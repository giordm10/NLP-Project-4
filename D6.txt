What was easy about this assignment?
The easiest part of the assignment was understanding and working with the initial 
dataset. The data was easy to access and read. Also, the concatenation of the 
imdb_labelled.txt, amazon_cells_labelled.txt, and yelp_labelled.txt into 
a single file as well as text normalization was easy, since 
we had already learned how to efficiently normalize data in previous projects.

What was challenging about this assignment or parts that you couldn't
get working correctly?
A challenging piece of the assignment was working on the implementation of 
the f-measure calculation for binary classification. There are a lot of components
that need to be calculated in order to correctly return f-measure. Trying to find
an efficient way to run our code was very challenging, as code that takes a long
time to run is harder to test and debug.

What did you like about this assignment?
We liked comparing the sentiment predictions of the different models.
Graphically displaying and interpreting our results gave us an understanding
of why we were seeing what we saw, rather than producing the calculations by themselves.

What did you dislike about this assignment?
We disliked the length of this assignment. It was assigned at a point in the semester when
every computer science class has a final project or assignment due at the same time. This
caused this project to be a big stressor for our group. It became difficult for us to find time
to work on the project together since we had to meet many times in order to finish all 10 of
the tasks. The content of the assignment was interesting, but we believe that it would
have been better if we had more time to work on it.

How did your team function? Include details regarding what each team member contributed, how 
the team communicated with each other, and how team software development & design was accomplished.
All of our team contributed to the code, with Casey and Michael contributing the most. Our team 
communicated through GroupMe to coordinate team meetings to code together. Usually, we tried to meet 
in person, but sometimes we had certain members meet over Zoom. We used VSCode liveshare to 
work on the same piece of code simultaneously. We also pushed the code to a GitHub repository for 
version control. This also allowed individual members of our team to work on the project on their own 
time if desired. Poean and Rebecca worked on debugging the written code, as well as documenting the 
scripts and keeping the GitHub up to date.

What did you learn from this assignment?
We attained a clearer understanding of optimizing computationally intensive tasks through the
use of multiple dictionaries. We mastered bootstrapping and gained hands-on experience calculating 
f-measures, both of which are useful in real-world settings. We also saw the importance of choosing meaningful
variable names, since we had previously given similar names to different variables.
