otherwise dont even waste your time on this 0 
never got it 0 
a truly truly bad film 0 
the chips that came out were dripping with grease and mostly not edible 0 
after the first charge kept going dead after 12 minutes 0 
i have had problems wit hit dropping signal and more 0 
service was very prompt 1 
excellent phone 1 
low quality 0 
i advise everyone do not be fooled 0 
worst foodservice ive had in a while 0 
unfortunately we must have hit the bakery on leftover day because everything we ordered was stale 0 
cinematography the film was shot in an interesting way 1 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
worse theres an incredibly weak subplot thrown in that follows a little band of latterday mansonites as they go after a reporter whos working on a story on the anniversary of the killings 0 
these were so good we ordered them twice 1 
totally believable 1 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
the selection of food was not the best 0 
our server was very nice and even though he looked a little overwhelmed with all of our needs he stayed professional and friendly until the end 1 
no ear loop needed its tiny and the sound is great 1 
kind of flops around 0 
youd have to have the iq of particularly stupid mollusk not to see that one coming 0 
the acting helps the writing along very well maybe the idiotsavant sister could have been played better and it is a real joy to watch 1 
my salad had a bland vinegrette on the baby greens and hearts of palm 0 
we ordered some old classics and some new dishes after going there a few times and were sorely disappointed with everything 0 
do not waste your time 0 
best service and food ever maria our server was so good and friendly she made our day 1 
its practically perfect in all of them  a true masterpiece in a sea of faux masterpieces 1 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
spend your money and time some place else 0 
fantastic earphones 1 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
if you hate earbugs avoid this phone by all means 0 
very bad experience 0 
i love my 350 headset my jabra350 bluetooth headset is great the reception is very good and the ear piece is a comfortable fit 1 
also great directing and photography 1 
fast service 1 
i liked it 1 
great it was new packaged nice works good no problems and it came in less time then i expected 1 
a cheap and cheerless heist movie with poor characterisation lots of underbite style stoic emoting think chow yun fat in a better tomorrow and some cheesy clichés thrown into an abandoned factory ready for a few poorly executed flying judo rolls a la john woo 0 
the owners are super friendly and the staff is courteous 1 
none of the new ones have ever quite worked properly 0 
i would have casted her in that role after ready the script 1 
ive only had my bluetooth for a few weeks but i really like it 1 
20th century foxs road house 1948 is not only quite a silly noir but is an implausible unmitigated bore of a movie 0 
he deserves 5 stars 1 
a greasy unhealthy meal 0 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
i love being able to use one headset for both by landline and cell 1 
great for ipods too 1 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
i think the most wonderful parts literally full of wonder are the excerpts from his works 1 
however after about a year the fliptop started to get loose and wobbly and eventually my screen went black and i couldnt receive and place calls 0 
setup couldnt have been simpler 1 
highly unprofessional and rude to a loyal patron 0 
for people who are first timers in film making i think they did an excellent job 1 
im pleased 1 
the battery is completely useless to me 0 
kieslowski never ceases to amaze me 1 
avoid this one if you can 0 
very friendly staff 1 
the nokia ca42 usb cable did not work with my phone 0 
the real disappointment was our waiter 0 
there was a warm feeling with the service and i felt like their guest for a special treat 1 
he really didnt seem to want to be hosting his voiceovers were monotonous didnt get involved with the guests 0 
doesnt do the job 0 
i think this restaurant suffers from not trying hard enough 0 
first of all there are enough racial stereotypes and racial jokes to offend everyone 0 
very dissapointing performance 0 
disappointment i hate anything that goes in my ear 0 
recommend with confidence 1 
im super pissd 0 
i cant wait to go back 1 
i think i was one of the people who found this another one of roths pearls 1 
you get what you pay for i guess 0 
perabo has a nice energy level and is obviously very comfortable in front of a camera 1 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
this was utterly confusing at first which caused me to lose a couple of very very important contacts 0 
i could eat their bruschetta all day it is devine 1 
will not be back 0 
the sides are delish mixed mushrooms yukon gold puree white corn beateous 1 
it has everything i need and i couldnt ask for more 1 
i wish i could enter negative values admins 0 
it worked very well 1 
the worst was the salmon sashimi 0 
i could barely stomach the meal but didnt complain because it was a business lunch 0 
better than expected 1 
have been going since 2007 and every meal has been awesome 1 
this is cool because most cases are just open there allowing the screen to get all scratched up 1 
excellent product for the price 1 
disappointing accessory from a good manufacturer 0 
if she had not rolled the eyes we may have stayed not sure if we will go back and try it again 0 
this is not moviemaking 0 
macbeth jason connery moved me to tears with his final monolog out brief candle outhe gave the sphere of moral decay and dark forces a human face which makes it the more interesting 1 
in particular the relationship between the bakery assistant and the waitress just didnt work for me at all 0 
pretty awesome place 1 
come hungry leave happy and stuffed 1 
there is no real plot 0 
do not buy do not buyit sucks 0 
both actors truly understand and become their particular character delivering a convincing sincere performance 1 
initially the local sites in the film which was filmed here in buffalo intrigued me 1 
howeverthe riingtones are not the best and neither are the games 0 
youll love how thin it is 1 
at least think to refill my water before i struggle to wave you over for 10 minutes 0 
i dont think ill be running back to carlys anytime soon for food 0 
great earpiece 1 
service was very prompt 1 
the ending is so so perfect youll shed a tear 1 
i recommend igo to anyone with different brand cell phonesmp3 players in the family 1 
i liked the patio and the service was outstanding 1 
its just painful 0 
excellent cast story line performances 1 
the guys all had steaks and our steak loving son who has had steak at the best and worst places said it was the best steak hes ever eaten 1 
you get extra minutes so that you can carry out the call and not get cut off 1 
the shrimp tender and moist 1 
i saw it as a child on tv back in 1973 when it was the stranger and i loved it 1 
i really like this product over the motorola because it is allot clearer on the ear piece and the mic 1 
i wear it everyday and it holds up very well 1 
there still are good actors around 1 
someone shouldve invented this sooner 1 
i was totally fascinated by the music the dancing everything 1 
i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
definitely will come back here again 1 
i would recommend it 1 
this is high adventure at its best 1 
it showed exactly how the government and the scientist argued for humanity and the reasons of the gadget 1 
comfort for our whole family 1 
avoid at any and all costs 0 
its a sad movie but very good 1 
perhaps i caught them on an off night judging by the other reviews but im not inspired to go back 0 
at least think to refill my water before i struggle to wave you over for 10 minutes 0 
the 12 mega pixel camera being a part of a phone is reasonably good7 1 
great phone 1 
the folks at otto always make us feel so welcome and special 1 
great pizza and salads 1 
good value great food great service 1 
tasted like dirt 0 
great phone 1 
as a sushi lover avoid this place by all means 0 
as a sushi lover avoid this place by all means 0 
for those that havent seen it dont waste your time 0 
only like 3 or 4 buildings used a couple of locations maybe poor hummh 0 
my sanyo has survived dozens of drops on blacktop without ill effect 1 
i could care less the interior is just beautiful 1 
the servers went back and forth several times not even so much as an are you being helped 0 
i waited and waited 0 
it does everything the description said it would 1 
rude inconsiderate management 0 
the potato chip order was sad i could probably count how many chips were in that box and it was probably around 12 0 
there arent death scenes like in previous movies and the fx are terrible 0 
this is the phone to get for 2005 i just bought my s710a and all i can say is wow 1 
that being said for a phone the camera is very nice many cool effects to play with and video is decent as well 1 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
summary the witticisms werent witty 0 
what a waste 0 
it was a drive to get there 0 
if that bug never showed up i would have given a 4 for sure but on the other side of the wall where this bug was climbing was the kitchen 0 
i like design and look of jabra behing the ear headsets and 5020 is pretty comfortible to wear 24 hours a day without pain in the ear 1 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
it was so funny 1 
it does everything the description said it would 1 
about 30 minutes of footage is wasted to show mediocre elderly actors awkwardly babbling overwrought pseudosatanic gibberish corny enough to make a teen goth blush almost always in olde english and sometimes in latin that may or may not be made up words 0 
using all earpieces left or right this thing will not stay on my ear 0 
i am going to have to be the first to negatively review this product 0 
and those baby owls were adorable 1 
there is nothing authentic about this place 0 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
great sound and service 1 
these headphones were a great find and i think they are perhaps the best purchase ive made in the last several years seriously 1 
the sound is clear and the people i talk to on it are amazed at the quality too 1 
i think the most wonderful parts literally full of wonder are the excerpts from his works 1 
i love the pho and the spring rolls oh so yummy you have to try 1 
do not buy if you want to use the holster 0 
the script is was there a script 0 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
its just painful 0 
this particular model would not work with my motorola q smartphone 0 
it has all the features i want 1 
the mic is great 1 
the price was very good and with the free shipping and all it was a good purchase 1 
highly entertaining at all angles 1 
a truly truly bad film 0 
ive bought 5 wired headphones that sound better than these 0 
this review is long overdue since i consider a tale of two sisters to be the single greatest film ever made 1 
i live in the neighborhood so i am disappointed i wont be back here because it is a convenient location 0 
food was really good and i got full petty fast 1 
the battery runs down quickly 0 
and i really did find them funny 1 
i own 2 of these cases and would order another 1 
i really hope the team behind this movie makes more movies and that they will continue to do so in their own some kinda weird style 1 
the food is rich so order accordingly 1 
this allows the possibility of double booking for the same date and time after the first 0 
it was awesome 1 
however after finally watching this film i realized that not only had i had a closed mind to the brilliance it depicts i also found myself watching it over and over again 1 
the real disappointment was our waiter 0 
penne vodka excellent 1 
very disappointing 0 
what a piece of junk i lose more calls on this phone 0 
worthwhile 1 
it was a riot to see hugo weaving play a sexobsessed gay real estate salesman who uses his clients houses for his trysts with the flaming darren tom hollander 1 
and if that isnt enough of a mess of a movie for you the picture is also marred with a constant use of studio sets and indoor exteriors 0 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
i ate there twice on my last visit and especially enjoyed the salmon salad 1 
drinks took close to 30 minutes to come out at one point 0 
i found the product to be easy to set up and use 1 
if there were zero stars i would give it zero stars 0 
good prices 1 
the worst one of the series 0 
so i bought about 10 of these and saved alot of money 1 
voice quality signal strength dropped calls 0 
the pleather case doesnt fit 0 
i find this inexcusable and so will probably be returning this phone and perhaps changing carriers 0 
food was really good and i got full petty fast 1 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
i promise they wont disappoint 1 
if that bug never showed up i would have given a 4 for sure but on the other side of the wall where this bug was climbing was the kitchen 0 
not much flavor to them and very poorly constructed 0 
the interplay between martin and emilio contains the same wonderful chemistry we saw in wall street with martin and charlie 1 
food was average at best 0 
dont waste your money 0 
the dialogue is composed of things that make little sense 0 
it kept getting worse and worse so now im officially done 0 
this is a chilly unremarkable movie about an author livingworking in a chilly abstruse culture 0 
this is infuriating 0 
all in all ha long bay was a bit of a flop 0 
its quite simply the highest most superlative form of cinema imaginable 1 
the puppets look really cheesy not in a good way like in the puppet master 80s flicks 0 
still its quite interesting and entertaining to follow 1 
it was so cool 1 
the story unfolds in 18th century jutland and the use of period music played on period instruments is just one more fine touch 1 
i want to first say our server was great and we had perfect service 1 
its a gloriously fun fast paced and fairly accurate portrayal of the night of a raver 1 
i have been very happy with the 510 and have had no complaints from any one regarding my sound quality on their end 1 
the dialogue is composed of things that make little sense 0 
it deserves strong love 1 
either way it sucks 0 
i struggle to find anything bad to say about it 1 
graphics is far from the best part of the game 0 
disappointed with battery 0 
gets the job done 1 
great phone 1 
punishment park is a brilliant piece of cinema 1 
so far so good 1 
finally after three or four times the spring of the latch broke and i could not use it any longer on the visor 0 
then i exchanged for the same phone even that had the same problem 0 
i am pairing this with my iphone and i could not be happier with it so far 1 
the film is way too long 0 
there are the usual hitchcock logic flaws 0 
but it does get better reception and clarity than any phone ive had before 1 
the ambiance isnt much better 0 
i totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is 1 
the first thing that happened was that the tracking was off 0 
see it 1 
the volume switch rocketed out of the unit to a destination unknown 0 
which are small and not worth the price 0 
i mean really how do you get so famous for your fish and chips when its so terrible 0 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
i dont have to be an accountant to know im getting screwed 0 
the acting was bad the dialogs were extremely shallow and insincere 0 
very pleased with this headset 1 
unfortunately it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees 0 
his performance is simply genius 1 
it was that year however that reminded us that huston was still at the top of his game as evinced by his faithful adaptation of james joyces acclaimed novella the dead 1 
this is a great place to eat 1 
the food is rich so order accordingly 1 
i ordered this for sony ericsson w810i but i think it only worked once thats when i first used it 0 
talk about great customer service of course we will be back 1 
when i received my pita it was huge it did have a lot of meat in it so thumbs up there 1 
john wayne did an incredible job for being so young in the movie industry 1 
i just saw this film and i recommend it 1 
the ambience is wonderful and there is music playing 1 
the film succeeds despite or perhaps because of an obviously meagre budget 1 
very happy with this product 1 
last night was my second time dining here and i was so happy i decided to go back 1 
this is not moviemaking 0 
the acting as youd expect from this cast is top notch 1 
bad choice 0 
any ring toneoverall good phone to buy 1 
this was a poor remake of my best friends wedding 0 
about ten minutes into this film i started having second thoughts 0 
this movie is bad 0 
really good product 1 
perfect for someone me who only likes beer ice cold or in this case even colder 1 
worse theres an incredibly weak subplot thrown in that follows a little band of latterday mansonites as they go after a reporter whos working on a story on the anniversary of the killings 0 
the songs were the best and the muppets were so hilarious 1 
if only someone involved with it knew how to string together narrative 0 
overall i rate this movie a 10 out of a 110 scale 1 
on three different occasions i asked for well done or medium well and all three times i got the bloodiest piece of meat on my plate 0 
the movie is not completely perfect but titta di girolamo will stay with you for a long time after the vision of the movie 1 
the films sole bright spot was jonah hill who will look almost unrecognizable to fans of the recent superbad due to the amount of weight he lost in the interim 1 
sucked most of the stuff does not work with my phone 0 
great food and awesome service 1 
its so stupid to have to keep buying new chargers car chargers cradles headphones and car kits every time a new phone comes out 0 
a piece of cinematic garbage captured on celluloid 0 
id love to go back 1 
1 long lasting battery you dont have to recharge it as frequentyly as some of the flip phones2 0 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
it was attached to a gas station and that is rarely a good sign 0 
about half way through this film i started to dislike it 0 
the food was terrible 0 
interesting decor 1 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
any grandmother can make a roasted chicken better than this one 0 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
not only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic but it also managed to give away the entire movie and im not exaggerating every moment every plot point every joke is told in the trailer 0 
left very frustrated 0 
the worst phone ive ever had only had it for a few months 0 
i had to go to a store and bought a new nokia phone which is working great 1 
they could serve it with just the vinaigrette and it may make for a better overall dish but it was still very good 1 
ordered an appetizer and took 40 minutes and then the pizza another 10 minutes 0 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
gets the job done 1 
the nokia ca42 usb cable did not work with my phone 0 
i checked out this place a couple years ago and was not impressed 0 
i was able to do voice dialing in the car with no problem 1 
the sound is clear and the people i talk to on it are amazed at the quality too 1 
of all the dishes the salmon was the best but all were great 1 
it only recognizes the phone as its storage device 0 
i cant use this case because the smell is disgusting 0 
an interesting premise and billy drago is always good as a dangerous nutbag side note id love to see drago stephen mchattie and lance hendrikson in a flick together talk about raging cheekbones 1 
full of unconvincing cardboard characters it is blandly written by edward chodorov who also produced and is surprisingly directed by jean negulesco from whom one would expect a great deal more 0 
this phone tries very hard to do everything but fails at its very ability to be a phone 0 
it plays louder than any other speaker of this size the price is so low that most would think the quality is lacking however its not 1 
the delivery was on time 1 
i can think of no other film where something vitally important occurs every other minute 1 
i have to jiggle the plug to get it to line up right to get decent volume 0 
the bottowm lineanother worthless cheap gimmick from sprint 0 
the film has an ultracheap look to it 0 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
this early film from future goremeister lucio fulci is a very good addition to the giallo subgenre 1 
the bipolarity of the ruthless thug one minute a ruthless killer the next minute a luvs diaper commercial is completely unconvincing 0 
when it opens the battery connection is broken and the device is turned off 0 
another note about this phones appearance is that it really looks rather bland especially in the all black model 0 
excellent 1 
my boyfriend and i came here for the first time on a recent trip to vegas and could not have been more pleased with the quality of food and service 1 
very funny 1 
spend your money and time some place else 0 
there arent death scenes like in previous movies and the fx are terrible 0 
both actors truly understand and become their particular character delivering a convincing sincere performance 1 
it is well made easy to access the phone and has a handy detachable belt clip 1 
i dont know exactly what it is about this movie but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our familys memories 1 
i would have given no star if i was able 0 
paolo sorrentino has written a wonderful story about loneliness and tony has built one of the most unforgettable characters seen in movies in recent years 1 
they made this case too small and is very difficult to install 0 
on the good side the staff was genuinely pleasant and enthusiastic a real treat 1 
only like 3 or 4 buildings used a couple of locations maybe poor hummh 0 
im big fan of rpg games too but this movie its a disgrace to any selfrespecting rpger there is 0 
bacon is hella salty 1 
dont do it 0 
when i placed my treo into the case not only was it not snug but there was a lot of extra room on the sides 0 
the performances are real and gripping the crocdodile is extremely well done indeed if the black water website is to be believed thats because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous 1 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
this movie is possibly one of the most creative works of horror ever 1 
back to good bbq lighter fare reasonable pricing and tell the public they are back to the old ways 1 
overall the film is interesting and thoughtprovoking 1 
that just screams legit in my booksomethats also pretty rare here in vegas 1 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
unfortunately it did not work 0 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
o my gosh the best phone i have ever had 1 
and i really did find them funny 1 
and i really did find them funny 1 
oh yeah and the storyline was pathetic too 0 
works fine 1 
we had 7 at our table and the service was pretty fast 1 
pretty piece of junk 0 
the headset fulfills my requirements so i am happy with my purchase 1 
he deserves 5 stars 1 
everyone is treated equally special 1 
the food is not tasty at all not to say its real traditional hunan style 0 
he is one of my favourite directors and one of the most talented directors in the history of cinema 1 
we had a group of 70 when we claimed we would only have 40 and they handled us beautifully 1 
as i said abovepretty useless 0 
crash is a depressing little nothing that provokes emotion but teaches you nothing if you already know racism and prejudice are bad things 0 
and the rest of it just sits there being awful with soldiers singing songs about the masculinity they pledge themselves to hairsplitting about purity the admiration of swords etc 0 
i only hear garbage for audio 0 
i received my headset in good time and was happy with it 1 
i felt asleep the first time i watched it so i can recommend it for insomniacs 0 
by the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant i was bored and didnt care what happened next and so i switched off 0 
not easy to watch 0 
my boyfriend tried the mediterranean chicken salad and fell in love 1 
it was also the right balance of war and love 1 
it is indescribably the most annoying and idiotic show i have ever seen 0 
i would recommend saving room for this 1 
we enjoy their pizza and brunch 1 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
the movie was so boring that i sometimes found myself occupied peaking in the paper instead of watching never happened during a columbo movie before 0 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
unfortunately the ability to actually know you are receiving a call is a rather important feature and this phone is pitiful in that respect 0 
a truly truly bad film 0 
its just painful 0 
personally i think it shows that people should learn to find a compromise them self without involving other people into issue 1 
if she had not rolled the eyes we may have stayed not sure if we will go back and try it again 0 
yet i enjoy watching it 1 
it presents a idyllic yet serious portrayal of the ups and downs of the characters lives 1 
great phone 1 
waiter was a jerk 0 
i tried the cape cod ravoli chickenwith cranberrymmmm 1 
an absolute must visit 1 
graphics is far from the best part of the game 0 
yes i am simplifying things here for the sake of brevity for this really is at the core of the problems with this film it has too much going on without any real fulfilling explanation 0 
thank you for wasting my money 0 
over rated 0 
no actress has been worse used that june allison in this movie 0 
he deserves 5 stars 1 
i never walked out of a movie faster 0 
if you simply want a small flip phone look elsewhere as the extra bells whistles are mediocre 0 
ambience is perfect 1 
i have bought this nokia cell phone a few weeks ago and it was a nightmare 0 
however my girl was complain that some time the phone doesnt wake up like normal phone does 0 
it was also the right balance of war and love 1 
do not buy if you want to use the holster 0 
go to place for gyros 1 
bt50 battery junk 0 
what a piece of junk i lose more calls on this phone 0 
this movie was kind of long in length but i enjoyed every minute of it 1 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
my friend loved the salmon tartar 1 
as many people complained i found this headsets microphone was very weak 0 
but i dont like it 0 
bad characters bad story and bad acting 0 
low quality 0 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
i am going to have to be the first to negatively review this product 0 
feelings thoughtsgabriels discomfort during the danceall these intangibles leap to life and come within the viewers grasp in hustons portrayal 1 
this is a great place to eat 1 
editing the editing of this film was phenomenal in my opinion 1 
and if that isnt enough of a mess of a movie for you the picture is also marred with a constant use of studio sets and indoor exteriors 0 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
if only someone involved with it knew how to string together narrative 0 
the steak was amazingrge fillet relleno was the best seafood plate i have ever had 1 
this movie is terrible 0 
i thought it was bad 0 
will never ever go back 0 
insults profound deuchebaggery and had to go outside for a smoke break while serving just to solidify it 0 
and the beans and rice were mediocre at best 0 
we waited an hour for what was a breakfast i could have done 100 times better at home 0 
i would definitely recommend the jabra bt250v for those who are looking for comfort clarity and a great price 1 
must have been an off night at this place 0 
to summarize the food was incredible nay transcendant but nothing brings me joy quite like the memory of the pneumatic condiment dispenser 1 
it fits so securely that the ear hook does not even need to be used and the sound is better directed through your ear canal 1 
just does not work 0 
this one works and was priced right 1 
the sound is clear and the people i talk to on it are amazed at the quality too 1 
the flat reenactments dont hold your attention because they are emotionally adrift and stagy 0 
battery life is also great 1 
i bought two of them and neither will charge 0 
poorly contstruct hinge 0 
we were promptly greeted and seated 1 
star trek v the final frontier is the worst in the series 0 
item arrived quickly and works great with my metro pcs samsung schr450 slider phone and sony premium sound in ear plugs 1 
very good food great atmosphere1 1 
its too bad the food is so damn generic 0 
this item is great installed it let it charged up overnite and it has been working good every since with no problems 1 
its too bad that everyone else involved didnt share crowes level of dedication to quality for if they did wed have a far better film on our hands than this subpar mess 0 
we also ordered the spinach and avocado salad the ingredients were sad and the dressing literally had zero taste 0 
also its a real treat to see anthony quinn playing crazy horse 1 
dont do it 0 
the igo chargers and tips are really great 1 
however the keypads are so tinny that i sometimes reach the wrong buttons 0 
i like design and look of jabra behing the ear headsets and 5020 is pretty comfortible to wear 24 hours a day without pain in the ear 1 
if it was to turn my good day feeling into a night of disturbing memories than i guess he succeeded 0 
i am not a filmmaker nor am i a director but i would hide my head in the sand if id spent whatever amount of money and time on this movie 0 
i took back my money and got outta there 0 
prosgood camera very nice pictures also has cool styles like black and white and more 1 
i used bitpim a free program you can find on the internetto transfer data to the phonethe price of the cable was excellent 1 
headset works great was packaged nicely to avoid any damage 1 
im not sure how long we stood there but it was long enough for me to begin to feel awkwardly out of place 0 
very good though 1 
third the cheese on my friends burger was cold 0 
great phone 1 
i kept looking at the time and it had soon become 35 minutes yet still no food 0 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
food was really boring 0 
seriously its not worth wasting your or your kids time on 0 
i wouldnt see this movie again for free 0 
walked in and the place smelled like an old grease trap and only 2 others there eating 0 
thanks good a movie like this was done and released 1 
it is a very well acted and done tv movie 1 
yeah the movie pretty much sucked 0 
best headset ever 1 
very good phone 1 
perhaps my phone is defective but people cannot hear me when i use this 0 
these are the central themes of the film and they are handled ineptly stereotypically and with no depth of imagination 0 
this results in the phone being either stuck at max volume or mute 0 
everything about this film is simply incredible 1 
i love the pho and the spring rolls oh so yummy you have to try 1 
he also came back to check on us regularly excellent service 1 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
the characters are interesting even if a bit predictable 1 
the food was barely lukewarm so it must have been sitting waiting for the server to bring it out to us 0 
its quite simply the highest most superlative form of cinema imaginable 1 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
it has all the features i want 1 
loved the casting of jimmy buffet as the science teacher 1 
the food is very good for your typical bar food 1 
my sashimi was poor quality being soggy and tasteless 0 
great service and food 1 
if you see it you should probably just leave it on the shelf 0 
i dont understand how this garbage got on the shelves of the movie store its not even a real movie 0 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job 1 
its a fresh subtle and rather sublime effect 1 
to my disbelief each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods i have ever tasted 0 
cumbersome design 0 
five star plus plus 1 
emily watsons character is very strong and she has only to give a quick glance and you understand everything 1 
if you want a sandwich just go to any firehouse 1 
it came free with a dvd player i bought but i still turned the thing off halfway through because i was embarrassed for howell 0 
this is was due to the fact that it took 20 minutes to be acknowledged then another 35 minutes to get our foodand they kept forgetting things 0 
great brunch spot 1 
im happy about this purchase good quality and low price 1 
another thing i didnt really like is when a character got punched in the face a gallon of blood would spew forth soon after 0 
an extensive menu provides lots of options for breakfast 1 
as for the service im a fan because its quick and youre being served by some nice folks 1 
it felt like a very gripping intelligent stage play but without the overly theatrical feeling one actually gets from watching people on a stage which plays on everyones terror of a white lie escalating to monstrous consequences 1 
i checked out this place a couple years ago and was not impressed 0 
what a waste 0 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
it looks very nice 1 
eew this location needs a complete overhaul 0 
by far the best cheesecurds we have ever had 1 
damn good steak 1 
this movie is possibly one of the most creative works of horror ever 1 
also difficult to put onid recommend avoiding this product 0 
if this premise sound stupid thats because it is 0 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
i love the ownerchef his one authentic japanese cool dude 1 
horrible horrible protector 0 
the dialogue is composed of things that make little sense 0 
i have read others reviews here but i havent had any problem with it 1 
definitely a turn off for me i doubt ill be back unless someone else is buying 0 
it was a pale color instead of nice and char and has no flavor 0 
top line dont waste your time and money on this one its as bad as it comes 0 
i know he was a contract player with little control over his scripts but the acting was as bad as the script 0 
the cast is good 1 
great it was new packaged nice works good no problems and it came in less time then i expected 1 
it is easy to turn on and off when you are in the car and the volume controls are quite accessable 1 
its practically perfect in all of them  a true masterpiece in a sea of faux masterpieces 1 
editing the editing of this film was phenomenal in my opinion 1 
but above all the exquisite visual composition of each moment with inventive and elegant use of closeup camera angle and lighting including pointillistic faux home movie footage is a wonder and joy to behold 1 
i didnt know pulled pork could be soooo delicious 1 
couldnt ask for a more satisfying meal 1 
the movie in movie situations in the beginning and through the game that is played with her by the acting coach are fascinating 1 
food arrived quickly 1 
food was really boring 0 
the script is bad very bad  it contains both cheesiness and unethical joke that you normally see in rated r or nc17 movie 0 
i checked out this place a couple years ago and was not impressed 0 
her lines seem to have been written by a fifteen year old though they are trying oh so so hard to sound like how a fifteen year old would really um you know well talk 0 
will never ever go back and have told many people what had happened 0 
food was really boring 0 
cinematography the film was shot in an interesting way 1 
what should have been a hilarious yummy christmas eve dinner to remember was the biggest fail of the entire trip for us 0 
i have been very happy with the 510 and have had no complaints from any one regarding my sound quality on their end 1 
service was good and the company was better 1 
the eargels channel the sound directly into your ear and seem to increase the sound volume and clarity 1 
an hour and a half i wish i could bring back 0 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
this was reflected not only in the cast but also in the belowpar script which borrowed much from the earlier classic 0 
which has more depth and character than the man underneath it 0 
it was an inexpensive piece but i would still have expected better quality 0 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
graphics is far from the best part of the game 0 
ample portions and good prices 1 
to sum the film up breeders is a terrible cheaply made horror movie that should be avoided like the ebola virus 0 
the accompanied software is almost brilliant 1 
too politically correct 0 
if this premise sound stupid thats because it is 0 
i love this place 1 
verizon tech support walked my through a few procedures none of which worked and i ended up having to do a hard reset wiping out all my data 0 
highly unprofessional and rude to a loyal patron 0 
i will not return 0 
clear crisp sound 1 
the ambiance was incredible 1 
what on earth is irons doing in this film 0 
the owner used to work at nobu so this place is really similar for half the price 1 
and i really did find them funny 1 
nargile i think you are great 1 
you could only take 2 videos at a time and the quality was very poor 0 
im in az all the time and now have my new spot 1 
it holds a charge for a long time is reasonably comfortable under longwearing conditions and the quality of sound is tremendous 1 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
very unreliable service from tmobile 0 
i advise everyone do not be fooled 0 
classywarm atmosphere fun and fresh appetizers succulent steaks baseball steak 1 
however after seeing the short again after about 25 years i was amazed at how timeless the film actually is 1 
why was this film made 0 
imdb ratings only go as low 1 for awful its time to get some negative numbers in there for cases such as these 0 
by far the best cheesecurds we have ever had 1 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
on the ground right next to our table was a large smeared beensteppedinandtrackedeverywhere pile of green bird poop 0 
well never go again 0 
the characters were all funny and had the peculiarity of not having a true lead character 1 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
it wasnt busy either also the building was freezing cold 0 
i think the most wonderful parts literally full of wonder are the excerpts from his works 1 
disappointing experience 0 
battery life is also great 1 
a standout scene 1 
great phone 1 
you could only take 2 videos at a time and the quality was very poor 0 
1010 1 
it presents a idyllic yet serious portrayal of the ups and downs of the characters lives 1 
watching washing machine twirling around wouldnt hurt your eyes as much as this show 0 
even the squibs look awful 0 
restored my phone to like new performance 1 
alexander nevsky is a great film 1 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
this film and i use that word loosely is an insult to the moviegoing public 0 
yes this film does require a rather significant amount of puzzlesolving but the pieces fit together to create a beautiful picture 1 
best fish ive ever had in my life 1 
excellent product 1 
reaching for the bottom row is uncomfortable and the send and end keys are not where i expect them to be3 0 
highquality chicken on the chicken caesar salad 1 
reception is terrible and full of static 0 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
oh this is such a thing of beauty this restaurant 1 
plug was the wrong size 0 
the art style has the appearance of crayonpencil drawings and is wonderfully colorful and fanciful 1 
great price too 1 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
pricing is a bit of a concern at mellow mushroom 0 
used and dirty 0 
would not recommend to others 0 
first of all there are enough racial stereotypes and racial jokes to offend everyone 0 
great movie 1 
i especially love the long battery life 1 
soggy and not good 0 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
i wont say any more i dont like spoilers so i dont want to be one but i believe this film is worth your time 1 
theres barely a boring moment in the film and there are plenty of humorous parts 1 
i struggle to find anything bad to say about it 1 
talk about great customer service of course we will be back 1 
my girlfriends veal was very bad 0 
its pure brilliance 1 
bland and flavorless is a good way of describing the barely tepid meat 0 
i love being able to use one headset for both by landline and cell 1 
probably not in a hurry to go back 0 
worst thai ever 0 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
i would have given no star if i was able 0 
things happen characters personalities change plot twists occur for no real reason other than that script calls for it 0 
and those baby owls were adorable 1 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
this film and i use that word loosely is an insult to the moviegoing public 0 
i believe every one should see this movie as i think few people outside of south africa understand its past and what is being attempted in the truth and reconciliation process 1 
but its just not funny 0 
needless to say i wont be going back anytime soon 0
