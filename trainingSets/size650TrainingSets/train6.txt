it deserves strong love 1 
i have eaten here multiple times and each time the food was delicious 1 
the igo chargers and tips are really great 1 
i did not have any problem with this item and would order it again if needed 1 
my fella got the huevos rancheros and they didnt look too appealing 0 
started watching this but didnt believe in any of the characters 0 
my drink was never empty and he made some really great menu suggestions 1 
if you do watch it however there are small consolations the actresses playing annes sisters each do a wonderful job with their roles 1 
lightweight and works well 1 
it really created a unique feeling though 1 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
the acting was bad the dialogs were extremely shallow and insincere 0 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
my gyro was basically lettuce only 0 
i bought this phone as a replacement for my startac and have regretted it since 0 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
its a campy sort of film thats a joy to watch 1 
fantastic service here 1 
both the hot sour the egg flower soups were absolutely 5 stars 1 
utter crap sound quality is terrible 0 
there were several moments in the movie that just didnt need to be there and were excruciatingly slow moving 0 
for the price this was a great deal 1 
the cow tongue and cheek tacos are amazing 1 
poorly contstruct hinge 0 
he really didnt seem to want to be hosting his voiceovers were monotonous didnt get involved with the guests 0 
i hate those things as much as cheap quality black olives 0 
i went on motorolas website and followed all directions but could not get it to pair again 0 
but now i was completely grossed out 0 
graphics is far from the best part of the game 0 
the igo chargers and tips are really great 1 
brilliant 1 
best tater tots in the southwest 1 
the only thing that i think could improve is the sound leaks out from the headset 0 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
it is light has plenty of battery capacity and is very confortable to wear for somewhat extended periods of time 1 
not good enough for the price 0 
the food is good 1 
but this movie really got to me 1 
the only thing that i think could improve is the sound leaks out from the headset 0 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
the jabra eargels fit my ears very well 1 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
i really recommend this faceplates since it looks very nice elegant and cool 1 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
this company charge me a restocking fee and still not given me my refund back 0 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
if you are razr owneryou must have this 1 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
ive never been more insulted or felt disrespected 0 
this film has no redeeming features 0 
i am pairing this with my iphone and i could not be happier with it so far 1 
i dont know what kind it is but they have the best iced tea 1 
its pretty easy 1 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
this was one of the worst films i have ever seen 0 
i dont understand how this garbage got on the shelves of the movie store its not even a real movie 0 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
i will not return 0 
great place to eat reminds me of the little mom and pop shops in the san francisco bay area 1 
there is no plot here to keep you going in the first place 0 
sound quality on both end is excellent i use headset to call my wife and ask my wife to use headset to call me 2 1 
he deserves 5 stars 1 
yet i enjoy watching it 1 
love it great armband 1 
i own a jabra earset and was very happy with it but the sound quality especially outgoing on this is better 1 
as a courtroom drama its compelling as an indictment on the american justice system its frightening 1 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
its pure brilliance 1 
having to humour him just to get by and get through the day was so apt 1 
about 30 minutes of footage is wasted to show mediocre elderly actors awkwardly babbling overwrought pseudosatanic gibberish corny enough to make a teen goth blush almost always in olde english and sometimes in latin that may or may not be made up words 0 
in fact im going to round up to 4 stars just because she was so awesome 1 
both great 1 
i highly recommend this case 1 
very good stuff for the price 1 
the steak was amazingrge fillet relleno was the best seafood plate i have ever had 1 
it was delicious 1 
utter crap sound quality is terrible 0 
often the dialogue doesnt really follow from one line to another or fit the surroundings 0 
highly recommended for all ages although the younger set will probably not appreciate some of the more subtle references they will certainly appreciate one galley scene in particular 1 
however paul schrader has indeed made a film about mishima that is both superb complex 1 
110 and only because there is no setting for 010 0 
i have had problems wit hit dropping signal and more 0 
i could not stand to even watch it for very long for fear of losing iq 0 
whatever prompted such a documentary is beyond me 0 
i just cant explain this movie more than romanticcharminghilariousand adorablethe junkyard scenes are funnyall the junkyard dogs have something specialtoo funny i laughedkids will love itbuy it when it comes outit has new features 1 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
returned 8 hours later 0 
the memories are murky but i can only say that i enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show 1 
yet plantronincs continues to use the same flawed charger design 0 
its not hard to make a decent hamburger 0 
absolutel junk 0 
i was hoping for more 0 
works great when my cat attacked the phone he scratched the protective strip instead of destroying the screen 1 
there is no plot here to keep you going in the first place 0 
i wouldnt see this movie again for free 0 
and generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode 0 
my phone doesnt slide around my car now and the grip prevents my phone from slipping out of my hand 1 
the story unfolds in 18th century jutland and the use of period music played on period instruments is just one more fine touch 1 
terrible phone holder 0 
but i thought his acting was skilled 1 
i give wirefly 1 stari will contact cingularatt and inform them of this practice 0 
nice headset priced right 1 
easy to use 1 
poor talk time performance 0 
the cg opening sequence in space looked like it could have been created on microsoft slideshow for gods sake 0 
attempting artiness with black white and clever camera angles the movie disappointed became even more ridiculous as the acting was poor and the plot and lines almost nonexistent 0 
does everything it should and more 1 
the story is lame not interesting and never really explains the sinister origins of the puppets 0 
i just saw this film and i recommend it 1 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
macbeth jason connery moved me to tears with his final monolog out brief candle outhe gave the sphere of moral decay and dark forces a human face which makes it the more interesting 1 
i have yet to run this new battery below two bars and thats three days without charging 1 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
there is really nothing for me at postinos hope your experience is better 0 
everything was fresh and delicious 1 
very good product well made 1 
i love this device 1 
warning stay away 0 
either way it sucks 0 
i can think of no other film where something vitally important occurs every other minute 1 
great atmosphere friendly and fast service 1 
our server was very nice and even though he looked a little overwhelmed with all of our needs he stayed professional and friendly until the end 1 
and those baby owls were adorable 1 
about half way through this film i started to dislike it 0 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
simple lightweight and great fit 1 
i was deeply impressed with the character he played 1 
i ordered the lemon raspberry ice cocktail which was also incredible 1 
nice sound 1 
my gyro was basically lettuce only 0 
none of the new ones have ever quite worked properly 0 
the range is very decent ive been able to roam around my house with the phone in the living room with no receptionsound quality issues 1 
star trek v the final frontier is the worst in the series 0 
the worst sappiest dialogue i could go on and on 0 
tied to charger for conversations lasting more than 45 minutesmajor problems 0 
the script is horrendously stupid 0 
very very sad 0 
he came running after us when he realized my husband had left his sunglasses on the table 1 
dont make the same mistake that i did and please dont buy this phone 0 
it was attached to a gas station and that is rarely a good sign 0 
the use of slowmotion needlessly repeats itself throughout the movie but is well backed up by bad acting and bad is a kind word here no continuity scenes that are thrown in for no reason whatsoever vehicles that looked like they were made from a corn flakes box and a directorial style that bordered on stupidity 0 
the biggest complaint i have is the battery drains superfast 0 
i probably would not go here again 0 
so dont go there if you are looking for good food 0 
but this movie really got to me 1 
its really easy 1 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
yet plantronincs continues to use the same flawed charger design 0 
putting the race card aside lets look at the major flaw in the film they destroy latifas character 0 
i promise they wont disappoint 1 
both rickman and stowe play their roles to the hilt in this tale of a childrens book writer who maybe has written a subversive tract 1 
the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach 0 
each day of the week they have a different deal and its all so delicious 1 
never going back 0 
meredith m was better than all right 1 
the scenes are often funny and occasionally touching as the characters evaluate their lives and where they are going 1 
worst phone ever 0 
i particularly remember my senses being assaulted by strident cords of music that would blare out with very little warning and even less meaning 0 
i live in the neighborhood so i am disappointed i wont be back here because it is a convenient location 0 
disappointing accessory from a good manufacturer 0 
my mother and brother had to do thiswhen i saw robert ryan portraying this type of man it was a very good imitation of this type of individual and i was impressed 1 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
food quality has been horrible 0 
service is also cute 1 
great value 1 
the price was very good and with the free shipping and all it was a good purchase 1 
good item low price 1 
blue ant is easy to use 1 
yet i enjoy watching it 1 
worse theres an incredibly weak subplot thrown in that follows a little band of latterday mansonites as they go after a reporter whos working on a story on the anniversary of the killings 0 
call me a nut but i think this is one of the best movies ever 1 
overall i wasnt very impressed with noca 0 
my friend did not like his bloody mary 0 
other than that the leather is nice and soft the fit is very tight the cut out for the face is a good shape 1 
bluetooth does not work phone locks up screens just flash up and now it just makes calls randomly while in my pocket locked 0 
i recently tried caballeros and i have been back every week since 1 
the use of slowmotion needlessly repeats itself throughout the movie but is well backed up by bad acting and bad is a kind word here no continuity scenes that are thrown in for no reason whatsoever vehicles that looked like they were made from a corn flakes box and a directorial style that bordered on stupidity 0 
this greedy corporation will never see another dime from me 0 
the ambiance was incredible 1 
its a case of so bad it is laughable 0 
we enjoy their pizza and brunch 1 
also the phone doesnt seem to accept anything except cbr mp3s preferably ripped by windows media player 0 
i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
will go back next trip out 1 
by the time the film ended i not only disliked it i despised it 0 
the poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying 0 
you could drive a semi truck into these holes 0 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
they were goldencrispy and delicious 1 
everyone is treated equally special 1 
this is an excellent film 1 
my salad had a bland vinegrette on the baby greens and hearts of palm 0 
horrible phone 0 
service was fantastic 1 
i dont think i will be back for a very long time 0 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
highly recommended a 1 
the only thing that i think could improve is the sound leaks out from the headset 0 
50 down the drain 0 
bacon is hella salty 1 
you wont forget this movie 1 
i like armand assante my cable companys summary sounded interesting so i watched it twice already and probably will again 1 
wont go back 0 
you wont regret it 1 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
rude inconsiderate management 0 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
the volume for the ringer is real good you have choices how loud 1 
these are the nicest restaurant owners ive ever come across 1 
its not hard to make a decent hamburger 0 
i wouldnt see this movie again for free 0 
it did not work in my cell phone plug i am very up set with the charger 0 
later i found myself lost in the power of the film 1 
avoid avoid avoid 0 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
bad choice 0 
the script is bad very bad  it contains both cheesiness and unethical joke that you normally see in rated r or nc17 movie 0 
ryans bar is definitely one edinburgh establishment i wont be revisiting 0 
i agree with jessica this movie is pretty bad 0 
imdb ratings only go as low 1 for awful its time to get some negative numbers in there for cases such as these 0 
the structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema 1 
the malta settings are as dry and as barren as the dialogue 0 
if you are reading this please dont go there 0 
makes it easier to keep up with my bluetooth when im not wearing it 0 
this is so embarassing and also my ears hurt if i try to push the ear plug into my ear 0 
stay away from this store be careful 0 
this is a good battery and it got here really fast 1 
i will not be eating there again 0 
shes poised and amazing 1 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
the most annoying thing about cover girl is the way in which rita hayworth is put up on a pedestal 0 
i was hoping for more 0 
so good i am going to have to review this place twice once hereas a tribute to the place and once as a tribute to an event held here last night 1 
does not work for listening to music with the cingular 8125 0 
its not user friendly 0 
this movie is a good and humorous comment on life in 2006 1 
as a courtroom drama its compelling as an indictment on the american justice system its frightening 1 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
i checked everywhere and there is no feature for it which is really disappointing 0 
their daily specials are always a hit with my group 1 
the least said about the acting the better 0 
cant upload ringtones from a third party 0 
each day of the week they have a different deal and its all so delicious 1 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
i was bored throughout the whole damn thing 0 
this was like the final blow 0 
the price was very good and with the free shipping and all it was a good purchase 1 
highly recommended 1 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
star trek v the final frontier is the worst in the series 0 
the calls drop the phone comes on and off at will the screen goes black and the worst of all it stops ringing intermittently 0 
we asked for the bill to leave without eating and they didnt bring that either 0 
it was a very superficial movie and it gave me the feeling that i was watching play rather than a film 0 
no actress has been worse used that june allison in this movie 0 
before i go in to why i gave a 1 star rating please know that this was my third time eating at bachi burger before writing a review 0 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
the worst sappiest dialogue i could go on and on 0 
absolutely great 1 
service is also cute 1 
bacon is hella salty 1 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
i asked multiple times for the wine list and after some time of being ignored i went to the hostess and got one myself 0 
hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in 0 
still waiting im sure this item would work well if i ever recieve it 0 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
favorite place in town for shawarrrrrrma 1 
the ambiance was incredible 1 
worthless product 0 
piece of trash 0 
not to mention the combination of pears almonds and bacon is a big winner 1 
have been going since 2007 and every meal has been awesome 1 
the tracfonewebsite is user friendly and makes it easy toactivate etc 1 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
works well 1 
ray charles is legendary 1 
do not make the same mistake as me 0 
the only good thing was that it fits comfortably on small ears 1 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
easy to use 1 
jawbone era is awesome too 1 
i do not know if this was emilio estevezs directorial debut but the pacing the interplay and development of the characters as well as some clever camera work surrounding the character estevez plays all suggest a natural eye 1 
then our food came out disappointment ensued 0 
i know he was a contract player with little control over his scripts but the acting was as bad as the script 0 
their steaks are 100 recommended 1 
i love the scream movies and all horror movies and this one ranks way up there 1 
in a word it is embarrassing 0 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
i was totally fascinated by the music the dancing everything 1 
linksys should have some way to exchange a bad phone for a refurb unit or something 0 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
i wear glasses and it fits fine with them 1 
seafood was limited to boiled shrimp and crab legs but the crab legs definitely did not taste fresh 0 
this item worked great but it broke after 6 months of use 0 
in a word it is embarrassing 0 
all in all id expected a better consumer experience from motorola 0 
there is no real plot 0 
see it with your kids if you have a chanceit will open up some amazing dialog about how far race relations have come in the last 50 years 1 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
disappointing 0 
the characters were all funny and had the peculiarity of not having a true lead character 1 
we loved the place 1 
if there was ever a movie that needed wordofmouth to promote this is it 1 
in fact i liked it better than interview with a vampire and i liked this lestat stuart townsend better than cruises attempt 1 
spoilers whatever else can or cant be said about it surface is superbly crafted 1 
service was fantastic 1 
this is a very average phone with bad battery life that operates on a weak network 0 
what did bother me was the slow service 0 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
this is just a great movie 1 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
lots of holes in the script 0 
now you know why i gave it a 10 1 
this is a really fantastic thai restaurant which is definitely worth a visit 1 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
this place is horrible and way overpriced 0 
it is cheap and it feel and look just as cheap 0 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
we loved the biscuits 1 
macbeth jason connery moved me to tears with his final monolog out brief candle outhe gave the sphere of moral decay and dark forces a human face which makes it the more interesting 1 
comfortable fit you need your headset to be comfortable for at least an hour at a time if not for an entire day 1 
their chow mein is so good 1 
his performance as awarded was stunning 1 
the least said about the acting the better 0 
actually the graphics were good at the time 1 
light weight i hardly notice it is there 1 
utterly without merit on any level this is akin to torture 0 
its been my choice headset for yearsgreat sound good volume good noise cancellation 1 
this blueant supertooth handsfree phone speaker is awesome 1 
bad reception 0 
customer service was terrible 0 
the acting was decidely wooden though no worse than a period universal b movie 0 
i love it 1 
but the actingeven that of such professionals as drago and debbie rochonwas terrible the directing worse perhaps contributory to the former the dialog chimplike and the camera work barely tolerable 0 
i could eat their bruschetta all day it is devine 1 
it wasnt busy at all and now we know why 0 
loved the casting of jimmy buffet as the science teacher 1 
i especially love the long battery life 1 
the soundtrack wasnt terrible either 1 
very disappointing 0 
come hungry leave happy and stuffed 1 
this film and i use that word loosely is an insult to the moviegoing public 0 
service was exceptional and food was a good as all the reviews 1 
the film gives meaning to the phrase never in the history of human conflict has so much been owed by so many to so few 1 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
i liked it 1 
his use of the colours of the french flag in the three films was nothing short of incredible every shot every scene was like a work of art 1 
very poor service 0 
their onscreen chemistry critical to the entire film is genuine 1 
i didnt want the clip going over the top of my ear causing discomfort 0 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
when my order arrived one of the gyros was missing 0 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
this place is awesome if you want something light and healthy during the summer 1 
i got it because it was so small and adorable 1 
the flat reenactments dont hold your attention because they are emotionally adrift and stagy 0 
if you are razr owneryou must have this 1 
very much disappointed with this company 0 
this place is great 1 
the service was poor and thats being nice 0 
what a waste of money and time 0 
avoid this film at all costs 0 
great hands free device 1 
thank you for such great service 1 
has been working great 1 
i really dont see how anyone could enjoy this movie 0 
and finally after all that we get to an ending that wouldve been great had it been handled by competent people and not jerry falwell 0 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
the real killer is the volume and of course it breaking 0 
i bought this battery with a coupon from amazon and im very happy with my purchase 1 
due to this happening on every call i was forced to stop using this headset 0 
i gave it 5 stars because of the sound quality 1 
if you look for authentic thai food go else where 0 
great pocket pc phone combination 1 
great food and service huge portions and they give a military discount 1 
del taco is pretty nasty and should be avoided if possible 0 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
you share general loewenhielms exquisite joy in his partaking of the cailles en sarcophage even though you are just watching a movie but you do wish for just a small sample to savor 1 
the transfers are very good 1 
i have yet to run this new battery below two bars and thats three days without charging 1 
the cable looks so thin and flimsy it is scary 0 
do not waste your time 0 
poor quality 0 
i dont have very many words to say about this place but it does everything pretty well 1 
over rated 0 
for that price i can think of a few place i would have much rather gone 0 
maybe if they werent cold they would have been somewhat edible 0 
my husband and i ate lunch here and were very disappointed with the food and service 0 
the story starts too fast with absolutely no suspense or buildup in the slightest 0 
well packaged arrived on time and works as intended 1 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
cinematography noteworthy including fine views of barcelona and its famed gaudi towers 1 
i did not expect this to be so good 1 
every time he opened his mouth you expect to hear you see kids pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show 0 
the jamaican mojitos are delicious 1 
i dont understand how this garbage got on the shelves of the movie store its not even a real movie 0 
its reception is very very poor 0 
the only downside is the service 0 
the soundtrack wasnt terrible either 1 
everything was fresh and delicious 1 
i hate movies like that 0 
i will not be eating there again 0 
no real improvement 0 
it definitely was not as good as my s11 1 
this is some seriously good pizza and im an expertconnisseur on the topic 1 
very bad performance plays angela bennett a computer expert who is at home all the time 0 
i am so tired of clichés that is just lazy writing and here they come in thick and fast 0 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
the problem was the script 0 
very disappointing 0 
the cashier was friendly and even brought the food out to me 1 
this is a good battery and it got here really fast 1 
i knew when i saw the film that more great things were to come from this gifted actor 1 
couldnt figure it out 0 
the real killer is the volume and of course it breaking 0 
best tacos in town by far 1 
this product is clearly not ready for prime time i dont care how cool it looks if you cant tell a call is coming in its worthless 0 
this is a great product sure beats using your fingers 1 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
the servers are not pleasant to deal with and they dont always honor pizza hut coupons 0 
1 hour 54 minutes of sheer tedium melodrama and horrible acting a mess of a script and a sinking feeling of good lord what were they thinking 0 
its extremely slow and takes forever to do anything with it 0 
a piece of junk that broke after being on my phone for 2 days 0 
to call this movie a drama is ridiculous 0 
the film deserves strong kudos for taking this stand for having exceptional acting from its mostly lesserknown cast and for the superintelligent script that doesnt insult the audience or take the easy way out when it comes to white racism 1 
it was so funny 1 
having to humour him just to get by and get through the day was so apt 1 
this is an outstanding little restaurant with some of the best food i have ever tasted 1 
also the area where my unit broke im not too fond of the magnetic strap 0 
now this dish was quite flavourful 1 
then our food came out disappointment ensued 0 
i received my headset in good time and was happy with it 1 
the movie lacks visual interest drama expression of feeling and celebration of the very patriotism that underlines the narrative 0 
id advise anyone to go and see it 1 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
this is a great deal 1 
his costars dont fare much better with people like morgan freeman jonah hill and ed helms just wasted 0 
just what i wanted 1 
unless youre just out to visually collect all extant films of austens work you can skip this one 0 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
works as described 1 
do not waste your money here 0 
and those baby owls were adorable 1 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
i felt as though her going to ireland did absolutely nothing whatsoever 0 
service is quick and even to go orders are just like we like it 1 
the worst sappiest dialogue i could go on and on 0 
then a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use 0 
a world better than 95 of the garbage in the theatres today 1 
this film offers many delights and surprises 1 
because both ears are occupied background is not distracting at all 1 
and his subtle connections between the three films are awesome 1 
the results well are a shame 0 
all this movie does is make you sick watching all these slackers make excuses for their stupid actions for 90 minutes 0 
i love this phone it is very handy and has a lot of features 1 
an interesting premise and billy drago is always good as a dangerous nutbag side note id love to see drago stephen mchattie and lance hendrikson in a flick together talk about raging cheekbones 1 
the ambiance isnt much better 0 
con spotty service 0 
worked perfectly 1 
this is so embarassing and also my ears hurt if i try to push the ear plug into my ear 0 
its a case of so bad it is laughable 0 
id say that would be the hardest decision honestly all of ms dishes taste how they are supposed to taste amazing 1 
hands down my favorite italian restaurant 1 
excellent product for the price 1 
but it wasnt until i watched this film that i realised how great he actually was 1 
lifetime does not air it enough so if anyone knows what store sells it let me know because this is a musthave 1 
steamboat willie is an amazingly important film to our cinema history 1 
so i bought about 10 of these and saved alot of money 1 
it didnt work people can not hear me when i talk 0 
one nice thing was that they added gratuity on the bill since our party was larger than 6 or 8 and they didnt expect more tip than that 1 
now you know why i gave it a 10 1 
the place was fairly clean but the food simply wasnt worth it 0 
and then tragedy struck 0 
nonlinear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well 1 
the performances are real and gripping the crocdodile is extremely well done indeed if the black water website is to be believed thats because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous 1 
the only good thing was that it fits comfortably on small ears 1 
not impressed 0 
the movie lacks visual interest drama expression of feeling and celebration of the very patriotism that underlines the narrative 0 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
the selection on the menu was great and so were the prices 1 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
battery has no life 0 
but then they came back cold 0 
hard to judge whether these sides were good because we were grossed out by the melted styrofoam and didnt want to eat it for fear of getting sick 0 
so there is no way for me to plug it in here in the us unless i go by a converter 0 
this is definitely one of the better documentaries i have seen looking at family relationships and marriage 1 
for that price i can think of a few place i would have much rather gone 0 
at first i thought i was grtting a good deal at 744 until i plugged it into my phone v3c razr 0 
for the price this was a great deal 1 
definitely will come back here again 1 
easy to use 1 
i was mortified 0 
whatever prompted such a documentary is beyond me 0 
nice headset priced right 1 
its reception is very very poor 0 
strike 2 who wants to be rushed 0 
i came over from verizon because cingulair has nicer cell phones the first thing i noticed was the really bad service 0 
comfort for our whole family 1 
i guess i liked the details of his dysfunctionhe was believable 1 
i would recommend it 1 
go to place for gyros 1 
if she had not rolled the eyes we may have stayed not sure if we will go back and try it again 0 
i seriously cannot believe that the owner has so many unexperienced employees that all are running around like chickens with their heads cut off 0 
i had a pretty satifying experience 1 
perhaps i caught them on an off night judging by the other reviews but im not inspired to go back 0 
im terribly disappointed that this film would receive so many awards and accolades especially when there are far more deserving works of film out there 0 
very easy to use 1 
penne vodka excellent 1 
think of the film being like a dream 1 
this is a great product sure beats using your fingers 1 
im translating movies for a living and this is the first movie in my 5year working experience that i found offensive to my intelligence 0 
it kept getting worse and worse so now im officially done 0 
regrettably the film fails 0 
yet i enjoy watching it 1 
does not work for listening to music with the cingular 8125 0 
you get extra minutes so that you can carry out the call and not get cut off 1 
id say that would be the hardest decision honestly all of ms dishes taste how they are supposed to taste amazing 1 
it was probably dirt 0 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
i hate writing bad reviews about films especially those in which i really like the star but this film is so bad i dont believe for one second that anyone could have been proud of it 0 
love this phone 1 
this scene is very strong and unpleasant 0 
one nice thing was that they added gratuity on the bill since our party was larger than 6 or 8 and they didnt expect more tip than that 1 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
im trying to return it for a refund 0 
i just cant explain this movie more than romanticcharminghilariousand adorablethe junkyard scenes are funnyall the junkyard dogs have something specialtoo funny i laughedkids will love itbuy it when it comes outit has new features 1 
the selection was probably the worst ive seen in vegasthere was none 0 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
uncomfortable in the ear dont use with lg vx9900 env 0 
all in all i think it was a good investment 1 
what a great double cheeseburger 1 
for a product that costs as much as this one does i expect it to work far better and with greater ease than this thing does 0 
great charger 1 
that one didnt work either 0 
so dont go there if you are looking for good food 0 
conclusion i loved it 1 
at no point in the proceedings does it look remotely like america 0 
one nice thing was that they added gratuity on the bill since our party was larger than 6 or 8 and they didnt expect more tip than that 1 
this product had a strong rubberpetroleum smell that was unbearable after a while and caused me to return it 0 
they have a really nice atmosphere 1 
the earpiece on this is too large or too heavyit keeps falling out of my ear 0 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
really pleased with this product so far 1 
i am also very happy with the price 1 
easily none other cartoon made me laugh in a tender way before getting into dark sitcoms oriented for teenagers 1 
this movie is so awesome 1 
this is a good joint 1 
about ten minutes into this film i started having second thoughts 0 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
the good cinematography also makes her and monica bellucci look very beautiful 1 
waaaaaayyyyyyyyyy over rated is all i am saying 0 
this review is long overdue since i consider a tale of two sisters to be the single greatest film ever made 1 
poor product 0 
after i pulled up my car i waited for another 15 minutes before being acknowledged 0 
excellent dualpurpose headset 1 
10 out of 10 stars 1 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
great phone 1 
hackneyed writing certainly but made even worse by the bad directing 0 
well never go again 0 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
my girlfriends veal was very bad 0 
whatever the producer was going for he missed entirely 0 
nice blanket of moz over top but i feel like this was done to cover up the subpar food 1 
the camera on the phone may be used as a dustpan when indoors id rather be using a disposable then this 0 
looks great and is strong 1 
if she had not rolled the eyes we may have stayed not sure if we will go back and try it again 0 
i couldnt think of a better way to end the film but a smile on my face great way to wrap up an amazing film and trilogy 1 
sorry i will not be getting food from here anytime soon 0 
the cast is always entertaining as usual 1 
paolo sorrentino has written a wonderful story about loneliness and tony has built one of the most unforgettable characters seen in movies in recent years 1 
when my order arrived one of the gyros was missing 0 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
the writer gorman bechard undoubtedly did his homework because all references are industry and characterage appropriate 1 
one of the most disappointing aspects is the lack of notable gore 0 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
an italian reviewer called this a small great film and thats right 1 
highly recommended a 1 
thus far have only visited twice and the food was absolutely delicious each time 1 
and the sound quality is great 1 
its a feelgood film and thats how i felt when i came out of the cinema 1 
it is a very well acted and done tv movie 1 
i wasnt the least bit interested 0 
could not get strong enough signal 0 
one character is totally annoying with a voice that gives me the feeling of fingernails on a chalkboard 0 
steer clear of this product and go with the genuine palm replacementr pens which come in a threepack 0 
really bad 0 
they brought a fresh batch of fries and i was thinking yay something warm but no 0 
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 
then the film just dropped the ball 0 
this isnt a small family restaurant this is a fine dining establishment 1 
i would recommend purchasing the jabra jx10 series 2 which works flawlessly with my moto q go figure 1 
excellent starter wireless headset 0 
a fantastic neighborhood gem 1 
really good product 1 
the management is rude 0 
service was very prompt 1 
utter crap sound quality is terrible 0 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
in other words the content level of this film is enough to easily fill a dozen other films 1 
our server was super nice and checked on us many times 1 
on the up side their cafe serves really good food 1 
the only place good for this film is in the garbage 0 
everyone is treated equally special 1 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
i hate movies like that 0 
we had so much to say about the place before we walked in that he expected it to be amazing but was quickly disappointed 0 
food was good service was good prices were good 1 
if there was ever an indication of a writer and a directors ability to meld two highly volatile temperaments into a seamless union of creativity then this is it 1 
probably never coming back and wouldnt recommend it 0 
they dropped more than the ball 0 
constantine gives everything the right intensity and seems to have a good understanding of the underlying psychological motivations 1 
the only suspense i was feeling was the frustration at just how retarded the girls were 0 
beware this is not a trashy cult movie this is trash period 0 
i will not return 0 
i started this review with two stars but im editing it to give it only one 0 
i have eaten here multiple times and each time the food was delicious 1 
this place was such a nice surprise 1 
its a campy sort of film thats a joy to watch 1 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
the plot has more holes than a pair of fishnet stockings and the direction and editing is astonishingly ham fisted 0 
it was horrendous 0 
worst ever 0 
you wont regret it 1 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
total waste of time 0 
this is was due to the fact that it took 20 minutes to be acknowledged then another 35 minutes to get our foodand they kept forgetting things 0 
this phone works great 1 
and the chef was generous with his time even came around twice so we can take pictures with him 1 
great food and great service in a clean and friendly setting 1 
avoid at any and all costs 0 
sound quality on both end is excellent i use headset to call my wife and ask my wife to use headset to call me 2 1 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
the atmosphere is modern and hip while maintaining a touch of coziness 1 
our server was super nice and checked on us many times 1 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
third the cheese on my friends burger was cold 0 
any grandmother can make a roasted chicken better than this one 0 
the scenes are often funny and occasionally touching as the characters evaluate their lives and where they are going 1
