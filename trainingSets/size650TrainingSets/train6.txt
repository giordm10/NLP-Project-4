my experience was terrible this was my fourth bluetooth headset and while it was much more comfortable than my last jabra which i hated 0 
it crackles with an unpredictable youthful energy but honestly i found it hard to follow and concentrate on it meanders so badly 0 
headset works great was packaged nicely to avoid any damage 1 
this place is like chipotle but better 1 
a very charming film with wonderful sentiment and heart 1 
this is an excellent film 1 
this is infuriating 0 
this case has passed the one year mark and while it shows signs of wear it is 100 functional 1 
down the drain because of a weak snap 0 
great food and service huge portions and they give a military discount 1 
returned 8 hours later 0 
this would not even be good as a made for tv flick 0 
the phone gets extremely hot 0 
the food was delicious our bartender was attentive and personable and we got a great deal 1 
the jerky camera movements were also annoying 0 
beware this is not a trashy cult movie this is trash period 0 
this scene is very strong and unpleasant 0 
what is even more stupid is that who had thought an idea that there should be a volcano in los angeles 0 
definitely a turn off for me i doubt ill be back unless someone else is buying 0 
it was so cool 1 
the design is very odd as the ear clip is not very comfortable at all 0 
its a feelgood film and thats how i felt when i came out of the cinema 1 
total brunch fail 0 
i have to mention this and it is a huge spoiler i loved the ending how all the characters of the three films were the remaining survivors of the ferry disaster with valentine and the young judge together and the old man watching it on her tv solidifying his happiness over the suffering which he dealt with for those many years 1 
the food came out at a good pace 1 
it seems completely secure both holding on to my belt and keeping the iphone inside 1 
ps the only scene in the movie that was cool is when the central character finds her room blown up 1 
this product had a strong rubberpetroleum smell that was unbearable after a while and caused me to return it 0 
my ribeye steak was cooked perfectly and had great mesquite flavor 1 
i would have given no star if i was able 0 
however my girl was complain that some time the phone doesnt wake up like normal phone does 0 
i dont know what the big deal is about this place but i wont be back yaall 0 
if there was ever an indication of a writer and a directors ability to meld two highly volatile temperaments into a seamless union of creativity then this is it 1 
but it wasnt anything at all just one big yawn 0 
walked in and the place smelled like an old grease trap and only 2 others there eating 0 
very good product well made 1 
his use of the colours of the french flag in the three films was nothing short of incredible every shot every scene was like a work of art 1 
unfortunately it was not good 0 
however i needed some better instructions 0 
i am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this 1 
conclusion very filling meals 1 
the mic is great 1 
so far it has worked like a charm 1 
hes a national treasure 1 
great atmosphere friendly and fast service 1 
theres also enough hypocrisy in this film to make me vomit 0 
i was bored throughout the whole damn thing 0 
sucked most of the stuff does not work with my phone 0 
i use this product in a motor control center where there is a lot of high voltage humming from the equipment and it works great 1 
probably never coming back and wouldnt recommend it 0 
i connected my wifes bluetoothmotorola hs850 to my phone and it worked like a charm whether the phone was in my pocket or the case 1 
is it possible for a movie to get any worse than this 0 
so flavorful and has just the perfect amount of heat 1 
so anyone near you will hear part of your conversation 0 
the pan cakes everyone are raving about taste like a sugary disaster tailored to the palate of a six year old 0 
there were too many close ups 0 
this particular model would not work with my motorola q smartphone 0 
dee snider just plain sucks 0 
their steaks are 100 recommended 1 
her lines seem to have been written by a fifteen year old though they are trying oh so so hard to sound like how a fifteen year old would really um you know well talk 0 
every thing on phone work perfectly she like it 1 
best of luck to the rude and noncustomer service focused new management 0 
the script is bad very bad  it contains both cheesiness and unethical joke that you normally see in rated r or nc17 movie 0 
definitely will come back here again 1 
i dont think ive ever gone to a movie and disliked it as much 0 
i was shocked because no signs indicate cash only 0 
very good lunch spot 1 
reception is terrible and full of static 0 
lately they have been extremely nice and helpful on the phone 1 
i love the ringtones because they are so upbeat 1 
i was very excited to get this headset because i thought it was really cute 1 
the atmosphere is modern and hip while maintaining a touch of coziness 1 
i own 2 of these cases and would order another 1 
it is light easy to use and has very clear reception and transmission 1 
i enjoyed it 1 
there was no chemistry between ben affleck and sandra bullock in this film and i couldnt understand why he would consider even leaving his wifetobe for this chick that he supposedly was knocked out by 0 
the story is lame not interesting and never really explains the sinister origins of the puppets 0 
but it does get better reception and clarity than any phone ive had before 1 
they are so cool 1 
a great film by a great director 1 
this movie is a good and humorous comment on life in 2006 1 
all in all id expected a better consumer experience from motorola 0 
needless to say we will never be back here again 0 
verizons bills however are difficult to understand even though their pricing plans are simple 0 
each day of the week they have a different deal and its all so delicious 1 
we had so much to say about the place before we walked in that he expected it to be amazing but was quickly disappointed 0 
im so happy to be here 1 
battery is terrible 0 
the cast was great 1 
i have had this phone for over a year now and i will tell you its not that great 0 
i would highly recommend this product 1 
comfortable nice range good battery life 1 
the directing and the cinematography arent quite as good 0 
they are so easy to love but even more easy to identify with 1 
i dont think well be going back anytime soon 0 
also notable is john baileys fine crisp beautifully colored cinematography and the great production design costumes by eiko ishioka who went on to do the memorable costumes for coppolas dracula for which she received a well deserved oscar 1 
this movie contained an allstar cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i havent seen before 1 
okay i like to consider myself a fair critic so ill give credit where credits duethe creature effects were actually pretty cool 1 
worthless product 0 
theres really nothing bad i can say about this headset 0 
its a mediocre miserable hollow laughable and predictable piece of garbage 0 
i enjoyed reading this book to my children when they were little 1 
in the span of an hour i had two people exclaim whoa is that the new phone on tv 1 
good value works fine power via usb car or wall outlet 1 
i dont think ill be running back to carlys anytime soon for food 0 
before i go in to why i gave a 1 star rating please know that this was my third time eating at bachi burger before writing a review 0 
spend your money elsewhere 0 
i swung in to give them a try but was deeply disappointed 0 
the biggest complaint i have is the battery drains superfast 0 
first of all it doesnt wear well 0 
i love this place 1 
the acting is fantastic the stories are seamlessly woven together and the dogs are splendid a must rent view or see 1 
the attention given to every character and complex psychological portrayals detailing loyalty treachery love and hope are tremendous 1 
the movie is terribly boring in places 0 
definitely worth checking out 1 
this was such an awesome movie that i bought it off of ebay 1 
poorly contstruct hinge 0 
also the fries are without a doubt the worst fries ive ever had 0 
this was utterly confusing at first which caused me to lose a couple of very very important contacts 0 
i really loved the story line and the poler bear was kinda cutebut if anyone has a question about fort steele just ask away 1 
excellent service 1 
much more interesting more action more suspense and less of the unneeded controversy 1 
im still trying to get over how bad it was 0 
some applause should be given to the prelude however 1 
the screen does get smudged easily because it touches your ear and face 0 
this is hands down the best phone ive ever had 1 
the movie is not completely perfect but titta di girolamo will stay with you for a long time after the vision of the movie 1 
definitely worth checking out 1 
the movie in movie situations in the beginning and through the game that is played with her by the acting coach are fascinating 1 
there are many continuity errors one other user commented on different cars in the garage joes glassesthe one that got to me the most was the fact joes facial hair configuration seemed to change from scene to scene 0 
will never ever go back and have told many people what had happened 0 
this is a disgrace 0 
brilliance indeed 1 
the poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying 0 
sound quality on both end is excellent i use headset to call my wife and ask my wife to use headset to call me 2 1 
worst customer service 0 
i mean this in a terrible way 0 
very disappointing 0 
i am a fan of his this movie sucked really bad 0 
the basic premise is wasted since it is sidelined by the inexplicable focus on the documentary crew 0 
beware this is not a trashy cult movie this is trash period 0 
same problem as others have mentioned 0 
looks great and is strong 1 
it was so boring 0 
they refuse to refund or replace 0 
worst hour and a half of my lifeoh my gosh 0 
improper description i had to return it 0 
which has more depth and character than the man underneath it 0 
i purcashed this for the car charger and it does not work 0 
however i recently watched the whole thing again on dvd and i was completely struck by how extremely stupid the storyline was how it contained holes inconsistencies and frankly a whole lot of crap and how horrid the dancing was 0 
i searched the internet and found this one to be the best value 1 
the feel of the dining room was more college cooking course than high class dining and the service was slow at best 0 
i bought this phone as a replacement for my startac and have regretted it since 0 
i advise everyone do not be fooled 0 
wow what a bad film 0 
not to mention the combination of pears almonds and bacon is a big winner 1 
excellent starter wireless headset 0 
definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly will return next time im in vegas 1 
it was so funny 1 
the loudspeaker option is great the bumpers with the lights is very appealing 0 
the jamaican mojitos are delicious 1 
still waiting im sure this item would work well if i ever recieve it 0 
this place is way too overpriced for mediocre food 0 
every element of this story was so over the top excessively phony and contrived that it was painful to sit through 0 
this is an excellent film 1 
it always cuts out and makes a beep beep beep sound then says signal failed 0 
great phone 1 
i love the ringtones because they are so upbeat 1 
the story starts too fast with absolutely no suspense or buildup in the slightest 0 
aailiyah was pretty good as akasha in places compelling her first entrance and mini dance scene 1 
seems like a good quick place to grab a bite of some familiar pub food but do yourself a favor and look elsewhere 0 
im in az all the time and now have my new spot 1 
by far the best cheesecurds we have ever had 1 
we were promptly greeted and seated 1 
it is practically useless and did not add any kind of boost to my reception after i bought it 0 
we are sending it back 0 
what is even more stupid is that who had thought an idea that there should be a volcano in los angeles 0 
my boyfriend and i sat at the bar and had a completely delightful experience 1 
never got it 0 
insults profound deuchebaggery and had to go outside for a smoke break while serving just to solidify it 0 
very disappointing 0 
i also decided not to send it back because our waitress looked like she was on the verge of having a heart attack 0 
when i received my pita it was huge it did have a lot of meat in it so thumbs up there 1 
the cast is always entertaining as usual 1 
due to this happening on every call i was forced to stop using this headset 0 
tom wilkinson broke my heart at the end and everyone elses judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike 1 
bad choice 0 
design flaw 0 
the flat reenactments dont hold your attention because they are emotionally adrift and stagy 0 
you will leave the theater wanting to go out and dance under the stars 1 
a fly was in my apple juice a fly 0 
i dont think ive ever gone to a movie and disliked it as much 0 
my salad had a bland vinegrette on the baby greens and hearts of palm 0 
highly entertaining at all angles 1 
now you know why i gave it a 10 1 
pretty good beer selection too 1 
the only thing i wasnt too crazy about was their guacamole as i dont like it puréed 0 
the microphone also works well but according to people i have called it applifies everything 1 
it was equally awful 0 
the noise shield is incrediable 1 
unfortunately cover girl is an example of how hollywood used to exploit women for financial gain 0 
disappointing accessory from a good manufacturer 0 
i might have gotten a defect but i would not risk buying it again because of the built quality alone 0 
by this time our side of the restaurant was almost empty so there was no excuse 0 
i love this thing 1 
i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
i can barely ever hear on it and am constantly saying what 0 
the headsets are easy to use and everyone loves them 1 
it is cheap and it feel and look just as cheap 0 
a standout scene 1 
i am pairing this with my iphone and i could not be happier with it so far 1 
wont work right or atleast for me 0 
the cow tongue and cheek tacos are amazing 1 
overall i am psyched to have a phone which has all my appointments and contacts in and gets great reception 1 
i never come again 0 
barney is definitely super de duper 1 
i saw it as a child on tv back in 1973 when it was the stranger and i loved it 1 
i would highly recommend this 1 
comes with a strong light that you can use to light up your camera shots and even flash sos signals seriously 1 
very pleased with this headset 1 
so dont go there if you are looking for good food 0 
this movie has a cutting edge to it 1 
the food was outstanding and the prices were very reasonable 1 
i would recommend it 1 
i would advise to not purchase this item it never worked very well 0 
definitely not worth the 3 i paid 0 
worked perfectly 1 
i dont understand how this garbage got on the shelves of the movie store its not even a real movie 0 
there is so much good food in vegas that i feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to rice and company 0 
coming here is like experiencing an underwhelming relationship where both parties cant wait for the other person to ask to break up 0 
it crackles with an unpredictable youthful energy but honestly i found it hard to follow and concentrate on it meanders so badly 0 
im glad the film didnt go for the most obvious choice as a lesser film certainly would have 1 
this place is good 1 
the decor is nice and the piano music soundtrack is pleasant 1 
it also took her forever to bring us the check when we asked for it 0 
the acting as youd expect from this cast is top notch 1 
they could serve it with just the vinaigrette and it may make for a better overall dish but it was still very good 1 
instead we got a bore fest about a whiny spoiled brat babysitting 0 
it only recognizes the phone as its storage device 0 
tied to charger for conversations lasting more than 45 minutesmajor problems 0 
but it does get better reception and clarity than any phone ive had before 1 
i wasnt really impressed with strip steak 0 
lots of holes in the script 0 
best of luck to the rude and noncustomer service focused new management 0 
they refuse to refund or replace 0 
during several different 2 minute calls i experienced 5 drops and it was in an area that had 5 bars 0 
not good for the money 0 
disappointing experience 0 
horrible had to switch 3 times 0 
the only good thing was that it fits comfortably on small ears 1 
i would recommend saving room for this 1 
i love this device 1 
another thing i didnt really like is when a character got punched in the face a gallon of blood would spew forth soon after 0 
if she had not rolled the eyes we may have stayed not sure if we will go back and try it again 0 
the best scene in the movie was when gerardo is trying to find a song that keeps running through his head 1 
works well 1 
bad quality 0 
very bad performance plays angela bennett a computer expert who is at home all the time 0 
a piece of junk that broke after being on my phone for 2 days 0 
the fish is badly made and some of its underwater shots are repeated a thousand times in the film 0 
this movie contained an allstar cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i havent seen before 1 
it was way over fried 0 
instead we got a bore fest about a whiny spoiled brat babysitting 0 
it ranks highly as a great noircrimedrama incredible performances by belmondo and lino ventura 1 
when a song could explain the emotions of the subjects better such as when jay adams unfortunate life was a subject of talk the song old man by neil young was played which evokes many emotions 1 
when achille and philippa beautifully sing a duet from don giovanni that perfectly describes their situation in the movie you appreciate the subtle layers of this excellent film 1 
the scenes with the ohsomature neighbourgirl are a misplace 0 
this is a good battery and it got here really fast 1 
if there were zero stars i would give it zero stars 0 
we got sitting fairly fast but ended up waiting 40 minutes just to place our order another 30 minutes before the food arrived 0 
so anyone near you will hear part of your conversation 0 
the sound quality is good and functionality is awesome 1 
the scenes are often funny and occasionally touching as the characters evaluate their lives and where they are going 1 
the delivery was on time 1 
our server was very nice and even though he looked a little overwhelmed with all of our needs he stayed professional and friendly until the end 1 
i love this bluetooth 1 
totally believable 1 
sweetest phone 1 
a lot of websites have been rating this a very good phone and so do i 1 
great software for motorolas 1 
a lot of websites have been rating this a very good phone and so do i 1 
call me a nut but i think this is one of the best movies ever 1 
and i really did find them funny 1 
cheap but hey it works was pleasantly suprised given the low cost of this item 1 
i was not happy with this item 0 
terrible management 0 
there are massive levels massive unlockable characters its just a massive game 1 
it does everything the description said it would 1 
freezes frequently4 0 
but in any case the best part is you can download these pictures to your laptop using ir or even send pictures from your laptop to the phone 1 
the greek dressing was very creamy and flavorful 1 
i never walked out of a movie faster 0 
kind of flops around 0 
i think not again 0 
the transfers are very good 1 
the speaker is of low quality so as making the ring tones sound very cheap 0 
im glad i found this product on amazon it is hard to find it wasnt high priced 1 
level 5 spicy was perfect where spice didnt overwhelm the soup 1 
it was forced like everything in this movie 0 
youll love it 1 
back to good bbq lighter fare reasonable pricing and tell the public they are back to the old ways 1 
he was very impressed when going from the original battery to the extended battery 1 
will definitely be back 1 
there is a totally unnecessary trainroller coaster scene 0 
a greasy unhealthy meal 0 
bad quality 0 
the construction of the headsets is poor 0 
they made this case too small and is very difficult to install 0 
probably not in a hurry to go back 0 
this is an outstanding little restaurant with some of the best food i have ever tasted 1 
this is a very average phone with bad battery life that operates on a weak network 0 
not only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic but it also managed to give away the entire movie and im not exaggerating every moment every plot point every joke is told in the trailer 0 
lets start with all the problemsthe acting especially from the lead professor was very very bad 0 
the food is good 1 
the real disappointment was our waiter 0 
how can that bethe audio quality is poor 0 
it is indescribably the most annoying and idiotic show i have ever seen 0 
if you love authentic mexican food and want a whole bunch of interesting yet delicious meats to choose from you need to try this place 1 
service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is vegas and located inside the crystals shopping mall by aria 1 
awful 0 
very good though 1 
my fella got the huevos rancheros and they didnt look too appealing 0 
people couldnt hear me talk and i had to pull out the earphone and talk on the phone 0 
just dont know why they were so slow 0 
although i very much liked the look and sound of this place the actual experience was a bit disappointing 0 
happy so far 1 
my experience was terrible this was my fourth bluetooth headset and while it was much more comfortable than my last jabra which i hated 0 
i checked out this place a couple years ago and was not impressed 0 
the result is a powerhouse achievement made more timely now perhaps because of our cultures disturbing fascination with celebrity and its distorted interpretations of fame 1 
you never know if you pushed it hard enough or the right number of times for the function you want or not 0 
doesnt work at all i bougth it for my l7c and its not working 0 
but this movie is not funny considering the ridiculousness of it 0 
i liked it 1 
the restaurant atmosphere was exquisite 1 
good show samsung 1 
not easy to watch 0 
in the span of an hour i had two people exclaim whoa is that the new phone on tv 1 
the only very disappointing thing was there was no speakerphone 0 
main thing i didnt enjoy is that the crowd is of older crowd around mid 30s and up 0 
all things considered a job very well done 1 
the mic there is a joke and the volume is quite low 0 
avoid this one if you can 0 
but the service was beyond bad 0 
it was awesome 1 
you wont regret it 1 
restored my phone to like new performance 1 
the first thing that happened was that the tracking was off 0 
ive seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie 0 
the only thing worse than taylors acting was stanwycks singing 0 
once you get inside youll be impressed with the place 1 
the waitress was friendly and happy to accomodate for veganveggie options 1 
the real killer is the volume and of course it breaking 0 
delicious 1 
the only good thing was that it fits comfortably on small ears 1 
i vomited in the bathroom mid lunch 0 
tried to go here for lunch and it was a madhouse 0 
the pairing of the two devices was so easy it barely took a couple minutes before i started making calls with the voice dialing feature 1 
im terribly disappointed that this film would receive so many awards and accolades especially when there are far more deserving works of film out there 0 
her role was played well 1 
great character actors telly savalas and peter boyle 1 
for the price this was a great deal 1 
i have eaten here multiple times and each time the food was delicious 1 
my friend did not like his bloody mary 0 
i dont think you will be disappointed 1 
phone falls out easily 0 
this is a good battery and it got here really fast 1 
gave up trying to eat any of the crust teeth still sore 0 
everything captain howdy says is either laughable or just plain stupid 0 
the kids are annoying 0 
nice case feels good in your hands 1 
after my phone got to be about a year old its been slowly breaking despite much care on my part 0 
painful on the ear 0 
give this one a look 1 
service was fantastic 1 
for sushi on the strip this is the place to go 1 
i left with a stomach ache and felt sick the rest of the day 0 
needless to say i wont be going back anytime soon 0 
im still infatuated with this phone 1 
almost all of the songs in cover girl are oldfashioned and not very tuneful 0 
the cashier was friendly and even brought the food out to me 1 
all the actors give a wonderful performance especially jennifer rubin as jamie harris who changes from the nervous starlet in the beginning through the strange events she is part of to the cool star 1 
funny clever hip just like prays previous film hype 1 
there was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters 0 
i was amazed at the quick arrival of the two original lg cell phone batteries and and at a fraction of the price 1 
the first time i ever came here i had an amazing experience i still tell people how awesome the duck was 1 
even allowing for poor production values for the time 1971 and the format some kind of miniseries this is baaaaaad 0 
the acting is beyond abysmal 0 
very disappointed 0 
the film succeeds despite or perhaps because of an obviously meagre budget 1 
the tracfonewebsite is user friendly and makes it easy toactivate etc 1 
it was pretty gross 0 
i am so pleased to know such a modern day genius is out there letting is passion for art drive him and taking us as an audience with him 1 
linked to my phone without effort 1 
sweetest phone 1 
a fly was in my apple juice a fly 0 
top line dont waste your time and money on this one its as bad as it comes 0 
again lame 0 
howeverthe riingtones are not the best and neither are the games 0 
the story is lame not interesting and never really explains the sinister origins of the puppets 0 
bland not a liking this place for a number of reasons and i dont want to waste time on bad reviewing ill leave it at that 0 
seriously its not worth wasting your or your kids time on 0 
secondly hitchcock pretty much perfected the thriller and chase movie 1 
there are so many problems i dont know where to start 0 
prosgood camera very nice pictures also has cool styles like black and white and more 1 
as an earlier review noted plug in this charger and nothing happens 0 
the fried rice was dry as well 0 
however my girl was complain that some time the phone doesnt wake up like normal phone does 0 
but when someone strives for greatness and poetry but delivers a muddled and often ridiculous story a bunch of disparate scenes pretentious dialogue then you get the worst kind of a movie that some other reviewer very accurately defined as pretentious crap 0 
im happy about this purchase good quality and low price 1 
some great music and terrific scenery 1 
great phone 1 
the camera on the phone may be used as a dustpan when indoors id rather be using a disposable then this 0 
they were goldencrispy and delicious 1 
great it was new packaged nice works good no problems and it came in less time then i expected 1 
it really is impressive that the place hasnt closed down 0 
its the best headset i have used 1 
it presents a idyllic yet serious portrayal of the ups and downs of the characters lives 1 
we started with the tuna sashimi which was brownish in color and obviously wasnt fresh 0 
on a positive note our server was very attentive and provided great service 1 
great case and price 1 
her role was played well 1 
i felt as though her going to ireland did absolutely nothing whatsoever 0 
the phone takes forever to charge like 2 to 5 hours literally 0 
regrettably the film fails 0 
i was seated immediately 1 
it didnt work people can not hear me when i talk 0 
dont waste your time watching this rubbish nonresearched film 0 
it is the best charger i have seen on the market yet 1 
it has a great camera thats 2mp and the pics are nice and clear with great picture quality 1 
and dont even get me started on the jerky camerawork 0 
i just wanted to leave 0 
often the dialogue doesnt really follow from one line to another or fit the surroundings 0 
it looses connection to the phone even when it is within a couple feet between the two 0 
to my disbelief each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods i have ever tasted 0 
great place to eat reminds me of the little mom and pop shops in the san francisco bay area 1 
i have only had it for a few weeks but so far so good 1 
ive had this bluetoooth headset for some time now and still not comfortable with the way it fits on the ear 0 
the film has great actors a master director a significant themeat least a wouldbe significant theme undertone of fifties existential worldweariness aerial scenes that ought to have thrilled both senses and imagination and characters about which one might deeply care 1 
the story line is totally predictable 0 
it failed to convey the broad sweep of landscapes that were a great part of the original 0 
none of them are engaging or exciting 0 
piece of junk 0 
the lead man is charismafree 0 
back to good bbq lighter fare reasonable pricing and tell the public they are back to the old ways 1 
i struggle to find anything bad to say about it 1 
ive never been more insulted or felt disrespected 0 
i also decided not to send it back because our waitress looked like she was on the verge of having a heart attack 0 
the restaurant atmosphere was exquisite 1 
the grilled chicken was so tender and yellow from the saffron seasoning 1 
both films are terrible but to the credit of the 1986 version it was watchable 0 
these were so good we ordered them twice 1 
i promise they wont disappoint 1 
everything was perfect the night we were in 1 
it rocked my world and is certainly a must see for anyone with no social or physical outlets 1 
it isnt even an achievement as a sobaditsgood or sobaditsmemorable movie 0 
these are the central themes of the film and they are handled ineptly stereotypically and with no depth of imagination 0 
i use this product in a motor control center where there is a lot of high voltage humming from the equipment and it works great 1 
chinese forgeries abound 0 
all in all its an insult to ones intelligence and a huge waste of money 0 
oh the charger seems to work fine 1 
o my gosh the best phone i have ever had 1 
and there wasnt a single sour note struck actingwise either some surprisingly solid casting here 1 
in addition to having one of the most lovely songs ever written french cancan also boasts one of the cutest leading ladies ever to grace the screen 1 
the service here is fair at best 0 
this early film from future goremeister lucio fulci is a very good addition to the giallo subgenre 1 
for those that havent seen it dont waste your time 0 
this device is great in several situations1 1 
you never know if you pushed it hard enough or the right number of times for the function you want or not 0 
these are the central themes of the film and they are handled ineptly stereotypically and with no depth of imagination 0 
just spicy enough perfect actually 1 
main thing i didnt enjoy is that the crowd is of older crowd around mid 30s and up 0 
bought mainly for the charger which broke soon after purchasing 0 
tied to charger for conversations lasting more than 45 minutesmajor problems 0 
perfect for someone me who only likes beer ice cold or in this case even colder 1 
if this premise sound stupid thats because it is 0 
to my disbelief each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods i have ever tasted 0 
didnt laugh or even smile once 0 
this film offers many delights and surprises 1 
delicious 1 
the food amazing 1 
with great sound effects and impressive special effects i cant recommend this movie enough 1 
it was also the right balance of war and love 1 
all the characters in this film are tremendously well played 1 
magical help 1 
i got it because it was so small and adorable 1 
i got it because it was so small and adorable 1

ive never been more insulted or felt disrespected 0 
what the hell kind of crap is that 0 
the bus boy on the other hand was so rude 0 
if you want a real scare rent this one 1 
great character actors telly savalas and peter boyle 1 
what should have been a hilarious yummy christmas eve dinner to remember was the biggest fail of the entire trip for us 0 
horrible phone 0 
the staff is always super friendly and helpful which is especially cool when you bring two small boys and a baby 1 
lasted one day and then blew up 0 
the steak was amazingrge fillet relleno was the best seafood plate i have ever had 1 
it was so cool 1 
very serious spoilers this movie was a huge disappointment 0 
disappointed 0 
the live music on fridays totally blows 0 
delicious and i will absolutely be back 1

and sometimes it was so embarrassing that i had to look away 0 
i could barely stomach the meal but didnt complain because it was a business lunch 0 
service is friendly and inviting 1 
i tried the cape cod ravoli chickenwith cranberrymmmm 1 
each day of the week they have a different deal and its all so delicious 1 
this isnt a small family restaurant this is a fine dining establishment 1 
an interesting premise and billy drago is always good as a dangerous nutbag side note id love to see drago stephen mchattie and lance hendrikson in a flick together talk about raging cheekbones 1 
does not work for listening to music with the cingular 8125 0 
these headphones were a great find and i think they are perhaps the best purchase ive made in the last several years seriously 1 
i wont say any more i dont like spoilers so i dont want to be one but i believe this film is worth your time 1 
dont buy it 0 
im not impressed with the concept or the food 0 
worst service to boot but that is the least of their worries 0 
not much seafood and like 5 strings of pasta at the bottom 0 
it looses connection to the phone even when it is within a couple feet between the two 0 
but this movie is not funny considering the ridiculousness of it 0 
unfortunately any virtue in this films production work was lost on a regrettable script 0 
i ordered the lemon raspberry ice cocktail which was also incredible 1 
the story itself is just predictable and lazy 0 
but it is great i would really recommend it 1 
ill definitely be in soon again 1 
regrettably the film fails 0 
it also took her forever to bring us the check when we asked for it 0 
a week later after i activated it it suddenly died 0 
i seriously cannot believe that the owner has so many unexperienced employees that all are running around like chickens with their heads cut off 0 
it had some average acting from the main person and it was a low budget as you clearly can see 0 
my 5year old nokia 2160 from tracfone holds the charge a lot better than this 0 
initially the local sites in the film which was filmed here in buffalo intrigued me 1 
the potatoes were like rubber and you could tell they had been made up ahead of time being kept under a warmer 0 
the sergeant pepper beef sandwich with auju sauce is an excellent sandwich as well 1 
its just painful 0 
spoilers whatever else can or cant be said about it surface is superbly crafted 1 
im probably one of the few people to ever go to ians and not like it 0 
i received my orders well within the shipping timeframe everything was in good working order and overall i am very excited to have this source 1 
he was extremely rude and really there are so many other restaurants i would love to dine at during a weekend in vegas 0 
plantronics bluetooth excelent buy 1 
2 times very bad customer service 0 
it has all the features i want 1 
the secondary plot line is incomprehensible and its relation to the primary plot line is mystifying 0 
it will drive you barking mad 0 
constantine gives everything the right intensity and seems to have a good understanding of the underlying psychological motivations 1 
i just wanted to leave 0 
it doesnt work in europe or asia 0 
i would avoid this place if you are staying in the mirage 0 
overall i like there food and the service 1 
really good product 1 
doesnt hold charge 0 
i saw this film over christmas and what a great film it was 1 
she carries the movie well 1 
poorly contstruct hinge 0 
the football scenes at the end were perplexing 0 
is it possible for a movie to get any worse than this 0 
the only thing i wasnt too crazy about was their guacamole as i dont like it puréed 0 
no ear loop needed its tiny and the sound is great 1 
the scallop dish is quite appalling for value as well 0 
food was so gooodd 1 
it was a huge awkward 15lb piece of cow that was 34ths gristle and fat 0 
i love the ownerchef his one authentic japanese cool dude 1 
i felt asleep the first time i watched it so i can recommend it for insomniacs 0 
feelings thoughtsgabriels discomfort during the danceall these intangibles leap to life and come within the viewers grasp in hustons portrayal 1 
the hockey scenes are terrible defensemen playing like theyre 5 years old goalies diving at shots that are 10 feet wide of the net etc 0 
i have tried these cables with my computer and my ipod and it works just fine 1 
just what i wanted 1 
the camera although rated at an impressive 13 megapixels renders images that fall well below expectations of such a relatively high resolution 0 
very good though 1 
its just adorable seeing mickey playing turkey in the straw in a highly imaginative if occasionally cruel way 1 
so in a nutshell 1 the restaraunt smells like a combination of a dirty fish market and a sewer 0 
i got it because it was so small and adorable 1 
each day of the week they have a different deal and its all so delicious 1 
i dont have to be an accountant to know im getting screwed 0 
perfect for someone me who only likes beer ice cold or in this case even colder 1 
performed awful muffled tinny incoming sound and severe echo for those on the other end of the call 0 
okay i like to consider myself a fair critic so ill give credit where credits duethe creature effects were actually pretty cool 1 
excellent product for the price 1 
the characters are fleshed out surprisingly well particularly grimes and blake and all the actors deliver their sharply scripted lines with just the right amount of deadpan tongue in cheek to make the dialogue both hilarious and realistic 1 
the movie is terribly boring in places 0 
greatno problems at all 1 
the acting is fantastic the stories are seamlessly woven together and the dogs are splendid a must rent view or see 1 
price is good too 1 
it is light has plenty of battery capacity and is very confortable to wear for somewhat extended periods of time 1 
i cant wait to go back 1 
it was forced like everything in this movie 0 
the acting is terrible and the writing is worse 0 
the staff was very attentive 1 
despite how hard i rate businesses its actually rare for me to give a 1 star 0 
there was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters 0 
great food and great service in a clean and friendly setting 1 
great value 1 
all of the tapas dishes were delicious 1 
we started with the tuna sashimi which was brownish in color and obviously wasnt fresh 0 
reasonably priced also 1 
the story is lame not interesting and never really explains the sinister origins of the puppets 0 
the movie is full of wonderful dancing hence the title 1 
they have a really nice atmosphere 1 
highly recommended 1 
the bottowm lineanother worthless cheap gimmick from sprint 0 
its too bad that everyone else involved didnt share crowes level of dedication to quality for if they did wed have a far better film on our hands than this subpar mess 0 
the service was great even the manager came and helped with our table 1 
hot dishes are not hot cold dishes are close to room tempi watched staff prepare food with bare hands no gloveseverything is deep fried in oil 0 
just does not work 0 
really pleased with this product so far 1 
coming here is like experiencing an underwhelming relationship where both parties cant wait for the other person to ask to break up 0 
the cast is always entertaining as usual 1 
this movie is also revealing 1 
the characters are interesting and you really care for them 1 
spoilers whatever else can or cant be said about it surface is superbly crafted 1 
a good quality bargain i bought this after i bought a cheapy from big lots that sounded awful and people on the other end couldnt hear me 1 
appetite instantly gone 0 
battery lasts only a few hours 0 
there are massive levels massive unlockable characters its just a massive game 1 
with the originality and freshness of the first movie now spent this remake had little else to offer 0 
my side greek salad with the greek dressing was so tasty and the pita and hummus was very refreshing 1 
i would highly recommend this product 1 
waited 2 hours never got either of our pizzas as many other around us who came in later did 0 
there still are good actors around 1 
i didnt know pulled pork could be soooo delicious 1 
we got the food and apparently they have never heard of salt and the batter on the fish was chewy 0 
worst hour and a half of my lifeoh my gosh 0 
the phone gets extremely hot 0 
recommend with confidence 1 
i would definitely recommend the jabra bt250v for those who are looking for comfort clarity and a great price 1 
nice design and quality 1 
20th century foxs road house 1948 is not only quite a silly noir but is an implausible unmitigated bore of a movie 0 
if she had not rolled the eyes we may have stayed not sure if we will go back and try it again 0 
utterly without merit on any level this is akin to torture 0 
works like a charm it work the same as the one i got with the phone 1 
all of the main players are mesmerising 1 
avoid this establishment 0 
all this movie does is make you sick watching all these slackers make excuses for their stupid actions for 90 minutes 0 
really bad 0 
both the hot sour the egg flower soups were absolutely 5 stars 1
