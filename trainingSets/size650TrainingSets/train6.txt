i bought this to use with my kindle fire and absolutely loved it 1 
it has a very good plot it holds your complete attention the acting is superb tom wilkinson was fantastic and emily watson was also very good 1 
the food was excellent and service was very good 1 
i love this place 1 
i hate writing bad reviews about films especially those in which i really like the star but this film is so bad i dont believe for one second that anyone could have been proud of it 0 
worst service to boot but that is the least of their worries 0 
avoid this film at all costs 0 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
took an hour to get our food only 4 tables in restaurant my food was luke warm our sever was running around like he was totally overwhelmed 0 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
the kids are very cool too 1 
the service was poor and thats being nice 0 
the crêpe was delicate and thin and moist 1 
definitely will come back here again 1 
it will drive you barking mad 0 
the best electronics of the available fm transmitters 1 
i have always used corded headsets and the freedom from the wireless is very helpful 1 
dont buy this product 0 
camera color balance is awful 0 
voice recognition is tremendous 1 
razr battery good buy 1 
all the characters in this film are tremendously well played 1 
these are certainly very comfortable and functionality is decent 1 
the design is very odd as the ear clip is not very comfortable at all 0 
best of all is the rotating feature very helpful 1 
so anyone near you will hear part of your conversation 0 
simply beautiful 1 
being a 90s child i truly enjoyed this show and i can proudly say that i enjoyed it big time and even more than the classical wb cartoons 1 
food was great and so was the serivce 1 
i find this inexcusable and so will probably be returning this phone and perhaps changing carriers 0 
i work in the hospitality industry in paradise valley and have refrained from recommending cibo any longer 0 
this movie totally grates on my nerves 0 
for sushi on the strip this is the place to go 1 
highquality chicken on the chicken caesar salad 1 
very bad experience 0 
worthless product 0 
poor quality and service 0 
how awful she is 0 
this place is pretty good nice little vibe in the restaurant 1 
the plot well i said id let that one go 0 
this item worked great but it broke after 6 months of use 0 
it was attached to a gas station and that is rarely a good sign 0 
i will be back many times soon 1 
its so stupid to have to keep buying new chargers car chargers cradles headphones and car kits every time a new phone comes out 0 
i will never go back to this place and will never ever recommended this place to anyone 0 
i hate those things as much as cheap quality black olives 0 
all in all i can assure you ill be back 1 
i know that sounds funny but to me it seemed like sketchy technology that wouldnt work wellwell this one works great 1 
better than expected 1 
i bought this phone as a replacement for my startac and have regretted it since 0 
go watch it 1 
i keep watching it over and over 1 
very very fun chef 1 
macbeth jason connery moved me to tears with his final monolog out brief candle outhe gave the sphere of moral decay and dark forces a human face which makes it the more interesting 1 
fantastic food 1 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
plus its only 8 bucks 1 
i gave it a 10 1 
generally it just lacked imagination 0 
funny clever hip just like prays previous film hype 1 
but this movie really got to me 1 
this movie is excellentangel is beautiful and scamp is adorablehis little yelps when hes scaredand the funniest parts are whenscamp is caught under the curtain and when angel and scamp are singing ive never had this feeling beforei totally recommend this movieits coming out on special edition on june 20the cover has scamp on a garbage can and angel underneath the lid 1 
awful service 0 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
it makes very strange ticking noises before it ends the call 0 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
it was a long time that i didnt see a so charismatic actor on screen 1 
the restaurant atmosphere was exquisite 1 
used and dirty 0 
the speaker is of low quality so as making the ring tones sound very cheap 0 
we also ordered the spinach and avocado salad the ingredients were sad and the dressing literally had zero taste 0 
when i opened the sandwich i was impressed but not in a good way 0 
a good quality bargain i bought this after i bought a cheapy from big lots that sounded awful and people on the other end couldnt hear me 1 
comfort for our whole family 1 
the plantains were the worst ive ever tasted 0 
a great touch 1 
the calls drop the phone comes on and off at will the screen goes black and the worst of all it stops ringing intermittently 0 
its too bad that everyone else involved didnt share crowes level of dedication to quality for if they did wed have a far better film on our hands than this subpar mess 0 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
bad characters bad story and bad acting 0 
the company shipped my product very promptly and it works well 1 
i love the ownerchef his one authentic japanese cool dude 1 
not much dialogue not much music the whole film was shot as elaborately and aesthetically like a sculpture 1 
not my thing 0 
this item is fantastic and works perfectly 1 
will definitely be back 1 
dont go here 0 
it was horrible 0 
everything about this film is simply incredible 1 
the seasonal fruit was fresh white peach puree 1 
ill definitely be in soon again 1 
this is a witty and delightful adaptation of the dr seuss book brilliantly animated by upas finest and thoroughly deserving of its academy award 1 
the fact is this film is a wonderful heartwarming tale about two people chasing their dreams 1 
how awful she is 0 
they keep getting better and better this is my third one and ive had numerous palms too 1 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
this is the place where i first had pho and it was amazing 1 
everything about this film is simply incredible 1 
i believe the screenwriter did a good job of tying up the loose ends 1 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
its this pandering to the audience that sabotages most of his films 0 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
the memories are murky but i can only say that i enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show 1 
the battery runs down quickly 0 
works great 1 
the last 15 minutes of movie are also not bad as well 1 
the plot is nonsense that doesnt interest in the slightest way or have any uniqueness to it 0 
the first time i ever came here i had an amazing experience i still tell people how awesome the duck was 1 
i gave it 5 stars because of the sound quality 1 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
its just lame 0 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
the reception is excellent 1 
saw the movie today and thought it was a good effort good messages for kids 1 
everything was perfect the night we were in 1 
its been my choice headset for yearsgreat sound good volume good noise cancellation 1 
about 30 minutes of footage is wasted to show mediocre elderly actors awkwardly babbling overwrought pseudosatanic gibberish corny enough to make a teen goth blush almost always in olde english and sometimes in latin that may or may not be made up words 0 
comfortable in my hand 1 
1010 1 
i didnt realize how wonderful the short really is until the last two scenes 1 
the results well are a shame 0 
these were so good we ordered them twice 1 
to my disbelief each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods i have ever tasted 0 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
i really do recommend this place you can go wrong with this donut place 1 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
probably not in a hurry to go back 0 
nobody identifies with these characters because theyre all cardboard cutouts and stereotypes or predictably reversestereotypes 0 
clever and a real crowdpleaserthis film still ranks among mickeys best films even after 80 wonderful years 1 
the real disappointment was our waiter 0 
phone is sturdy as all nokia bar phones are 1 
the food was delicious our bartender was attentive and personable and we got a great deal 1 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
the characters are interesting and you really care for them 1 
terrible product and waste of money 0 
the charger arrived within the promised timeframe but it did not work 0 
this one is simply a disappointment 0 
the greek dressing was very creamy and flavorful 1 
i dont have very many words to say about this place but it does everything pretty well 1 
never got it 0 
one more thing i can tolerate political incorrectness very well im all for artistic freedom and suspension of disbelief but the slavic female character was just too much 0 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
instead we got a bore fest about a whiny spoiled brat babysitting 0 
either way it sucks 0 
total waste of time 0 
see it 1 
i was left shattered from the experience of watching this film and i took a good two hours to fully recover 0 
for a product that costs as much as this one does i expect it to work far better and with greater ease than this thing does 0 
babie bop is very cute 1 
just really good so far probably the best bt headset i have ever had 1 
comes with a strong light that you can use to light up your camera shots and even flash sos signals seriously 1 
their monster chicken fried steak and eggs is my all time favorite 1 
they have been around for years and carries the highest quality of antiglare screen protector that i have found to date 1 
not a good item it worked for a while then started having problems in my auto reverse tape player 0 
they brought a fresh batch of fries and i was thinking yay something warm but no 0 
its an empty hollow shell of a movie 0 
the scripting of the subtle comedy is unmatched by any movie in recent years 1 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
you also cannot take pictures with it in the case because the lense is covered 0 
we will not be coming back 0 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
a good commentary of todays love and undoubtedly a film worth seeing 1 
returned 8 hours later 0 
and there wasnt a single sour note struck actingwise either some surprisingly solid casting here 1 
the food is good 1 
i gave it a 10 1 
i only hear garbage for audio 0 
the servers are not pleasant to deal with and they dont always honor pizza hut coupons 0 
unfortunately it did not work 0 
we had so much to say about the place before we walked in that he expected it to be amazing but was quickly disappointed 0 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
didnt laugh or even smile once 0 
the staff is great the food is delish and they have an incredible beer selection 1 
comfortable in my hand 1 
it defeats the purpose of a bluetooth headset 0 
the food is very good for your typical bar food 1 
the scenery that the two daughters paint and photograph are beautiful 1 
all in all i can assure you ill be back 1 
the story unfolds in 18th century jutland and the use of period music played on period instruments is just one more fine touch 1 
we got the food and apparently they have never heard of salt and the batter on the fish was chewy 0 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
frankly after cotton club and unfaithful it was kind of embarrassing to watch lane and gere in this film because it is bad 0 
strike 2 who wants to be rushed 0 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
no actress has been worse used that june allison in this movie 0 
i use this product in a motor control center where there is a lot of high voltage humming from the equipment and it works great 1 
the bottowm lineanother worthless cheap gimmick from sprint 0 
but in terms of the writing its very fresh and bold 1 
great atmosphere friendly and fast service 1 
total letdown i would much rather just go to the camelback flower shop and cartel coffee 0 
the shipping time was also very quick 1 
this second appearance of mickey mouse following the silent plane crazy earlier that year is probably his most famous filmmostly because it was so groundbreaking 1 
the stories were as unbelievable as the actors 0 
its extremely slow and takes forever to do anything with it 0 
this movie is excellentangel is beautiful and scamp is adorablehis little yelps when hes scaredand the funniest parts are whenscamp is caught under the curtain and when angel and scamp are singing ive never had this feeling beforei totally recommend this movieits coming out on special edition on june 20the cover has scamp on a garbage can and angel underneath the lid 1 
the keyboard is a nice compromise between a full qwerty and the basic cell phone number keypad 1 
i love this device 1 
good value great food great service 1 
i highly recommend this device to everyone 1 
worthwhile 1 
trumbull on i love lucy 1 
used and dirty 0 
dont buy this product it fails 0 
this totally unfunny movie is so over the top and pathetic and unrealistic that throughout the whole 90 minutes of utter torture i probably looked at my watch about 70000 times 0 
he deserves 5 stars 1 
definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly will return next time im in vegas 1 
its not hard to make a decent hamburger 0 
the performances are not improved by improvisation because the actors now have twice as much to worry about not only whether theyre delivering the line well but whether the line itself is any good 0 
this really is how vegas fine dining used to be right down to the menus handed to the ladies that have no prices listed 1 
very clear quality sound and you dont have to mess with the sound on your ipod since you have the sound buttons on the headset 1 
a good quality bargain i bought this after i bought a cheapy from big lots that sounded awful and people on the other end couldnt hear me 1 
the cast of veteran actors are more than just a nostalgia trip 1 
battery has no life 0 
so bad 0 
the last 15 minutes of movie are also not bad as well 1 
the story line is totally predictable 0 
the chicken i got was definitely reheated and was only ok the wedges were cold and soggy 0 
none of it works just dont buy it 0 
our server was super nice and checked on us many times 1 
dont waste your time here 0 
on the negative its insipid enough to cause regret for another 2 hours of life wasted in front of the screen 0 
this is an outstanding little restaurant with some of the best food i have ever tasted 1 
the dialogue is composed of things that make little sense 0 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
predictable but not a bad watch 1 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
you wont forget this movie 1 
the buttons for on and off are bad 0 
prosgood camera very nice pictures also has cool styles like black and white and more 1 
and generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode 0 
but its just not funny 0 
star trek v the final frontier is the worst in the series 0 
very very fun chef 1 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
i know this is not like the other restaurants at all something is very off here 0 
only pros large seating area nice bar area great simple drink menu the best brick oven pizza with homemade dough 1 
it was a waste of my money 0 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
headset works great was packaged nicely to avoid any damage 1 
her lines seem to have been written by a fifteen year old though they are trying oh so so hard to sound like how a fifteen year old would really um you know well talk 0 
there were too many close ups 0 
level 5 spicy was perfect where spice didnt overwhelm the soup 1 
its a total package 1 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
nonlinear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well 1 
omg the food was delicioso 1 
even if you love bad movies do not watch this movie 0 
they were excellent 1 
the service was great even the manager came and helped with our table 1 
very true to shakespear and a must for all shakespear fans 1 
and his subtle connections between the three films are awesome 1 
the cinematographyif it can be called thatsucked 0 
its pretty surprising that this wonderful film was made in 1949 as hollywood generally had its collective heads in the sand concerning black and white issues at that time 1 
it was either too cold not enough flavor or just bad 0 
an instant classic with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits 1 
ive had no trouble accessing the internet downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions 1 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
drinks took close to 30 minutes to come out at one point 0 
very disappointing 0 
the attention given to every character and complex psychological portrayals detailing loyalty treachery love and hope are tremendous 1 
a truly truly bad film 0 
whatever prompted such a documentary is beyond me 0 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
this product is clearly not ready for prime time i dont care how cool it looks if you cant tell a call is coming in its worthless 0 
this movie does an excellent job of revealing the complexity of the task and the incredible challenges facing south africa 1 
as for the mains also uninspired 0 
after charging overnight these batteries work great 1 
excellent hands free tool 1 
this does not fit the palm tungsten e2 and it broke the first time i tried to plug it in 0 
best fish ive ever had in my life 1 
but the service was beyond bad 0 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
item arrived quickly and works great with my metro pcs samsung schr450 slider phone and sony premium sound in ear plugs 1 
what this film lacks is a convincing script 0 
if she had not rolled the eyes we may have stayed not sure if we will go back and try it again 0 
i hope this place sticks around 1 
the hockey scenes are terrible defensemen playing like theyre 5 years old goalies diving at shots that are 10 feet wide of the net etc 0 
everything about this film is simply incredible 1 
has been working great 1 
bad script bad direction and horrible acting make this one plain bad 0 
and the beans and rice were mediocre at best 0 
it fits so securely that the ear hook does not even need to be used and the sound is better directed through your ear canal 1 
but whatever it was that cost them so much it didnt translate to quality thats for sure 0 
these were so good we ordered them twice 1 
i paid too much 0 
the sound quality is excellent as well 1 
poor construction 0 
avoid at all costs 0 
i like steiners because its dark and it feels like a bar 1 
bad fit way too big 0 
worthless product 0 
the directing and the cinematography arent quite as good 0 
10 out of 10 for both the movie and trilogy 1 
this is simply the best bluetooth headset for sound quality 1 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
i cant use this case because the smell is disgusting 0 
i was particularly pleased with the acting ability of dwight schultz 1 
do not waste your time 0 
your servers suck wait correction our server heimer sucked 0 
no additional ear gels provided and no instructions whatsoever 0 
it really created a unique feeling though 1 
the chains which im no fan of beat this place easily 0 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
secondly hitchcock pretty much perfected the thriller and chase movie 1 
the screen does get smudged easily because it touches your ear and face 0 
using all earpieces left or right this thing will not stay on my ear 0 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
if good intentions made a film great then this film might be one of the greatest films ever made 1 
this is a chilly unremarkable movie about an author livingworking in a chilly abstruse culture 0 
waitress was sweet and funny 1 
the acting as youd expect from this cast is top notch 1 
so bad 0 
however my girl was complain that some time the phone doesnt wake up like normal phone does 0 
this one works and was priced right 1 
this product is clearly not ready for prime time i dont care how cool it looks if you cant tell a call is coming in its worthless 0 
i totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is 1 
a great touch 1 
great it was new packaged nice works good no problems and it came in less time then i expected 1 
it sure does beat the nachos at the movies but i would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant 0 
summary the witticisms werent witty 0 
sending it back 0 
wonderful lil tapas and the ambience made me feel all warm and fuzzy inside 1 
the service was meh 0 
the story is also both funny and poignant at times 1 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
barney is definitely super de duper 1 
very comfortable 1 
this particular model would not work with my motorola q smartphone 0 
shes poised and amazing 1 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
it was pretty gross 0 
the live music on fridays totally blows 0 
dont buy this product 0 
the food was barely lukewarm so it must have been sitting waiting for the server to bring it out to us 0 
these products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet 0 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
but its just not funny 0 
by this time our side of the restaurant was almost empty so there was no excuse 0 
dont make the same mistake i did 0 
same problem as others have mentioned 0 
the volume for the ringer is real good you have choices how loud 1 
weve tried to like this place but after 10 times i think were done with them 0 
unfortunately cover girl is an example of how hollywood used to exploit women for financial gain 0 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
i can assure you that you wont be disappointed 1 
this is a simple little phone to use but the breakage is unacceptible 0 
i have only had it for a few weeks but so far so good 1 
food was really boring 0 
also the area where my unit broke im not too fond of the magnetic strap 0 
i recommend igo to anyone with different brand cell phonesmp3 players in the family 1 
it deserves strong love 1 
incredible 1 
the chips and sals a here is amazing 1 
by the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant i was bored and didnt care what happened next and so i switched off 0 
we ordered some old classics and some new dishes after going there a few times and were sorely disappointed with everything 0 
no shifting no bubbling no peeling not even a scratch nothingi couldnt be more happier with my new one for the droid 1 
the service was great even the manager came and helped with our table 1 
piece of junk 0 
for that price i can think of a few place i would have much rather gone 0 
there is no plot or storyline 0 
not good by any stretch of the imagination 0 
however bt headsets are currently not good for real time games like firstperson shooters since the audio delay messes me up 0 
the phone gets extremely hot 0 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
also the area where my unit broke im not too fond of the magnetic strap 0 
the service was great even the manager came and helped with our table 1 
all in all an excellent restaurant highlighted by great service a unique menu and a beautiful setting 1 
back to good bbq lighter fare reasonable pricing and tell the public they are back to the old ways 1 
cumbersome design 0 
with great sound effects and impressive special effects i cant recommend this movie enough 1 
its pretty surprising that this wonderful film was made in 1949 as hollywood generally had its collective heads in the sand concerning black and white issues at that time 1 
how can you call yourself a steakhouse if you cant properly cook a steak i dont understand 0 
lame would be the best way to describe it 0 
it had some average acting from the main person and it was a low budget as you clearly can see 0 
i was very excited to get this headset because i thought it was really cute 1 
i only hear garbage for audio 0 
the acting is like watching wooden puppets moving around and reading from a book thats how bad it is 0 
finally after three or four times the spring of the latch broke and i could not use it any longer on the visor 0 
this film tries to be a serious and sophisticated thrillerhorror flick and it fails miserably 0 
we ordered the duck rare and it was pink and tender on the inside with a nice char on the outside 1 
other than that the leather is nice and soft the fit is very tight the cut out for the face is a good shape 1 
the portion was huge 1 
the selection was probably the worst ive seen in vegasthere was none 0 
itll be a regular stop on my trips to phoenix 1 
bt50 battery junk 0 
it worked very well 1 
will definitely be back 1 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
never going back 0 
the scripting of the subtle comedy is unmatched by any movie in recent years 1 
bad purchase 0 
the atmosphere is modern and hip while maintaining a touch of coziness 1 
i never walked out of a movie faster 0 
the plot doesnt hang together at all and the acting is absolutely appalling 0 
nice spicy and tender 1 
i think it was robert ryans best film because he portrayed someone like my father and he was a schizophrenic in real lifemy father although he never murdered anyone but was affected more so during the second world war which made him worse 1 
do not buy if you want to use the holster 0 
i love the scream movies and all horror movies and this one ranks way up there 1 
its a great tool for entertainment communication and data managementoh be sure to use activesync 42 for optimal data synchronization results 1 
on the ground right next to our table was a large smeared beensteppedinandtrackedeverywhere pile of green bird poop 0 
i think not again 0 
its also great to see that renowned silent screenwriter frances marion hasnt missed a step going from silent to sound 1 
the phone was unusable and was not new 0 
the staff is great the food is delish and they have an incredible beer selection 1 
i would not recommend this place 0 
steve martin delivers a really funny performance of a middleaged upper class uptight white guy 1 
predictable but not a bad watch 1 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly will return next time im in vegas 1 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
its one of the movies i need to see whenever it comes on tvnever mind the fact that i already have it memorized 1 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
ive never been more insulted or felt disrespected 0 
i love being able to use one headset for both by landline and cell 1 
lame would be the best way to describe it 0 
the result is a powerhouse achievement made more timely now perhaps because of our cultures disturbing fascination with celebrity and its distorted interpretations of fame 1 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
this product is great it makes working a lot easier i can go to the copier while waiting on hold for something 1 
very good stuff for the price 1 
customer service was terrible 0 
the service was great even the manager came and helped with our table 1 
its a total package 1 
obviously they have a terrible customer service so you get what you pay for 0 
i left the theater with a lilt in my step joy in my heart and hope for the human race 1 
the movie showed a lot of florida at its best made it look very appealing 1 
i am a fan of his this movie sucked really bad 0 
audio quality is poor very poor 0 
friends pasta also bad he barely touched it 0 
i really dont see how anyone could enjoy this movie 0 
it wasnt busy at all and now we know why 0 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
it does everything the description said it would 1 
it will drive you barking mad 0 
she ordered a toasted english muffin that came out untoasted 0 
the steak and the shrimp are in my opinion the best entrees at gc 1 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
the service here is fair at best 0 
a very charming film with wonderful sentiment and heart 1 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
stopped by during the late may bank holiday off rick steve recommendation and loved it 1 
plug was the wrong size 0 
having trouble with volume 0 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
each track commands sentiment actually contributing to the scenes and characters 1 
today was my first taste of a buldogis gourmet hot dog and i have to tell you it was more than i ever thought possible 1 
the acting is beyond abysmal 0 
the ri style calamari was a joke 0 
krussel always good 1 
the story line is totally predictable 0 
really really good rice all the time 1 
echo problemvery unsatisfactory 0 
good case 1 
im glad the film didnt go for the most obvious choice as a lesser film certainly would have 1 
this place has it 1 
it plays louder than any other speaker of this size the price is so low that most would think the quality is lacking however its not 1 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
avoid at all cost 0 
the food is about on par with dennys which is to say not good at all 0 
from here on the widmark character turns unintentionally comical 0 
product is useless since it does not have enough charging current to charge the 2 cellphones i was planning to use it with 0 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
i mean this in a terrible way 0 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
the first time i ever came here i had an amazing experience i still tell people how awesome the duck was 1 
friends pasta also bad he barely touched it 0 
damian is so talented and versatile in so many ways of writing and portraying different characters on screen 1 
great time family dinner on a sunday night 1 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
not recommended 0 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
we were promptly greeted and seated 1 
10 out of 10 for both the movie and trilogy 1 
the staff are also very friendly and efficient 1 
still its quite interesting and entertaining to follow 1 
i really enjoyed eating here 1 
i must say i have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again 1 
best fish ive ever had in my life 1 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
there was hardly any meat 0 
i highly recommend this device to everyone 1 
but it picked up speed and got right to the point 1 
conclusion very filling meals 1 
the service was poor and thats being nice 0 
i was left shattered from the experience of watching this film and i took a good two hours to fully recover 0 
the servers went back and forth several times not even so much as an are you being helped 0 
low quality 0 
if you havent choked in your own vomit by the end by all the cheap drama and worthless dialogue youve must have bored yourself to death with this waste of time 0 
this place was such a nice surprise 1 
just does not work 0 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
waitress was sweet and funny 1 
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1 
insults profound deuchebaggery and had to go outside for a smoke break while serving just to solidify it 0 
excellent performance 1 
i am so pleased to know such a modern day genius is out there letting is passion for art drive him and taking us as an audience with him 1 
after all the rave reviews i couldnt wait to eat herewhat a disappointment 0 
def coming back to bowl next time 1 
battery lasts only a few hours 0 
when my order arrived one of the gyros was missing 0 
fantastic buy and will get again for whatever my next phone is 1 
you cant beat the price on these 1 
ive never been treated so bad 0 
i saw this short film on hbo the other day and absolutely loved it 1 
good food good service 1 
pretty cool i would say 1 
i cannot make calls at certain places 0 
the real disappointment was our waiter 0 
the dialogue sucked 0 
i sat riveted to the tv screen 1 
the pancake was also really good and pretty large at that 1 
after all the rave reviews i couldnt wait to eat herewhat a disappointment 0 
this particular model would not work with my motorola q smartphone 0 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
the fish is badly made and some of its underwater shots are repeated a thousand times in the film 0 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
often the dialogue doesnt really follow from one line to another or fit the surroundings 0 
the hockey scenes are terrible defensemen playing like theyre 5 years old goalies diving at shots that are 10 feet wide of the net etc 0 
great choice 1 
i rate this movie 910 1 
as a sushi lover avoid this place by all means 0 
great food and awesome service 1 
then the film just dropped the ball 0 
the flair bartenders are absolutely amazing 1 
dont buy this product 0 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
this case seems well made 1 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
plus it was wellpaced and suited its relatively short run time 1 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
this phone is pretty sturdy and ive never had any large problems with it 1 
it really is impressive that the place hasnt closed down 0 
itll be a regular stop on my trips to phoenix 1 
which is precisely why i am giving it such a bad review 0 
item does not match picture 0 
my rating just 3 out of 10 0 
really bad 0 
none of the new ones have ever quite worked properly 0 
seriously flavorful delights folks 1 
it is just the sort of pap that is screened in the afternoon to punish the unemployed for not having jobs 0 
good value great food great service 1 
the food was outstanding and the prices were very reasonable 1 
initially the local sites in the film which was filmed here in buffalo intrigued me 1 
the food amazing 1 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
in short dont bother with this movie 0 
could not get strong enough signal 0 
the pizza selections are good 1 
if it were possible to give them zero stars theyd have it 0 
well never go again 0 
as a courtroom drama its compelling as an indictment on the american justice system its frightening 1 
2 thumbs up 1 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
the owners are super friendly and the staff is courteous 1 
in an interesting part of town this place is amazing 1 
gets a signal when other verizon phones wont 1 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
the characters were all funny and had the peculiarity of not having a true lead character 1 
i would recommend purchasing the jabra jx10 series 2 which works flawlessly with my moto q go figure 1 
but now that it is out of warranty the same problems reoccurebottom line put your money somewhere else cingular will not support it 0 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
nothing short of magnificent photographycinematography in this film 1 
the cashew cream sauce was bland and the vegetables were undercooked 0 
the movie is not completely perfect but titta di girolamo will stay with you for a long time after the vision of the movie 1 
i vomited in the bathroom mid lunch 0 
i love being able to use one headset for both by landline and cell 1 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
this is a great restaurant at the mandalay bay 1 
the food is good 1 
when it opens the battery connection is broken and the device is turned off 0 
new battery works great in phone 1 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
you get what you pay for i guess 0 
razr battery good buy 1 
now the burgers arent as good the pizza which used to be amazing is doughy and flavorless 0 
avoid at all cost 0 
nice spicy and tender 1 
the acting by the whole cast could be put on a scale and balanced perfectly between overacting and underacting 0 
ray charles is legendary 1 
weve have gotten a much better service from the pizza place next door than the services we received from this restaurant 0 
it is perfect for a sitdown family meal or get together with a few friends 1 
this is probably the most irritating show i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
this film highlights the fundamental flaws of the legal process that its not about discovering guilt or innocence but rather is about who presents better in court 1 
i dont each much pasta but i love the homemade hand made pastas and thin pizzas here 1 
even the squibs look awful 0 
seriously killer hot chai latte 1 
im using it with an iriver spinn with case and it fits fine 1 
i bought this battery with a coupon from amazon and im very happy with my purchase 1 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
we ordered some old classics and some new dishes after going there a few times and were sorely disappointed with everything 0 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
seriously flavorful delights folks 1 
i purchased this and within 2 days it was no longer working 0 
worst customer service 0 
the success of the film depends on the casting of sydney greenstreet as the alexander yardley character 1 
i believe every one should see this movie as i think few people outside of south africa understand its past and what is being attempted in the truth and reconciliation process 1 
delicious and i will absolutely be back 1 
on the up side their cafe serves really good food 1 
the transfers are very good 1 
service was good and the company was better 1 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
a good film by a great director 1 
one nice thing was that they added gratuity on the bill since our party was larger than 6 or 8 and they didnt expect more tip than that 1 
they were excellent 1 
at around 4 pm i bought it at around 8pm i started to watch at around 815pm i fast forwarded the remaining film to see if there was anything left watchable for a human being with a brain but there wasnt 0 
macbeth jason connery moved me to tears with his final monolog out brief candle outhe gave the sphere of moral decay and dark forces a human face which makes it the more interesting 1 
the story is also both funny and poignant at times 1 
really pleased with this product so far 1 
small sleek impressive looking practical setup with ample storage in place 1 
on the negative its insipid enough to cause regret for another 2 hours of life wasted in front of the screen 0 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
at least think to refill my water before i struggle to wave you over for 10 minutes 0 
this phone works great 1 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
food quality has been horrible 0 
the poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying 0 
works great 1 
if you plan to use this in a car forget about it 0 
i recently tried caballeros and i have been back every week since 1 
the worst experience ever 0 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
for that price i can think of a few place i would have much rather gone 0 
the bipolarity of the ruthless thug one minute a ruthless killer the next minute a luvs diaper commercial is completely unconvincing 0 
i highly recommend this modest priced cellular phone 1 
i totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is 1 
i have tried these cables with my computer and my ipod and it works just fine 1 
hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in 0 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
the nokia ca42 usb cable did not work with my phone 0 
i purcashed this for the car charger and it does not work 0 
ps the only scene in the movie that was cool is when the central character finds her room blown up 1 
there is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again 0 
great phone 1 
there is nothing authentic about this place 0 
talk about useless customer service 0 
i probably would not go here again 0 
not even good for camp value 0 
the bus boy on the other hand was so rude 0 
during several different 2 minute calls i experienced 5 drops and it was in an area that had 5 bars 0 
this is just a great movie 1 
the first thing that happened was that the tracking was off 0 
warning stay away 0 
it was so bad i had lost the heart to finish it 0 
all of the tapas dishes were delicious 1
