after two i felt disgusting 0 
its very attractive and appears to be of good quality 1 
lots of holes in the script 0 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
the staff is always super friendly and helpful which is especially cool when you bring two small boys and a baby 1 
talk about great customer service of course we will be back 1 
after arguing with verizon regarding the dropped calls we returned the phones after two days 0 
did not like at all 0 
i was very disappointed in the movie 0 
five star plus plus 1 
excellent sound battery life and inconspicuous to boot 1 
its worth driving up from tucson 1 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
not impressed 0 
with great sound effects and impressive special effects i cant recommend this movie enough 1 
their daily specials are always a hit with my group 1 
piece of trash 0 
would not go back 0 
the poor actors 0 
i left with a stomach ache and felt sick the rest of the day 0 
really bad 0 
if you are reading this please dont go there 0 
great product for the price 1 
i do think tom hanks is a good actor 1 
if you have several dozen or several hundred contacts then imagine the fun of sending each of them one by one 0 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
bela lugosi was totally extraneous intoning odd lines 0 
tasted like dirt 0 
their onscreen chemistry critical to the entire film is genuine 1 
i really recommend this faceplates since it looks very nice elegant and cool 1 
dont waste your time watching this rubbish nonresearched film 0 
the battery life is highly unacceptable 0 
the directing and the cinematography arent quite as good 0 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
its pretty easy 1 
i always order from the vegetarian menu during dinner which has a wide array of options to choose from 1 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
a film not easily forgotten 1 
the story itself is just predictable and lazy 0 
after i pulled up my car i waited for another 15 minutes before being acknowledged 0 
the art style has the appearance of crayonpencil drawings and is wonderfully colorful and fanciful 1 
in fact im going to round up to 4 stars just because she was so awesome 1 
there still are good actors around 1 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
avoid this film at all costs 0 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
he also came back to check on us regularly excellent service 1 
i love the ringtones because they are so upbeat 1 
i was able to do voice dialing in the car with no problem 1 
the characters are interesting even if a bit predictable 1 
in other words the content level of this film is enough to easily fill a dozen other films 1 
small sleek impressive looking practical setup with ample storage in place 1 
this is the first phone ive had that has been so cheaply made 0 
to be honest with you this is unbelievable nonsense and very foolish 0 
i would give this television series a 10 plus if i could 1 
i highly recommend this modest priced cellular phone 1 
the story is lame not interesting and never really explains the sinister origins of the puppets 0 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
the film deserves strong kudos for taking this stand for having exceptional acting from its mostly lesserknown cast and for the superintelligent script that doesnt insult the audience or take the easy way out when it comes to white racism 1 
they refuse to refund or replace 0 
i would recommend purchasing the jabra jx10 series 2 which works flawlessly with my moto q go figure 1 
the price is reasonable and the service is great 1 
it is a very well acted and done tv movie 1 
for those that havent seen it dont waste your time 0 
the owners are super friendly and the staff is courteous 1 
this one works and was priced right 1 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
works great 1 
everything about it is fine and reasonable for the price ie 1 
the food was outstanding and the prices were very reasonable 1 
they were goldencrispy and delicious 1 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
problem is that the ear loops are made of weak material and break easily 0 
the film is way too long 0 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
voice recognition is tremendous 1 
he surely doesnt know how to make a coherent action movie from the screenwriter of air force one who was only obliged to write the script just for a big sum of money 0 
and his subtle connections between the three films are awesome 1 
the nano stated itmy son was dissapointed 0 
service was exceptional and food was a good as all the reviews 1 
i can take a little bad service but the food sucks 0 
unfortunately this is a bad movie that is just plain bad 0 
avoid at all costs 0 
we waited for thirty minutes to be seated although there were 8 vacant tables and we were the only folks waiting 0 
2 thumbs up to this seller 1 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
good product incredible value 1 
thank you for such great service 1 
the charger worked for about a week and then completely stopped charging my phone 0 
the explosion of the gas tanks at the end was just as awful 0 
join the club and get awesome offers via email 1 
i also decided not to send it back because our waitress looked like she was on the verge of having a heart attack 0 
as for the service im a fan because its quick and youre being served by some nice folks 1 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
theres also enough hypocrisy in this film to make me vomit 0 
the phone is sturdy and waterproof 1 
best ive found so far ive tried 2 other bluetooths and this one has the best quality for both me and the listener as well as ease of using 1 
see it 1 
you will leave the theater wanting to go out and dance under the stars 1 
cant store anything but phone numbers to sim 0 
this totally unfunny movie is so over the top and pathetic and unrealistic that throughout the whole 90 minutes of utter torture i probably looked at my watch about 70000 times 0 
sounds good reasonably priced and effective its that simple 1 
i have seen many movies starring jaclyn smith but my god this was one of her best though it came out 12 years ago 1 
very tough and very short on flavor 0 
the screen size is big key pad lit well enough and the camera quality is excellent for a camera phone 1 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
terrible my car will not accept this cassette 0 
woa talk about awful 0 
conclusion i loved it 1 
everything about it is just bad 0 
the food was terrible 0 
the potatoes were like rubber and you could tell they had been made up ahead of time being kept under a warmer 0 
the selection was probably the worst ive seen in vegasthere was none 0 
it is indescribably the most annoying and idiotic show i have ever seen 0 
aside from its terrible lead this film has loads of other debits 0 
great software for motorolas 1 
reversible plug works great 1 
there are many continuity errors one other user commented on different cars in the garage joes glassesthe one that got to me the most was the fact joes facial hair configuration seemed to change from scene to scene 0 
regardless the film fails on most levels 0 
either way it sucks 0 
i will not return 0 
cooked to perfection and the service was impeccable 1 
fantastic buy and will get again for whatever my next phone is 1 
actually the graphics were good at the time 1 
great earpiece 1 
we ordered some old classics and some new dishes after going there a few times and were sorely disappointed with everything 0 
great phone 1 
everyone is treated equally special 1 
honeslty it didnt taste that fresh 0 
much better than the other ayce sushi place i went to in vegas 1 
but it does get better reception and clarity than any phone ive had before 1 
perhaps my phone is defective but people cannot hear me when i use this 0 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
dont buy this product 0 
phone now holds charge like it did when it was new 1 
its pretty surprising that this wonderful film was made in 1949 as hollywood generally had its collective heads in the sand concerning black and white issues at that time 1 
this is a beautiful phone 1 
customer service was terrible 0 
i wasted my little money with this earpiece 0 
the presentation of the food was awful 0 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
you could only take 2 videos at a time and the quality was very poor 0 
excellent hands free tool 1 
the calls drop the phone comes on and off at will the screen goes black and the worst of all it stops ringing intermittently 0 
its just adorable seeing mickey playing turkey in the straw in a highly imaginative if occasionally cruel way 1 
definitely will come back here again 1 
great food 1 
i heart this place 1 
1 hour 54 minutes of sheer tedium melodrama and horrible acting a mess of a script and a sinking feeling of good lord what were they thinking 0 
cheap but hey it works was pleasantly suprised given the low cost of this item 1 
my gyro was basically lettuce only 0 
so good i am going to have to review this place twice once hereas a tribute to the place and once as a tribute to an event held here last night 1 
i was not impressed by this product 0 
works fine 1 
the flair bartenders are absolutely amazing 1 
after my phone got to be about a year old its been slowly breaking despite much care on my part 0 
i probably would not go here again 0 
very slow at seating even with reservation 0 
everything was perfect the night we were in 1 
first of all there are enough racial stereotypes and racial jokes to offend everyone 0 
you can even take self portraits with the outside exterior display very cool 1 
i guess i should have known that this place would suck because it is inside of the excalibur but i didnt use my common sense 0 
perfect for the ps3 1 
110 and only because there is no setting for 010 0 
its a case of so bad it is laughable 0 
also were served hot bread and butter and home made potato chips with bacon bits on topvery original and very good 1 
the delivery was on time 1 
integrated seamlessly with the motorola razr phone 1 
the warm beer didnt help 0 
this is cool because most cases are just open there allowing the screen to get all scratched up 1 
110 and only because there is no setting for 010 0 
i took back my money and got outta there 0 
im happy about this purchase good quality and low price 1 
im so sorry but i really cant recommend it to anyone 0 
i paid too much 0 
bad characters bad story and bad acting 0 
i cant believe theres even a sequel to this 0 
his use of the colours of the french flag in the three films was nothing short of incredible every shot every scene was like a work of art 1 
her lines seem to have been written by a fifteen year old though they are trying oh so so hard to sound like how a fifteen year old would really um you know well talk 0 
babie bop is very cute 1 
clear skype calls long battery life long range 1 
his performance is simply genius 1 
thanks again to amazon for having the things i need for a good price 1 
i wear glasses and it fits fine with them 1 
each day of the week they have a different deal and its all so delicious 1 
it is easy to turn on and off when you are in the car and the volume controls are quite accessable 1 
would come back again if i had a sushi craving while in vegas 1 
spend your money elsewhere 0 
first of all there are enough racial stereotypes and racial jokes to offend everyone 0 
the sound is clear and the people i talk to on it are amazed at the quality too 1 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
the only suspense i was feeling was the frustration at just how retarded the girls were 0 
we waited for thirty minutes to be seated although there were 8 vacant tables and we were the only folks waiting 0 
to my disbelief each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods i have ever tasted 0 
good works fine 1 
well packaged arrived on time and works as intended 1 
the earpiece on this is too large or too heavyit keeps falling out of my ear 0 
the only downside is the service 0 
if you check the directors filmography on this site you will see why this film didnt have a chance 0 
check it out 1 
the warmth it generates is in contrast to its austere backdrop 1 
im glad the film didnt go for the most obvious choice as a lesser film certainly would have 1 
only like 3 or 4 buildings used a couple of locations maybe poor hummh 0 
a pretty good product 1 
omelets are to die for 1 
we asked for the bill to leave without eating and they didnt bring that either 0 
the earpiece on this is too large or too heavyit keeps falling out of my ear 0 
the only possible way this movie could be redeemed would be as mst3k fodder 0 
what the hell kind of crap is that 0 
i have read others reviews here but i havent had any problem with it 1 
the design is very good4 1 
poor sound quality 0 
1010 1 
they are so easy to love but even more easy to identify with 1 
wow very spicy but delicious 1 
clever and a real crowdpleaserthis film still ranks among mickeys best films even after 80 wonderful years 1 
poor voice clarity 0 
this movie is so awesome 1 
excellent sound battery life and inconspicuous to boot 1 
the acting was decidely wooden though no worse than a period universal b movie 0 
they are so easy to love but even more easy to identify with 1 
the only thing i did like was the prime rib and dessert section 1 
i cannot believe that the actors agreed to do this film 0 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
great pizza and salads 1 
the handsfree part works fine but then the car tries to download the address book and the treo rebootsoverall i still rate this device high 1 
you could only take 2 videos at a time and the quality was very poor 0 
the management is rude 0 
but the convoluted plot just didnt convince me and much of the film was watched with a weird questioning glance 0 
so flavorful and has just the perfect amount of heat 1 
great audio 1 
this case has passed the one year mark and while it shows signs of wear it is 100 functional 1 
the food was delicious our bartender was attentive and personable and we got a great deal 1 
the ngage is still lacking in earbuds 0 
the cashier had no care what so ever on what i had to say it still ended up being wayyy overpriced 0 
the cashier had no care what so ever on what i had to say it still ended up being wayyy overpriced 0 
overall i wasnt very impressed with noca 0 
so flavorful and has just the perfect amount of heat 1 
i believe that this place is a great stop for those with a huge belly and hankering for sushi 1 
this film highlights the fundamental flaws of the legal process that its not about discovering guilt or innocence but rather is about who presents better in court 1 
the calls drop the phone comes on and off at will the screen goes black and the worst of all it stops ringing intermittently 0 
it always cuts out and makes a beep beep beep sound then says signal failed 0 
wont ever go here again 0 
i mean really how do you get so famous for your fish and chips when its so terrible 0 
it is easy to turn on and off when you are in the car and the volume controls are quite accessable 1 
this results in the phone being either stuck at max volume or mute 0 
the descriptions said yum yum sauce and another said eel sauce yet another said spicy mayowell none of the rolls had sauces on them 0 
this totally unfunny movie is so over the top and pathetic and unrealistic that throughout the whole 90 minutes of utter torture i probably looked at my watch about 70000 times 0 
this movie totally grates on my nerves 0 
i came back today since they relocated and still not impressed 0 
we walked away stuffed and happy about our first vegas buffet experience 1 
this is so embarassing and also my ears hurt if i try to push the ear plug into my ear 0 
this is an unbelievable bargain 1 
the screen size is big key pad lit well enough and the camera quality is excellent for a camera phone 1 
were jerks on the phone 0 
its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
its reception is very very poor 0 
piece of junk 0 
waitress was sweet and funny 1 
always a great time at dos gringos 1 
plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job 1 
the worst sappiest dialogue i could go on and on 0 
they were excellent 1 
the seller is very understanding and patient i would definitely buy from them again 1 
if you are reading this please dont go there 0 
dont waste your money 0 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
left very frustrated 0 
weve have gotten a much better service from the pizza place next door than the services we received from this restaurant 0 
the movie is terribly boring in places 0 
this film highlights the fundamental flaws of the legal process that its not about discovering guilt or innocence but rather is about who presents better in court 1 
he surely doesnt know how to make a coherent action movie from the screenwriter of air force one who was only obliged to write the script just for a big sum of money 0 
the atmosphere was great with a lovely duo of violinists playing songs we requested 1 
disappointing 0 
the characters were all funny and had the peculiarity of not having a true lead character 1 
a very very very slowmoving aimless movie about a distressed drifting young man 0 
talk about useless customer service 0 
excellent 1 
it was an inexpensive piece but i would still have expected better quality 0 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
really bad 0 
this is a witty and delightful adaptation of the dr seuss book brilliantly animated by upas finest and thoroughly deserving of its academy award 1 
this place is awesome if you want something light and healthy during the summer 1 
if there was ever an indication of a writer and a directors ability to meld two highly volatile temperaments into a seamless union of creativity then this is it 1 
the buttons for on and off are bad 0 
the stories were powerful explorations of the nature of man and of art 1 
i paid the bill but did not tip because i felt the server did a terrible job 0 
i am pairing this with my iphone and i could not be happier with it so far 1 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
maybe its just their vegetarian fare but ive been twice and i thought it was average at best 0 
incredible 1 
all in all im quite satisfied with this purchase 1 
some great music and terrific scenery 1 
disappointed with battery 0 
as i said abovepretty useless 0 
it was attached to a gas station and that is rarely a good sign 0 
1010 1 
so bad 0 
i would recommend saving room for this 1 
i loved it it was really scary 1 
very disappointed 0 
hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in 0 
i probably would not go here again 0 
the concert sequences just sucked 0 
the story is beyond stupid 0 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
all i have to say is the food was amazing 1 
highquality chicken on the chicken caesar salad 1 
if you want a sandwich just go to any firehouse 1 
very good food great atmosphere1 1 
this case has passed the one year mark and while it shows signs of wear it is 100 functional 1 
not only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic but it also managed to give away the entire movie and im not exaggerating every moment every plot point every joke is told in the trailer 0 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
the plot simply rumbles on like a machine desperately depending on the addition of new scenes 0 
its like a bad two hour tv movie 0 
actually the graphics were good at the time 1 
i particularly remember my senses being assaulted by strident cords of music that would blare out with very little warning and even less meaning 0 
an extensive menu provides lots of options for breakfast 1 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film 1 
all in all i think it was a good investment 1 
very pleased with this headset 1 
the sangria was about half of a glass wine full and was 12 ridiculous 0 
and the beans and rice were mediocre at best 0 
after i pulled up my car i waited for another 15 minutes before being acknowledged 0 
the movie showed a lot of florida at its best made it look very appealing 1 
the story which was told so eloquently by francis ford coppola 25 years earlier really unfolds gradually and leaves room for the characters to develop 1 
waaaaaayyyyyyyyyy over rated is all i am saying 0 
my boyfriend and i sat at the bar and had a completely delightful experience 1 
it was so cool 1 
walked in and the place smelled like an old grease trap and only 2 others there eating 0 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
its a gloriously fun fast paced and fairly accurate portrayal of the night of a raver 1 
did not like at all 0 
they keep getting better and better this is my third one and ive had numerous palms too 1 
plus its only 8 bucks 1 
i was particularly pleased with the acting ability of dwight schultz 1 
this is a chilly unremarkable movie about an author livingworking in a chilly abstruse culture 0 
never got it 0 
1010 1 
if you want a real scare rent this one 1 
great pork sandwich 1 
this movie was kind of long in length but i enjoyed every minute of it 1 
the secondary plot line is incomprehensible and its relation to the primary plot line is mystifying 0 
this was reflected not only in the cast but also in the belowpar script which borrowed much from the earlier classic 0 
i love the camera its really pretty good quality 1 
obviously they have a terrible customer service so you get what you pay for 0 
it was delicious 1 
i checked everywhere and there is no feature for it which is really disappointing 0 
all of the tapas dishes were delicious 1 
the ending is so so perfect youll shed a tear 1 
it was so bad i had lost the heart to finish it 0 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
if you want a sandwich just go to any firehouse 1 
cinematography the film was shot in an interesting way 1 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
this is definitely a cult classic well worth viewing and sharing with others 1 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
youll love it 1 
the only consistent thread holding the series together were the amazing performances of leni parker and anita laselva as the two taelons in quiet idealogical conflict 0 
it was also the right balance of war and love 1 
once you get inside youll be impressed with the place 1 
often the dialogue doesnt really follow from one line to another or fit the surroundings 0 
the instructions didnt explain that a microphone jack could be used 0 
i dont have very many words to say about this place but it does everything pretty well 1 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
very very fun chef 1 
battery is terrible 0 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
oh the charger seems to work fine 1 
it came free with a dvd player i bought but i still turned the thing off halfway through because i was embarrassed for howell 0 
so i bought about 10 of these and saved alot of money 1 
come hungry leave happy and stuffed 1 
bad reception 0 
the sound quality is good and functionality is awesome 1 
2 thumbs up to this seller 1 
would not recommend to others 0 
this second appearance of mickey mouse following the silent plane crazy earlier that year is probably his most famous filmmostly because it was so groundbreaking 1 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
this is one of the best italian thrillers of the early 70s 1 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
this is so embarassing and also my ears hurt if i try to push the ear plug into my ear 0 
integrated seamlessly with the motorola razr phone 1 
the burger i got the gold standard a 17 burger and was kind of disappointed 0 
there was so much hype over this phone that i assumed it was the best my mistake 0 
the movie has almost no action scenes in it and very little comedy 0 
steer clear of this product and go with the genuine palm replacementr pens which come in a threepack 0 
every thing on phone work perfectly she like it 1 
the mic is great 1 
i hope this place sticks around 1 
buyerbe very careful 0 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
i might have gotten a defect but i would not risk buying it again because of the built quality alone 0 
avoid this film at all costs 0 
one character is totally annoying with a voice that gives me the feeling of fingernails on a chalkboard 0 
this movie is terrible 0 
my fella got the huevos rancheros and they didnt look too appealing 0 
dont go here 0 
but in any case the best part is you can download these pictures to your laptop using ir or even send pictures from your laptop to the phone 1 
i understand that its supposed to be a cheap popcorn comedy but that doesnt mean that it has to completely insult our intelligence and have writing so incredibly hackneyed that it borders on offensive 0 
barney is definitely super de duper 1 
it felt too light and tinny 0 
waiter was a jerk 0 
we waited an hour for what was a breakfast i could have done 100 times better at home 0 
it has a great camera thats 2mp and the pics are nice and clear with great picture quality 1 
both of them were truly unbelievably good and i am so glad we went back 1 
nicest chinese restaurant ive been in a while 1 
i find this inexcusable and so will probably be returning this phone and perhaps changing carriers 0 
the pizza tasted old super chewy in not a good way 0 
avoid this film at all costs 0 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
it has northern humour and positive about the community it represents 1 
the scripting of the subtle comedy is unmatched by any movie in recent years 1 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
painful on the ear 0 
the performances are not improved by improvisation because the actors now have twice as much to worry about not only whether theyre delivering the line well but whether the line itself is any good 0 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
both do good jobs and are quite amusing 1 
when achille and philippa beautifully sing a duet from don giovanni that perfectly describes their situation in the movie you appreciate the subtle layers of this excellent film 1 
using all earpieces left or right this thing will not stay on my ear 0 
buttons are too small 0 
very disappointed in accessoryone 0 
i know that sounds funny but to me it seemed like sketchy technology that wouldnt work wellwell this one works great 1 
your servers suck wait correction our server heimer sucked 0 
i had the chicken pho and it tasted very bland 0 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
every thing on phone work perfectly she like it 1 
the use of slowmotion needlessly repeats itself throughout the movie but is well backed up by bad acting and bad is a kind word here no continuity scenes that are thrown in for no reason whatsoever vehicles that looked like they were made from a corn flakes box and a directorial style that bordered on stupidity 0 
that company is a joke 0 
food was delicious 1 
just spicy enough perfect actually 1 
very convenient since we were staying at the mgm 1 
i was shocked because no signs indicate cash only 0 
works good 1 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
the design is very good4 1 
excellent starter wireless headset 0 
the selection was probably the worst ive seen in vegasthere was none 0 
will never ever go back 0 
they have a plethora of salads and sandwiches and everything ive tried gets my seal of approval 1 
it really created a unique feeling though 1 
the new characters werent all that memorable and i found myself forgetting who was who 0 
then scene where they debated whether or not to sack the trumpeter who falsely was accused for the murder is pure horror really stupid 0 
i found this move beautiful enjoyable and uplifting 1 
the ambiance isnt much better 0 
my fiancé and i came in the middle of the day and we were greeted and seated right away 1 
this game rocks 1 
i had about two bites and refused to eat anymore 0 
enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film 1 
the waiter wasnt helpful or friendly and rarely checked on us 0 
the battery runs down quickly 0 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
the delivery was on time 1 
the story which was told so eloquently by francis ford coppola 25 years earlier really unfolds gradually and leaves room for the characters to develop 1 
these are fabulous 1 
i just cant explain this movie more than romanticcharminghilariousand adorablethe junkyard scenes are funnyall the junkyard dogs have something specialtoo funny i laughedkids will love itbuy it when it comes outit has new features 1 
ive never been treated so bad 0 
what a waste of time 0 
his performance is simply genius 1 
the accompanied software is almost brilliant 1 
item does not match picture 0 
when my mom and i got home she immediately got sick and she only had a few bites of salad 0 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
the salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop which was perfectly cooked 1 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
also the story and acting were weak 0 
first off the reception sucks i have never had more than 2 bars ever 0 
it is simple to use and i like it 1 
wasted two hours 0 
we wont be going back 0 
this mostly routine factbased tv drama gets a boost from the fine performance by cole 1 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
obviously they have a terrible customer service so you get what you pay for 0 
this is truly an art movieit actually has a lot of art in it 1 
weve have gotten a much better service from the pizza place next door than the services we received from this restaurant 0 
everything on the menu is terrific and we were also thrilled that they made amazing accommodations for our vegetarian daughter 1 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
which are small and not worth the price 0 
dont waste your time here 0 
appears to actually outperform the original battery from china that came with my v325i 1 
who in their right mind is gonna buy this battery 0 
its a fresh subtle and rather sublime effect 1 
the seller is very understanding and patient i would definitely buy from them again 1 
well just if you keep thinking how bad it is 0 
this is so embarassing and also my ears hurt if i try to push the ear plug into my ear 0 
not much seafood and like 5 strings of pasta at the bottom 0 
i find wasting food to be despicable but this just wasnt food 0 
the speaker is of low quality so as making the ring tones sound very cheap 0 
ambience is perfect 1 
ill definitely be in soon again 1 
i would highly recommend this product 1 
what should have been a hilarious yummy christmas eve dinner to remember was the biggest fail of the entire trip for us 0 
bought mainly for the charger which broke soon after purchasing 0 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
my salad had a bland vinegrette on the baby greens and hearts of palm 0 
were jerks on the phone 0 
stay away from this store be careful 0 
i cant believe theres even a sequel to this 0 
my brother in law who works at the mall ate here same day and guess what he was sick all night too 0 
i cant see how this movie can be an inspiration to anyone to come out or overcome fear and rejection 0 
on the ground right next to our table was a large smeared beensteppedinandtrackedeverywhere pile of green bird poop 0 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
i mean really how do you get so famous for your fish and chips when its so terrible 0 
the company shipped my product very promptly and it works well 1 
i ended up sliding it on the edge of my pants or back pockets instead 1 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
happy so far 1 
i seriously cannot believe that the owner has so many unexperienced employees that all are running around like chickens with their heads cut off 0 
my salad had a bland vinegrette on the baby greens and hearts of palm 0 
the loudspeaker option is great the bumpers with the lights is very appealing 0 
i got to enjoy the seafood salad with a fabulous vinegrette 1 
she carries the movie well 1 
too bad cause i know its family owned i really wanted to like this place 0 
i recommend igo to anyone with different brand cell phonesmp3 players in the family 1 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
you wont be disappointed 1 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
there is simply no excuse for something this poorly done 0 
this is an outstanding little restaurant with some of the best food i have ever tasted 1 
i have to mention this and it is a huge spoiler i loved the ending how all the characters of the three films were the remaining survivors of the ferry disaster with valentine and the young judge together and the old man watching it on her tv solidifying his happiness over the suffering which he dealt with for those many years 1 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
tonight i had the elk filet specialand it sucked 0 
when i saw it in the theater i thought i was going to be sick 0 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
not a pleasant voyage of selfdiscovery 0 
regrettably the film fails 0 
the worst piece of crap ever along with the verizon customer service 0 
the movie was so boring that i sometimes found myself occupied peaking in the paper instead of watching never happened during a columbo movie before 0 
lousy product 0 
nothing at all to recommend 0 
the chips that came out were dripping with grease and mostly not edible 0 
we got sitting fairly fast but ended up waiting 40 minutes just to place our order another 30 minutes before the food arrived 0 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
great pork sandwich 1 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
a pretty good product 1 
plantronics bluetooth excelent buy 1 
this is truly an art movieit actually has a lot of art in it 1 
the servers are not pleasant to deal with and they dont always honor pizza hut coupons 0 
the film is way too long 0 
the loudspeaker option is great the bumpers with the lights is very appealing 0 
everyone is treated equally special 1 
battery is holding up well 1 
the only suspense i was feeling was the frustration at just how retarded the girls were 0 
not much flavor to them and very poorly constructed 0 
of all the dishes the salmon was the best but all were great 1 
so bad 0 
this is a great product sure beats using your fingers 1 
i must say i have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again 1 
but it wasnt until i watched this film that i realised how great he actually was 1 
fast service 1 
i have never had such bland food which surprised me considering the article we read focused so much on their spices and flavor 0 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
but when someone strives for greatness and poetry but delivers a muddled and often ridiculous story a bunch of disparate scenes pretentious dialogue then you get the worst kind of a movie that some other reviewer very accurately defined as pretentious crap 0 
your brain will attempt to shutdown as part of a primal impulse of selfpreservation 0 
the service was meh 0 
piece of junk 0 
i wasnt expecting oscar material but this 0 
will definitely be back 1 
ive seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie 0 
the football scenes at the end were perplexing 0 
terrible phone holder 0 
not a pleasant voyage of selfdiscovery 0 
it shouldnt take 30 min for pancakes and eggs 0 
great phone 1 
a must study for anyone interested in the worst sins of industrial design 0 
the holster that arrived did not match the photo in the ad 0 
the bus boy on the other hand was so rude 0 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
tonight i had the elk filet specialand it sucked 0 
and i just love the colors 1 
the design might be ergonomic in theory but i could not stand having these in my ear 0 
i think this restaurant suffers from not trying hard enough 0 
cooked to perfection and the service was impeccable 1 
you can even take self portraits with the outside exterior display very cool 1 
the use of slowmotion needlessly repeats itself throughout the movie but is well backed up by bad acting and bad is a kind word here no continuity scenes that are thrown in for no reason whatsoever vehicles that looked like they were made from a corn flakes box and a directorial style that bordered on stupidity 0 
avoid at all costs 0 
fast service 1 
it was packed 0 
all in all im quite satisfied with this purchase 1 
i have bought this nokia cell phone a few weeks ago and it was a nightmare 0 
i got it because it was so small and adorable 1 
spoilers whatever else can or cant be said about it surface is superbly crafted 1 
everything was gross 0 
a pretty good product 1 
the croutons also taste homemade which is an extra plus 1 
all the bread is made inhouse 1 
i recommend igo to anyone with different brand cell phonesmp3 players in the family 1 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
pretty piece of junk 0 
im surprised this is a good quality car charger and theres not much reviews about it 1 
the only suspense i was feeling was the frustration at just how retarded the girls were 0 
the design is very odd as the ear clip is not very comfortable at all 0 
its a piece of crap 0 
i am pairing this with my iphone and i could not be happier with it so far 1 
if you simply want a small flip phone look elsewhere as the extra bells whistles are mediocre 0 
it even has its sweet moments 1 
an awesome new look for fall 2000 1 
not good for the money 0 
rating 1 out of 10 0 
the plot is nonsense that doesnt interest in the slightest way or have any uniqueness to it 0 
an absolute must visit 1 
i dont think there are any redeeming qualities in this remake 0 
great software for motorolas 1 
my drink was never empty and he made some really great menu suggestions 1 
from what my dinner companions told meeverything was very fresh with nice texture and taste 1 
it crackles with an unpredictable youthful energy but honestly i found it hard to follow and concentrate on it meanders so badly 0 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
the waitress was friendly and happy to accomodate for veganveggie options 1 
yes its shiny on front side and i love it 1 
i dont each much pasta but i love the homemade hand made pastas and thin pizzas here 1 
i can assure you that you wont be disappointed 1 
bad choice 0 
this place is overpriced not consistent with their boba and it really is overpriced 0 
excellent hands free tool 1 
if you want a real scare rent this one 1 
how this piece of trash was ever released is beyond me the acting the story the characters the supposedly special effects etcits all wrong 0 
last night was my second time dining here and i was so happy i decided to go back 1 
i live in the neighborhood so i am disappointed i wont be back here because it is a convenient location 0 
the nachos are a must have 1 
there were too many close ups 0 
i think not again 0 
gets a signal when other verizon phones wont 1 
our server was very nice and even though he looked a little overwhelmed with all of our needs he stayed professional and friendly until the end 1 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
awesome service and food 1 
it was quite comfortable in the ear 1 
im probably one of the few people to ever go to ians and not like it 0 
total brunch fail 0 
also difficult to put onid recommend avoiding this product 0 
the croutons also taste homemade which is an extra plus 1 
nice blanket of moz over top but i feel like this was done to cover up the subpar food 1 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
i think this restaurant suffers from not trying hard enough 0 
muddy low quality sound and the casing around the wires insert was poorly super glued and slid off 0 
long whiny and pointless 0 
their onscreen chemistry critical to the entire film is genuine 1 
my sister has one also and she loves it 1 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
it was so bad i had lost the heart to finish it 0 
i had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get some relief 0 
my only problem is i thought the actor playing the villain was a low rent michael ironside 0 
the black eyed peas and sweet potatoes unreal 1 
paolo sorrentino has written a wonderful story about loneliness and tony has built one of the most unforgettable characters seen in movies in recent years 1 
i have had this phone for over a year now and i will tell you its not that great 0 
its a great tool for entertainment communication and data managementoh be sure to use activesync 42 for optimal data synchronization results 1
