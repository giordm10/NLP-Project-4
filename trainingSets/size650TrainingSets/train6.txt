the only downside is the service 0 
by this time our side of the restaurant was almost empty so there was no excuse 0 
jamie foxx absolutely is ray charles 1 
bought mainly for the charger which broke soon after purchasing 0 
yeah the movie pretty much sucked 0 
setup couldnt have been simpler 1 
that said our mouths and bellies were still quite pleased 1 
this is not moviemaking 0 
earbud piece breaks easily 0 
their regular toasted bread was equally satisfying with the occasional pats of butter mmmm 1 
but it picked up speed and got right to the point 1 
this is an unbelievable bargain 1 
the food was terrible 0 
victor mclaglen was even bad and brian donlevy was almost unrecognizable 0 
i really enjoyed eating here 1 
we enjoy their pizza and brunch 1 
low quality 0 
all in all id expected a better consumer experience from motorola 0 
nice case feels good in your hands 1 
lots of holes in the script 0 
i consider this theft 0 
it features an outlandish array of memorable psychotic but lovable nuts 1 
the fish is badly made and some of its underwater shots are repeated a thousand times in the film 0 
i will not be eating there again 0 
i was totally fascinated by the music the dancing everything 1 
after 20 minutes wait i got a table 0 
i heart this place 1 
my only complaint is the standard sound volume is a little low even when turned up to 5of 5 0 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
nice design and quality 1 
their frozen margaritas are way too sugary for my taste 0 
after all the rave reviews i couldnt wait to eat herewhat a disappointment 0 
if you check the directors filmography on this site you will see why this film didnt have a chance 0 
the bipolarity of the ruthless thug one minute a ruthless killer the next minute a luvs diaper commercial is completely unconvincing 0 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
lasted one day and then blew up 0 
the service was great even the manager came and helped with our table 1 
its the best headset i have used 1 
trouble is the writing and directing make it impossible to establish those things that make a movie watchable like character story theme and so on 0 
go watch it 1 
finally after three or four times the spring of the latch broke and i could not use it any longer on the visor 0 
worked very well paired with a treo 700w and as a skype headset on my pc using a usb bluetooth transceiver 1 
if there was ever a movie that needed wordofmouth to promote this is it 1 
the pleather case doesnt fit 0 
the handsfree part works fine but then the car tries to download the address book and the treo rebootsoverall i still rate this device high 1 
one of the best mexican movies ever and one of the less understood even by mexican themselves no matter how identified the should have felt with it 1 
10 out of 10 for both the movie and trilogy 1 
well im satisfied 1 
the handsfree part works fine but then the car tries to download the address book and the treo rebootsoverall i still rate this device high 1 
the lighting is awful 0 
its really easy 1 
the chefs were friendly and did a good job 1 
before i go in to why i gave a 1 star rating please know that this was my third time eating at bachi burger before writing a review 0 
this film has no redeeming features 0 
if that bug never showed up i would have given a 4 for sure but on the other side of the wall where this bug was climbing was the kitchen 0 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
this is a great little item 1 
i can assure you that you wont be disappointed 1 
we received a white colored battery that goes dead after a couple hoursthe original used to last a week but still lasts longer than thereplacement 0 
i cant believe theres even a sequel to this 0 
i have to mention this and it is a huge spoiler i loved the ending how all the characters of the three films were the remaining survivors of the ferry disaster with valentine and the young judge together and the old man watching it on her tv solidifying his happiness over the suffering which he dealt with for those many years 1 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
unfortunately cover girl is an example of how hollywood used to exploit women for financial gain 0 
the awful dialogue and hopeless overacting by everyone who gets shot top off a real waste of space and time 0 
an hour seriously 0 
the service was great even the manager came and helped with our table 1 
go and see it 1 
makes it easier to keep up with my bluetooth when im not wearing it 0 
both of the egg rolls were fantastic 1 
finally after three or four times the spring of the latch broke and i could not use it any longer on the visor 0 
he also came back to check on us regularly excellent service 1 
first time there and might just be the last 0 
a pretty good product 1 
the owner used to work at nobu so this place is really similar for half the price 1 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
the story which was told so eloquently by francis ford coppola 25 years earlier really unfolds gradually and leaves room for the characters to develop 1 
i wasnt expecting oscar material but this 0 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
good servicecheck 1 
its a case of so bad it is laughable 0 
lovely little thriller from hitchcock with lots of nice shenanigans surrounding a murdered spy a kidnapped child a nasty church a foreign plot and some random taxidermists 1 
they have a really nice atmosphere 1 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
the only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive 1 
nonlinear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well 1 
nobody identifies with these characters because theyre all cardboard cutouts and stereotypes or predictably reversestereotypes 0 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
in an interesting part of town this place is amazing 1 
the ripped banana was not only ripped but petrified and tasteless 0 
the characters are fleshed out surprisingly well particularly grimes and blake and all the actors deliver their sharply scripted lines with just the right amount of deadpan tongue in cheek to make the dialogue both hilarious and realistic 1 
you have to hold the phone at a particular angle for the other party to hear you clearly 0 
i was disgusted because i was pretty sure that was human hair 0 
the battery works great 1 
the only good thing was our waiter he was very helpful and kept the bloddy marys coming 1 
if you love authentic mexican food and want a whole bunch of interesting yet delicious meats to choose from you need to try this place 1 
as for the mains also uninspired 0 
nice quality build unlike some cheap s out there 1 
horrible horrible protector 0 
the food was outstanding and the prices were very reasonable 1 
today was my first taste of a buldogis gourmet hot dog and i have to tell you it was more than i ever thought possible 1 
what i really like there is the crepe station 1 
keep up the good work amazon 1 
dont buy this product it fails 0 
a good time 1 
i left with a stomach ache and felt sick the rest of the day 0 
not worth it 0 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
the characters were all funny and had the peculiarity of not having a true lead character 1 
its kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly its embarrassing how childlike the company is 0 
the best place in vegas for breakfast just check out a sat or sun 1 
it felt like a very gripping intelligent stage play but without the overly theatrical feeling one actually gets from watching people on a stage which plays on everyones terror of a white lie escalating to monstrous consequences 1 
excellent product 1 
a pretty good product 1 
for that its worth checking out 1 
i probably would not go here again 0 
spoilers whatever else can or cant be said about it surface is superbly crafted 1 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
i probably wont be coming back here 0 
utterly without merit on any level this is akin to torture 0 
this is probably the most irritating show i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
trumbull on i love lucy 1 
the only thing really worth watching was the scenery and the house because it is beautiful 1 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
the food is rich so order accordingly 1 
even allowing for poor production values for the time 1971 and the format some kind of miniseries this is baaaaaad 0 
kris kristoffersen is good in this movie and really makes a difference 1 
i was amazed at the quick arrival of the two original lg cell phone batteries and and at a fraction of the price 1 
everything from acting to cinematography was solid 1 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
i rate this movie 910 1 
the price was very good and with the free shipping and all it was a good purchase 1 
the least said about the acting the better 0 
battery life is real good 1 
to those who find this movie intelligent or even masterful i can only say its your intelligence and your imagination you obviously used to try and make some sense of this pitiful attempt its in our human nature to try and make sense of things 0 
i love all the features and form factor 1 
2 thumbs up 1 
not even a hello we will be right with you 0 
waitress was sweet and funny 1 
how awesome is that 1 
i was not happy with this item 0 
at any rate this film stinks its not funny and fulci should have stayed with giallo and supernatural zombie movies 0 
i cant use this case because the smell is disgusting 0 
these products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet 0 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
horrible had to switch 3 times 0 
if the food isnt bad enough for you then enjoy dealing with the worlds worstannoying drunk people 0 
logitech bluetooth headset is a 10 1 
terrible phone holder 0 
the jabra eargels fit my ears very well 1 
truly awful 0 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
i was totally fascinated by the music the dancing everything 1 
no shifting no bubbling no peeling not even a scratch nothingi couldnt be more happier with my new one for the droid 1 
none of them are engaging or exciting 0 
bad script bad direction and horrible acting make this one plain bad 0 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
this allows the possibility of double booking for the same date and time after the first 0 
highly unrecommended 0 
great phone 1 
the only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port irda 0 
item arrived quickly and works great with my metro pcs samsung schr450 slider phone and sony premium sound in ear plugs 1 
this place lacked style 0 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
overall a great experience 1 
good food good service 1 
the folks at otto always make us feel so welcome and special 1 
battery life is real good 1 
very good stuff for the price 1 
verizon tech support walked my through a few procedures none of which worked and i ended up having to do a hard reset wiping out all my data 0 
overall a delight 1 
price is good too 1 
its very slow 0 
avoid this film at all costs 0 
good beer drink selection and good food selection 1 
i never come again 0 
it was a pale color instead of nice and char and has no flavor 0 
if you hate earbugs avoid this phone by all means 0 
nice case feels good in your hands 1 
i like steiners because its dark and it feels like a bar 1 
oh and i forgot to also mention the weird color effect it has on your phone 0 
the hockey scenes are terrible defensemen playing like theyre 5 years old goalies diving at shots that are 10 feet wide of the net etc 0 
level 5 spicy was perfect where spice didnt overwhelm the soup 1 
meredith m was better than all right 1 
it was a great phone 1 
i am far from a sushi connoisseur but i can definitely tell the difference between good food and bad food and this was certainly bad food 0 
what possesed me to get this junk i have no idea 0 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
the story starts too fast with absolutely no suspense or buildup in the slightest 0 
pretty good beer selection too 1 
the movie is full of wonderful dancing hence the title 1 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
really awful 0 
the pairing of the two devices was so easy it barely took a couple minutes before i started making calls with the voice dialing feature 1 
buyer beware you could flush money right down the toilet 0 
service was very prompt 1 
item arrived quickly and works great with my metro pcs samsung schr450 slider phone and sony premium sound in ear plugs 1 
i own a jabra earset and was very happy with it but the sound quality especially outgoing on this is better 1 
secondly hitchcock pretty much perfected the thriller and chase movie 1 
so for our enjoyment we get to see them run around play games and be dangerous 1 
very disappointed 0 
the service was great even the manager came and helped with our table 1 
dont bother coming here 0 
omg i felt like i had never eaten thai food until this dish 1 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
then i watched it again two sundays ago march 20th 2005 and i began to really enjoy it and this time i taped the entire thing 1 
i believe that pitch black was done well 1 
any ring toneoverall good phone to buy 1 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
works fine 1 
it is not good 0 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
does not work for listening to music with the cingular 8125 0 
and generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode 0 
amazon sucks 0 
the performances are not improved by improvisation because the actors now have twice as much to worry about not only whether theyre delivering the line well but whether the line itself is any good 0 
it even has its sweet moments 1 
its a sad movie but very good 1 
the acting as youd expect from this cast is top notch 1 
my headset works just peachykeen 1 
this place is overpriced not consistent with their boba and it really is overpriced 0 
i started this review with two stars but im editing it to give it only one 0 
yes i am simplifying things here for the sake of brevity for this really is at the core of the problems with this film it has too much going on without any real fulfilling explanation 0 
the entire audience applauded at the conclusion of the film 1 
lewis blacks considerable talent is wasted here too as he is at his most incendiary when he is unrestrained which the pg13 rating certainly wont allow 0 
excellent sound quality 1 
doesnt hold charge 0 
very displeased 0 
the camera really likes her in this movie 1 
unreliable im giving up 0 
i am a fan of his this movie sucked really bad 0 
the staff is great the food is delish and they have an incredible beer selection 1 
the food sucked which we expected but it sucked more than we could have imagined 0 
very good food great atmosphere1 1 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
i dont recommend unless your car breaks down in front of it and you are starving 0 
however bt headsets are currently not good for real time games like firstperson shooters since the audio delay messes me up 0 
good protection and does not make phone too bulky 1 
someone shouldve invented this sooner 1 
this battery is an excellent bargain 1 
having to humour him just to get by and get through the day was so apt 1 
end of days is one of the worst bigbudget action movies ive ever seen 0 
the voice recognition thru the handset is excellent 1 
i have seen many movies starring jaclyn smith but my god this was one of her best though it came out 12 years ago 1 
this is so embarassing and also my ears hurt if i try to push the ear plug into my ear 0 
conclusion i loved it 1 
each day of the week they have a different deal and its all so delicious 1 
the building itself seems pretty neat the bathroom is pretty trippy but i wouldnt eat here again 0 
the movie had you on the edge of your seat and made you somewhat afraid to go to your car at the end of the night 1 
the cast of veteran actors are more than just a nostalgia trip 1 
judith light is one of my favorite actresses and i think she does a superb job in this film 1 
i received my supposedly new motorola 375 and apparently there was not a match between the phone and the charger 0 
i bought this phone as a replacement for my startac and have regretted it since 0 
i ordered the voodoo pasta and it was the first time id had really excellent pasta since going gluten free several years ago 1 
you wont be disappointed 1 
the jalapeno bacon is soooo good 1 
what should have been a hilarious yummy christmas eve dinner to remember was the biggest fail of the entire trip for us 0 
i had the chicken pho and it tasted very bland 0 
join the club and get awesome offers via email 1 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
amazon sucks 0 
the first thing that happened was that the tracking was off 0 
the vanilla ice cream was creamy and smooth while the profiterole choux pastry was fresh enough 1 
the acting is like watching wooden puppets moving around and reading from a book thats how bad it is 0 
dont waste your money 0 
i loved it 1 
last night was my second time dining here and i was so happy i decided to go back 1 
i really like this product over the motorola because it is allot clearer on the ear piece and the mic 1 
and service was super friendly 1 
so for our enjoyment we get to see them run around play games and be dangerous 1 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
the food was delicious our bartender was attentive and personable and we got a great deal 1 
one of my favorite purchases ever 1 
its not hard to make a decent hamburger 0 
after the first charge kept going dead after 12 minutes 0 
the movie is littered with overt racial slurs towards the black cast members and in return the whites are depicted as morons and boobs 0 
hackneyed writing certainly but made even worse by the bad directing 0 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
someone shouldve invented this sooner 1 
i still maintain that monkeys shouldnt make headphones we just obviously dont share enough dna to copy the design over to humans 0 
i am very happy 1 
about 30 minutes of footage is wasted to show mediocre elderly actors awkwardly babbling overwrought pseudosatanic gibberish corny enough to make a teen goth blush almost always in olde english and sometimes in latin that may or may not be made up words 0 
the price was very good and with the free shipping and all it was a good purchase 1 
from what my dinner companions told meeverything was very fresh with nice texture and taste 1 
i was very pleased to see that i could replace my well travled swivel holster for my blackberry flip 1 
blue ant is easy to use 1 
ordered burger rare came in well done 0 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
we wont be returning 0 
this movie is bad 0 
not even good for camp value 0 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
finally after three or four times the spring of the latch broke and i could not use it any longer on the visor 0 
very good quality though 1 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
there is nothing authentic about this place 0 
cant upload ringtones from a third party 0 
i bought this battery with a coupon from amazon and im very happy with my purchase 1 
the vanilla ice cream was creamy and smooth while the profiterole choux pastry was fresh enough 1 
phone is sturdy as all nokia bar phones are 1 
the live music on fridays totally blows 0 
this is a great place to eat 1 
i enjoyed reading this book to my children when they were little 1 
i have yet to run this new battery below two bars and thats three days without charging 1 
dont waste your time watching this rubbish nonresearched film 0 
this place has it 1 
now this dish was quite flavourful 1 
audio quality is poor very poor 0 
it is a really good show to watch 1 
often the dialogue doesnt really follow from one line to another or fit the surroundings 0 
their rotating beers on tap is also a highlight of this place 1 
nice quality build unlike some cheap s out there 1 
very displeased 0 
the potato chip order was sad i could probably count how many chips were in that box and it was probably around 12 0 
this one works and was priced right 1 
camera color balance is awful 0 
however bt headsets are currently not good for real time games like firstperson shooters since the audio delay messes me up 0 
pretty awesome place 1 
but other than that the movie seemed to drag and the heroes didnt really work for their freedom 0 
i dont each much pasta but i love the homemade hand made pastas and thin pizzas here 1 
the result is a powerhouse achievement made more timely now perhaps because of our cultures disturbing fascination with celebrity and its distorted interpretations of fame 1 
i would have casted her in that role after ready the script 1 
im still infatuated with this phone 1 
ive owned this phone for 7 months now and can say that its the best mobile phone ive had 1 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
howeverthe riingtones are not the best and neither are the games 0 
the script is horrendously stupid 0 
does everything it should and more 1 
a piece of junk that broke after being on my phone for 2 days 0 
its a piece of crap 0 
he was very impressed when going from the original battery to the extended battery 1 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
buyer beware you could flush money right down the toilet 0 
i loved it 1 
items stated as included from the description are not included 0 
judith light is one of my favorite actresses and i think she does a superb job in this film 1 
this movie is so awesome 1 
alexander nevsky is a great film 1 
the inside is really quite nice and very clean 1 
i just saw this film and i recommend it 1 
definitely will come back here again 1 
a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it 1 
the owner used to work at nobu so this place is really similar for half the price 1 
service was good and the company was better 1 
the first time i ever came here i had an amazing experience i still tell people how awesome the duck was 1 
go rent it 1 
nargile i think you are great 1 
kind of flops around 0 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
waaaaaayyyyyyyyyy over rated is all i am saying 0 
not good enough for the price 0 
not enough volume 0 
it has a very good plot it holds your complete attention the acting is superb tom wilkinson was fantastic and emily watson was also very good 1 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
would not go back 0 
the salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop which was perfectly cooked 1 
unfortunately inexperience of direction meant that scene after scene passed with little in the way of dramatic tension or conflict 0 
it was so bad i had lost the heart to finish it 0 
i had the chicken pho and it tasted very bland 0 
ive seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie 0 
some great music and terrific scenery 1 
this place is like chipotle but better 1 
generally it just lacked imagination 0 
mediocre food 0 
the films dialogue is natural real to life 1 
att is not clear sound is very distorted and you have to yell when you talk 0 
interesting decor 1 
we got sitting fairly fast but ended up waiting 40 minutes just to place our order another 30 minutes before the food arrived 0 
your brain will attempt to shutdown as part of a primal impulse of selfpreservation 0 
warning do not buy 0 
the death row scenes were entirely unmoving 0 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
that said our mouths and bellies were still quite pleased 1 
i ordered albondigas soup which was just warm and tasted like tomato soup with frozen meatballs 0 
i would give this television series a 10 plus if i could 1 
the poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying 0 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
avoid this film at all costs 0 
the jerky camera movements were also annoying 0 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
the movie lacks visual interest drama expression of feeling and celebration of the very patriotism that underlines the narrative 0 
comfortable fit you need your headset to be comfortable for at least an hour at a time if not for an entire day 1 
i have had tmobile service for 2 or 3 years now and i am pretty happy with it 1 
everything captain howdy says is either laughable or just plain stupid 0 
both great 1 
all the characters in this film are tremendously well played 1 
if good intentions made a film great then this film might be one of the greatest films ever made 1 
bought mainly for the charger which broke soon after purchasing 0 
i had ordered a motorola data cable got a very well finished and working product 1 
poor quality 0 
battery chargelife is quite long 1 
to my disbelief each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods i have ever tasted 0 
but its just not funny 0 
do not purchase this phone 0 
do not waste your time 0 
other than that the leather is nice and soft the fit is very tight the cut out for the face is a good shape 1 
clear skype calls long battery life long range 1 
nine out of ten for a truly lovely film 1 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
if you want healthy authentic or ethic food try this place 1 
she carries the movie well 1 
none of them are engaging or exciting 0 
my salad had a bland vinegrette on the baby greens and hearts of palm 0 
it will drive you barking mad 0 
really really good rice all the time 1 
ive had this bluetoooth headset for some time now and still not comfortable with the way it fits on the ear 0 
the service was meh 0 
i would recommend it 1 
everything about this product is wrongfirst 0 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
worked very well paired with a treo 700w and as a skype headset on my pc using a usb bluetooth transceiver 1 
nice sound 1 
coming here is like experiencing an underwhelming relationship where both parties cant wait for the other person to ask to break up 0 
it is simple to use and i like it 1 
and i really did find them funny 1 
the acting helps the writing along very well maybe the idiotsavant sister could have been played better and it is a real joy to watch 1 
i was very disappointed 0 
i dont think there are any redeeming qualities in this remake 0 
i would not recommend this place 0 
just dont know why they were so slow 0 
also notable is john baileys fine crisp beautifully colored cinematography and the great production design costumes by eiko ishioka who went on to do the memorable costumes for coppolas dracula for which she received a well deserved oscar 1 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
this place is disgusting 0 
the turkey and roast beef were bland 0 
this movie creates its own universe and is fascinating in every way 1 
i love this bluetooth 1 
this place deserves no stars 0 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
probably never coming back and wouldnt recommend it 0 
not as good as i had hoped 0 
the folks at otto always make us feel so welcome and special 1 
case was more or less an extra that i originally put on but later discarded because it scratched my ear 0 
great bluetooth 1 
i love this bluetooth 1 
this film offers many delights and surprises 1 
you get extra minutes so that you can carry out the call and not get cut off 1 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
i had heard good things about this place but it exceeding every hope i could have dreamed of 1 
horrible phone 0 
at no point in the proceedings does it look remotely like america 0 
all i have to say is the food was amazing 1 
hands down my favorite italian restaurant 1 
im glad i found this product on amazon it is hard to find it wasnt high priced 1 
avoid at any and all costs 0 
down the drain because of a weak snap 0 
poor reliability 0 
i had a salad with the wings and some ice cream for dessert and left feeling quite satisfied 1 
it is zillion times away from reality 0 
i will never forget it now 1 
works great 1 
the worst one of the series 0 
we wont be returning 0 
pricing is a bit of a concern at mellow mushroom 0 
couldnt use the unit with sunglasses not good in texas 0 
the cinematographyif it can be called thatsucked 0 
everything captain howdy says is either laughable or just plain stupid 0 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
very very fun chef 1 
im still infatuated with this phone 1 
ive had no trouble accessing the internet downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions 1 
ill put this gem up against any movie in terms of screenplay cinematography acting postproduction editing directing or any other aspect of filmmaking 1 
design flaw 0 
the owners really really need to quit being soooooo cheap let them wrap my freaking sandwich in two papers not one 0 
despite the pans of reviewers i liked this movie 1 
this phone tries very hard to do everything but fails at its very ability to be a phone 0 
the reception has been generally good 1 
does everything it should and more 1 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
the yellowtail carpaccio was melt in your mouth fresh 1 
first the bathrooms at this location were dirty seat covers were not replenished just plain yucky 0 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
i am not a filmmaker nor am i a director but i would hide my head in the sand if id spent whatever amount of money and time on this movie 0 
think it over when you plan to own this onethis sure is the last moto phone for me 0 
could not get strong enough signal 0 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
i do not know if this was emilio estevezs directorial debut but the pacing the interplay and development of the characters as well as some clever camera work surrounding the character estevez plays all suggest a natural eye 1 
really ugly 0 
i wish i could return the unit and get back my money 0 
i was very disappointed 0 
i had to wait over 30 minutes to get my drink and longer to get 2 arepas 0 
the characters are interesting and you want to find out more about them the longer the movie goes on and i think people will be surprised by who does and doesnt make it 1 
to sum the film up breeders is a terrible cheaply made horror movie that should be avoided like the ebola virus 0 
the scripting of the subtle comedy is unmatched by any movie in recent years 1 
sucked most of the stuff does not work with my phone 0 
the design is very good4 1 
then scene where they debated whether or not to sack the trumpeter who falsely was accused for the murder is pure horror really stupid 0 
but whatever it was that cost them so much it didnt translate to quality thats for sure 0 
the steak and the shrimp are in my opinion the best entrees at gc 1 
phone falls out easily 0 
this device is great in several situations1 1 
this convention never worked well in the past and certainly doesnt work here 0 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
service is quick and friendly 1 
then theres the plot holes 0 
the bathroom is just next door and very nice 1 
lovely little thriller from hitchcock with lots of nice shenanigans surrounding a murdered spy a kidnapped child a nasty church a foreign plot and some random taxidermists 1 
lets start with all the problemsthe acting especially from the lead professor was very very bad 0 
definitely worth checking out 1 
i knew when i saw the film that more great things were to come from this gifted actor 1 
items stated as included from the description are not included 0 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0 
the han nan chicken was also very tasty 1 
awesome service and food 1 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
it is a very well acted and done tv movie 1 
it is indescribably the most annoying and idiotic show i have ever seen 0 
think of the film being like a dream 1 
its a little geeky but i think thats its sex on toast and it rocks and oozes sex right down to its battery embedded sleek stylish leather case 1 
i have had tmobile service for 2 or 3 years now and i am pretty happy with it 1 
one of the most disappointing aspects is the lack of notable gore 0 
go watch it 1 
the fries were not hot and neither was my burger 0 
great choice 1 
its a little geeky but i think thats its sex on toast and it rocks and oozes sex right down to its battery embedded sleek stylish leather case 1 
camerawork again bad 0 
graphics is far from the best part of the game 0 
think it over when you plan to own this onethis sure is the last moto phone for me 0 
the lighting is just dark enough to set the mood 1 
so i bought about 10 of these and saved alot of money 1 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
i am so tired of clichés that is just lazy writing and here they come in thick and fast 0 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
the design is very odd as the ear clip is not very comfortable at all 0 
for that price i can think of a few place i would have much rather gone 0 
the pleather case doesnt fit 0 
all in all im quite satisfied with this purchase 1 
and generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode 0 
poor sound quality 0 
paolo sorrentino has written a wonderful story about loneliness and tony has built one of the most unforgettable characters seen in movies in recent years 1 
it always cuts out and makes a beep beep beep sound then says signal failed 0 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
voice recognition is tremendous 1 
poor reliability 0 
who in their right mind is gonna buy this battery 0 
i had to wait over 30 minutes to get my drink and longer to get 2 arepas 0 
still i do like this movie for its empowerment of women theres not enough movies out there like this one 1 
the first time i ever came here i had an amazing experience i still tell people how awesome the duck was 1 
i checked everywhere and there is no feature for it which is really disappointing 0 
the buffet at bellagio was far from what i anticipated 0 
this place is awesome if you want something light and healthy during the summer 1 
in particular the relationship between the bakery assistant and the waitress just didnt work for me at all 0 
sauce was tasteless 0 
i gave it 5 stars then and im giving it 5 stars now 1 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
about ten minutes into this film i started having second thoughts 0 
great price too 1 
new battery works great in phone 1 
very prompt service 1 
crust is not good 0 
i started this review with two stars but im editing it to give it only one 0 
the lighting is just dark enough to set the mood 1 
the transfers are very good 1 
steer clear of this product and go with the genuine palm replacementr pens which come in a threepack 0 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
i didnt know pulled pork could be soooo delicious 1 
the lead man is charismafree 0 
the goat taco didnt skimp on the meat and wow what flavor 1 
i recommend this for everyone who loves film movies anythinga work of art 1 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
the construction of the headsets is poor 0 
the phone is sturdy and waterproof 1 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
terrible my car will not accept this cassette 0 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
when my order arrived one of the gyros was missing 0 
this results in the phone being either stuck at max volume or mute 0 
the worst piece of crap ever along with the verizon customer service 0 
comfortable in my hand 1 
crisp and clear 1 
the 12 mega pixel camera being a part of a phone is reasonably good7 1 
the chicken dishes are ok the beef is like shoe leather 0 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
as a courtroom drama its compelling as an indictment on the american justice system its frightening 1 
the staff was very attentive 1 
so bad 0 
clever and a real crowdpleaserthis film still ranks among mickeys best films even after 80 wonderful years 1 
someone shouldve invented this sooner 1 
it is an excellent drama an excellent thriller and an excellent film 1 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
this is a chilly unremarkable movie about an author livingworking in a chilly abstruse culture 0 
this is probably the most irritating show i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
i just saw this film and i recommend it 1 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
damian is so talented and versatile in so many ways of writing and portraying different characters on screen 1 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
the food was excellent and service was very good 1 
the movie is terribly boring in places 0 
i especially liked the noncliche choices with the parents in other movies i could predict the dialog verbatim but the writing in this movie made better selections 1 
the menu is always changing food quality is going down service is extremely slow 0 
really really good rice all the time 1 
but in any case the best part is you can download these pictures to your laptop using ir or even send pictures from your laptop to the phone 1 
food is way overpriced and portions are fucking small 0 
uncomfortable in the ear dont use with lg vx9900 env 0 
integrated seamlessly with the motorola razr phone 1 
spoilers whatever else can or cant be said about it surface is superbly crafted 1 
the spaghetti is nothing special whatsoever 0 
the manager was the worst 0 
the sides are delish mixed mushrooms yukon gold puree white corn beateous 1 
nargile i think you are great 1 
loved itfriendly servers great food wonderful and imaginative menu 1 
im returning them 0 
i enjoyed reading this book to my children when they were little 1 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
avoid at any and all costs 0 
unfortunately it will not recharge my iphone 4s despite connecting it from multiple power sources imac external battery wall outlet etc 0 
dont waste your on this one 0 
i highly recommend this case 1 
so there is no way for me to plug it in here in the us unless i go by a converter 0 
it was horrendous 0 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
works great 1 
and considering the two of us left there very full and happy for about 20 you just cant go wrong 1 
if you want healthy authentic or ethic food try this place 1 
i thought it was bad 0 
unless youre just out to visually collect all extant films of austens work you can skip this one 0 
one of the worst shows of all time 0 
this is the first phone ive had that has been so cheaply made 0 
however the keypads are so tinny that i sometimes reach the wrong buttons 0 
this is one of the best movies out there that shows such strong sibling bond for each other 1 
i literally vomited while watching this film 0 
it has all the features i want 1 
what a mistake 0 
in addition to having one of the most lovely songs ever written french cancan also boasts one of the cutest leading ladies ever to grace the screen 1 
the servers went back and forth several times not even so much as an are you being helped 0 
we loved the biscuits 1 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
graphics is far from the best part of the game 0 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
the earpiece on this is too large or too heavyit keeps falling out of my ear 0 
highly recommend for any one who has a blue tooth phone 1 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
i could eat their bruschetta all day it is devine 1 
when achille and philippa beautifully sing a duet from don giovanni that perfectly describes their situation in the movie you appreciate the subtle layers of this excellent film 1 
which are small and not worth the price 0 
the entire audience applauded at the conclusion of the film 1 
omg i felt like i had never eaten thai food until this dish 1 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
it was way over fried 0 
ive missed numerous calls because of this reason 0 
the range is very decent ive been able to roam around my house with the phone in the living room with no receptionsound quality issues 1 
if it was to turn my good day feeling into a night of disturbing memories than i guess he succeeded 0 
the chips and sals a here is amazing 1 
ive never been treated so bad 0
