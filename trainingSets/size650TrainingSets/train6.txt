real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
when a song could explain the emotions of the subjects better such as when jay adams unfortunate life was a subject of talk the song old man by neil young was played which evokes many emotions 1 
but whatever it was that cost them so much it didnt translate to quality thats for sure 0 
great phone 1 
this is an excellent film 1 
reasonably priced also 1 
the best example of how dumb the writing is when its established that you can turn the zombiestudents back into humans by removing a necklace containing a piece of the meteorite 0 
the construction of the headsets is poor 0 
special mention should be made of the superb music score and sound effects which are an integral element in helping to make this such a memorable and enjoyable cartoon 1 
i dont have to be an accountant to know im getting screwed 0 
very cheap plastic creaks like an old wooden floor 0 
buttons are too small 0 
its a feelgood film and thats how i felt when i came out of the cinema 1 
my drink was never empty and he made some really great menu suggestions 1 
works as described 1 
the ambience is wonderful and there is music playing 1 
which is precisely why i am giving it such a bad review 0 
i could not recommend these more 0 
it is zillion times away from reality 0 
ive had no trouble accessing the internet downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions 1 
this is one of peter watkins most accessible films 1 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
unfortunately this is a bad movie that is just plain bad 0 
long whiny and pointless 0 
what a mistake 0 
bland not a liking this place for a number of reasons and i dont want to waste time on bad reviewing ill leave it at that 0 
this is a really fantastic thai restaurant which is definitely worth a visit 1 
i love this phone 1 
the only thing worse than taylors acting was stanwycks singing 0 
before i go in to why i gave a 1 star rating please know that this was my third time eating at bachi burger before writing a review 0 
if that bug never showed up i would have given a 4 for sure but on the other side of the wall where this bug was climbing was the kitchen 0 
his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic 1 
okay i like to consider myself a fair critic so ill give credit where credits duethe creature effects were actually pretty cool 1 
the aerial scenes were welldone 1 
the camera really likes her in this movie 1 
made very sturdy 1 
this place is like chipotle but better 1 
to be honest with you this is unbelievable nonsense and very foolish 0 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
an extensive menu provides lots of options for breakfast 1 
great product fast shipping 1 
this results in the phone being either stuck at max volume or mute 0 
im returning them 0 
very funny 1 
for a self proclaimed coffee cafe i was wildly disappointed 0 
a fantastic neighborhood gem 1 
disappointed 0 
great food and awesome service 1 
the bathrooms are clean and the place itself is well decorated 1 
it is cheap and it feel and look just as cheap 0 
if there were zero stars i would give it zero stars 0 
total brunch fail 0 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
the kids are very cool too 1 
this second appearance of mickey mouse following the silent plane crazy earlier that year is probably his most famous filmmostly because it was so groundbreaking 1 
the best place to go for a tasty bowl of pho 1 
waste your money on this game 1 
worst hour and a half of my lifeoh my gosh 0 
youll love it 1 
the potatoes were great and so was the biscuit 1 
the movie has almost no action scenes in it and very little comedy 0 
this is the phone to get for 2005 i just bought my s710a and all i can say is wow 1 
it is wonderful and inspiring to watch and i hope that it gets released again on to video or dvd 1 
car charger as well as ac charger are included to make sure you never run out of juicehighy recommended 1 
very true to shakespear and a must for all shakespear fans 1 
it is an hour and half waste of time following a bunch of very pretty high schoolers whine and cry about life 0 
i wont be back 0 
it is light has plenty of battery capacity and is very confortable to wear for somewhat extended periods of time 1 
so bad 0 
this is an excellent tool especially when paired with your phones autoanswer 1 
but in any case the best part is you can download these pictures to your laptop using ir or even send pictures from your laptop to the phone 1 
it is just the sort of pap that is screened in the afternoon to punish the unemployed for not having jobs 0 
i mean this in a terrible way 0 
restaurant is always full but never a wait 1 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
great product and price 1 
i purchased this and within 2 days it was no longer working 0 
is pretty funny 1 
the casting is also horrible cause all you see is a really really bad actors period 0 
her lines seem to have been written by a fifteen year old though they are trying oh so so hard to sound like how a fifteen year old would really um you know well talk 0 
i found the product to be easy to set up and use 1 
i could not recommend these more 0 
better than expected 1 
their research and development division obviously knows what theyre doing 1 
as an earlier review noted plug in this charger and nothing happens 0 
for a self proclaimed coffee cafe i was wildly disappointed 0 
the headsets are easy to use and everyone loves them 1 
we arent ones to make a scene at restaurants but i just dont get itdefinitely lost the love after this one 0 
lets start with all the problemsthe acting especially from the lead professor was very very bad 0 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
when i saw it in the theater i thought i was going to be sick 0 
fantastic service here 1 
i let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this bad idea we both hated it 0 
i think i was one of the people who found this another one of roths pearls 1 
if you stay in vegas you must get breakfast here at least once 1 
i would definitely recommend the jabra bt250v for those who are looking for comfort clarity and a great price 1 
to call this movie a drama is ridiculous 0 
everything was fresh and delicious 1 
i came back today since they relocated and still not impressed 0 
shes poised and amazing 1 
excellent service 1 
it was a very superficial movie and it gave me the feeling that i was watching play rather than a film 0 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
the food was delicious our bartender was attentive and personable and we got a great deal 1 
every time he opened his mouth you expect to hear you see kids pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show 0 
i love this place 1 
my rating just 3 out of 10 0 
i wouldnt return 0 
it was so boring 0 
the attention given to every character and complex psychological portrayals detailing loyalty treachery love and hope are tremendous 1 
my mother and brother had to do thiswhen i saw robert ryan portraying this type of man it was a very good imitation of this type of individual and i was impressed 1 
this place deserves one star and 90 has to do with the food 0 
garbo who showed right off the bat that her talents could carry over from the silent era i wanted to see some of her silent work but netflix doesnt seem to be stocking them 1 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
the inside is really quite nice and very clean 1 
conclusion i loved it 1 
after my phone got to be about a year old its been slowly breaking despite much care on my part 0 
i went on motorolas website and followed all directions but could not get it to pair again 0 
id say that would be the hardest decision honestly all of ms dishes taste how they are supposed to taste amazing 1 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
too bad you have to pay up to a month for the service 0 
dont bother coming here 0 
disappointing accessory from a good manufacturer 0 
the stories were powerful explorations of the nature of man and of art 1 
it is practically useless and did not add any kind of boost to my reception after i bought it 0 
also the fries are without a doubt the worst fries ive ever had 0 
that company is a joke 0 
think of the film being like a dream 1 
otherwise easy to install and use clear sound 1 
dont waste your time watching this rubbish nonresearched film 0 
this is by far the worst purchase ive made on amazon 0 
they do not last forever but is not overly expensive to replaceeasy to operate and the sound is much better than others i have tried 1 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
how stupid is that 0 
ive dropped my phone more times than i can say even on concrete and my phone is still great knock on wood 1 
at first i thought i was grtting a good deal at 744 until i plugged it into my phone v3c razr 0 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
i vomited in the bathroom mid lunch 0 
awful 0 
initially the local sites in the film which was filmed here in buffalo intrigued me 1 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
the soundtrack sucked 0 
battery life is real good 1 
very good quality though 1 
none of them are engaging or exciting 0 
the bus boy on the other hand was so rude 0 
ambience is perfect 1 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
i did not expect this to be so good 1 
and the rest of it just sits there being awful with soldiers singing songs about the masculinity they pledge themselves to hairsplitting about purity the admiration of swords etc 0 
the story line is totally predictable 0 
this is the kind of money that is wasted properly 1 
the instruction manual is lacking 0 
disapointing results 0 
this results in the phone being either stuck at max volume or mute 0 
its not hard to make a decent hamburger 0 
they dropped more than the ball 0 
the service was poor and thats being nice 0 
this phone might well be the worst ive ever had in any brand 0 
i dont have to be an accountant to know im getting screwed 0 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
lot of holes in the plot theres nothing about how he became the emperor nothing about where he spend 20 years between his childhood and mature age 0 
we enjoy their pizza and brunch 1 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
judith light is one of my favorite actresses and i think she does a superb job in this film 1 
unfortunately this is a bad movie that is just plain bad 0 
the writer gorman bechard undoubtedly did his homework because all references are industry and characterage appropriate 1 
the presentation of the food was awful 0 
the cashier was friendly and even brought the food out to me 1 
secondly hitchcock pretty much perfected the thriller and chase movie 1 
gets the job done 1 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
is pretty funny 1 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
you share general loewenhielms exquisite joy in his partaking of the cailles en sarcophage even though you are just watching a movie but you do wish for just a small sample to savor 1 
best tacos in town by far 1 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
this was reflected not only in the cast but also in the belowpar script which borrowed much from the earlier classic 0 
problem is that the ear loops are made of weak material and break easily 0 
1 hour 54 minutes of sheer tedium melodrama and horrible acting a mess of a script and a sinking feeling of good lord what were they thinking 0 
it wasnt busy at all and now we know why 0 
excellent phone 1 
i am not a filmmaker nor am i a director but i would hide my head in the sand if id spent whatever amount of money and time on this movie 0 
there is no plot here to keep you going in the first place 0 
strike 2 who wants to be rushed 0 
easy to pair with my samsung cell 1 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
as for the mains also uninspired 0 
i enjoyed it 1 
very dissapointing performance 0 
pretty cool i would say 1 
dont waste your money 0 
these were so good we ordered them twice 1 
lordy the khao soi is a dish that is not to be missed for curry lovers 1 
id say that would be the hardest decision honestly all of ms dishes taste how they are supposed to taste amazing 1 
not tasty and the texture was just nasty 0 
the burger i got the gold standard a 17 burger and was kind of disappointed 0 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
but when i check voice mail at night the keypad backlight turns off a few seconds into the first message and then im lost 0 
for the price this was a great deal 1 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
i consider this theft 0 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
i must say i have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again 1 
everything about this movie is stupid 0 
reaching for the bottom row is uncomfortable and the send and end keys are not where i expect them to be3 0 
i love this bluetooth 1 
this was reflected not only in the cast but also in the belowpar script which borrowed much from the earlier classic 0 
this is an excellent tool especially when paired with your phones autoanswer 1 
if you plan to use this in a car forget about it 0 
if you have not seen this movie i definitely recommend it 1 
this early film from future goremeister lucio fulci is a very good addition to the giallo subgenre 1 
what a waste of money and time 0 
soyo technology sucks 0 
totally different with loads of understatement and black comedy this is a film few get to see but those who do will remember it 1 
i was left shattered from the experience of watching this film and i took a good two hours to fully recover 0 
i was very excited to get this headset because i thought it was really cute 1 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
but now that it is out of warranty the same problems reoccurebottom line put your money somewhere else cingular will not support it 0 
its one of the most boring horror movies from the 90s mainly because it starts slow and centers in a boring atmosphere 0 
poor construction 0 
in addition it feels amp looks as if the phone is all lightweight cheap plastic 0 
the earpiece on this is too large or too heavyit keeps falling out of my ear 0 
before i go in to why i gave a 1 star rating please know that this was my third time eating at bachi burger before writing a review 0 
i purcashed this for the car charger and it does not work 0 
the ambiance was incredible 1 
what did bother me was the slow service 0 
light weight i hardly notice it is there 1 
food was delicious 1 
but in any case the best part is you can download these pictures to your laptop using ir or even send pictures from your laptop to the phone 1 
also the phone doesnt seem to accept anything except cbr mp3s preferably ripped by windows media player 0 
they could be used as exemplars for any set designer 1 
great phone 1 
they keep getting better and better this is my third one and ive had numerous palms too 1 
this place is handsdown one of the best places to eat in the phoenix metro area 1 
i guess i liked the details of his dysfunctionhe was believable 1 
dont waste your money and time 0 
dont bother coming here 0 
i even dropped this phone into a stream and it was submerged for 15 seconds and it still works great 1 
by the time the film ended i not only disliked it i despised it 0 
lifetime does not air it enough so if anyone knows what store sells it let me know because this is a musthave 1 
we received a white colored battery that goes dead after a couple hoursthe original used to last a week but still lasts longer than thereplacement 0 
was not happy 0 
this is just a great movie 1 
5 stars for the brick oven bread app 1 
a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it 1 
sucked most of the stuff does not work with my phone 0 
they have a plethora of salads and sandwiches and everything ive tried gets my seal of approval 1 
but the movie makes a lot of serious mistakes 0 
appears to actually outperform the original battery from china that came with my v325i 1 
this fixes all the problems 1 
the ambiance was incredible 1 
this phone might well be the worst ive ever had in any brand 0 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
the only thing worse than taylors acting was stanwycks singing 0 
the grilled chicken was so tender and yellow from the saffron seasoning 1 
the waiter wasnt helpful or friendly and rarely checked on us 0 
my breakfast was perpared great with a beautiful presentation of 3 giant slices of toast lightly dusted with powdered sugar 1 
i ordered albondigas soup which was just warm and tasted like tomato soup with frozen meatballs 0 
i received it quickly and it works great 1 
you need two hands to operate the screenthis software interface is decade old and cannot compete with new software designs 0 
the acting is beyond abysmal 0 
muddy low quality sound and the casing around the wires insert was poorly super glued and slid off 0 
very prompt service 1 
server did a great job handling our large rowdy table 1 
it is very educational for children 1 to 8 years old 1 
the seasonal fruit was fresh white peach puree 1 
it also took her forever to bring us the check when we asked for it 0 
service stinks here 0 
the performances are not improved by improvisation because the actors now have twice as much to worry about not only whether theyre delivering the line well but whether the line itself is any good 0 
it did not work in my cell phone plug i am very up set with the charger 0 
for sushi on the strip this is the place to go 1 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
in a word it is embarrassing 0 
my friend did not like his bloody mary 0 
not tasty and the texture was just nasty 0 
i went on motorolas website and followed all directions but could not get it to pair again 0 
very pleased with this headset 1 
i was sitting in my vehicle with the cradle on my belt and the headset lost signal 0 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
the lead man is charismafree 0 
never been to hard rock casino before will never ever step forward in it again 0 
so dont go there if you are looking for good food 0 
poor reliability 0 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
dont waste your money 0 
kind of hard to mess up a steak but they did 0 
what a disappointment 0 
an excellent new restaurant by an experienced frenchman 1 
the steaks are all well trimmed and also perfectly cooked 1 
the camera although rated at an impressive 13 megapixels renders images that fall well below expectations of such a relatively high resolution 0 
really pleased with this product so far 1 
case was more or less an extra that i originally put on but later discarded because it scratched my ear 0 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
i mean really how do you get so famous for your fish and chips when its so terrible 0 
the problem i have is that they charge 1199 for a sandwich that is no bigger than a subway sub which offers better and more amount of vegetables 0 
they brought a fresh batch of fries and i was thinking yay something warm but no 0 
wasted two hours 0 
as for the service i thought it was good 1 
an amazing finale to possibly the best trilogy of all time 1 
for a product that costs as much as this one does i expect it to work far better and with greater ease than this thing does 0 
not even a hello we will be right with you 0 
of all the dishes the salmon was the best but all were great 1 
wow loved this place 1 
lucy bell is so much higher than this crap and for her to sink this low is quite depressing 0 
im glad the film didnt go for the most obvious choice as a lesser film certainly would have 1 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
it really is impressive that the place hasnt closed down 0 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
it was just not a fun experience 1 
the charger arrived within the promised timeframe but it did not work 0 
avoid this one if you can 0 
totally believable 1 
the staff is friendly and the joint is always clean 1 
it rocked my world and is certainly a must see for anyone with no social or physical outlets 1 
avoid this one if you can 0 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
i will be back many times soon 1 
better than youd expect 1 
better than new 1 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
so for our enjoyment we get to see them run around play games and be dangerous 1 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
the very idea of it was lame take a minor character from a mediocre pg13 film and make a complete nonsequel while changing its tone to a pgrated family movie 0 
my friend did not like his bloody mary 0 
the food was terrible 0 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
the servers went back and forth several times not even so much as an are you being helped 0 
worse theres an incredibly weak subplot thrown in that follows a little band of latterday mansonites as they go after a reporter whos working on a story on the anniversary of the killings 0 
when it opens the battery connection is broken and the device is turned off 0 
sounds good reasonably priced and effective its that simple 1 
i have to use the smallest earpieces provided but it stays on pretty well 1 
we had a group of 70 when we claimed we would only have 40 and they handled us beautifully 1 
the selection was probably the worst ive seen in vegasthere was none 0 
its a total package 1 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
for sushi on the strip this is the place to go 1 
exceptionally bad 0 
i love this phone it is very handy and has a lot of features 1 
nice case feels good in your hands 1 
here in the wind and the lion we see a wonderful rendering of americas own imperial age 1 
do not make the same mistake as me 0 
i love their fries and their beans 1 
do not waste your time 0 
what this film lacks is a convincing script 0 
the soundtrack wasnt terrible either 1 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
i have to mention this and it is a huge spoiler i loved the ending how all the characters of the three films were the remaining survivors of the ferry disaster with valentine and the young judge together and the old man watching it on her tv solidifying his happiness over the suffering which he dealt with for those many years 1 
special mention should be made of the superb music score and sound effects which are an integral element in helping to make this such a memorable and enjoyable cartoon 1 
case was more or less an extra that i originally put on but later discarded because it scratched my ear 0 
this is such a fun and funny movie 1 
very tough and very short on flavor 0 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
i searched the internet and found this one to be the best value 1 
this movie does an excellent job of revealing the complexity of the task and the incredible challenges facing south africa 1 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
treo and tmobile refused to replace it again and forced me to buy another phone without any kind of upgrade discount 0 
i was deeply impressed with the character he played 1 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
mark my words this is one of those cult films like evil dead 2 or phantasm that people will still be discovering and falling in love with 20 30 40 years down the line 1 
the delivery was on time 1 
i will not return 0 
the pairing of the two devices was so easy it barely took a couple minutes before i started making calls with the voice dialing feature 1 
all things considered a job very well done 1 
and finally after all that we get to an ending that wouldve been great had it been handled by competent people and not jerry falwell 0 
this place deserves one star and 90 has to do with the food 0 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
go rent it 1 
but storm trooper is not even bad enough to make it to the list of wonderfully terrible movies 0 
i give wirefly 1 stari will contact cingularatt and inform them of this practice 0 
food was really good and i got full petty fast 1 
the scripting of the subtle comedy is unmatched by any movie in recent years 1 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
this is my new fav vegas buffet spot 1 
this is a good joint 1 
poor construction 0 
i love their fries and their beans 1 
there are massive levels massive unlockable characters its just a massive game 1 
bluetooth does not work phone locks up screens just flash up and now it just makes calls randomly while in my pocket locked 0 
however bt headsets are currently not good for real time games like firstperson shooters since the audio delay messes me up 0 
the waitress and manager are so friendly 1 
the veggitarian platter is out of this world 1 
i hope this place sticks around 1 
this fixes all the problems 1 
there were several moments in the movie that just didnt need to be there and were excruciatingly slow moving 0 
you need at least 3 mins to get to your phone book from the time you first turn on the phonebattery life is short 0 
my order was not correct 0 
lousy product 0 
i get absolutely horrible reception in my apartment where with other phones i have not had this problem 0 
and it was boring 0 
my gyro was basically lettuce only 0 
i guess that nobody at the network that aired this dribble watched it before putting it on 0 
the point is the journey a journey that touches every member of the family 1 
really really good rice all the time 1 
great product fast shipping 1 
there is nothing authentic about this place 0 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
i wasnt expecting oscar material but this 0 
the only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive 1 
yes i am simplifying things here for the sake of brevity for this really is at the core of the problems with this film it has too much going on without any real fulfilling explanation 0 
razr battery good buy 1 
the food sucked which we expected but it sucked more than we could have imagined 0 
waste of 13 bucks 0 
she carries the movie well 1 
each track commands sentiment actually contributing to the scenes and characters 1 
i have been to very few places to eat that under no circumstances would i ever return to and this tops the list 0 
as a courtroom drama its compelling as an indictment on the american justice system its frightening 1 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
i can assure you that you wont be disappointed 1 
summary the witticisms werent witty 0 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
dont waste your time 0 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
i love this place 1 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
this is a really fantastic thai restaurant which is definitely worth a visit 1 
the movie lacks visual interest drama expression of feeling and celebration of the very patriotism that underlines the narrative 0 
an absolute must visit 1 
bland and flavorless is a good way of describing the barely tepid meat 0 
excellent dualpurpose headset 1 
i put the latest os on it v115g and it now likes to slow to a crawl and lock up every once in a while 0 
i have had mine for about a year and this christmas i bought some for the rest of the family 1 
it isnt even an achievement as a sobaditsgood or sobaditsmemorable movie 0 
the very idea of it was lame take a minor character from a mediocre pg13 film and make a complete nonsequel while changing its tone to a pgrated family movie 0 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
alexander nevsky is a great film 1 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
almost everyone involved must be return to school acting is utterly predictable and bad script is pile of garbage all round 0 
that company is a joke 0 
if you have several dozen or several hundred contacts then imagine the fun of sending each of them one by one 0 
the phone is sturdy and waterproof 1 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
unfortunately the ability to actually know you are receiving a call is a rather important feature and this phone is pitiful in that respect 0 
ill be looking for a new earpiece 0 
were jerks on the phone 0 
will never ever go back and have told many people what had happened 0 
i dont think well be going back anytime soon 0 
avoid at all costs 0 
the memories are murky but i can only say that i enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show 1 
when achille and philippa beautifully sing a duet from don giovanni that perfectly describes their situation in the movie you appreciate the subtle layers of this excellent film 1 
highquality chicken on the chicken caesar salad 1 
is pretty funny 1 
the steak and the shrimp are in my opinion the best entrees at gc 1 
i guess i liked the details of his dysfunctionhe was believable 1 
highly unrecommended 0 
its a great tool for entertainment communication and data managementoh be sure to use activesync 42 for optimal data synchronization results 1 
wonderful lil tapas and the ambience made me feel all warm and fuzzy inside 1 
the dialogue is composed of things that make little sense 0 
its like a bad two hour tv movie 0 
i loved it 1 
it has a very good plot it holds your complete attention the acting is superb tom wilkinson was fantastic and emily watson was also very good 1 
it is an hour and half waste of time following a bunch of very pretty high schoolers whine and cry about life 0 
will order from them again 1 
the accompanied software is almost brilliant 1 
sound quality on both end is excellent i use headset to call my wife and ask my wife to use headset to call me 2 1 
love this place hits the spot when i want something healthy but not lacking in quantity or flavor 1 
this may be the only bad film he ever made 0 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
nice quality build unlike some cheap s out there 1 
you cant relate with them hell you barely can understand them 0 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
echo problemvery unsatisfactory 0 
why are these sad little vegetables so overcooked 0 
these are the central themes of the film and they are handled ineptly stereotypically and with no depth of imagination 0 
i had ordered a motorola data cable got a very well finished and working product 1 
the ambiance was incredible 1 
an hour seriously 0 
it rocked my world and is certainly a must see for anyone with no social or physical outlets 1 
i was very excited to get this headset because i thought it was really cute 1 
the script is bad very bad  it contains both cheesiness and unethical joke that you normally see in rated r or nc17 movie 0 
the design is very odd as the ear clip is not very comfortable at all 0 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
im probably one of the few people to ever go to ians and not like it 0 
will never ever go back 0 
it looks very nice 1 
hot dishes are not hot cold dishes are close to room tempi watched staff prepare food with bare hands no gloveseverything is deep fried in oil 0 
i was able to do voice dialing in the car with no problem 1 
worthwhile 1 
this was my first time and i cant wait until the next 1 
i would highly recommend this 1 
i was very pleased to see that i could replace my well travled swivel holster for my blackberry flip 1 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
shrimp when i unwrapped it i live only 12 a mile from brushfire it was literally ice cold 0 
the ambiance isnt much better 0 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
ill be looking for a new earpiece 0 
att is not clear sound is very distorted and you have to yell when you talk 0 
the food was delicious our bartender was attentive and personable and we got a great deal 1 
before i go in to why i gave a 1 star rating please know that this was my third time eating at bachi burger before writing a review 0 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
just spicy enough perfect actually 1 
is pretty funny 1 
im probably one of the few people to ever go to ians and not like it 0 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
ambience is perfect 1 
i found this place by accident and i could not be happier 1 
the desserts were a bit strange 0 
the nachos are a must have 1 
everything about it is fine and reasonable for the price ie 1 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
waste your money on this game 1 
the only thing i did like was the prime rib and dessert section 1 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
service was fantastic 1 
crisp and clear 1 
the cg opening sequence in space looked like it could have been created on microsoft slideshow for gods sake 0 
im so happy to be here 1 
this is one of peter watkins most accessible films 1 
very disappointed in accessoryone 0 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
went for lunch service was slow 0 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
very disappointed and wondered how it could be in the oscar shortlist 0 
i got home to see the driest damn wings ever 0 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
doesnt hold charge 0 
having trouble with volume 0 
its a shame to see good actors like thomerson and james make a living in a mess like this 0 
the story line is just awful 0 
the reception is excellent 1 
this item is fantastic and works perfectly 1 
the first thing that happened was that the tracking was off 0 
you have to hold the phone at a particular angle for the other party to hear you clearly 0 
good quality 1 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
first time going but i think i will quickly become a regular 1 
how can that bethe audio quality is poor 0 
dont bother coming here 0 
the update procedure is difficult and cumbersome 0 
i wont be back 0 
i dont know what kind it is but they have the best iced tea 1 
we enjoy their pizza and brunch 1 
comfortable in my hand 1 
no actress has been worse used that june allison in this movie 0 
the food wasnt good 0 
overall i wasnt very impressed with noca 0 
however after seeing the short again after about 25 years i was amazed at how timeless the film actually is 1 
this frog phone charm is adorable and very eye catching 1 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
i was disgusted because i was pretty sure that was human hair 0 
this was such an awesome movie that i bought it off of ebay 1 
this is a witty and delightful adaptation of the dr seuss book brilliantly animated by upas finest and thoroughly deserving of its academy award 1 
to those who find this movie intelligent or even masterful i can only say its your intelligence and your imagination you obviously used to try and make some sense of this pitiful attempt its in our human nature to try and make sense of things 0 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
good prices 1 
i love this phone it is very handy and has a lot of features 1 
works for me 1 
i think that it is a must see older john wayne film 1 
i believe every one should see this movie as i think few people outside of south africa understand its past and what is being attempted in the truth and reconciliation process 1 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
service is also cute 1 
oh yeah and the storyline was pathetic too 0 
great case and price 1 
sprint charges for this service 0 
see it 1 
i highly recommend this modest priced cellular phone 1 
after watching this film i wanted to learn more about the works of this artist 1 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
i thoroughly enjoyed it when christopher eccleston took control of the tardis and the continuation of the series 1 
my 810 score is mostly for the plot 1 
the pizza tasted old super chewy in not a good way 0 
i was able to do voice dialing in the car with no problem 1 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
but its just not funny 0 
this is not moviemaking 0 
the loudspeaker option is great the bumpers with the lights is very appealing 0 
comes with a strong light that you can use to light up your camera shots and even flash sos signals seriously 1 
lot of holes in the plot theres nothing about how he became the emperor nothing about where he spend 20 years between his childhood and mature age 0 
both of the egg rolls were fantastic 1 
punishment park is a brilliant piece of cinema 1 
nobody identifies with these characters because theyre all cardboard cutouts and stereotypes or predictably reversestereotypes 0 
i have to use the smallest earpieces provided but it stays on pretty well 1 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
what a mistake that was 0 
it really created a unique feeling though 1 
i was very pleased to see that i could replace my well travled swivel holster for my blackberry flip 1 
about half way through this film i started to dislike it 0 
point your finger at any item on the menu order it and you wont be disappointed 1 
go and see it 1 
battery life is real good 1 
bland and flavorless is a good way of describing the barely tepid meat 0 
conclusion very filling meals 1 
so far so good 1 
we definately enjoyed ourselves 1 
i particularly remember my senses being assaulted by strident cords of music that would blare out with very little warning and even less meaning 0 
he came running after us when he realized my husband had left his sunglasses on the table 1 
the food is not tasty at all not to say its real traditional hunan style 0 
its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
i would advise to not purchase this item it never worked very well 0 
really awful 0 
it looses connection to the phone even when it is within a couple feet between the two 0 
unreliable im giving up 0 
on a positive note our server was very attentive and provided great service 1 
i did not expect this to be so good 1 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
which is precisely why i am giving it such a bad review 0 
it doesnt make you look cool 0 
love this headset 1 
you cant beat that 1 
i ordered this for sony ericsson w810i but i think it only worked once thats when i first used it 0 
this is a great restaurant at the mandalay bay 1 
tom wilkinson broke my heart at the end and everyone elses judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike 1 
i contacted the company and they told me that although the unit was still under warranty if i couldnt produce my receipt i was out of luck 0 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
i tried the cape cod ravoli chickenwith cranberrymmmm 1 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
not tasty and the texture was just nasty 0 
the service was terrible food was mediocre 0 
good product incredible value 1 
internet is excrutiatingly slow 0 
poorly contstruct hinge 0 
the music in the film is really nice too 1 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
however after seeing the short again after about 25 years i was amazed at how timeless the film actually is 1 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
verizon tech support walked my through a few procedures none of which worked and i ended up having to do a hard reset wiping out all my data 0 
to summarize the food was incredible nay transcendant but nothing brings me joy quite like the memory of the pneumatic condiment dispenser 1 
very disappointed 0 
it also took her forever to bring us the check when we asked for it 0 
i have never had such bland food which surprised me considering the article we read focused so much on their spices and flavor 0 
there are many continuity errors one other user commented on different cars in the garage joes glassesthe one that got to me the most was the fact joes facial hair configuration seemed to change from scene to scene 0 
used and dirty 0 
delicious 1 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
every time he opened his mouth you expect to hear you see kids pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show 0 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
the owner used to work at nobu so this place is really similar for half the price 1 
the telephone repair man was really funny and his reactions to the nuts and bitchy boss were truly genuine 1 
so they performed 1 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
i have 23 bars on my cell phone when i am home but you cant not hear anything 0 
nice solid keyboard 1 
bad reception 0 
the bus boy on the other hand was so rude 0 
one nice thing was that they added gratuity on the bill since our party was larger than 6 or 8 and they didnt expect more tip than that 1 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
so far so good 1 
this phone is pretty sturdy and ive never had any large problems with it 1 
the acting by the whole cast could be put on a scale and balanced perfectly between overacting and underacting 0 
this was one of the worst films i have ever seen 0 
i would highly recommend this product 1 
a bit predictable 0 
i really do recommend this place you can go wrong with this donut place 1 
utter crap sound quality is terrible 0
