the atmosphere here is fun 1 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
it has a great camera thats 2mp and the pics are nice and clear with great picture quality 1 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
will never ever go back 0 
the cinematography is simply stunning to say the least and the fx are nothing if not stateoftheart 1 
a very very very slowmoving aimless movie about a distressed drifting young man 0 
all of the main players are mesmerising 1 
the food was terrible 0 
and then tragedy struck 0 
i tried talking real loud but shouting on the telephone gets old and i was still told it wasnt great 0 
the problem was the script 0 
con spotty service 0 
w810i is just superb 1 
please dont waste your money 0 
an instant classic with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits 1 
theres barely a boring moment in the film and there are plenty of humorous parts 1 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
i guess maybe we went on an off night but it was disgraceful 0 
the entire audience applauded at the conclusion of the film 1 
jamie foxx absolutely is ray charles 1 
someone shouldve invented this sooner 1 
there is however some pretty good acting at least for this type of film 1 
as always the evening was wonderful and the food delicious 1 
i also didnt like the on button it felt like it would crack with use 0 
to call this movie a drama is ridiculous 0 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
nice solid keyboard 1 
this product is clearly not ready for prime time i dont care how cool it looks if you cant tell a call is coming in its worthless 0 
i rate this movie 910 1 
worst martini ever 0 
very funny 1 
it was so cool 1 
i came over from verizon because cingulair has nicer cell phones the first thing i noticed was the really bad service 0 
it was just not a fun experience 1 
end of days is one of the worst bigbudget action movies ive ever seen 0 
all in all i can assure you ill be back 1 
bad reception 0 
we thought youd have to venture further away to get good sushi but this place really hit the spot that night 1 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
his costars dont fare much better with people like morgan freeman jonah hill and ed helms just wasted 0 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
the staff are also very friendly and efficient 1 
i put the latest os on it v115g and it now likes to slow to a crawl and lock up every once in a while 0 
also if your phone is dropped this case is not going to save it specially when dropped face down 0 
his performance as awarded was stunning 1 
not only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic but it also managed to give away the entire movie and im not exaggerating every moment every plot point every joke is told in the trailer 0 
wed definitely go back here again 1 
it was equally awful 0 
this is truly an art movieit actually has a lot of art in it 1 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
the sweet potato fries were very good and seasoned well 1 
you wont be disappointed 1 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
this product is clearly not ready for prime time i dont care how cool it looks if you cant tell a call is coming in its worthless 0 
what a waste of money and time 0 
babie bop is very cute 1 
the price was very good and with the free shipping and all it was a good purchase 1 
didnt laugh or even smile once 0 
the battery is unreliable as well as the service use antena 0 
i had a pretty satifying experience 1 
great pizza and salads 1 
thats how id describe this painfully dreary timewaster of a film 0 
imdb ratings only go as low 1 for awful its time to get some negative numbers in there for cases such as these 0 
a fly was in my apple juice a fly 0 
i was not impressed by this product 0 
too bad cause i know its family owned i really wanted to like this place 0 
the folks at otto always make us feel so welcome and special 1 
1 hour 54 minutes of sheer tedium melodrama and horrible acting a mess of a script and a sinking feeling of good lord what were they thinking 0 
do not buy if you want to use the holster 0 
the guys all had steaks and our steak loving son who has had steak at the best and worst places said it was the best steak hes ever eaten 1 
it seems completely secure both holding on to my belt and keeping the iphone inside 1 
no im going to eat the potato that i found some strangers hair in it 0 
speaking of the music it is unbearably predictably and kitchy 0 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
while i managed to bend the leaf spring back in place the metal now has enough stress that it will break on the next drop 0 
after a year the battery went completely dead on my headset 0 
very well made and fits my surefire gx2 perfectly 1 
i could care less the interior is just beautiful 1 
also were served hot bread and butter and home made potato chips with bacon bits on topvery original and very good 1 
poor product 0 
their onscreen chemistry critical to the entire film is genuine 1 
steer clear of this product and go with the genuine palm replacementr pens which come in a threepack 0 
it was so cool 1 
amazon sucks 0 
this product is clearly not ready for prime time i dont care how cool it looks if you cant tell a call is coming in its worthless 0 
im pleased 1 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
overall a great experience 1 
this short film certainly pulls no punches 0 
this place is overpriced not consistent with their boba and it really is overpriced 0 
good prices 1 
other than that the leather is nice and soft the fit is very tight the cut out for the face is a good shape 1 
it works fine on my motorola 325 cellphone and a lot better than the wornout battery did 1 
it was pretty gross 0 
the characters are interesting and you want to find out more about them the longer the movie goes on and i think people will be surprised by who does and doesnt make it 1 
i had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get some relief 0 
i love it 1 
extremely tasty 1 
all in all an excellent restaurant highlighted by great service a unique menu and a beautiful setting 1 
you wont regret it 1 
i consider this theft 0 
no ear loop needed its tiny and the sound is great 1 
the food was very good 1 
the 12 mega pixel camera being a part of a phone is reasonably good7 1 
the food was terrible 0 
his losing his marbles so early in the proceedings is totally implausible and unconvincing 0 
not good when wearing a hat or sunglasses 0 
end of days is one of the worst bigbudget action movies ive ever seen 0 
the ambiance isnt much better 0 
sorry i will not be getting food from here anytime soon 0 
the menu is always changing food quality is going down service is extremely slow 0 
the holster that arrived did not match the photo in the ad 0 
nice quality build unlike some cheap s out there 1 
i love my 350 headset my jabra350 bluetooth headset is great the reception is very good and the ear piece is a comfortable fit 1 
very slow at seating even with reservation 0 
the tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu 0 
regrettably the film fails 0 
in fact its hard to remember that the part of ray charles is being acted and not played by the man himself 1 
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 
the staff are great the ambiance is great 1 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
both films are terrible but to the credit of the 1986 version it was watchable 0 
phone now holds charge like it did when it was new 1 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
the secondary plot line is incomprehensible and its relation to the primary plot line is mystifying 0 
easily none other cartoon made me laugh in a tender way before getting into dark sitcoms oriented for teenagers 1 
i like armand assante my cable companys summary sounded interesting so i watched it twice already and probably will again 1 
sweetest phone 1 
i especially liked the noncliche choices with the parents in other movies i could predict the dialog verbatim but the writing in this movie made better selections 1 
the cashew cream sauce was bland and the vegetables were undercooked 0 
cute quaint simple honest 1 
those phones are working just fine now 1 
server did a great job handling our large rowdy table 1 
there is however some pretty good acting at least for this type of film 1 
im not eating here 0 
their frozen margaritas are way too sugary for my taste 0 
id advise anyone to go and see it 1 
the potato chip order was sad i could probably count how many chips were in that box and it was probably around 12 0 
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0 
dee snider just plain sucks 0 
the cocktails are all handmade and delicious 1 
dont do it 0 
best tater tots in the southwest 1 
also the phone doesnt seem to accept anything except cbr mp3s preferably ripped by windows media player 0 
its like a really sexy party in your mouth where youre outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party 1 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
but kevin spacey is an excellent verbal tsunami as buddy ackerman  and totally believable because he is a great actor 1 
but what really made it unwatchable was the direction 0 
do not buy do not buyit sucks 0 
for that its worth checking out 1 
unreliable im giving up 0 
rip off over charge shipping 0 
and the sound quality is great 1 
i hate writing bad reviews about films especially those in which i really like the star but this film is so bad i dont believe for one second that anyone could have been proud of it 0 
waitress was sweet and funny 1 
not impressed 0 
end of days is one of the worst bigbudget action movies ive ever seen 0 
clear skype calls long battery life long range 1 
will be back again 1 
unfortunately it did not work 0 
then i had to continue pairing it periodically since it somehow kept dropping 0 
the staff are also very friendly and efficient 1 
good case 1 
i would recommend it 1 
we ordered some old classics and some new dishes after going there a few times and were sorely disappointed with everything 0 
avoid this one if you can 0 
they are so cool 1 
then i watched it again two sundays ago march 20th 2005 and i began to really enjoy it and this time i taped the entire thing 1 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
logitech bluetooth headset is a 10 1 
i got to enjoy the seafood salad with a fabulous vinegrette 1 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
i believe the screenwriter did a good job of tying up the loose ends 1 
camera color balance is awful 0 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
you cant beat that 1 
then a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use 0 
hard to judge whether these sides were good because we were grossed out by the melted styrofoam and didnt want to eat it for fear of getting sick 0 
it was attached to a gas station and that is rarely a good sign 0 
so badwellits just bad 0 
we definately enjoyed ourselves 1 
it is wonderful and inspiring to watch and i hope that it gets released again on to video or dvd 1 
but now that it is out of warranty the same problems reoccurebottom line put your money somewhere else cingular will not support it 0 
also makes it easier to hold on to 1 
the success of the film depends on the casting of sydney greenstreet as the alexander yardley character 1 
overall i would recommend this phone over the new walkman 1 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
this one is simply a disappointment 0 
best ive found so far ive tried 2 other bluetooths and this one has the best quality for both me and the listener as well as ease of using 1 
things happen characters personalities change plot twists occur for no real reason other than that script calls for it 0 
very disappointing 0 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
similarly the delivery man did not say a word of apology when our food was 45 minutes late 0 
battery lasts only a few hours 0 
i used bitpim a free program you can find on the internetto transfer data to the phonethe price of the cable was excellent 1 
i find this inexcusable and so will probably be returning this phone and perhaps changing carriers 0 
this film highlights the fundamental flaws of the legal process that its not about discovering guilt or innocence but rather is about who presents better in court 1 
setup couldnt have been simpler 1 
best of all is the rotating feature very helpful 1 
when achille and philippa beautifully sing a duet from don giovanni that perfectly describes their situation in the movie you appreciate the subtle layers of this excellent film 1 
my order was not correct 0 
i gave it a 10 1 
looks great and is strong 1 
fantastic food 1 
just whatever you do avoid groove as its the antithesis of all that is good about human traffic 0 
service stinks here 0 
those burgers were amazing 1 
ordered burger rare came in well done 0 
waste your money on this game 1 
battery life is real good 1 
i got home to see the driest damn wings ever 0 
just spicy enough perfect actually 1 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
ive never been more insulted or felt disrespected 0 
used and dirty 0 
excellent hands free tool 1 
i have read others reviews here but i havent had any problem with it 1 
the accompanied software is almost brilliant 1 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
overall the film is interesting and thoughtprovoking 1 
perhaps i caught them on an off night judging by the other reviews but im not inspired to go back 0 
there is a brilliant twist ending 1 
a good film by a great director 1 
it always cuts out and makes a beep beep beep sound then says signal failed 0 
some highlights great quality nigiri here 1 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
the last 15 minutes of movie are also not bad as well 1 
people who like european films and art movies will like this movie 1 
the cinematographyif it can be called thatsucked 0 
the food sucked which we expected but it sucked more than we could have imagined 0 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
it ranks highly as a great noircrimedrama incredible performances by belmondo and lino ventura 1 
the pancake was also really good and pretty large at that 1 
it was just too horrible 0 
the characters were all funny and had the peculiarity of not having a true lead character 1 
no plot whatsoever 0 
if you havent choked in your own vomit by the end by all the cheap drama and worthless dialogue youve must have bored yourself to death with this waste of time 0 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
i have read others reviews here but i havent had any problem with it 1 
there is a lot of beautiful places 1 
the tracfonewebsite is user friendly and makes it easy toactivate etc 1 
i have always used corded headsets and the freedom from the wireless is very helpful 1 
i will never go back to this place and will never ever recommended this place to anyone 0 
too politically correct 0 
in other words the content level of this film is enough to easily fill a dozen other films 1 
the phone is sturdy and waterproof 1 
the only thing i did like was the prime rib and dessert section 1 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
it was a good thing that the tickets only cost five dollars because i would be mad if id have paid 750 to see this crap 0 
oh yeah and the storyline was pathetic too 0 
i cant tell you how disappointed i was 0 
you have to hold the phone at a particular angle for the other party to hear you clearly 0 
these are fabulous 1 
very disappointing 0 
defective crap 0 
this place receives stars for their appetizers 1 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
the worst phone ive ever had only had it for a few months 0 
it just blew 0 
they will customize your order any way youd like my usual is eggplant with green bean stir fry love it 1 
i can take a little bad service but the food sucks 0 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
makes it easier to keep up with my bluetooth when im not wearing it 0 
i got the car charger and not even after a week the charger was brokeni went to plug it in and it started smoking 0 
when my mom and i got home she immediately got sick and she only had a few bites of salad 0 
the characters are fleshed out surprisingly well particularly grimes and blake and all the actors deliver their sharply scripted lines with just the right amount of deadpan tongue in cheek to make the dialogue both hilarious and realistic 1 
nice leather 1 
this is one of the better buffets that i have been to 1 
highly recommended for all ages although the younger set will probably not appreciate some of the more subtle references they will certainly appreciate one galley scene in particular 1 
ive had this for nearly 2 years and it has worked great for me 1 
babie bop is very cute 1 
it only recognizes the phone as its storage device 0 
this is a good battery and it got here really fast 1 
i might have gotten a defect but i would not risk buying it again because of the built quality alone 0 
unfortunately it did not work 0 
the cinematographyif it can be called thatsucked 0 
by this time our side of the restaurant was almost empty so there was no excuse 0 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
im not impressed with the concept or the food 0 
i did not expect this to be so good 1 
the potato chip order was sad i could probably count how many chips were in that box and it was probably around 12 0 
the food was terrible 0 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
the cast of veteran actors are more than just a nostalgia trip 1 
the movie lacks visual interest drama expression of feeling and celebration of the very patriotism that underlines the narrative 0 
we also ordered the spinach and avocado salad the ingredients were sad and the dressing literally had zero taste 0 
brilliance indeed 1 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
disappointing 0 
i might have gotten a defect but i would not risk buying it again because of the built quality alone 0 
only pros large seating area nice bar area great simple drink menu the best brick oven pizza with homemade dough 1 
this place is pretty good nice little vibe in the restaurant 1 
very friendly staff 1 
the staff was very attentive 1 
awsome device works great 1 
he is an amazing film artist one of the most important whoever lived 1 
a lot of websites have been rating this a very good phone and so do i 1 
this one wants to surf on the small wave of space movies in 1998 deep impact and armageddon and this one fails everywhere 0 
the file browser offers all the options that one needshandsfree is great 1 
utter crap sound quality is terrible 0 
overall i wasnt very impressed with noca 0 
i didnt want the clip going over the top of my ear causing discomfort 0 
the dialogue sucked 0 
very much disappointed with this company 0 
i rate this movie 910 1 
my friend loved the salmon tartar 1 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
my order was not correct 0 
its one of the movies i need to see whenever it comes on tvnever mind the fact that i already have it memorized 1 
add betty white and jean smart and you have a great cast everyone played their parts really well 1 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
we thought youd have to venture further away to get good sushi but this place really hit the spot that night 1 
the lighting is awful 0 
im still infatuated with this phone 1 
lucy bell is so much higher than this crap and for her to sink this low is quite depressing 0 
a fantastic neighborhood gem 1 
bad reception 0 
great phone 1 
it is just the sort of pap that is screened in the afternoon to punish the unemployed for not having jobs 0 
the best part about nurse betty is its unpredictability 1 
motorola finally got the voice quality of a bluetooth headset right 1 
we will not be coming back 0 
editing the editing of this film was phenomenal in my opinion 1 
it finds my cell phone right away when i enter the car 1 
his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic 1 
the acting is like watching wooden puppets moving around and reading from a book thats how bad it is 0 
i really recommend this faceplates since it looks very nice elegant and cool 1 
the ngage is still lacking in earbuds 0 
works good 1 
muddy low quality sound and the casing around the wires insert was poorly super glued and slid off 0 
it was probably dirt 0 
i hate movies like that 0 
everything was fresh and delicious 1 
not easy to watch 0 
very very disappointed ordered the 35 big bay plater 0 
cute quaint simple honest 1 
that was done in the second movie 0 
very true to shakespear and a must for all shakespear fans 1 
i did not bother contacting the company for few dollar product but i learned the lesson that i should not have bought this form online anyway 0 
great phone 1 
unfortunately it will not recharge my iphone 4s despite connecting it from multiple power sources imac external battery wall outlet etc 0 
the service was a little slow considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace 0 
not much seafood and like 5 strings of pasta at the bottom 0 
god and i can never get that 90 minutes back 0 
i asked multiple times for the wine list and after some time of being ignored i went to the hostess and got one myself 0 
now you know why i gave it a 10 1 
the only thing worse than taylors acting was stanwycks singing 0 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
you need at least 3 mins to get to your phone book from the time you first turn on the phonebattery life is short 0 
i was shocked because no signs indicate cash only 0 
dont buy it 0 
all in all ha long bay was a bit of a flop 0 
my boyfriend and i came here for the first time on a recent trip to vegas and could not have been more pleased with the quality of food and service 1 
the acting as youd expect from this cast is top notch 1 
i felt as though her going to ireland did absolutely nothing whatsoever 0 
great product 1 
my 810 score is mostly for the plot 1 
worst thai ever 0 
what should have been a hilarious yummy christmas eve dinner to remember was the biggest fail of the entire trip for us 0 
im so sorry but i really cant recommend it to anyone 0 
i have tried these cables with my computer and my ipod and it works just fine 1 
voice quality signal strength dropped calls 0 
the poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying 0 
you can even take self portraits with the outside exterior display very cool 1 
what on earth is irons doing in this film 0 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
nice headset priced right 1 
and finally after all that we get to an ending that wouldve been great had it been handled by competent people and not jerry falwell 0 
oh yeah and the storyline was pathetic too 0 
mobile phone tools are a must have 1 
service is friendly and inviting 1 
dont go here 0 
give this one a look 1 
seller shipped quickly and much cheaper than the competitors 1 
after 3 months screen just went black all of a sudden 0 
good quality 1 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
excellent hands free tool 1 
i am going to have to be the first to negatively review this product 0 
excellent performance 1 
dont buy this product 0 
doesnt work 0 
just spicy enough perfect actually 1 
it was a great phone 1 
linked to my phone without effort 1 
never again will i be dining at this place 0 
its an empty hollow shell of a movie 0 
service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is vegas and located inside the crystals shopping mall by aria 1 
i also didnt like the on button it felt like it would crack with use 0 
these are certainly very comfortable and functionality is decent 1 
great product fast shipping 1 
disappointing accessory from a good manufacturer 0 
after 3 months screen just went black all of a sudden 0 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
it was just too horrible 0 
the plastic breaks really easy on this clip 0 
tom wilkinson broke my heart at the end and everyone elses judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike 1 
excellent phone 1 
call me a nut but i think this is one of the best movies ever 1 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
all in all its an insult to ones intelligence and a huge waste of money 0 
absolutel junk 0 
i got the car charger and not even after a week the charger was brokeni went to plug it in and it started smoking 0 
not my thing 0 
see it 1 
we recently witnessed her poor quality of management towards other guests as well 0 
this movie contained an allstar cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i havent seen before 1 
in a word it is embarrassing 0 
worse theres an incredibly weak subplot thrown in that follows a little band of latterday mansonites as they go after a reporter whos working on a story on the anniversary of the killings 0 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
sending it back 0 
my friend loved the salmon tartar 1 
this is hands down the best phone ive ever had 1 
very disappointed in accessoryone 0 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
sprint charges for this service 0 
i love lane but ive never seen her in a movie this lousy 0 
i love their fries and their beans 1 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
trumbull on i love lucy 1 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
they have been around for years and carries the highest quality of antiglare screen protector that i have found to date 1 
this convention never worked well in the past and certainly doesnt work here 0 
the warm beer didnt help 0 
doesnt work 0 
i also didnt like the on button it felt like it would crack with use 0 
for a self proclaimed coffee cafe i was wildly disappointed 0 
ray charles life provided excellent biographical material for the film which goes well beyond being just another movie about a musician 1 
i came back today since they relocated and still not impressed 0 
his losing his marbles so early in the proceedings is totally implausible and unconvincing 0 
we had a group of 70 when we claimed we would only have 40 and they handled us beautifully 1 
if you have several dozen or several hundred contacts then imagine the fun of sending each of them one by one 0 
there was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth but it didnt really work into the rest of the plot 0 
this phone is pretty sturdy and ive never had any large problems with it 1 
in fact its hard to remember that the part of ray charles is being acted and not played by the man himself 1 
he was extremely rude and really there are so many other restaurants i would love to dine at during a weekend in vegas 0 
i love the scream movies and all horror movies and this one ranks way up there 1 
omg the food was delicioso 1 
if you love death and decay and shakespears lyrics this is the one 1 
on a positive note our server was very attentive and provided great service 1 
ordered a double cheeseburger got a single patty that was falling apart picture uploaded yeah still sucks 0 
the food is about on par with dennys which is to say not good at all 0 
i do love sushi but i found kabuki to be overpriced overhip and underservices 0 
first of all there are enough racial stereotypes and racial jokes to offend everyone 0 
the writers were smack on and i think the best actors and actresses were a bonus to the showthese characters were so real 1 
my brother in law who works at the mall ate here same day and guess what he was sick all night too 0 
the acting as youd expect from this cast is top notch 1 
i really hope the team behind this movie makes more movies and that they will continue to do so in their own some kinda weird style 1 
see it with your kids if you have a chanceit will open up some amazing dialog about how far race relations have come in the last 50 years 1 
after the first charge kept going dead after 12 minutes 0 
its also great to see that renowned silent screenwriter frances marion hasnt missed a step going from silent to sound 1 
but this movie is definitely a below average rent 0 
bluetooth range is good a few days ago i left my phone in the trunk got a call and carried the conversation without a hitch 1 
the lighting is awful 0 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
five star plus plus 1 
so badwellits just bad 0 
i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
all in all id expected a better consumer experience from motorola 0 
a fantastic neighborhood gem 1 
go and see it 1 
very nice and relaxing late night viewing 1 
ive had this for nearly 2 years and it has worked great for me 1 
i probably wont be coming back here 0 
works great 1 
the attempts at humor were pitiful and story is so awful it dosent bear thinking about which basically involves a vulcan stealing the enterprise to find god seriously i just didnt care about any of this film and oh not to mention uhura does a belly dance to distract male guards 0 
items stated as included from the description are not included 0 
the movie is terribly boring in places 0 
the story is also both funny and poignant at times 1 
the plot was the same as pretty much every other cheap horror 0 
they have a plethora of salads and sandwiches and everything ive tried gets my seal of approval 1 
the plantains were the worst ive ever tasted 0 
first of all there are enough racial stereotypes and racial jokes to offend everyone 0 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
i dont know exactly what it is about this movie but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our familys memories 1 
they are so cool 1 
looks great and is strong 1 
the instruction manual is lacking 0 
down the drain because of a weak snap 0 
in summary this was a largely disappointing dining experience 0 
i was deeply impressed with the character he played 1 
mark my words this is one of those cult films like evil dead 2 or phantasm that people will still be discovering and falling in love with 20 30 40 years down the line 1 
i did not have any problem with this item and would order it again if needed 1 
i would definitely recommend the jabra bt250v for those who are looking for comfort clarity and a great price 1 
it failed to convey the broad sweep of landscapes that were a great part of the original 0 
cinematography the film was shot in an interesting way 1 
cant say enough good things about this place 1 
the inside is really quite nice and very clean 1 
add betty white and jean smart and you have a great cast everyone played their parts really well 1 
cinematography noteworthy including fine views of barcelona and its famed gaudi towers 1 
i received my orders well within the shipping timeframe everything was in good working order and overall i am very excited to have this source 1 
when a song could explain the emotions of the subjects better such as when jay adams unfortunate life was a subject of talk the song old man by neil young was played which evokes many emotions 1 
i have purchased these for both family and friends and all enjoy their clarity and ease of use 1 
the fish is badly made and some of its underwater shots are repeated a thousand times in the film 0 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
best ive found so far ive tried 2 other bluetooths and this one has the best quality for both me and the listener as well as ease of using 1 
even in my bmw 3 series which is fairly quiet i have trouble hearing what the other person is saying 0 
the phone gets extremely hot 0 
the service was great even the manager came and helped with our table 1 
garbo who showed right off the bat that her talents could carry over from the silent era i wanted to see some of her silent work but netflix doesnt seem to be stocking them 1 
judith light is one of my favorite actresses and i think she does a superb job in this film 1 
their steaks are 100 recommended 1 
nice solid keyboard 1 
the presentation of the food was awful 0 
so far it has worked like a charm 1 
it was packed 0 
does not fit 0 
when achille and philippa beautifully sing a duet from don giovanni that perfectly describes their situation in the movie you appreciate the subtle layers of this excellent film 1 
i liked it 1 
i never come again 0 
ryans bar is definitely one edinburgh establishment i wont be revisiting 0 
we definately enjoyed ourselves 1 
service is also cute 1 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
generally it just lacked imagination 0 
one of the worst shows of all time 0 
i found this place by accident and i could not be happier 1 
i hope this place sticks around 1 
dont go here 0 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
i dressed up to be treated so rudely 0 
and the beans and rice were mediocre at best 0 
in addition to having one of the most lovely songs ever written french cancan also boasts one of the cutest leading ladies ever to grace the screen 1 
i kept catching the cable on the seat and i had to pull the phone out to turn it on an off 0 
and it was way to expensive 0 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
the file browser offers all the options that one needshandsfree is great 1 
definitely will come back here again 1 
cooked to perfection and the service was impeccable 1 
i like armand assante my cable companys summary sounded interesting so i watched it twice already and probably will again 1 
battery is terrible 0 
the film has an ultracheap look to it 0 
disappointing experience 0 
other than that the leather is nice and soft the fit is very tight the cut out for the face is a good shape 1 
the ambience is wonderful and there is music playing 1 
that being said for a phone the camera is very nice many cool effects to play with and video is decent as well 1 
i recommend igo to anyone with different brand cell phonesmp3 players in the family 1 
the turkey and roast beef were bland 0 
very displeased 0 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
but this movie is not funny considering the ridiculousness of it 0 
tom wilkinson broke my heart at the end and everyone elses judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike 1 
there is a lot of beautiful places 1 
it showed exactly how the government and the scientist argued for humanity and the reasons of the gadget 1 
end of days is one of the worst bigbudget action movies ive ever seen 0 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
excellent bluetooth headset 1 
earbud piece breaks easily 0 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
as i said abovepretty useless 0 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
the acting is like watching wooden puppets moving around and reading from a book thats how bad it is 0 
stay away from this store be careful 0 
this film offers many delights and surprises 1 
first of all there are enough racial stereotypes and racial jokes to offend everyone 0 
the telephone repair man was really funny and his reactions to the nuts and bitchy boss were truly genuine 1 
but now i was completely grossed out 0 
just spicy enough perfect actually 1 
just does not work 0 
not good enough for the price 0 
the camera although rated at an impressive 13 megapixels renders images that fall well below expectations of such a relatively high resolution 0 
i love my 350 headset my jabra350 bluetooth headset is great the reception is very good and the ear piece is a comfortable fit 1 
disapointing results 0 
it is wonderful and inspiring to watch and i hope that it gets released again on to video or dvd 1 
i really loved the story line and the poler bear was kinda cutebut if anyone has a question about fort steele just ask away 1 
disappointing accessory from a good manufacturer 0 
very disappointed in accessoryone 0 
there is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again 0 
the waiter wasnt helpful or friendly and rarely checked on us 0 
i saw it as a child on tv back in 1973 when it was the stranger and i loved it 1 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
i loved it 1 
the steak was amazingrge fillet relleno was the best seafood plate i have ever had 1 
see it with your kids if you have a chanceit will open up some amazing dialog about how far race relations have come in the last 50 years 1 
i used bitpim a free program you can find on the internetto transfer data to the phonethe price of the cable was excellent 1 
my ribeye steak was cooked perfectly and had great mesquite flavor 1 
great movie 1 
good show samsung 1 
the food sucked which we expected but it sucked more than we could have imagined 0 
my headset works just peachykeen 1 
but then they came back cold 0 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
worst service to boot but that is the least of their worries 0 
one of the most disappointing aspects is the lack of notable gore 0 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
waaaaaayyyyyyyyyy over rated is all i am saying 0 
very good food great atmosphere1 1 
overall i am psyched to have a phone which has all my appointments and contacts in and gets great reception 1 
if this premise sound stupid thats because it is 0 
worst martini ever 0 
i would give this television series a 10 plus if i could 1 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
do not buy if you want to use the holster 0 
that was done in the second movie 0 
my only problem is i thought the actor playing the villain was a low rent michael ironside 0 
the food was delicious our bartender was attentive and personable and we got a great deal 1 
there is a lot of beautiful places 1 
i would not recommend this place 0 
if it were possible to give them zero stars theyd have it 0 
the service was terrible though 0 
there is however some pretty good acting at least for this type of film 1 
to be honest with you this is unbelievable nonsense and very foolish 0 
overall a great experience 1 
my experience was terrible this was my fourth bluetooth headset and while it was much more comfortable than my last jabra which i hated 0 
i wouldnt see this movie again for free 0 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
i came back today since they relocated and still not impressed 0 
very good stuff for the price 1 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
this place receives stars for their appetizers 1 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
our server was super nice and checked on us many times 1 
im glad the film didnt go for the most obvious choice as a lesser film certainly would have 1 
no shifting no bubbling no peeling not even a scratch nothingi couldnt be more happier with my new one for the droid 1 
all in all i can assure you ill be back 1 
bad fit way too big 0 
however paul schrader has indeed made a film about mishima that is both superb complex 1 
will not be back 0 
for those that havent seen it dont waste your time 0 
not good when wearing a hat or sunglasses 0 
once you get inside youll be impressed with the place 1 
im trying to return it for a refund 0 
if you love death and decay and shakespears lyrics this is the one 1 
not tasty and the texture was just nasty 0 
i will not return 0 
the headset fulfills my requirements so i am happy with my purchase 1 
the noise shield is incrediable 1 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
the awful dialogue and hopeless overacting by everyone who gets shot top off a real waste of space and time 0 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
the headset fulfills my requirements so i am happy with my purchase 1 
i as well wouldve given godfathers zero stars if possible 0 
all i have to say is the food was amazing 1 
see it 1 
waste of 13 bucks 0 
oh yeah and the storyline was pathetic too 0 
but if you liked movies like the matrix and better yet their sequels i think youll appreciate the thought provoking mindblowing experience this film will give you 1 
worst phone ever 0 
the spaghetti is nothing special whatsoever 0 
good food good service 1 
bluetooth does not work phone locks up screens just flash up and now it just makes calls randomly while in my pocket locked 0 
razr battery good buy 1 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
this item is great installed it let it charged up overnite and it has been working good every since with no problems 1 
has been working great 1
