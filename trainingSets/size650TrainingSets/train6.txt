the death row scenes were entirely unmoving 0 
service is perfect and the family atmosphere is nice to see 1 
the only very disappointing thing was there was no speakerphone 0 
i bought this phone as a replacement for my startac and have regretted it since 0 
the ripped banana was not only ripped but petrified and tasteless 0 
the biggest complaint i have is the battery drains superfast 0 
its a great tool for entertainment communication and data managementoh be sure to use activesync 42 for optimal data synchronization results 1 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
if you havent gone here go now 1 
the service here leaves a lot to be desired 0 
the phone was unusable and was not new 0 
now the burgers arent as good the pizza which used to be amazing is doughy and flavorless 0 
i work in the hospitality industry in paradise valley and have refrained from recommending cibo any longer 0 
i tried talking real loud but shouting on the telephone gets old and i was still told it wasnt great 0 
the staff was very attentive 1 
it dit not work most of the time with my nokia 5320 0 
awesome device 1 
i promise they wont disappoint 1 
but what really made it unwatchable was the direction 0 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
customer service was terrible 0 
its just lame 0 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
perfect for the ps3 1 
waitress was sweet and funny 1 
i give wirefly 1 stari will contact cingularatt and inform them of this practice 0 
interesting decor 1 
great phone 1 
lucy bell is so much higher than this crap and for her to sink this low is quite depressing 0 
the only suspense i was feeling was the frustration at just how retarded the girls were 0 
the food was delicious our bartender was attentive and personable and we got a great deal 1 
the service was outshining i definitely recommend the halibut 1 
its the best headset i have used 1 
phone now holds charge like it did when it was new 1 
it was clear that she had the range and ability to pull off this part 1 
not too screamy not to masculine but just right 1 
the jabra eargels fit my ears very well 1 
if this premise sound stupid thats because it is 0 
today was my first taste of a buldogis gourmet hot dog and i have to tell you it was more than i ever thought possible 1 
other than that the leather is nice and soft the fit is very tight the cut out for the face is a good shape 1 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
i have never had such bland food which surprised me considering the article we read focused so much on their spices and flavor 0 
worst martini ever 0 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
the film deserves strong kudos for taking this stand for having exceptional acting from its mostly lesserknown cast and for the superintelligent script that doesnt insult the audience or take the easy way out when it comes to white racism 1 
it was so bad i had lost the heart to finish it 0 
the sound is clear and the people i talk to on it are amazed at the quality too 1 
what a great double cheeseburger 1 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
however the ear pads come off easily and after only one week i lost one 0 
and then tragedy struck 0 
i wouldnt see this movie again for free 0 
if you see it you should probably just leave it on the shelf 0 
this is definitely one of the better documentaries i have seen looking at family relationships and marriage 1 
one of the most disappointing aspects is the lack of notable gore 0 
both do good jobs and are quite amusing 1 
20th century foxs road house 1948 is not only quite a silly noir but is an implausible unmitigated bore of a movie 0 
great place to eat reminds me of the little mom and pop shops in the san francisco bay area 1 
id like to return it 0 
my sanyo has survived dozens of drops on blacktop without ill effect 1 
i have yet to run this new battery below two bars and thats three days without charging 1 
i also didnt like the on button it felt like it would crack with use 0 
the malta settings are as dry and as barren as the dialogue 0 
restored my phone to like new performance 1 
highly unprofessional and rude to a loyal patron 0 
these headphones were a great find and i think they are perhaps the best purchase ive made in the last several years seriously 1 
the food is about on par with dennys which is to say not good at all 0 
the potato chip order was sad i could probably count how many chips were in that box and it was probably around 12 0 
but what really made it unwatchable was the direction 0 
waited 2 hours never got either of our pizzas as many other around us who came in later did 0 
a great touch 1 
the visual effects were awful 0 
it was delicious 1 
dee snider just plain sucks 0 
what a big waste of time 0 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
omelets are to die for 1 
horrible dont waste your time and money 0 
a great film by a great director 1 
the phone was unusable and was not new 0 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
this is a beautiful phone 1 
excellent hands free tool 1 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
the owner used to work at nobu so this place is really similar for half the price 1 
its a sad movie but very good 1 
a great way to finish a great 1 
i had the chicken pho and it tasted very bland 0 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
comes with a strong light that you can use to light up your camera shots and even flash sos signals seriously 1 
the greek dressing was very creamy and flavorful 1 
a good quality bargain i bought this after i bought a cheapy from big lots that sounded awful and people on the other end couldnt hear me 1 
stay away from this store be careful 0 
otherwise easy to install and use clear sound 1 
was not happy 0 
the directing and the cinematography arent quite as good 0 
i might have gotten a defect but i would not risk buying it again because of the built quality alone 0 
the salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop which was perfectly cooked 1 
wont ever go here again 0 
everyone is very attentive providing excellent customer service 1 
i am not a filmmaker nor am i a director but i would hide my head in the sand if id spent whatever amount of money and time on this movie 0 
my phone doesnt slide around my car now and the grip prevents my phone from slipping out of my hand 1 
not a pleasant voyage of selfdiscovery 0 
go rent it 1 
a piece of junk that broke after being on my phone for 2 days 0 
highly entertaining at all angles 1 
avoid at all costs 0 
the plot well i said id let that one go 0 
its a case of so bad it is laughable 0 
the service was great even the manager came and helped with our table 1 
i had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get some relief 0 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
however after finally watching this film i realized that not only had i had a closed mind to the brilliance it depicts i also found myself watching it over and over again 1 
very good lunch spot 1 
first time going but i think i will quickly become a regular 1 
but in terms of the writing its very fresh and bold 1 
piece of trash 0 
it is unusable in a moving car at freeway speed 0 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
worth every penny 1 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
once you get inside youll be impressed with the place 1 
brilliance indeed 1 
the dining space is tiny but elegantly decorated and comfortable 1 
walked in and the place smelled like an old grease trap and only 2 others there eating 0 
the staff are also very friendly and efficient 1 
a very good film indeed about great and unconditional love 1 
i dont think ill be running back to carlys anytime soon for food 0 
overpriced for what you are getting 0 
a greasy unhealthy meal 0 
i can think of no other film where something vitally important occurs every other minute 1 
i loved it 1 
the best electronics of the available fm transmitters 1 
the sound quality for the device is unacceptableunless you are in a really quiet area you almost hear nothing 0 
dont buy this product 0 
sam shepards portrayal of a gung ho marine was sobering 1 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
the bathroom is just next door and very nice 1 
poor product 0 
unfortunately this is a bad movie that is just plain bad 0 
i couldnt think of a better way to end the film but a smile on my face great way to wrap up an amazing film and trilogy 1 
its a great tool for entertainment communication and data managementoh be sure to use activesync 42 for optimal data synchronization results 1 
good food good service 1 
i love the camera its really pretty good quality 1 
you have to hold the phone at a particular angle for the other party to hear you clearly 0 
after a year the battery went completely dead on my headset 0 
fits comfortably came with three sizes of earbud tips 1 
frozen pucks of disgust with some of the worst people behind the register 0 
ive tried several different earpieces for my cell phone and this jabra one is the first one ive found that fits my ear comfortably 1 
this is not moviemaking 0 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
there is no real plot 0 
eew this location needs a complete overhaul 0 
great brunch spot 1 
what makes this story different are the terrific production values faultless photography composition and editing the terrific casting the underappreciated brian keith playing a bully teddy and vivid history 1 
there is a totally unnecessary trainroller coaster scene 0 
the cocktails are all handmade and delicious 1 
i keep watching it over and over 1 
dont buy this product 0 
of course the acting is blah 0 
my fiancé and i came in the middle of the day and we were greeted and seated right away 1 
light weight i hardly notice it is there 1 
a film not easily forgotten 1 
i dont know what the big deal is about this place but i wont be back yaall 0 
generous portions and great taste 1 
the best part about nurse betty is its unpredictability 1 
gets a signal when other verizon phones wont 1 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
highly recommended for all ages although the younger set will probably not appreciate some of the more subtle references they will certainly appreciate one galley scene in particular 1 
the movie showed a lot of florida at its best made it look very appealing 1 
the bathroom is just next door and very nice 1 
terrible my car will not accept this cassette 0 
the poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying 0 
definitely a turn off for me i doubt ill be back unless someone else is buying 0 
the majority of the logitech earbud headsets failed 0 
i love this thing 1 
as for the mains also uninspired 0 
just really good so far probably the best bt headset i have ever had 1 
i hate those things as much as cheap quality black olives 0 
very nice and relaxing late night viewing 1 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
gotta love those closeups of slimy drooling teeth 1 
there is however some pretty good acting at least for this type of film 1 
def coming back to bowl next time 1 
this was a poor remake of my best friends wedding 0 
i was particularly pleased with the acting ability of dwight schultz 1 
lasted one day and then blew up 0 
i received my orders well within the shipping timeframe everything was in good working order and overall i am very excited to have this source 1 
what a great double cheeseburger 1 
dont do it 0 
i would advise to not purchase this item it never worked very well 0 
seriously its not worth wasting your or your kids time on 0 
i kept catching the cable on the seat and i had to pull the phone out to turn it on an off 0 
chinese forgeries abound 0 
i had heard good things about this place but it exceeding every hope i could have dreamed of 1 
the cg opening sequence in space looked like it could have been created on microsoft slideshow for gods sake 0 
he is one of my favourite directors and one of the most talented directors in the history of cinema 1 
nice solid keyboard 1 
some great music and terrific scenery 1 
i hate movies like that 0 
dont waste your time 0 
none of it works just dont buy it 0 
the staff was very attentive 1 
we made the drive all the way from north scottsdale and i was not one bit disappointed 1 
the best place in vegas for breakfast just check out a sat or sun 1 
bad script bad direction and horrible acting make this one plain bad 0 
that was nice 1 
this is my new fav vegas buffet spot 1 
waitress was a little slow in service 0 
very much disappointed with this company 0 
i saw mirrormask last night and it was an unsatisfactory experience 0 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
it looks very nice 1 
i must say i have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again 1 
but when i check voice mail at night the keypad backlight turns off a few seconds into the first message and then im lost 0 
the biggest complaint i have is the battery drains superfast 0 
love the margaritas too 1 
worth every penny 1 
some great music and terrific scenery 1 
an extensive menu provides lots of options for breakfast 1 
the film succeeds despite or perhaps because of an obviously meagre budget 1 
you wont forget this movie 1 
well never go again 0 
just dont know why they were so slow 0 
they do not care about the consumer one bit 0 
it just blew 0 
i could not stand to even watch it for very long for fear of losing iq 0 
and those baby owls were adorable 1 
this place receives stars for their appetizers 1 
the problem was the script 0 
the film has great actors a master director a significant themeat least a wouldbe significant theme undertone of fifties existential worldweariness aerial scenes that ought to have thrilled both senses and imagination and characters about which one might deeply care 1 
all in all i can assure you ill be back 1 
im trying to return it for a refund 0 
will not be back 0 
but this movie is definitely a below average rent 0 
it also took her forever to bring us the check when we asked for it 0 
great product and price 1 
the fried rice was dry as well 0 
this is an excellent film 1 
the foreigner is not worth one second of your time 0 
i great reception all the time 1 
but then they came back cold 0 
the ambience is wonderful and there is music playing 1 
you share general loewenhielms exquisite joy in his partaking of the cailles en sarcophage even though you are just watching a movie but you do wish for just a small sample to savor 1 
everything captain howdy says is either laughable or just plain stupid 0 
the holster that arrived did not match the photo in the ad 0 
i ordered this for sony ericsson w810i but i think it only worked once thats when i first used it 0 
it was a great phone 1 
my salad had a bland vinegrette on the baby greens and hearts of palm 0 
a very good film indeed about great and unconditional love 1 
this review is long overdue since i consider a tale of two sisters to be the single greatest film ever made 1 
they have a plethora of salads and sandwiches and everything ive tried gets my seal of approval 1 
love this place hits the spot when i want something healthy but not lacking in quantity or flavor 1 
gave up trying to eat any of the crust teeth still sore 0 
jamie foxx absolutely is ray charles 1 
sooooo good 1 
i wont be back 0 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
that was funny 1 
highly recommended a 1 
everything stinks 0 
very cheap plastic creaks like an old wooden floor 0 
after one bite i was hooked 1 
i really wanted the plantronics 510 to be the right one but it has too many issues for methe good 0 
and service was super friendly 1 
the food was outstanding and the prices were very reasonable 1 
but when i check voice mail at night the keypad backlight turns off a few seconds into the first message and then im lost 0 
if you see it you should probably just leave it on the shelf 0 
my brother in law who works at the mall ate here same day and guess what he was sick all night too 0 
this is truly an art movieit actually has a lot of art in it 1 
do not waste your money here 0 
then i exchanged for the same phone even that had the same problem 0 
the kids are very cool too 1 
it is so small and you dont even realize that it is there after a while of getting used to it 1 
the calls drop the phone comes on and off at will the screen goes black and the worst of all it stops ringing intermittently 0 
do not waste your money here 0 
extremely tasty 1 
reaching for the bottom row is uncomfortable and the send and end keys are not where i expect them to be3 0 
very disappointed and wondered how it could be in the oscar shortlist 0 
not even a hello we will be right with you 0 
but its just not funny 0 
there are so many problems i dont know where to start 0 
a good time 1 
go to place for gyros 1 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
also its a real treat to see anthony quinn playing crazy horse 1 
i purchased this and within 2 days it was no longer working 0 
an amazing finale to possibly the best trilogy of all time 1 
doesnt last long 0 
the company shipped my product very promptly and it works well 1 
i would recommend this 1 
their monster chicken fried steak and eggs is my all time favorite 1 
i was particularly pleased with the acting ability of dwight schultz 1 
just dont know why they were so slow 0 
stay away from this store be careful 0 
this product is great it makes working a lot easier i can go to the copier while waiting on hold for something 1 
works good 1 
i did not bother contacting the company for few dollar product but i learned the lesson that i should not have bought this form online anyway 0 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
down the drain because of a weak snap 0 
not recommended 0 
its not hard to make a decent hamburger 0 
how awful she is 0 
very unreliable service from tmobile 0 
the cashew cream sauce was bland and the vegetables were undercooked 0 
a must study for anyone interested in the worst sins of industrial design 0 
i liked it 1 
people who like european films and art movies will like this movie 1 
the memories are murky but i can only say that i enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show 1 
see it 1 
great earpiece 1 
it was a pale color instead of nice and char and has no flavor 0 
nice sound 1 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
i have to use the smallest earpieces provided but it stays on pretty well 1 
i love the scream movies and all horror movies and this one ranks way up there 1 
did not like at all 0 
a good quality bargain i bought this after i bought a cheapy from big lots that sounded awful and people on the other end couldnt hear me 1 
the movie seemed a little slow at first 0 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
the staff are also very friendly and efficient 1 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
but kevin spacey is an excellent verbal tsunami as buddy ackerman  and totally believable because he is a great actor 1 
im not impressed with the concept or the food 0 
the plug did not work very well 0 
an hour and a half i wish i could bring back 0 
i was very excited to get this headset because i thought it was really cute 1 
seller shipped quickly and much cheaper than the competitors 1 
im glad i found this product on amazon it is hard to find it wasnt high priced 1 
treo and tmobile refused to replace it again and forced me to buy another phone without any kind of upgrade discount 0 
the good cinematography also makes her and monica bellucci look very beautiful 1 
they dropped more than the ball 0 
the seller is very understanding and patient i would definitely buy from them again 1 
the lighting is just dark enough to set the mood 1 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
i could barely stomach the meal but didnt complain because it was a business lunch 0 
the building itself seems pretty neat the bathroom is pretty trippy but i wouldnt eat here again 0 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
you share general loewenhielms exquisite joy in his partaking of the cailles en sarcophage even though you are just watching a movie but you do wish for just a small sample to savor 1 
do not waste your time 0 
a great film by a great director 1 
not good for the money 0 
comfortable nice range good battery life 1 
my headset works just peachykeen 1 
very satisifed with that 1 
what i really like there is the crepe station 1 
i waited and waited 0 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
i believe the screenwriter did a good job of tying up the loose ends 1 
bad choice 0 
service is friendly and inviting 1 
very disappointing 0 
it ranks highly as a great noircrimedrama incredible performances by belmondo and lino ventura 1 
the story is beyond stupid 0 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
they do not care about the consumer one bit 0 
the cow tongue and cheek tacos are amazing 1 
im trying to return it for a refund 0 
good works fine 1 
i knew when i saw the film that more great things were to come from this gifted actor 1 
will not be back 0 
there is nothing privileged about workingeating there 0 
the cinematography is simply stunning to say the least and the fx are nothing if not stateoftheart 1 
great pizza and salads 1 
just dont know why they were so slow 0 
for the price on amazon it is an excellent product which i would highly recommend 1 
about ten minutes into this film i started having second thoughts 0 
would recommend this item 1 
iam very pleased with my purchase 1 
those burgers were amazing 1 
the stories were powerful explorations of the nature of man and of art 1 
and service was super friendly 1 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
the music in the film is really nice too 1 
the acting sucked 0 
lordy the khao soi is a dish that is not to be missed for curry lovers 1 
awesome selection of beer 1 
ample portions and good prices 1 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
maybe its just their vegetarian fare but ive been twice and i thought it was average at best 0 
food was really boring 0 
bt50 battery junk 0 
excellent short film 1 
do not make the same mistake as me 0 
2 thumbs up 1 
there is nothing authentic about this place 0 
the worst was the salmon sashimi 0 
my sister has one also and she loves it 1 
i was totally fascinated by the music the dancing everything 1 
not easy to watch 0 
does not fit 0 
the real killer is the volume and of course it breaking 0 
then our food came out disappointment ensued 0 
bt50 battery junk 0 
their onscreen chemistry critical to the entire film is genuine 1 
seller shipped quickly and much cheaper than the competitors 1 
the cinematography is simply stunning to say the least and the fx are nothing if not stateoftheart 1 
thanks good a movie like this was done and released 1 
cool phone 1 
someone shouldve invented this sooner 1 
i would advise to not purchase this item it never worked very well 0 
the food came out at a good pace 1 
im glad i found this product on amazon it is hard to find it wasnt high priced 1 
the only thing really worth watching was the scenery and the house because it is beautiful 1 
all in all im quite satisfied with this purchase 1 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
the story itself is just predictable and lazy 0 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
very clear quality sound and you dont have to mess with the sound on your ipod since you have the sound buttons on the headset 1 
the cg opening sequence in space looked like it could have been created on microsoft slideshow for gods sake 0 
thanks good a movie like this was done and released 1 
ordered burger rare came in well done 0 
light weight i hardly notice it is there 1 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
i really like this product over the motorola because it is allot clearer on the ear piece and the mic 1 
the spaghetti is nothing special whatsoever 0 
its also great to see that renowned silent screenwriter frances marion hasnt missed a step going from silent to sound 1 
pricing is a bit of a concern at mellow mushroom 0 
my only complaint is the standard sound volume is a little low even when turned up to 5of 5 0 
i was disgusted because i was pretty sure that was human hair 0 
my salad had a bland vinegrette on the baby greens and hearts of palm 0 
the hockey scenes are terrible defensemen playing like theyre 5 years old goalies diving at shots that are 10 feet wide of the net etc 0 
all the bread is made inhouse 1 
razr battery good buy 1 
they are so cool 1 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
then i watched it again two sundays ago march 20th 2005 and i began to really enjoy it and this time i taped the entire thing 1 
its a piece of crap 0 
the only thing that i think could improve is the sound leaks out from the headset 0 
schrader has made a resume full of lousy amateurish films 0 
unfortunately the ability to actually know you are receiving a call is a rather important feature and this phone is pitiful in that respect 0 
the very idea of it was lame take a minor character from a mediocre pg13 film and make a complete nonsequel while changing its tone to a pgrated family movie 0 
pretty piece of junk 0 
product is exactly as described 1 
i like armand assante my cable companys summary sounded interesting so i watched it twice already and probably will again 1 
we watched our waiter pay a lot more attention to other tables and ignore us 0 
food was really good and i got full petty fast 1 
avoid this establishment 0 
the characters were all funny and had the peculiarity of not having a true lead character 1 
if i take a picture the battery drops a bar and starts beeping letting me know its dieing 0 
it was probably dirt 0 
the han nan chicken was also very tasty 1 
i liked the patio and the service was outstanding 1 
ray charles is legendary 1 
check it out 1 
the transfers are very good 1 
ive had this bluetoooth headset for some time now and still not comfortable with the way it fits on the ear 0 
i hope this place sticks around 1 
i really wanted the plantronics 510 to be the right one but it has too many issues for methe good 0 
due to this happening on every call i was forced to stop using this headset 0 
however my girl was complain that some time the phone doesnt wake up like normal phone does 0 
this was reflected not only in the cast but also in the belowpar script which borrowed much from the earlier classic 0 
bad quality 0 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
fast service 1 
i have never had such bland food which surprised me considering the article we read focused so much on their spices and flavor 0 
i purchased this and within 2 days it was no longer working 0 
i couldnt think of a better way to end the film but a smile on my face great way to wrap up an amazing film and trilogy 1 
i was very disappointed 0 
but the convoluted plot just didnt convince me and much of the film was watched with a weird questioning glance 0 
today was my first taste of a buldogis gourmet hot dog and i have to tell you it was more than i ever thought possible 1 
disappointed 0 
just dont know why they were so slow 0 
i can barely ever hear on it and am constantly saying what 0 
steer clear of this product and go with the genuine palm replacementr pens which come in a threepack 0 
it was forced like everything in this movie 0 
brilliance indeed 1 
i wear glasses and it fits fine with them 1 
the food is about on par with dennys which is to say not good at all 0 
the food is very good for your typical bar food 1 
this is a simple little phone to use but the breakage is unacceptible 0 
wow loved this place 1 
whatever prompted such a documentary is beyond me 0 
the atmosphere was great with a lovely duo of violinists playing songs we requested 1 
their daily specials are always a hit with my group 1 
i dont think it would hold it too securly on your belt 0 
great brunch spot 1 
i loved it 1 
penne vodka excellent 1 
a usable keyboard actually turns a pda into a realworld useful machine instead of just a neat gadget 1 
the fried rice was dry as well 0 
the bus boy on the other hand was so rude 0 
you could only take 2 videos at a time and the quality was very poor 0 
on three different occasions i asked for well done or medium well and all three times i got the bloodiest piece of meat on my plate 0 
product is exactly as described 1 
ill put this gem up against any movie in terms of screenplay cinematography acting postproduction editing directing or any other aspect of filmmaking 1 
the acting was bad 0 
this is definitely a cult classic well worth viewing and sharing with others 1 
omit watching this 0 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
waitress was good though 1 
i wont spoil it but the ending in pretty amazing 1 
eew this location needs a complete overhaul 0 
it features an outlandish array of memorable psychotic but lovable nuts 1 
i didnt know pulled pork could be soooo delicious 1 
lame would be the best way to describe it 0 
go rent it 1 
not impressed 0 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
im probably one of the few people to ever go to ians and not like it 0 
well just if you keep thinking how bad it is 0 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
poor voice clarity 0 
the block was amazing 1 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
you could drive a semi truck into these holes 0 
the malta settings are as dry and as barren as the dialogue 0 
how can anyone in their right mind ask for anything more from a movie than this 1 
graphics is far from the best part of the game 0 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
the place was fairly clean but the food simply wasnt worth it 0 
what a mistake that was 0 
the only thing that i think could improve is the sound leaks out from the headset 0 
needless to say i wont be going back anytime soon 0 
the pancake was also really good and pretty large at that 1 
i hope this place sticks around 1 
waaaaaayyyyyyyyyy over rated is all i am saying 0 
it was a pale color instead of nice and char and has no flavor 0 
camerawork again bad 0 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
if you simply want a small flip phone look elsewhere as the extra bells whistles are mediocre 0 
it was too predictable even for a chick flick 0 
the memories are murky but i can only say that i enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show 1 
im not impressed with the concept or the food 0 
eclectic selection 1 
but it is great i would really recommend it 1 
the movie had you on the edge of your seat and made you somewhat afraid to go to your car at the end of the night 1 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
after a year the battery went completely dead on my headset 0 
not a good bargain 0 
unfortunately cover girl is an example of how hollywood used to exploit women for financial gain 0 
its a mediocre miserable hollow laughable and predictable piece of garbage 0 
and the sound quality is great 1 
worst phone ever 0 
this place deserves no stars 0 
it was a drive to get there 0 
pricing is a bit of a concern at mellow mushroom 0 
come hungry leave happy and stuffed 1 
this movie contained an allstar cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i havent seen before 1 
i think i was one of the people who found this another one of roths pearls 1 
everything about this product is wrongfirst 0 
the foreigner is not worth one second of your time 0 
but despite these few flaws this case is of exceptional quality and well worth the additional costs of owning an official oem product 1 
otherwise dont even waste your time on this 0 
the film succeeds despite or perhaps because of an obviously meagre budget 1 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
the poor actors 0 
the croutons also taste homemade which is an extra plus 1 
a must study for anyone interested in the worst sins of industrial design 0 
by this time our side of the restaurant was almost empty so there was no excuse 0 
this blueant supertooth handsfree phone speaker is awesome 1 
the cow tongue and cheek tacos are amazing 1 
its too bad that everyone else involved didnt share crowes level of dedication to quality for if they did wed have a far better film on our hands than this subpar mess 0 
an interesting premise and billy drago is always good as a dangerous nutbag side note id love to see drago stephen mchattie and lance hendrikson in a flick together talk about raging cheekbones 1 
i received it quickly and it works great 1 
love the margaritas too 1 
this movie is so awesome 1 
i am very impressed with this headset from plantronics 1 
it has everything i need and i couldnt ask for more 1 
this place has it 1 
the waitress was friendly and happy to accomodate for veganveggie options 1 
they are so easy to love but even more easy to identify with 1 
there was no chemistry between ben affleck and sandra bullock in this film and i couldnt understand why he would consider even leaving his wifetobe for this chick that he supposedly was knocked out by 0 
the only thing i wasnt too crazy about was their guacamole as i dont like it puréed 0 
his losing his marbles so early in the proceedings is totally implausible and unconvincing 0 
if you want a sandwich just go to any firehouse 1 
cant get the software to work with my computer 0 
the place was fairly clean but the food simply wasnt worth it 0 
avoid at all costs 0 
the price is reasonable and the service is great 1 
black water is a thriller that manages to completely transcend its limitations its an indie flick by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience 1 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
what makes this story different are the terrific production values faultless photography composition and editing the terrific casting the underappreciated brian keith playing a bully teddy and vivid history 1 
they have horrible attitudes towards customers and talk down to each one when customers dont enjoy their food 0 
they work about 2 weeks then break 0 
at first glance it is a lovely bakery cafe nice ambiance clean friendly staff 1 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
this film has no redeeming features 0 
stay away from the q 0 
this movie is bad 0 
i advise everyone do not be fooled 0 
excellent hands free tool 1 
i highly recommend this case 1 
there is really nothing for me at postinos hope your experience is better 0 
terrible phone holder 0 
the poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying 0 
perabo has a nice energy level and is obviously very comfortable in front of a camera 1 
the mic is great 1 
so absolutley fantastic 1 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
this may be the only bad film he ever made 0 
although i very much liked the look and sound of this place the actual experience was a bit disappointing 0 
so bad 0 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
they were goldencrispy and delicious 1 
exactly what i wanted 1 
i used bitpim a free program you can find on the internetto transfer data to the phonethe price of the cable was excellent 1 
the success of the film depends on the casting of sydney greenstreet as the alexander yardley character 1 
about ten minutes into this film i started having second thoughts 0 
you cant beat that 1 
this phone is slim and light and the display is beautiful 1 
last time buying from you 0 
this is one of the best italian thrillers of the early 70s 1 
the desserts were a bit strange 0 
verizon tech support walked my through a few procedures none of which worked and i ended up having to do a hard reset wiping out all my data 0 
we asked for the bill to leave without eating and they didnt bring that either 0 
i could not recommend these more 0 
the text messaging feature is really tricky to use 0 
keep up the good work amazon 1 
its just painful 0 
so for our enjoyment we get to see them run around play games and be dangerous 1 
i loved their mussels cooked in this wine reduction the duck was tender and their potato dishes were delicious 1 
highly recommended for all ages although the younger set will probably not appreciate some of the more subtle references they will certainly appreciate one galley scene in particular 1 
what makes this story different are the terrific production values faultless photography composition and editing the terrific casting the underappreciated brian keith playing a bully teddy and vivid history 1 
my breakfast was perpared great with a beautiful presentation of 3 giant slices of toast lightly dusted with powdered sugar 1 
great phone 1 
this is an outstanding little restaurant with some of the best food i have ever tasted 1 
the success of the film depends on the casting of sydney greenstreet as the alexander yardley character 1 
overall i like this place a lot 1 
i was so insulted 0 
i let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this bad idea we both hated it 0 
dont buy it 0 
it was a waste of my money 0 
a good quality bargain i bought this after i bought a cheapy from big lots that sounded awful and people on the other end couldnt hear me 1 
overall a delight 1 
i did not expect this to be so good 1 
just does not work 0 
comfortable fit you need your headset to be comfortable for at least an hour at a time if not for an entire day 1 
the only thing i wasnt too crazy about was their guacamole as i dont like it puréed 0 
server did a great job handling our large rowdy table 1 
comfortable in my hand 1 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
what happened next was prettyoff putting 0 
once your food arrives its meh 0 
how can you call yourself a steakhouse if you cant properly cook a steak i dont understand 0 
i wear glasses and it fits fine with them 1 
this early film from future goremeister lucio fulci is a very good addition to the giallo subgenre 1 
gotta love those closeups of slimy drooling teeth 1 
good works fine 1 
i go to far too many places and ive never seen any restaurant that serves a 1 egg breakfast especially for 400 0 
i have always used corded headsets and the freedom from the wireless is very helpful 1 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
im trying to return it for a refund 0 
dee snider just plain sucks 0
