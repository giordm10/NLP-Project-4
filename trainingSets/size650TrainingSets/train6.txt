headset works great was packaged nicely to avoid any damage 1 
you will leave the theater wanting to go out and dance under the stars 1 
the acting was bad the dialogs were extremely shallow and insincere 0 
good service very clean and inexpensive to boot 1 
good case excellent value 1 
other than that the leather is nice and soft the fit is very tight the cut out for the face is a good shape 1 
my headset works just peachykeen 1 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
painful on the ear 0 
the vanilla ice cream was creamy and smooth while the profiterole choux pastry was fresh enough 1 
everything about it is fine and reasonable for the price ie 1 
greatno problems at all 1 
greatno problems at all 1 
the battery works great 1 
looks great and is strong 1 
insults profound deuchebaggery and had to go outside for a smoke break while serving just to solidify it 0 
this movie is so awesome 1 
it definitely was not as good as my s11 1 
i wasnt really impressed with strip steak 0 
great phone 1 
unfortunately it did not work 0 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
this is a really fantastic thai restaurant which is definitely worth a visit 1 
lot of holes in the plot theres nothing about how he became the emperor nothing about where he spend 20 years between his childhood and mature age 0 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
incredible 1 
as for the mains also uninspired 0 
this is a great place to eat 1 
it was packed 0 
everything about this movie is stupid 0 
i dont think you will be disappointed 1 
freezes frequently4 0 
good show samsung 1 
looks great and is strong 1 
it just blew 0 
the best place in vegas for breakfast just check out a sat or sun 1 
good show samsung 1 
today was my first taste of a buldogis gourmet hot dog and i have to tell you it was more than i ever thought possible 1 
the tracfonewebsite is user friendly and makes it easy toactivate etc 1 
but i thought his acting was skilled 1 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
join the club and get awesome offers via email 1 
the fried rice was dry as well 0 
i would not recommend this place 0 
it was a pale color instead of nice and char and has no flavor 0 
i advise everyone do not be fooled 0 
see it with your kids if you have a chanceit will open up some amazing dialog about how far race relations have come in the last 50 years 1 
his losing his marbles so early in the proceedings is totally implausible and unconvincing 0 
garbo who showed right off the bat that her talents could carry over from the silent era i wanted to see some of her silent work but netflix doesnt seem to be stocking them 1 
its just lame 0 
having to humour him just to get by and get through the day was so apt 1 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
i totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is 1 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
now this is a movie i really dislike 0 
buyer beware you could flush money right down the toilet 0 
i think not again 0 
battery life is also great 1 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
but even the talented carrell cant save this 0 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
there is nothing authentic about this place 0 
this phone might well be the worst ive ever had in any brand 0 
the ambience is wonderful and there is music playing 1 
which has more depth and character than the man underneath it 0 
items stated as included from the description are not included 0 
i understand that its supposed to be a cheap popcorn comedy but that doesnt mean that it has to completely insult our intelligence and have writing so incredibly hackneyed that it borders on offensive 0 
this phone works great 1 
the cast was great 1 
best of all is the rotating feature very helpful 1 
we arent ones to make a scene at restaurants but i just dont get itdefinitely lost the love after this one 0 
down the drain because of a weak snap 0 
this is a chilly unremarkable movie about an author livingworking in a chilly abstruse culture 0 
drinks took close to 30 minutes to come out at one point 0 
this phone is pretty sturdy and ive never had any large problems with it 1 
needless to say we will never be back here again 0 
i thought it was bad 0 
regrettably the film fails 0 
this is an excellent film 1 
the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach 0 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
this second appearance of mickey mouse following the silent plane crazy earlier that year is probably his most famous filmmostly because it was so groundbreaking 1 
nice docking station for home or work 1 
i hate movies like that 0 
his losing his marbles so early in the proceedings is totally implausible and unconvincing 0 
what a disappointment 0 
buyer beware you could flush money right down the toilet 0 
i really enjoyed eating here 1 
your servers suck wait correction our server heimer sucked 0 
i still maintain that monkeys shouldnt make headphones we just obviously dont share enough dna to copy the design over to humans 0 
easily none other cartoon made me laugh in a tender way before getting into dark sitcoms oriented for teenagers 1 
host staff were for lack of a better word bitches 0 
this pair of headphones is the worst that i have ever had soundwise 0 
i love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it 1 
there is no plot here to keep you going in the first place 0 
good works fine 1 
i ordered this for sony ericsson w810i but i think it only worked once thats when i first used it 0 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
for the price on amazon it is an excellent product which i would highly recommend 1 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
they could be used as exemplars for any set designer 1 
the warmth it generates is in contrast to its austere backdrop 1 
a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it 1 
love this phone 1 
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0 
there was hardly any meat 0 
this is was due to the fact that it took 20 minutes to be acknowledged then another 35 minutes to get our foodand they kept forgetting things 0 
i wouldnt see this movie again for free 0 
so flavorful and has just the perfect amount of heat 1 
if she had not rolled the eyes we may have stayed not sure if we will go back and try it again 0 
the meat was pretty dry i had the sliced brisket and pulled pork 0 
comfortable in my hand 1 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
dont waste your money 0 
its like a really sexy party in your mouth where youre outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party 1 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
but i definitely would not eat here again 0 
kind of flops around 0 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
the shower area is outside so you can only rinse not take a full shower unless you dont mind being nude for everyone to see 0 
thank you for such great service 1 
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1 
the potatoes were like rubber and you could tell they had been made up ahead of time being kept under a warmer 0 
save your money ive had this item for 11 months now 0 
in particular the relationship between the bakery assistant and the waitress just didnt work for me at all 0 
cute quaint simple honest 1 
they are so easy to love but even more easy to identify with 1 
i found this move beautiful enjoyable and uplifting 1 
this was such an awesome movie that i bought it off of ebay 1 
elias koteasjack palance play good roles angelina is hot and gets nakedbilly drago appears in this and is cool as usual a cameo by sven ole thorsen helps make this a very enjoyable movie with good acting and a decent budget 1 
superb phone on a great network 1 
the food is good 1 
a pretty good product 1 
the ripped banana was not only ripped but petrified and tasteless 0 
we started with the tuna sashimi which was brownish in color and obviously wasnt fresh 0 
both great 1 
their rotating beers on tap is also a highlight of this place 1 
no plot whatsoever 0 
its a piece of crap 0 
if there was ever an indication of a writer and a directors ability to meld two highly volatile temperaments into a seamless union of creativity then this is it 1 
excellent performance 1 
another thing i didnt really like is when a character got punched in the face a gallon of blood would spew forth soon after 0 
garbo who showed right off the bat that her talents could carry over from the silent era i wanted to see some of her silent work but netflix doesnt seem to be stocking them 1 
terrible product and waste of money 0 
i advise you to look out for it 1 
the block was amazing 1 
its a long time since i was so entertained by a movie 1 
both of them were truly unbelievably good and i am so glad we went back 1 
this review is long overdue since i consider a tale of two sisters to be the single greatest film ever made 1 
this second appearance of mickey mouse following the silent plane crazy earlier that year is probably his most famous filmmostly because it was so groundbreaking 1 
but this movie is definitely a below average rent 0 
this allows the possibility of double booking for the same date and time after the first 0 
it was awesome 1 
highly recommended a 1 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
a good time 1 
yeah the movie pretty much sucked 0 
our server was super nice and checked on us many times 1 
and then tragedy struck 0 
i immediately said i wanted to talk to the manager but i did not want to talk to the guy who was doing shots of fireball behind the bar 0 
the food was outstanding and the prices were very reasonable 1 
the real killer is the volume and of course it breaking 0 
it was a very superficial movie and it gave me the feeling that i was watching play rather than a film 0 
the classic maine lobster roll was fantastic 1 
i really loved the story line and the poler bear was kinda cutebut if anyone has a question about fort steele just ask away 1 
their chow mein is so good 1 
ill be looking for a new earpiece 0 
the food was very good 1 
the phone was unusable and was not new 0 
but now that it is out of warranty the same problems reoccurebottom line put your money somewhere else cingular will not support it 0 
big disappointment with calendar sync 0 
crisp and clear 1 
very disappointing 0 
the speaker is of low quality so as making the ring tones sound very cheap 0 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
this greedy corporation will never see another dime from me 0 
exceptionally bad 0 
we sat another ten minutes and finally gave up and left 0 
the burger had absolutely no flavor the meat itself was totally bland the burger was overcooked and there was no charcoal flavor 0 
we arent ones to make a scene at restaurants but i just dont get itdefinitely lost the love after this one 0 
i wish i could enter negative values admins 0 
excellent performance 1 
the football scenes at the end were perplexing 0 
i only hear garbage for audio 0 
he owns the film just as spacek owned coal miners daughter and quaid owned great balls of fire 1 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
service is perfect and the family atmosphere is nice to see 1 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
what a big waste of time 0 
the plot is nonsense that doesnt interest in the slightest way or have any uniqueness to it 0 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
a very very very slowmoving aimless movie about a distressed drifting young man 0 
anyway the plot flowed smoothly and the malebonding scenes were a hoot 1 
as for the service im a fan because its quick and youre being served by some nice folks 1 
the keyboard is a nice compromise between a full qwerty and the basic cell phone number keypad 1 
plug was the wrong size 0 
ray charles is legendary 1 
i did not expect this to be so good 1 
just what i wanted 1 
overall i am psyched to have a phone which has all my appointments and contacts in and gets great reception 1 
go watch it 1 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
the classic maine lobster roll was fantastic 1 
i wear it everyday and it holds up very well 1 
and considering the two of us left there very full and happy for about 20 you just cant go wrong 1 
i would have casted her in that role after ready the script 1 
first of all there are enough racial stereotypes and racial jokes to offend everyone 0 
almost everyone involved must be return to school acting is utterly predictable and bad script is pile of garbage all round 0 
this really is how vegas fine dining used to be right down to the menus handed to the ladies that have no prices listed 1 
there is a totally unnecessary trainroller coaster scene 0 
the lighting is just dark enough to set the mood 1 
its just painful 0 
perhaps my phone is defective but people cannot hear me when i use this 0 
i found a six inch long piece of wire in my salsa 0 
not enough volume 0 
and those baby owls were adorable 1 
also difficult to put onid recommend avoiding this product 0 
plug was the wrong size 0 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
portable and it works 1 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
ill even say it again  this is torture 0 
appears to actually outperform the original battery from china that came with my v325i 1 
a piece of cinematic garbage captured on celluloid 0 
integrated seamlessly with the motorola razr phone 1 
cooked to perfection and the service was impeccable 1 
the phone loads super 1 
elias koteasjack palance play good roles angelina is hot and gets nakedbilly drago appears in this and is cool as usual a cameo by sven ole thorsen helps make this a very enjoyable movie with good acting and a decent budget 1 
very prompt service 1 
this is one of the better buffets that i have been to 1 
youll love it 1 
in addition it feels amp looks as if the phone is all lightweight cheap plastic 0 
i always order from the vegetarian menu during dinner which has a wide array of options to choose from 1 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
i believe that pitch black was done well 1 
what a big waste of time 0 
very disappointed 0 
no im going to eat the potato that i found some strangers hair in it 0 
does everything it should and more 1 
this place deserves one star and 90 has to do with the food 0 
this place receives stars for their appetizers 1 
and i really did find them funny 1 
o my gosh the best phone i have ever had 1 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
i purcashed this for the car charger and it does not work 0 
food was so gooodd 1 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
it failed to convey the broad sweep of landscapes that were a great part of the original 0 
both of them were truly unbelievably good and i am so glad we went back 1 
the acting is fantastic the stories are seamlessly woven together and the dogs are splendid a must rent view or see 1 
but it wasnt anything at all just one big yawn 0 
add betty white and jean smart and you have a great cast everyone played their parts really well 1 
this is so embarassing and also my ears hurt if i try to push the ear plug into my ear 0 
generally it just lacked imagination 0 
highly recommended 1 
why are these sad little vegetables so overcooked 0 
the portion was huge 1 
bad choice 0 
if you check the directors filmography on this site you will see why this film didnt have a chance 0 
john wayne did an incredible job for being so young in the movie industry 1 
disappointed with battery 0 
i did not expect this to be so good 1 
its this pandering to the audience that sabotages most of his films 0 
overall a delight 1 
lets start with all the problemsthe acting especially from the lead professor was very very bad 0 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
ray charles is legendary 1 
it definitely was not as good as my s11 1 
i am very impressed with this headset from plantronics 1 
excellent bluetooth headset 1 
also notable is john baileys fine crisp beautifully colored cinematography and the great production design costumes by eiko ishioka who went on to do the memorable costumes for coppolas dracula for which she received a well deserved oscar 1 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
about 30 minutes of footage is wasted to show mediocre elderly actors awkwardly babbling overwrought pseudosatanic gibberish corny enough to make a teen goth blush almost always in olde english and sometimes in latin that may or may not be made up words 0 
but even the talented carrell cant save this 0 
the pan cakes everyone are raving about taste like a sugary disaster tailored to the palate of a six year old 0 
wow very spicy but delicious 1 
imdb ratings only go as low 1 for awful its time to get some negative numbers in there for cases such as these 0 
ive never been more insulted or felt disrespected 0 
waaaaaayyyyyyyyyy over rated is all i am saying 0 
fantastic food 1 
this is a great little item 1 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
they keep getting better and better this is my third one and ive had numerous palms too 1 
integrated seamlessly with the motorola razr phone 1 
the portion was huge 1 
it was too predictable even for a chick flick 0 
but storm trooper is not even bad enough to make it to the list of wonderfully terrible movies 0 
point your finger at any item on the menu order it and you wont be disappointed 1 
once you get inside youll be impressed with the place 1 
weve tried to like this place but after 10 times i think were done with them 0 
saggy floppy piece of junk 0 
seller shipped quickly and much cheaper than the competitors 1 
useless phone simply deaf 0 
the worst phone from samsungcrap this crappy samsung e715 is the worst i have ever seeen 0 
could not get strong enough signal 0 
great price also 1 
the battery runs down quickly 0 
his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic 1 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
unfortunately it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees 0 
for those that havent seen it dont waste your time 0 
the shower area is outside so you can only rinse not take a full shower unless you dont mind being nude for everyone to see 0 
better than expected 1 
i got this phone on reccomendation from a relative and im glad i did 1 
if you do go see this movie bring a pillow or a girlfriendboyfriend to keep you occupied through out 0 
heres where the movie really pied me off 0 
all in all a great disappointment 0 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
i ordered the lemon raspberry ice cocktail which was also incredible 1 
works good 1 
my experience was terrible this was my fourth bluetooth headset and while it was much more comfortable than my last jabra which i hated 0 
i dont have very many words to say about this place but it does everything pretty well 1 
service sucks 0 
just what i wanted 1 
they know how to make them here 1 
i hate to disagree with my fellow yelpers but my husband and i were so disappointed with this place 0 
it is super charged up for use as a small hybrid palmtopcameracellphone and excels in those roles 1 
first time there and might just be the last 0 
its not user friendly 0 
thank you for wasting my money 0 
i could not stand to even watch it for very long for fear of losing iq 0 
what possesed me to get this junk i have no idea 0 
im not eating here 0 
it is perfect for a sitdown family meal or get together with a few friends 1 
there is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again 0 
anne heche was utterly convincing 1 
the bt headset was such a disapoinment 0 
the sets especially designed to work with the camera are amazingstylized beautiful and effective 1 
at around 4 pm i bought it at around 8pm i started to watch at around 815pm i fast forwarded the remaining film to see if there was anything left watchable for a human being with a brain but there wasnt 0 
very displeased 0 
the acting was bad 0 
the directing seems too pretentious 0 
an hour seriously 0 
amazon sucks 0 
i wouldnt return 0 
not what i wanted 0 
the waitresses are very friendly 1 
my fella got the huevos rancheros and they didnt look too appealing 0 
schrader has made a resume full of lousy amateurish films 0 
works for me 1 
the cow tongue and cheek tacos are amazing 1 
personally i think it shows that people should learn to find a compromise them self without involving other people into issue 1 
not a weekly haunt but definitely a place to come back to every once in a while 1 
the things that the four kids get themselves into is absolutely hilarious to watch 1 
i received my supposedly new motorola 375 and apparently there was not a match between the phone and the charger 0 
battery chargelife is quite long 1 
regrettably the film fails 0 
it really is impressive that the place hasnt closed down 0 
what a waste 0 
i must say i have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again 1 
after trying many many handsfree gadgets this is the one that finally works well 1 
krussel always good 1 
the speaker is of low quality so as making the ring tones sound very cheap 0 
i cant wait to go back 1 
i have been very happy with the 510 and have had no complaints from any one regarding my sound quality on their end 1 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
it is easy to turn on and off when you are in the car and the volume controls are quite accessable 1 
it was not good 0 
i dont have very many words to say about this place but it does everything pretty well 1 
good food good service 1 
as i said abovepretty useless 0 
almost all of the songs in cover girl are oldfashioned and not very tuneful 0 
i had verizon 2 years ago and really liked their service 1 
they never brought a salad we asked for 0 
the range is very decent ive been able to roam around my house with the phone in the living room with no receptionsound quality issues 1 
it was a very superficial movie and it gave me the feeling that i was watching play rather than a film 0 
avoid this establishment 0 
food was average at best 0 
poor sound quality 0 
the food was terrible 0 
you share general loewenhielms exquisite joy in his partaking of the cailles en sarcophage even though you are just watching a movie but you do wish for just a small sample to savor 1 
nothing at all to recommend 0 
im a big fan of this series mostly due to anne rices style sensitivities and treatments 1 
so far it has worked like a charm 1 
definitely will come back here again 1 
this one wants to surf on the small wave of space movies in 1998 deep impact and armageddon and this one fails everywhere 0 
i am going to have to be the first to negatively review this product 0 
the awful dialogue and hopeless overacting by everyone who gets shot top off a real waste of space and time 0 
though the wind and the lion is told largely through the eyes of the son every member of the family can identify with one of the characters whether it be sean connerys noble brigand candace bergens feisty heroine john hustons wily john hay or steve kanalys spiffy radiant ruthless cando lieutenant roosevelts big stick 1 
i immediately said i wanted to talk to the manager but i did not want to talk to the guy who was doing shots of fireball behind the bar 0 
if you havent choked in your own vomit by the end by all the cheap drama and worthless dialogue youve must have bored yourself to death with this waste of time 0 
the lighting is just dark enough to set the mood 1 
but the convoluted plot just didnt convince me and much of the film was watched with a weird questioning glance 0 
but it is great i would really recommend it 1 
beware this is not a trashy cult movie this is trash period 0 
im probably one of the few people to ever go to ians and not like it 0 
1010 1 
this movie now joins revenge of the boogeyman and zombiez as part of the hellish trinity of horror films 0 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
the acting sucked 0 
also the story and acting were weak 0 
i have eaten here multiple times and each time the food was delicious 1 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
the potatoes were like rubber and you could tell they had been made up ahead of time being kept under a warmer 0 
this is a great deal 1 
the awful dialogue and hopeless overacting by everyone who gets shot top off a real waste of space and time 0 
for readers who have already seen one of miyazakis films he is still in top form and made another worthwhile experience 1 
also were served hot bread and butter and home made potato chips with bacon bits on topvery original and very good 1 
unreliable im giving up 0 
the potato chip order was sad i could probably count how many chips were in that box and it was probably around 12 0 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
it was probably dirt 0 
the characters are interesting and you want to find out more about them the longer the movie goes on and i think people will be surprised by who does and doesnt make it 1 
black water is a thriller that manages to completely transcend its limitations its an indie flick by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience 1 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
still waiting im sure this item would work well if i ever recieve it 0 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
the acting by the whole cast could be put on a scale and balanced perfectly between overacting and underacting 0 
leopard print is wonderfully wild 1 
see it with your kids if you have a chanceit will open up some amazing dialog about how far race relations have come in the last 50 years 1 
i loved their mussels cooked in this wine reduction the duck was tender and their potato dishes were delicious 1 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
the food wasnt good 0 
total waste of time 0 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
would come back again if i had a sushi craving while in vegas 1 
conclusion i loved it 1 
the company shipped my product very promptly and it works well 1 
avoid at all cost 0 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
its worth driving up from tucson 1 
the seasonal fruit was fresh white peach puree 1 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
linksys should have some way to exchange a bad phone for a refurb unit or something 0 
never heard of any of them except cole who was totally unbelievable in the part 0 
im pleased 1 
great food 1 
some applause should be given to the prelude however 1 
pretty awesome place 1 
awful service 0 
what a waste of money and time 0 
the result is a powerhouse achievement made more timely now perhaps because of our cultures disturbing fascination with celebrity and its distorted interpretations of fame 1 
the chicken dishes are ok the beef is like shoe leather 0 
this place has it 1 
after trying many many handsfree gadgets this is the one that finally works well 1 
useless phone simply deaf 0 
as many people complained i found this headsets microphone was very weak 0 
i was very pleased to see that i could replace my well travled swivel holster for my blackberry flip 1 
for a self proclaimed coffee cafe i was wildly disappointed 0 
it is the best charger i have seen on the market yet 1 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
fans of the genre will be in heaven 1 
then a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use 0 
omg i felt like i had never eaten thai food until this dish 1 
it always cuts out and makes a beep beep beep sound then says signal failed 0 
this movie totally grates on my nerves 0 
the cashier had no care what so ever on what i had to say it still ended up being wayyy overpriced 0 
they were goldencrispy and delicious 1 
after trying many many handsfree gadgets this is the one that finally works well 1 
pretty piece of junk 0 
the atmosphere is modern and hip while maintaining a touch of coziness 1 
disappointed with battery 0 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
all in all an excellent restaurant highlighted by great service a unique menu and a beautiful setting 1 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
to summarize the food was incredible nay transcendant but nothing brings me joy quite like the memory of the pneumatic condiment dispenser 1 
this one wants to surf on the small wave of space movies in 1998 deep impact and armageddon and this one fails everywhere 0 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
despite the pans of reviewers i liked this movie 1 
i love this phone 1 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
nothing new there 0 
bt50 battery junk 0 
great for the jawbone 1 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
the staff is friendly and the joint is always clean 1 
it was a riot to see hugo weaving play a sexobsessed gay real estate salesman who uses his clients houses for his trysts with the flaming darren tom hollander 1 
awesome device 1 
weve have gotten a much better service from the pizza place next door than the services we received from this restaurant 0 
not good by any stretch of the imagination 0 
it was either too cold not enough flavor or just bad 0 
the fried rice was dry as well 0 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
the 12 mega pixel camera being a part of a phone is reasonably good7 1 
awsome device works great 1 
we walked away stuffed and happy about our first vegas buffet experience 1 
but it is great i would really recommend it 1 
it rocked my world and is certainly a must see for anyone with no social or physical outlets 1 
you learn a lot about the real inside emotions of people in this movie and a lot about the movie business itself 1 
the battery is unreliable as well as the service use antena 0 
i ordered this for sony ericsson w810i but i think it only worked once thats when i first used it 0 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
its the one movie that never ceases to interest me simply because it keeps me alert as i try to attempt to decipher its meanings 1 
considering the relations off screen between taylor and stanwyck it was surprising how little chemistry there was on screen between the two of them 0 
very good quality though 1 
if you see it you should probably just leave it on the shelf 0 
this wonderful experience made this place a muststop whenever we are in town again 1 
host staff were for lack of a better word bitches 0 
then i exchanged for the same phone even that had the same problem 0 
the sides are delish mixed mushrooms yukon gold puree white corn beateous 1 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
the battery is completely useless to me 0 
the dialogue sucked 0 
really bad 0 
generally it just lacked imagination 0 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
linked to my phone without effort 1 
bluetooth does not work phone locks up screens just flash up and now it just makes calls randomly while in my pocket locked 0 
we made the drive all the way from north scottsdale and i was not one bit disappointed 1 
i always order from the vegetarian menu during dinner which has a wide array of options to choose from 1 
disappointing accessory from a good manufacturer 0 
their daily specials are always a hit with my group 1 
integrated seamlessly with the motorola razr phone 1 
this is simply the best bluetooth headset for sound quality 1 
the manager was the worst 0 
service is friendly and inviting 1 
too politically correct 0 
the plot doesnt hang together at all and the acting is absolutely appalling 0 
really bad 0 
this place is disgusting 0 
all in all i think it was a good investment 1 
it doesnt make you look cool 0 
appears to actually outperform the original battery from china that came with my v325i 1 
he was extremely rude and really there are so many other restaurants i would love to dine at during a weekend in vegas 0 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
portable and it works 1 
last time buying from you 0 
how awesome is that 1 
worst thai ever 0 
first time going but i think i will quickly become a regular 1 
what a mistake 0 
this place is like chipotle but better 1 
worked very well paired with a treo 700w and as a skype headset on my pc using a usb bluetooth transceiver 1 
poor construction 0 
the text messaging feature is really tricky to use 0 
camera color balance is awful 0 
the kids are very cool too 1 
i was shocked because no signs indicate cash only 0 
another note about this phones appearance is that it really looks rather bland especially in the all black model 0 
this is a great restaurant at the mandalay bay 1 
i dont have very many words to say about this place but it does everything pretty well 1 
excellent short film 1 
camerawork again bad 0 
it was a very superficial movie and it gave me the feeling that i was watching play rather than a film 0 
i purcashed this for the car charger and it does not work 0 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
easily none other cartoon made me laugh in a tender way before getting into dark sitcoms oriented for teenagers 1 
due to this happening on every call i was forced to stop using this headset 0 
steer clear of this product and go with the genuine palm replacementr pens which come in a threepack 0 
these are fabulous 1 
not worth it 0 
it was pretty gross 0 
the jabra eargels fit my ears very well 1 
this was a different cut than the piece the other day but still wonderful and tender s well as well flavored 1 
the building itself seems pretty neat the bathroom is pretty trippy but i wouldnt eat here again 0 
too politically correct 0 
we sat another ten minutes and finally gave up and left 0 
i will be back many times soon 1 
what happened next was prettyoff putting 0 
the calls drop the phone comes on and off at will the screen goes black and the worst of all it stops ringing intermittently 0 
the pizza selections are good 1 
looks great and is strong 1 
the service was a bit lacking 0 
unfortunately it did not work 0 
it was a waste of my money 0 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
the battery is unreliable as well as the service use antena 0 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
i literally vomited while watching this film 0 
my gyro was basically lettuce only 0 
the food was very good 1 
this phone works great 1 
the food was very good 1 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
it was forced like everything in this movie 0 
i love it 1 
this place is horrible and way overpriced 0 
definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly will return next time im in vegas 1 
the 12 mega pixel camera being a part of a phone is reasonably good7 1 
so for our enjoyment we get to see them run around play games and be dangerous 1 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
poor sound quality 0 
i kept catching the cable on the seat and i had to pull the phone out to turn it on an off 0 
any ring toneoverall good phone to buy 1 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
how awful she is 0 
the chefs were friendly and did a good job 1 
from what my dinner companions told meeverything was very fresh with nice texture and taste 1 
this phone is slim and light and the display is beautiful 1 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
very disappointed 0 
i saw it as a child on tv back in 1973 when it was the stranger and i loved it 1 
the camera really likes her in this movie 1 
the fried rice was dry as well 0 
needless to say we will never be back here again 0 
im glad i found this product on amazon it is hard to find it wasnt high priced 1 
so in a nutshell 1 the restaraunt smells like a combination of a dirty fish market and a sewer 0 
great food 1 
wont work right or atleast for me 0 
this place is amazing 1 
special mention should be made of the superb music score and sound effects which are an integral element in helping to make this such a memorable and enjoyable cartoon 1 
awesome selection of beer 1 
ray charles life provided excellent biographical material for the film which goes well beyond being just another movie about a musician 1 
a good film by a great director 1 
wont work right or atleast for me 0 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
im using it with an iriver spinn with case and it fits fine 1 
att is not clear sound is very distorted and you have to yell when you talk 0 
nice leather 1 
penne vodka excellent 1 
seafood was limited to boiled shrimp and crab legs but the crab legs definitely did not taste fresh 0 
worst martini ever 0 
then scene where they debated whether or not to sack the trumpeter who falsely was accused for the murder is pure horror really stupid 0 
1 hour 54 minutes of sheer tedium melodrama and horrible acting a mess of a script and a sinking feeling of good lord what were they thinking 0 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
dont buy this product 0 
this is a very average phone with bad battery life that operates on a weak network 0 
four stars for the food the guy in the blue shirt for his great vibe still letting us in to eat 1 
they are so cool 1 
would not recommend to others 0 
the steak was amazingrge fillet relleno was the best seafood plate i have ever had 1 
unreliable im giving up 0 
but it picked up speed and got right to the point 1 
then i exchanged for the same phone even that had the same problem 0 
the art style has the appearance of crayonpencil drawings and is wonderfully colorful and fanciful 1 
insults profound deuchebaggery and had to go outside for a smoke break while serving just to solidify it 0 
lame would be the best way to describe it 0 
he really didnt seem to want to be hosting his voiceovers were monotonous didnt get involved with the guests 0 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
item arrived quickly and works great with my metro pcs samsung schr450 slider phone and sony premium sound in ear plugs 1 
sam shepards portrayal of a gung ho marine was sobering 1 
avoid this one if you can 0 
needless to say i wont be going back anytime soon 0 
great charger 1 
the shipping time was also very quick 1 
i had to wait over 30 minutes to get my drink and longer to get 2 arepas 0 
this little device has transformed my organizational capability and made my life a whole lot easier 1 
in an interesting part of town this place is amazing 1 
best ive found so far ive tried 2 other bluetooths and this one has the best quality for both me and the listener as well as ease of using 1 
oh this is such a thing of beauty this restaurant 1 
this is cool because most cases are just open there allowing the screen to get all scratched up 1 
perhaps i caught them on an off night judging by the other reviews but im not inspired to go back 0 
the directing and the cinematography arent quite as good 0 
even if you love bad movies do not watch this movie 0 
great hands free device 1 
i could barely stomach the meal but didnt complain because it was a business lunch 0 
its a sad movie but very good 1 
personally i think it shows that people should learn to find a compromise them self without involving other people into issue 1 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
del taco is pretty nasty and should be avoided if possible 0 
the results well are a shame 0 
the service was extremely slow 0 
not what i wanted 0 
but the convoluted plot just didnt convince me and much of the film was watched with a weird questioning glance 0 
hence the whole story lacks a certain energy 0
