owners are really great people 1 
this is probably the most irritating show i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
the only thing i did like was the prime rib and dessert section 1 
and those baby owls were adorable 1 
its very attractive and appears to be of good quality 1 
it was so bad i had lost the heart to finish it 0 
thank you for wasting my money 0 
the characters are fleshed out surprisingly well particularly grimes and blake and all the actors deliver their sharply scripted lines with just the right amount of deadpan tongue in cheek to make the dialogue both hilarious and realistic 1 
the range is very decent ive been able to roam around my house with the phone in the living room with no receptionsound quality issues 1 
id like to return it 0 
but it is great i would really recommend it 1 
not a good item it worked for a while then started having problems in my auto reverse tape player 0 
the waitress and manager are so friendly 1 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
problem is that the ear loops are made of weak material and break easily 0 
an awesome new look for fall 2000 1 
it sure does beat the nachos at the movies but i would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant 0 
light weight i hardly notice it is there 1 
the plot doesnt hang together at all and the acting is absolutely appalling 0 
but its just not funny 0 
i dont think i will be back for a very long time 0 
it is a very well acted and done tv movie 1 
not nearly as good looking as the amazon picture makes it look 0 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
blue ant is easy to use 1 
nice design and quality 1 
very tough and very short on flavor 0 
the whole experience was underwhelming and i think well just go to ninja sushi next time 0 
but when i check voice mail at night the keypad backlight turns off a few seconds into the first message and then im lost 0 
we have tried 2 units and they both failed within 2 months pros 0 
so in a nutshell 1 the restaraunt smells like a combination of a dirty fish market and a sewer 0 
and sometimes it was so embarrassing that i had to look away 0 
waste of money 0 
i was deeply impressed with the character he played 1 
the place was fairly clean but the food simply wasnt worth it 0 
the decor is nice and the piano music soundtrack is pleasant 1 
they could be used as exemplars for any set designer 1 
it was probably dirt 0 
later i found myself lost in the power of the film 1 
the block was amazing 1 
we got sitting fairly fast but ended up waiting 40 minutes just to place our order another 30 minutes before the food arrived 0 
i liked this movie way too much 1 
im a big fan of this series mostly due to anne rices style sensitivities and treatments 1 
first off the reception sucks i have never had more than 2 bars ever 0 
i dont have to be an accountant to know im getting screwed 0 
linksys should have some way to exchange a bad phone for a refurb unit or something 0 
but other than that the movie seemed to drag and the heroes didnt really work for their freedom 0 
how can that bethe audio quality is poor 0 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
i have to mention this and it is a huge spoiler i loved the ending how all the characters of the three films were the remaining survivors of the ferry disaster with valentine and the young judge together and the old man watching it on her tv solidifying his happiness over the suffering which he dealt with for those many years 1 
in an interesting part of town this place is amazing 1 
juano hernandez an exceptional actor who played supporting roles in many films of the era is a proud black man who is accused of murdering a white man in the south 1 
he deserves 5 stars 1 
waitress was a little slow in service 0 
you need at least 3 mins to get to your phone book from the time you first turn on the phonebattery life is short 0 
its very attractive and appears to be of good quality 1 
not much dialogue not much music the whole film was shot as elaborately and aesthetically like a sculpture 1 
what a waste 0 
also notable is john baileys fine crisp beautifully colored cinematography and the great production design costumes by eiko ishioka who went on to do the memorable costumes for coppolas dracula for which she received a well deserved oscar 1 
however i recently watched the whole thing again on dvd and i was completely struck by how extremely stupid the storyline was how it contained holes inconsistencies and frankly a whole lot of crap and how horrid the dancing was 0 
omit watching this 0 
reasonably priced also 1 
but above all the exquisite visual composition of each moment with inventive and elegant use of closeup camera angle and lighting including pointillistic faux home movie footage is a wonder and joy to behold 1 
all of the tapas dishes were delicious 1 
their steaks are 100 recommended 1 
i consider this theft 0 
battery lasts only a few hours 0 
just what i wanted 1 
the steak and the shrimp are in my opinion the best entrees at gc 1 
its like a bad two hour tv movie 0 
i love this phone 1 
the good cinematography also makes her and monica bellucci look very beautiful 1 
service was exceptional and food was a good as all the reviews 1 
new battery works great in phone 1 
the ending is so so perfect youll shed a tear 1 
if there was ever a movie that needed wordofmouth to promote this is it 1 
on the negative its insipid enough to cause regret for another 2 hours of life wasted in front of the screen 0 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
i had the chicken pho and it tasted very bland 0 
the only thing really worth watching was the scenery and the house because it is beautiful 1 
we wont be returning 0 
the performances are not improved by improvisation because the actors now have twice as much to worry about not only whether theyre delivering the line well but whether the line itself is any good 0 
love this phone 1 
end of days is one of the worst bigbudget action movies ive ever seen 0 
kind of flops around 0 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
but other than that the movie seemed to drag and the heroes didnt really work for their freedom 0 
the service was great even the manager came and helped with our table 1 
i was left shattered from the experience of watching this film and i took a good two hours to fully recover 0 
they will customize your order any way youd like my usual is eggplant with green bean stir fry love it 1 
the staff is always super friendly and helpful which is especially cool when you bring two small boys and a baby 1 
tried to go here for lunch and it was a madhouse 0 
we definately enjoyed ourselves 1 
if you plan to use this in a car forget about it 0 
heres where the movie really pied me off 0 
the visual effects were awful 0 
the descriptions said yum yum sauce and another said eel sauce yet another said spicy mayowell none of the rolls had sauces on them 0 
i love the ownerchef his one authentic japanese cool dude 1 
sucked most of the stuff does not work with my phone 0 
the presentation of the food was awful 0 
special mention should be made of the superb music score and sound effects which are an integral element in helping to make this such a memorable and enjoyable cartoon 1 
well never go again 0 
it is unusable in a moving car at freeway speed 0 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
total letdown i would much rather just go to the camelback flower shop and cartel coffee 0 
not good when wearing a hat or sunglasses 0 
this is high adventure at its best 1 
the story line is totally predictable 0 
i highly recommend this device to everyone 1 
he came running after us when he realized my husband had left his sunglasses on the table 1 
in particular the relationship between the bakery assistant and the waitress just didnt work for me at all 0 
this product is clearly not ready for prime time i dont care how cool it looks if you cant tell a call is coming in its worthless 0 
the lead man is charismafree 0 
just spicy enough perfect actually 1 
we waited for thirty minutes to be seated although there were 8 vacant tables and we were the only folks waiting 0 
but in terms of the writing its very fresh and bold 1 
i can barely ever hear on it and am constantly saying what 0 
very disappointed and wondered how it could be in the oscar shortlist 0 
the greek dressing was very creamy and flavorful 1 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
highquality chicken on the chicken caesar salad 1 
level 5 spicy was perfect where spice didnt overwhelm the soup 1 
i would highly recommend this 1 
it also had a new problem 0 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
terrible phone holder 0 
no actress has been worse used that june allison in this movie 0 
the two main characters may be two of the most believable children i ever saw put on screen 1 
i found a six inch long piece of wire in my salsa 0 
it is light easy to use and has very clear reception and transmission 1 
go watch it 1 
worst martini ever 0 
any grandmother can make a roasted chicken better than this one 0 
makes it easier to keep up with my bluetooth when im not wearing it 0 
being a 90s child i truly enjoyed this show and i can proudly say that i enjoyed it big time and even more than the classical wb cartoons 1 
i cant wait to go back 1 
the meat was pretty dry i had the sliced brisket and pulled pork 0 
the food was terrible 0 
this movie creates its own universe and is fascinating in every way 1 
love it great armband 1 
trumbull on i love lucy 1 
however after finally watching this film i realized that not only had i had a closed mind to the brilliance it depicts i also found myself watching it over and over again 1 
the seasonal fruit was fresh white peach puree 1 
this item worked great but it broke after 6 months of use 0 
i had a pretty satifying experience 1 
do not buy for d807wrongly advertised for d807 0 
i would not recommend this place 0 
its fits like a glove and is strong secure and durable 1 
utter crap sound quality is terrible 0 
this is an excellent tool especially when paired with your phones autoanswer 1 
eew this location needs a complete overhaul 0 
the story line is just awful 0 
definitely worth seeing its the sort of thought provoking film that forces you to question your own threshold of loneliness 1 
the volume switch rocketed out of the unit to a destination unknown 0 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
for readers who have already seen one of miyazakis films he is still in top form and made another worthwhile experience 1 
couldnt figure it out 0 
the pairing of the two devices was so easy it barely took a couple minutes before i started making calls with the voice dialing feature 1 
the mic there is a joke and the volume is quite low 0 
i tried the cape cod ravoli chickenwith cranberrymmmm 1 
good case excellent value 1 
also makes it easier to hold on to 1 
it looks very nice 1 
again lame 0 
they keep getting better and better this is my third one and ive had numerous palms too 1 
while you dont yet hear mickey speak there are tons of sound effects and music throughout the filmsomething we take for granted now but which was a huge crowd pleaser in 1928 1 
the sangria was about half of a glass wine full and was 12 ridiculous 0 
when it opens the battery connection is broken and the device is turned off 0 
all in all i can assure you ill be back 1 
it is very comfortable to wear as well which is probably the most important aspect about using a case 1 
very poor service 0 
the burger had absolutely no flavor the meat itself was totally bland the burger was overcooked and there was no charcoal flavor 0 
car charger as well as ac charger are included to make sure you never run out of juicehighy recommended 1 
i ordered the voodoo pasta and it was the first time id had really excellent pasta since going gluten free several years ago 1 
but when someone strives for greatness and poetry but delivers a muddled and often ridiculous story a bunch of disparate scenes pretentious dialogue then you get the worst kind of a movie that some other reviewer very accurately defined as pretentious crap 0 
totally believable 1 
so flavorful and has just the perfect amount of heat 1 
totally believable 1 
arrived quickly and much less expensive than others being sold 1 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
i have read others reviews here but i havent had any problem with it 1 
this place is awesome if you want something light and healthy during the summer 1 
you never know if you pushed it hard enough or the right number of times for the function you want or not 0 
i cant see how this movie can be an inspiration to anyone to come out or overcome fear and rejection 0 
i was shocked because no signs indicate cash only 0 
they are so cool 1 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
it features an outlandish array of memorable psychotic but lovable nuts 1 
when a song could explain the emotions of the subjects better such as when jay adams unfortunate life was a subject of talk the song old man by neil young was played which evokes many emotions 1 
prosgood camera very nice pictures also has cool styles like black and white and more 1 
lastly the mozzarella sticks they were the best thing we ordered 1 
having trouble with volume 0 
the camera really likes her in this movie 1 
ample portions and good prices 1 
then theres the plot holes 0 
it was also the right balance of war and love 1 
the screen does get smudged easily because it touches your ear and face 0 
the guys all had steaks and our steak loving son who has had steak at the best and worst places said it was the best steak hes ever eaten 1 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
the potato chip order was sad i could probably count how many chips were in that box and it was probably around 12 0 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
i thought it was bad 0 
if you are razr owneryou must have this 1 
it was that loudglad to say that the plantronics 510 maintains a flawless connection to my cell and with no static during normal use 1 
but i thought his acting was skilled 1 
in the span of an hour i had two people exclaim whoa is that the new phone on tv 1 
great place fo take out or eat in 1 
if you dont find it too bad as again the unit comes with one earpad onlyi would not recommend this to anyone 0 
doesnt hold charge 0 
great earpiece 1 
kind of hard to mess up a steak but they did 0 
wasted two hours 0 
clever and a real crowdpleaserthis film still ranks among mickeys best films even after 80 wonderful years 1 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
i would avoid this place if you are staying in the mirage 0 
strike 2 who wants to be rushed 0 
worst customer service 0 
we ordered some old classics and some new dishes after going there a few times and were sorely disappointed with everything 0 
for that price i can think of a few place i would have much rather gone 0 
great price too 1 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
there was no chemistry between ben affleck and sandra bullock in this film and i couldnt understand why he would consider even leaving his wifetobe for this chick that he supposedly was knocked out by 0 
this movie is a good and humorous comment on life in 2006 1 
not much flavor to them and very poorly constructed 0 
what a waste of money and time 0 
if you see it you should probably just leave it on the shelf 0 
one more thing i can tolerate political incorrectness very well im all for artistic freedom and suspension of disbelief but the slavic female character was just too much 0 
we started with the tuna sashimi which was brownish in color and obviously wasnt fresh 0 
what a piece of junk i lose more calls on this phone 0 
people couldnt hear me talk and i had to pull out the earphone and talk on the phone 0 
battery has no life 0 
it works 1 
i was not happy with this item 0 
barney is definitely super de duper 1 
i probably would not go here again 0 
the biggest complaint i have is the battery drains superfast 0 
the sound quality is excellent as well 1 
it was so boring 0 
the fried rice was dry as well 0 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
great food and great service in a clean and friendly setting 1 
i saw this short film on hbo the other day and absolutely loved it 1 
ive seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie 0 
i especially love the long battery life 1 
this movie is a good and humorous comment on life in 2006 1 
excellent performance 1 
battery life is real good 1 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
keep up the good work amazon 1 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
dont make the same mistake that i did and please dont buy this phone 0 
a very charming film with wonderful sentiment and heart 1 
this really is how vegas fine dining used to be right down to the menus handed to the ladies that have no prices listed 1 
great sound and service 1 
echo problemvery unsatisfactory 0 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
great hands free device 1 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
the construction of the headsets is poor 0 
after 20 minutes wait i got a table 0 
their daily specials are always a hit with my group 1 
i received my supposedly new motorola 375 and apparently there was not a match between the phone and the charger 0 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
walked in and the place smelled like an old grease trap and only 2 others there eating 0 
i could not understand what kind of idiot would produce this mess in the first place not to mention several season 0 
cant upload ringtones from a third party 0 
the movie is not completely perfect but titta di girolamo will stay with you for a long time after the vision of the movie 1 
great food and service huge portions and they give a military discount 1 
it quit working after id used it for about 18 months so i just purchased another one because this is the best headset ive ever owned 1 
the waitress and manager are so friendly 1 
nice headset priced right 1 
being a 90s child i truly enjoyed this show and i can proudly say that i enjoyed it big time and even more than the classical wb cartoons 1 
internet is excrutiatingly slow 0 
i could not understand what kind of idiot would produce this mess in the first place not to mention several season 0 
the ripped banana was not only ripped but petrified and tasteless 0 
in short dont bother with this movie 0 
the movie is terribly boring in places 0 
works great 1 
audio quality is poor very poor 0 
that said our mouths and bellies were still quite pleased 1 
the bus boy on the other hand was so rude 0 
it makes very strange ticking noises before it ends the call 0 
the ending is so so perfect youll shed a tear 1 
the food was terrible 0 
great price also 1 
the lead man is charismafree 0 
this place is pretty good nice little vibe in the restaurant 1 
food was good service was good prices were good 1 
it ranks highly as a great noircrimedrama incredible performances by belmondo and lino ventura 1 
coming here is like experiencing an underwhelming relationship where both parties cant wait for the other person to ask to break up 0 
i believe the screenwriter did a good job of tying up the loose ends 1 
very disappointed 0 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
it was a bit too sweet not really spicy enough and lacked flavor 0 
bluetooth range is good a few days ago i left my phone in the trunk got a call and carried the conversation without a hitch 1 
then i had to continue pairing it periodically since it somehow kept dropping 0 
the result is a powerhouse achievement made more timely now perhaps because of our cultures disturbing fascination with celebrity and its distorted interpretations of fame 1 
this is the phone to get for 2005 i just bought my s710a and all i can say is wow 1 
i was very excited to get this headset because i thought it was really cute 1 
they keep getting better and better this is my third one and ive had numerous palms too 1 
i was bored throughout the whole damn thing 0 
bland not a liking this place for a number of reasons and i dont want to waste time on bad reviewing ill leave it at that 0 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
it was just too horrible 0 
this item is great installed it let it charged up overnite and it has been working good every since with no problems 1 
crust is not good 0 
the acting as youd expect from this cast is top notch 1 
only like 3 or 4 buildings used a couple of locations maybe poor hummh 0 
four stars for the food the guy in the blue shirt for his great vibe still letting us in to eat 1 
i sat riveted to the tv screen 1 
just whatever you do avoid groove as its the antithesis of all that is good about human traffic 0 
dont make the same mistake i did 0 
i had the chicken pho and it tasted very bland 0 
the volume for the ringer is real good you have choices how loud 1 
one of my favorite purchases ever 1 
this phone is very fast with sending any kind of messages and web browsing is significantly faster than previous phones i have used 1 
a cheap and cheerless heist movie with poor characterisation lots of underbite style stoic emoting think chow yun fat in a better tomorrow and some cheesy clichés thrown into an abandoned factory ready for a few poorly executed flying judo rolls a la john woo 0 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
lousy product 0 
it is just the sort of pap that is screened in the afternoon to punish the unemployed for not having jobs 0 
the movie is not completely perfect but titta di girolamo will stay with you for a long time after the vision of the movie 1 
best ive found so far ive tried 2 other bluetooths and this one has the best quality for both me and the listener as well as ease of using 1 
service is perfect and the family atmosphere is nice to see 1 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
my rating just 3 out of 10 0 
the pizza selections are good 1 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
an excellent new restaurant by an experienced frenchman 1 
this place was such a nice surprise 1 
best breakfast buffet 1 
i will not be eating there again 0 
exceptionally bad 0 
i am very happy 1 
best tacos in town by far 1 
very disappointed 0 
this film and i use that word loosely is an insult to the moviegoing public 0 
highly recommend for any one who has a blue tooth phone 1 
im very disappointed with my decision 0 
the selection of food was not the best 0 
im super pissd 0 
everything captain howdy says is either laughable or just plain stupid 0 
this is an unbelievable bargain 1 
this phone tries very hard to do everything but fails at its very ability to be a phone 0 
the charger arrived within the promised timeframe but it did not work 0 
if she had not rolled the eyes we may have stayed not sure if we will go back and try it again 0 
damian is so talented and versatile in so many ways of writing and portraying different characters on screen 1 
the reception is excellent 1 
not my thing 0 
by this time our side of the restaurant was almost empty so there was no excuse 0 
lordy the khao soi is a dish that is not to be missed for curry lovers 1 
add betty white and jean smart and you have a great cast everyone played their parts really well 1 
the characters were all funny and had the peculiarity of not having a true lead character 1 
this place should honestly be blown up 0 
portable and it works 1 
i immediately said i wanted to talk to the manager but i did not want to talk to the guy who was doing shots of fireball behind the bar 0 
uncomfortable in the ear dont use with lg vx9900 env 0 
the plot such as it is is so derivative and predictable that the ending is like a mercy killing 0 
at first i thought i was grtting a good deal at 744 until i plugged it into my phone v3c razr 0 
its uncomfortable and the sound quality is quite poor compared with the phone razr or with my previous wired headset that plugged into an lg 0 
pretty cool i would say 1 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
sounds good reasonably priced and effective its that simple 1 
after trying many many handsfree gadgets this is the one that finally works well 1 
it was forced like everything in this movie 0 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
the voice recognition thru the handset is excellent 1 
dont buy this product 0 
the performances are real and gripping the crocdodile is extremely well done indeed if the black water website is to be believed thats because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous 1 
there is simply no excuse for something this poorly done 0 
only pros large seating area nice bar area great simple drink menu the best brick oven pizza with homemade dough 1 
you have to hold the phone at a particular angle for the other party to hear you clearly 0 
honeslty it didnt taste that fresh 0 
i love this cable it allows me to connect any miniusb device to my pc 1 
i used bitpim a free program you can find on the internetto transfer data to the phonethe price of the cable was excellent 1 
this is one of the best italian thrillers of the early 70s 1 
poor talk time performance 0 
i love this place 1 
this place is good 1 
the soundtrack sucked 0 
full of unconvincing cardboard characters it is blandly written by edward chodorov who also produced and is surprisingly directed by jean negulesco from whom one would expect a great deal more 0 
the sound quality is excellent as well 1 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
none of them are engaging or exciting 0 
not my thing 0 
the company shipped my product very promptly and it works well 1 
a happy wonderful feel good ending 1 
a great touch 1 
the live music on fridays totally blows 0 
bad characters bad story and bad acting 0 
it deserves strong love 1 
being a 90s child i truly enjoyed this show and i can proudly say that i enjoyed it big time and even more than the classical wb cartoons 1 
took an hour to get our food only 4 tables in restaurant my food was luke warm our sever was running around like he was totally overwhelmed 0 
elias koteasjack palance play good roles angelina is hot and gets nakedbilly drago appears in this and is cool as usual a cameo by sven ole thorsen helps make this a very enjoyable movie with good acting and a decent budget 1 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
the puppets look really cheesy not in a good way like in the puppet master 80s flicks 0 
good prices 1 
the ngage is still lacking in earbuds 0 
the sets especially designed to work with the camera are amazingstylized beautiful and effective 1 
im very disappointed with my decision 0 
tried to go here for lunch and it was a madhouse 0 
low quality 0 
the company shipped my product very promptly and it works well 1 
if you want healthy authentic or ethic food try this place 1 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
the only thing i did like was the prime rib and dessert section 1 
fantastic earphones 1 
and then tragedy struck 0 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
my friend did not like his bloody mary 0 
which is precisely why i am giving it such a bad review 0 
great pork sandwich 1 
this is a simple little phone to use but the breakage is unacceptible 0 
but above all the exquisite visual composition of each moment with inventive and elegant use of closeup camera angle and lighting including pointillistic faux home movie footage is a wonder and joy to behold 1 
phone now holds charge like it did when it was new 1 
paolo sorrentino has written a wonderful story about loneliness and tony has built one of the most unforgettable characters seen in movies in recent years 1 
cant upload ringtones from a third party 0 
cant get the software to work with my computer 0 
5 stars for the brick oven bread app 1 
hell no will i go back 0 
battery chargelife is quite long 1 
it is simple to use and i like it 1 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
just what i wanted 1 
clever and a real crowdpleaserthis film still ranks among mickeys best films even after 80 wonderful years 1 
the only thing that i think could improve is the sound leaks out from the headset 0 
i can think of no other film where something vitally important occurs every other minute 1 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
of course the footage from the 70s was grainy but that only enhanced the film 1 
i as well wouldve given godfathers zero stars if possible 0 
they are so easy to love but even more easy to identify with 1 
i dont think ill be running back to carlys anytime soon for food 0 
imdb ratings only go as low 1 for awful its time to get some negative numbers in there for cases such as these 0 
the chips that came out were dripping with grease and mostly not edible 0 
the majority of the logitech earbud headsets failed 0 
the service was terrible food was mediocre 0 
this is the kind of money that is wasted properly 1 
the only good thing was that it fits comfortably on small ears 1 
its kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly its embarrassing how childlike the company is 0 
filmiing was less expansive 0 
what happened next was prettyoff putting 0 
lewis blacks considerable talent is wasted here too as he is at his most incendiary when he is unrestrained which the pg13 rating certainly wont allow 0 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
this place deserves one star and 90 has to do with the food 0 
well never go again 0 
also makes it easier to hold on to 1 
very bad performance plays angela bennett a computer expert who is at home all the time 0 
the only thing i wasnt too crazy about was their guacamole as i dont like it puréed 0 
that was funny 1 
this place was such a nice surprise 1 
for people who are first timers in film making i think they did an excellent job 1 
i received my supposedly new motorola 375 and apparently there was not a match between the phone and the charger 0 
overall i wasnt very impressed with noca 0 
great place to eat reminds me of the little mom and pop shops in the san francisco bay area 1 
and those baby owls were adorable 1 
this product is great it makes working a lot easier i can go to the copier while waiting on hold for something 1 
there are many continuity errors one other user commented on different cars in the garage joes glassesthe one that got to me the most was the fact joes facial hair configuration seemed to change from scene to scene 0 
rating 010 grade z note the show is so bad that even mother of the cast pull her daughter out of the show 0 
we would recommend these to others 1 
cute quaint simple honest 1 
the service was meh 0 
went for lunch service was slow 0 
still its quite interesting and entertaining to follow 1 
its like a really sexy party in your mouth where youre outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party 1 
it was so funny 1 
in particular the relationship between the bakery assistant and the waitress just didnt work for me at all 0 
worst foodservice ive had in a while 0 
the burger is good beef cooked just right 1 
were jerks on the phone 0 
great sound and service 1 
i wouldnt see this movie again for free 0 
i cant see how this movie can be an inspiration to anyone to come out or overcome fear and rejection 0 
also were served hot bread and butter and home made potato chips with bacon bits on topvery original and very good 1 
would not reccommend 0 
im glad i found this product on amazon it is hard to find it wasnt high priced 1 
while i managed to bend the leaf spring back in place the metal now has enough stress that it will break on the next drop 0 
i bought this phone as a replacement for my startac and have regretted it since 0 
what on earth is irons doing in this film 0 
i gave it 5 stars then and im giving it 5 stars now 1 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
the story which was told so eloquently by francis ford coppola 25 years earlier really unfolds gradually and leaves room for the characters to develop 1 
works for me 1 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
having trouble with volume 0 
their onscreen chemistry critical to the entire film is genuine 1 
i knew when i saw the film that more great things were to come from this gifted actor 1 
a happy wonderful feel good ending 1 
my 810 score is mostly for the plot 1 
doesnt last long 0 
i cant believe theres even a sequel to this 0 
wont ever go here again 0 
easily none other cartoon made me laugh in a tender way before getting into dark sitcoms oriented for teenagers 1 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
the microphone also works well but according to people i have called it applifies everything 1 
would not go back 0 
avoid this establishment 0 
one thing i hate is the mode set button at the side 0 
this place lacked style 0 
perfect for the ps3 1 
the servers went back and forth several times not even so much as an are you being helped 0 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
the owners are super friendly and the staff is courteous 1 
i love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it 1 
the keyboard is a nice compromise between a full qwerty and the basic cell phone number keypad 1 
seriously its not worth wasting your or your kids time on 0 
the only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port irda 0 
go to place for gyros 1 
this is a masterful piece of filmmaking with many themes simmering and occasionally boiling over in this warts and all study of the poets bohemian selfindulgent wartime years that span the aerial bombardments of london and the outward tranquillity of a welsh coastal retreat the borderlines between friendship lust and love dedication to art and experience versus practical concerns jealousy rivalry cowardice and egotism versus heroism and selfsacrifice and more 1 
what this film lacks is a convincing script 0 
i recommend igo to anyone with different brand cell phonesmp3 players in the family 1 
maybe its just their vegetarian fare but ive been twice and i thought it was average at best 0 
overpriced for what you are getting 0 
the worst piece of crap ever along with the verizon customer service 0 
as a sushi lover avoid this place by all means 0 
the noise shield is incrediable 1 
i cant believe theres even a sequel to this 0 
how can that bethe audio quality is poor 0 
it is not good 0 
john garfield ann revere lilli plmer william conrad canada leeand filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screenjames wong howe 1 
new battery works great in phone 1 
there was so much hype over this phone that i assumed it was the best my mistake 0 
the staff are great the ambiance is great 1 
i have been very happy with the 510 and have had no complaints from any one regarding my sound quality on their end 1 
would not reccommend 0 
that was done in the second movie 0 
the only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port irda 0 
the jabra eargels fit my ears very well 1 
you need two hands to operate the screenthis software interface is decade old and cannot compete with new software designs 0 
i probably would not go here again 0 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
glad i didnt pay to see it 0 
the basic premise is wasted since it is sidelined by the inexplicable focus on the documentary crew 0 
this fixes all the problems 1 
a drive thru means you do not want to wait around for half an hour for your food but somehow when we end up going here they make us wait and wait 0 
i am very impressed with this headset from plantronics 1 
now we were chosen to be tortured with this disgusting piece of blatant american propaganda 0 
unfortunately any virtue in this films production work was lost on a regrettable script 0 
however my girl was complain that some time the phone doesnt wake up like normal phone does 0 
oh the charger seems to work fine 1 
owners are really great people 1 
awsome device works great 1 
feelings thoughtsgabriels discomfort during the danceall these intangibles leap to life and come within the viewers grasp in hustons portrayal 1 
what should have been a hilarious yummy christmas eve dinner to remember was the biggest fail of the entire trip for us 0 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
the movie is full of wonderful dancing hence the title 1 
after 20 minutes wait i got a table 0 
it was just not a fun experience 1 
tasted like dirt 0 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
i checked everywhere and there is no feature for it which is really disappointing 0 
there is no plot here to keep you going in the first place 0 
this phone tries very hard to do everything but fails at its very ability to be a phone 0 
i had about two bites and refused to eat anymore 0 
poor product 0 
people who like european films and art movies will like this movie 1 
the lighting is awful 0 
shes poised and amazing 1 
you cant beat that 1 
magical help 1 
you cant beat that 1 
very funny 1 
the cashier was friendly and even brought the food out to me 1 
easily none other cartoon made me laugh in a tender way before getting into dark sitcoms oriented for teenagers 1 
again no plot at all 0 
there is no plot or storyline 0 
crisp and clear 1 
after 3 months screen just went black all of a sudden 0 
the croutons also taste homemade which is an extra plus 1 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
awful service 0 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
verizon tech support walked my through a few procedures none of which worked and i ended up having to do a hard reset wiping out all my data 0 
that being said for a phone the camera is very nice many cool effects to play with and video is decent as well 1 
problem is that the ear loops are made of weak material and break easily 0 
there is no plot here to keep you going in the first place 0 
mic doesnt work 0 
as for the service i thought it was good 1 
food was really good and i got full petty fast 1 
dont waste your money 0 
very very fun chef 1 
after one bite i was hooked 1 
this movie is greatespecially if you enjoy visual arts 1 
about ten minutes into this film i started having second thoughts 0 
in fact its hard to remember that the part of ray charles is being acted and not played by the man himself 1 
it deserves strong love 1 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
so i had to take the battery out of the phone put it all back together and then restart it 0 
but now that it is out of warranty the same problems reoccurebottom line put your money somewhere else cingular will not support it 0 
it lasts less than 3o minutes if i actually try to use the phonemy wife has the same phone with the same problem 0 
the flat reenactments dont hold your attention because they are emotionally adrift and stagy 0 
on the negative its insipid enough to cause regret for another 2 hours of life wasted in front of the screen 0 
my drink was never empty and he made some really great menu suggestions 1 
i saw this movie and i thought this is a stupid movie 0 
i cant see how this movie can be an inspiration to anyone to come out or overcome fear and rejection 0 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
i guess i liked the details of his dysfunctionhe was believable 1 
20th century foxs road house 1948 is not only quite a silly noir but is an implausible unmitigated bore of a movie 0 
reception is terrible and full of static 0 
when im on this side of town this will definitely be a spot ill hit up again 1 
then scene where they debated whether or not to sack the trumpeter who falsely was accused for the murder is pure horror really stupid 0 
ill be looking for a new earpiece 0 
the only good thing was that it fits comfortably on small ears 1 
i ate there twice on my last visit and especially enjoyed the salmon salad 1 
every thing on phone work perfectly she like it 1 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
ordered burger rare came in well done 0 
love this headset 1 
the spaghetti is nothing special whatsoever 0 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
all in all an excellent restaurant highlighted by great service a unique menu and a beautiful setting 1 
what is even more stupid is that who had thought an idea that there should be a volcano in los angeles 0 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
we would recommend these to others 1 
painful on the ear 0 
lot of holes in the plot theres nothing about how he became the emperor nothing about where he spend 20 years between his childhood and mature age 0 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
im glad the film didnt go for the most obvious choice as a lesser film certainly would have 1 
it has kept up very well 1 
i just saw this film and i recommend it 1 
def coming back to bowl next time 1 
i really loved the story line and the poler bear was kinda cutebut if anyone has a question about fort steele just ask away 1 
i do think tom hanks is a good actor 1 
the only good thing was our waiter he was very helpful and kept the bloddy marys coming 1 
i didnt realize how wonderful the short really is until the last two scenes 1 
we wont be going back 0 
the movie seemed a little slow at first 0 
the igo chargers and tips are really great 1 
what a waste of money and time 0 
im very disappointed with my decision 0 
highly unrecommended 0 
i probably wont be coming back here 0 
the buttons for on and off are bad 0 
we were promptly greeted and seated 1 
a good quality bargain i bought this after i bought a cheapy from big lots that sounded awful and people on the other end couldnt hear me 1 
works great 1 
if there was ever a movie that needed wordofmouth to promote this is it 1 
i love the look and feel of samsung flipphones 1 
yes its shiny on front side and i love it 1 
i was very disappointed in the movie 0 
it was so bad i had lost the heart to finish it 0 
i have been in more than a few bars in vegas and do not ever recall being charged for tap water 0 
it was horrendous 0 
i know he was a contract player with little control over his scripts but the acting was as bad as the script 0 
my only complaint is the standard sound volume is a little low even when turned up to 5of 5 0 
this place is great 1 
my fiancé and i came in the middle of the day and we were greeted and seated right away 1 
the update procedure is difficult and cumbersome 0 
dont waste your time watching this rubbish nonresearched film 0
