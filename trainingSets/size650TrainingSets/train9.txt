great atmosphere friendly and fast service 1 
but even the talented carrell cant save this 0 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
all in all a great disappointment 0 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
the chicken dishes are ok the beef is like shoe leather 0 
i guess that nobody at the network that aired this dribble watched it before putting it on 0 
very good food great atmosphere1 1 
still waiting im sure this item would work well if i ever recieve it 0 
battery lasts only a few hours 0 
they have a really nice atmosphere 1 
as always the evening was wonderful and the food delicious 1 
also the fries are without a doubt the worst fries ive ever had 0 
so bad 0 
the characters are interesting even if a bit predictable 1 
im still infatuated with this phone 1 
coming here is like experiencing an underwhelming relationship where both parties cant wait for the other person to ask to break up 0 
the stories were powerful explorations of the nature of man and of art 1 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
but she is still a bad actress repeating her robotic face moves in each of her pictures 0 
the story is beyond stupid 0 
any grandmother can make a roasted chicken better than this one 0 
the food sucked which we expected but it sucked more than we could have imagined 0 
would recommend this item 1 
great pizza and salads 1 
the staff is friendly and the joint is always clean 1 
i saw mirrormask last night and it was an unsatisfactory experience 0 
i also didnt like the on button it felt like it would crack with use 0 
this phone is pretty sturdy and ive never had any large problems with it 1 
does not work 0 
good value works fine power via usb car or wall outlet 1 
there is really nothing for me at postinos hope your experience is better 0 
i guess i liked the details of his dysfunctionhe was believable 1 
whatever prompted such a documentary is beyond me 0 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
improper description i had to return it 0 
so far so good 1 
only like 3 or 4 buildings used a couple of locations maybe poor hummh 0 
it has a very good plot it holds your complete attention the acting is superb tom wilkinson was fantastic and emily watson was also very good 1 
a film not easily forgotten 1 
those burgers were amazing 1 
waste your money on this game 1 
they refuse to refund or replace 0 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
best breakfast buffet 1 
does everything it should and more 1 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
i had a salad with the wings and some ice cream for dessert and left feeling quite satisfied 1 
i have to use the smallest earpieces provided but it stays on pretty well 1 
setup couldnt have been simpler 1 
i am going to have to be the first to negatively review this product 0 
of course the footage from the 70s was grainy but that only enhanced the film 1 
recommend with confidence 1 
the results well are a shame 0 
the roast beef sandwich tasted really good 1 
i love the ringtones because they are so upbeat 1 
this movie is a good and humorous comment on life in 2006 1 
i also didnt like the on button it felt like it would crack with use 0 
worst foodservice ive had in a while 0 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
loved itfriendly servers great food wonderful and imaginative menu 1 
i wasnt really impressed with strip steak 0 
what a mistake 0 
defective crap 0 
those phones are working just fine now 1 
great atmosphere friendly and fast service 1 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
never again will i be dining at this place 0 
i liked this movie way too much 1 
unfortunately any virtue in this films production work was lost on a regrettable script 0 
the film gives meaning to the phrase never in the history of human conflict has so much been owed by so many to so few 1 
the acting is fantastic the stories are seamlessly woven together and the dogs are splendid a must rent view or see 1 
i highly recommend these and encourage people to give them a try 1 
all things considered a job very well done 1 
the chips that came out were dripping with grease and mostly not edible 0 
i immediately said i wanted to talk to the manager but i did not want to talk to the guy who was doing shots of fireball behind the bar 0 
avoid at all costs 0 
very true to shakespear and a must for all shakespear fans 1 
all the bread is made inhouse 1 
the use of slowmotion needlessly repeats itself throughout the movie but is well backed up by bad acting and bad is a kind word here no continuity scenes that are thrown in for no reason whatsoever vehicles that looked like they were made from a corn flakes box and a directorial style that bordered on stupidity 0 
but i dont like it 0 
the movie is not completely perfect but titta di girolamo will stay with you for a long time after the vision of the movie 1 
walked in and the place smelled like an old grease trap and only 2 others there eating 0 
it was probably dirt 0 
they are so easy to love but even more easy to identify with 1 
there was no chemistry between ben affleck and sandra bullock in this film and i couldnt understand why he would consider even leaving his wifetobe for this chick that he supposedly was knocked out by 0 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
that was done in the second movie 0 
this would not even be good as a made for tv flick 0 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
it is the best charger i have seen on the market yet 1 
highly unprofessional and rude to a loyal patron 0 
rude inconsiderate management 0 
the story itself is just predictable and lazy 0 
after 3 months screen just went black all of a sudden 0 
the attempts at humor were pitiful and story is so awful it dosent bear thinking about which basically involves a vulcan stealing the enterprise to find god seriously i just didnt care about any of this film and oh not to mention uhura does a belly dance to distract male guards 0 
he really didnt seem to want to be hosting his voiceovers were monotonous didnt get involved with the guests 0 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
battery chargelife is quite long 1 
i was disgusted because i was pretty sure that was human hair 0 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
small sleek impressive looking practical setup with ample storage in place 1 
this movie is bad 0 
later i found myself lost in the power of the film 1 
great choice 1 
we got sitting fairly fast but ended up waiting 40 minutes just to place our order another 30 minutes before the food arrived 0 
the fish is badly made and some of its underwater shots are repeated a thousand times in the film 0 
but this movie is definitely a below average rent 0 
it came free with a dvd player i bought but i still turned the thing off halfway through because i was embarrassed for howell 0 
this is essentially a communications tool that does not communicate 0 
an amazing finale to possibly the best trilogy of all time 1 
nice blanket of moz over top but i feel like this was done to cover up the subpar food 1 
things that went wrong they burned the saganaki 0 
wasted two hours 0 
overall i rate this movie a 10 out of a 110 scale 1 
it came free with a dvd player i bought but i still turned the thing off halfway through because i was embarrassed for howell 0 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
for readers who have already seen one of miyazakis films he is still in top form and made another worthwhile experience 1 
utterly without merit on any level this is akin to torture 0 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
of course the footage from the 70s was grainy but that only enhanced the film 1 
unfortunately any virtue in this films production work was lost on a regrettable script 0 
is it possible for a movie to get any worse than this 0 
yes its shiny on front side and i love it 1 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
never been to hard rock casino before will never ever step forward in it again 0 
but i thought his acting was skilled 1 
very pleased with this headset 1 
i bought this phone as a replacement for my startac and have regretted it since 0 
overall i rate this movie a 10 out of a 110 scale 1 
this is a great little item 1 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
ive owned this phone for 7 months now and can say that its the best mobile phone ive had 1 
fantastic buy and will get again for whatever my next phone is 1 
i checked out this place a couple years ago and was not impressed 0 
i would not recommend this place 0 
the bathrooms are clean and the place itself is well decorated 1 
did not like at all 0 
think it over when you plan to own this onethis sure is the last moto phone for me 0 
ray charles is legendary 1 
could not get strong enough signal 0 
magical help 1 
the seller is very understanding and patient i would definitely buy from them again 1 
i would have casted her in that role after ready the script 1 
these are fabulous 1 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
its welldesigned and very sharp the blue is a very nice color 1 
i had the mac salad and it was pretty bland so i will not be getting that again 0 
saggy floppy piece of junk 0 
a must study for anyone interested in the worst sins of industrial design 0 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
tried to go here for lunch and it was a madhouse 0 
awesome service and food 1 
even if you love bad movies do not watch this movie 0 
really bad 0 
they have a really nice atmosphere 1 
the speaker is of low quality so as making the ring tones sound very cheap 0 
if you love death and decay and shakespears lyrics this is the one 1 
the atmosphere was great with a lovely duo of violinists playing songs we requested 1 
yeah the movie pretty much sucked 0 
but the convoluted plot just didnt convince me and much of the film was watched with a weird questioning glance 0 
it had some average acting from the main person and it was a low budget as you clearly can see 0 
it doesnt work in europe or asia 0 
this movie has a cutting edge to it 1 
great movie 1 
worst foodservice ive had in a while 0 
but its just not funny 0 
i would advise to not purchase this item it never worked very well 0 
i understand that its supposed to be a cheap popcorn comedy but that doesnt mean that it has to completely insult our intelligence and have writing so incredibly hackneyed that it borders on offensive 0 
end of days is one of the worst bigbudget action movies ive ever seen 0 
the acting as youd expect from this cast is top notch 1 
tom wilkinson broke my heart at the end and everyone elses judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike 1 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
what should have been a hilarious yummy christmas eve dinner to remember was the biggest fail of the entire trip for us 0 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
the nano stated itmy son was dissapointed 0 
this is not moviemaking 0 
battery life is also great 1 
good protection and does not make phone too bulky 1 
my only problem is i thought the actor playing the villain was a low rent michael ironside 0 
i was totally fascinated by the music the dancing everything 1 
itll be a regular stop on my trips to phoenix 1 
the sweet potato tots were good but the onion rings were perfection or as close as i have had 1 
great audio 1 
i am very impressed with the job that motorola did on the sturdiness of this phone 1 
conclusion i loved it 1 
on three different occasions i asked for well done or medium well and all three times i got the bloodiest piece of meat on my plate 0 
i would recommend purchasing the jabra jx10 series 2 which works flawlessly with my moto q go figure 1 
the phone crashed completely and now i have to get it replaced 0 
never heard of any of them except cole who was totally unbelievable in the part 0 
horrible horrible protector 0 
i would not recommend this place 0 
we watched our waiter pay a lot more attention to other tables and ignore us 0 
and those baby owls were adorable 1 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
you also cannot take pictures with it in the case because the lense is covered 0 
you truly take this journey through the eyes and soul of a child 1 
i have tried these cables with my computer and my ipod and it works just fine 1 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
the only thing i wasnt too crazy about was their guacamole as i dont like it puréed 0 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
top line dont waste your time and money on this one its as bad as it comes 0 
however this didnt make up for the fact that overall this was a tremendously boring movie 0 
my phone doesnt slide around my car now and the grip prevents my phone from slipping out of my hand 1 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
of all the dishes the salmon was the best but all were great 1 
i have had tmobile service for 2 or 3 years now and i am pretty happy with it 1 
this pair of headphones is the worst that i have ever had soundwise 0 
freezes frequently4 0 
must have been an off night at this place 0 
and it was way to expensive 0 
how awful she is 0 
i hope this place sticks around 1 
do not waste your money here 0 
the plot well i said id let that one go 0 
id rather eat airline food seriously 0 
it also took her forever to bring us the check when we asked for it 0 
the plot simply rumbles on like a machine desperately depending on the addition of new scenes 0 
ill be looking for a new earpiece 0 
its a feelgood film and thats how i felt when i came out of the cinema 1 
i love the ownerchef his one authentic japanese cool dude 1 
the battery is working well as a replacement for the original that came with the phone over 2 years ago 1 
but in terms of the writing its very fresh and bold 1 
the pizza selections are good 1 
it has a great camera thats 2mp and the pics are nice and clear with great picture quality 1 
i will never forget it now 1 
the story unfolds in 18th century jutland and the use of period music played on period instruments is just one more fine touch 1 
1010 1 
voice recognition is tremendous 1 
there are the usual hitchcock logic flaws 0 
i was very disappointed in the movie 0 
the text messaging feature is really tricky to use 0 
the battery is working well as a replacement for the original that came with the phone over 2 years ago 1 
the battery works great 1 
im very disappointed with my decision 0 
it lasts less than 3o minutes if i actually try to use the phonemy wife has the same phone with the same problem 0 
i will come back here every time im in vegas 1 
i as well wouldve given godfathers zero stars if possible 0 
very good phone 1 
in fact i liked it better than interview with a vampire and i liked this lestat stuart townsend better than cruises attempt 1 
seafood was limited to boiled shrimp and crab legs but the crab legs definitely did not taste fresh 0 
too bad you have to pay up to a month for the service 0 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
absolutely great 1 
brilliance indeed 1 
i dont understand how this garbage got on the shelves of the movie store its not even a real movie 0 
better than youd expect 1 
a usable keyboard actually turns a pda into a realworld useful machine instead of just a neat gadget 1 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
im surprised this is a good quality car charger and theres not much reviews about it 1 
worst hour and a half of my lifeoh my gosh 0 
i was bored throughout the whole damn thing 0 
cinematography noteworthy including fine views of barcelona and its famed gaudi towers 1 
the acting as youd expect from this cast is top notch 1 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
of all the dishes the salmon was the best but all were great 1 
im big fan of rpg games too but this movie its a disgrace to any selfrespecting rpger there is 0 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
i do not know if this was emilio estevezs directorial debut but the pacing the interplay and development of the characters as well as some clever camera work surrounding the character estevez plays all suggest a natural eye 1 
almost all of the songs in cover girl are oldfashioned and not very tuneful 0 
we have gotten a lot of compliments on it 1 
best tater tots in the southwest 1 
this is the place where i first had pho and it was amazing 1 
very cheap plastic creaks like an old wooden floor 0 
big disappointment with calendar sync 0 
the phone is sturdy and waterproof 1 
so bad 0 
i immediately said i wanted to talk to the manager but i did not want to talk to the guy who was doing shots of fireball behind the bar 0 
before i go in to why i gave a 1 star rating please know that this was my third time eating at bachi burger before writing a review 0 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
they brought a fresh batch of fries and i was thinking yay something warm but no 0 
funny clever hip just like prays previous film hype 1 
which are small and not worth the price 0 
the mic there is a joke and the volume is quite low 0 
defective crap 0 
after one bite i was hooked 1 
the pan cakes everyone are raving about taste like a sugary disaster tailored to the palate of a six year old 0 
dee snider just plain sucks 0 
the flat reenactments dont hold your attention because they are emotionally adrift and stagy 0 
fantastic service here 1 
just does not work 0 
avoid avoid avoid 0 
good food good service 1 
if you want a real scare rent this one 1 
i would recommend purchasing the jabra jx10 series 2 which works flawlessly with my moto q go figure 1 
all the pretty pictures in the world cannot make up for a piece of work that is flawed at the core 0 
the worst phone ive ever had only had it for a few months 0 
in addition to having one of the most lovely songs ever written french cancan also boasts one of the cutest leading ladies ever to grace the screen 1 
i let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this bad idea we both hated it 0 
better than youd expect 1 
pretty piece of junk 0 
i bought this battery with a coupon from amazon and im very happy with my purchase 1 
great for the jawbone 1 
give this one a look 1 
i highly recommend this modest priced cellular phone 1 
terrible service 0 
con spotty service 0 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
nicest chinese restaurant ive been in a while 1 
it was a long time that i didnt see a so charismatic actor on screen 1 
putting the race card aside lets look at the major flaw in the film they destroy latifas character 0 
the owners really really need to quit being soooooo cheap let them wrap my freaking sandwich in two papers not one 0 
its like a really sexy party in your mouth where youre outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party 1 
its worth driving up from tucson 1 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
this does not fit the palm tungsten e2 and it broke the first time i tried to plug it in 0 
he is one of my favourite directors and one of the most talented directors in the history of cinema 1 
graphics is far from the best part of the game 0 
i have eaten here multiple times and each time the food was delicious 1 
overall i was not impressed and would not go back 0 
id advise anyone to go and see it 1 
this is not moviemaking 0 
i understand that its supposed to be a cheap popcorn comedy but that doesnt mean that it has to completely insult our intelligence and have writing so incredibly hackneyed that it borders on offensive 0 
if you want a sandwich just go to any firehouse 1 
its been my choice headset for yearsgreat sound good volume good noise cancellation 1 
awesome service and food 1 
amazon sucks 0 
i would highly recommend this product 1 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
the movie is not completely perfect but titta di girolamo will stay with you for a long time after the vision of the movie 1 
the ambiance was incredible 1 
its a fresh subtle and rather sublime effect 1 
we waited an hour for what was a breakfast i could have done 100 times better at home 0 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
i did not expect this to be so good 1 
great pizza and salads 1 
first time there and might just be the last 0 
i thought errol flynn was brilliant as custer and has since become my favourite actor 1 
superb phone on a great network 1 
it sure does beat the nachos at the movies but i would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant 0 
the acting was decidely wooden though no worse than a period universal b movie 0 
does not work for listening to music with the cingular 8125 0 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
also the story and acting were weak 0 
soggy and not good 0 
the hockey scenes are terrible defensemen playing like theyre 5 years old goalies diving at shots that are 10 feet wide of the net etc 0 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
so i am here to warn youdo not rent this movie it is the dumbest thing you have never seen 0 
bad quality 0 
someone shouldve invented this sooner 1 
the scenery that the two daughters paint and photograph are beautiful 1 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
the art style has the appearance of crayonpencil drawings and is wonderfully colorful and fanciful 1 
sam shepards portrayal of a gung ho marine was sobering 1 
i as well wouldve given godfathers zero stars if possible 0 
appears to actually outperform the original battery from china that came with my v325i 1 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
walked in and the place smelled like an old grease trap and only 2 others there eating 0 
woa talk about awful 0 
its just painful 0 
excellent bluetooth headset 1 
i have only had it for a few weeks but so far so good 1 
recommend with confidence 1 
trouble is the writing and directing make it impossible to establish those things that make a movie watchable like character story theme and so on 0 
when i received my pita it was huge it did have a lot of meat in it so thumbs up there 1 
a standout scene 1 
an excellent new restaurant by an experienced frenchman 1 
that just screams legit in my booksomethats also pretty rare here in vegas 1 
disappointment i hate anything that goes in my ear 0 
it is so small and you dont even realize that it is there after a while of getting used to it 1 
hands down my favorite italian restaurant 1 
it does everything the description said it would 1 
this place is not worth your time let alone vegas 0 
i started this review with two stars but im editing it to give it only one 0 
what makes this story different are the terrific production values faultless photography composition and editing the terrific casting the underappreciated brian keith playing a bully teddy and vivid history 1 
when im on this side of town this will definitely be a spot ill hit up again 1 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
great earpiece 1 
all in all id expected a better consumer experience from motorola 0 
easy to use 1 
this film has no redeeming features 0 
this case has passed the one year mark and while it shows signs of wear it is 100 functional 1 
it shouldnt take 30 min for pancakes and eggs 0 
not good when wearing a hat or sunglasses 0 
took an hour to get our food only 4 tables in restaurant my food was luke warm our sever was running around like he was totally overwhelmed 0 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
everything captain howdy says is either laughable or just plain stupid 0 
food was great and so was the serivce 1 
a very charming film with wonderful sentiment and heart 1 
all i have to say is the food was amazing 1 
great phone 1 
my husband and i ate lunch here and were very disappointed with the food and service 0 
nice headset priced right 1 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
im very disappointed with my decision 0 
woa talk about awful 0 
i ordered the lemon raspberry ice cocktail which was also incredible 1 
excellent product for the price 1 
the writer gorman bechard undoubtedly did his homework because all references are industry and characterage appropriate 1 
totally believable 1 
i dont think there are any redeeming qualities in this remake 0 
the service was outshining i definitely recommend the halibut 1 
this movie is terrible 0 
to my disbelief each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods i have ever tasted 0 
it feels poorly constructed the menus are difficult to navigate and the buttons are so recessed that it is difficult to push them 0 
a good commentary of todays love and undoubtedly a film worth seeing 1 
finally after three or four times the spring of the latch broke and i could not use it any longer on the visor 0 
horrible phone 0 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
ive owned this phone for 7 months now and can say that its the best mobile phone ive had 1 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
it was horrible 0 
at no point in the proceedings does it look remotely like america 0 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
waiter was a jerk 0 
see it 1 
i did not bother contacting the company for few dollar product but i learned the lesson that i should not have bought this form online anyway 0 
i would advise to not purchase this item it never worked very well 0 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
none of them are engaging or exciting 0 
i cannot believe that the actors agreed to do this film 0 
the phone loads super 1 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
even if you love bad movies do not watch this movie 0 
both of the egg rolls were fantastic 1 
its this pandering to the audience that sabotages most of his films 0 
but it picked up speed and got right to the point 1 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
1010 1 
it works fine on my motorola 325 cellphone and a lot better than the wornout battery did 1 
the lighting is just dark enough to set the mood 1 
the budget was evidently very limited 0 
the instructions didnt explain that a microphone jack could be used 0 
director paul matthews who also wrotedirected the weak 1995 monster movie grim clearly doesnt know how to pace his films 0 
a happy wonderful feel good ending 1 
setup went very smoothly 1 
i was very disappointed 0 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
poor talk time performance 0 
i know this is not like the other restaurants at all something is very off here 0 
very tough and very short on flavor 0 
even in my bmw 3 series which is fairly quiet i have trouble hearing what the other person is saying 0 
dont make the same mistake that i did and please dont buy this phone 0 
reasonably priced also 1 
im in az all the time and now have my new spot 1 
nice blanket of moz over top but i feel like this was done to cover up the subpar food 1 
dont miss it 1 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
check it out 1 
the service was meh 0 
i have always used corded headsets and the freedom from the wireless is very helpful 1 
it crackles with an unpredictable youthful energy but honestly i found it hard to follow and concentrate on it meanders so badly 0 
i struggle to find anything bad to say about it 1 
wont ever go here again 0 
everyone is treated equally special 1 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
the visual effects were awful 0 
wont ever go here again 0 
great pocket pc phone combination 1 
the burger had absolutely no flavor the meat itself was totally bland the burger was overcooked and there was no charcoal flavor 0 
highquality chicken on the chicken caesar salad 1 
but its just not funny 0 
the staff was very attentive 1 
both do good jobs and are quite amusing 1 
this product is great it makes working a lot easier i can go to the copier while waiting on hold for something 1 
their monster chicken fried steak and eggs is my all time favorite 1 
the scenes with the ohsomature neighbourgirl are a misplace 0 
doesnt last long 0 
stopped by during the late may bank holiday off rick steve recommendation and loved it 1 
i just wanted to leave 0 
service is perfect and the family atmosphere is nice to see 1 
classywarm atmosphere fun and fresh appetizers succulent steaks baseball steak 1 
as for the service im a fan because its quick and youre being served by some nice folks 1 
seriously killer hot chai latte 1 
not worth it 0 
this place is great 1 
all of the main players are mesmerising 1 
i saw this short film on hbo the other day and absolutely loved it 1 
then i watched it again two sundays ago march 20th 2005 and i began to really enjoy it and this time i taped the entire thing 1 
you need two hands to operate the screenthis software interface is decade old and cannot compete with new software designs 0 
the only thing worse than taylors acting was stanwycks singing 0 
say bye bye to your tip lady 0 
not recommended 0 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
but the premise of the film was so ridiculous that the president of the us 0 
if you simply want a small flip phone look elsewhere as the extra bells whistles are mediocre 0 
its pure brilliance 1 
jamie foxx absolutely is ray charles 1 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
mishima is extremely uninteresting 0 
omelets are to die for 1 
funny clever hip just like prays previous film hype 1 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
first of all there are enough racial stereotypes and racial jokes to offend everyone 0 
i think it was robert ryans best film because he portrayed someone like my father and he was a schizophrenic in real lifemy father although he never murdered anyone but was affected more so during the second world war which made him worse 1 
it is not good 0 
battery lasts only a few hours 0 
i love my 350 headset my jabra350 bluetooth headset is great the reception is very good and the ear piece is a comfortable fit 1 
but even the talented carrell cant save this 0 
if you want a sandwich just go to any firehouse 1 
im really disappointed all i have now is a charger that doesnt work 0 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
the company shipped my product very promptly and it works well 1 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
adapter does not provide enough charging current 0 
wont go back 0 
the kids are annoying 0 
worked very well paired with a treo 700w and as a skype headset on my pc using a usb bluetooth transceiver 1 
then i had to continue pairing it periodically since it somehow kept dropping 0 
nothing short of magnificent photographycinematography in this film 1 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
very nice and relaxing late night viewing 1 
my wife had the lobster bisque soup which was lukewarm 0 
and sometimes it was so embarrassing that i had to look away 0 
i had strawberry tea which was good 1 
waste of money 0 
that just screams legit in my booksomethats also pretty rare here in vegas 1 
i have been very happy with the 510 and have had no complaints from any one regarding my sound quality on their end 1 
if you check the directors filmography on this site you will see why this film didnt have a chance 0 
the company shipped my product very promptly and it works well 1 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
very disappointing 0 
i was deeply impressed with the character he played 1 
the songs were the best and the muppets were so hilarious 1 
it was so funny 1 
ray charles is legendary 1 
these are the central themes of the film and they are handled ineptly stereotypically and with no depth of imagination 0 
perabo has a nice energy level and is obviously very comfortable in front of a camera 1 
another note about this phones appearance is that it really looks rather bland especially in the all black model 0 
the dining space is tiny but elegantly decorated and comfortable 1 
the screen does get smudged easily because it touches your ear and face 0 
portable and it works 1 
cumbersome design 0 
i could care less the interior is just beautiful 1 
i guess it was supposed to be clever twist then shed some light on the situation but it was just stupid 0 
highly recommended for all ages although the younger set will probably not appreciate some of the more subtle references they will certainly appreciate one galley scene in particular 1 
will not be back 0 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
fantastic earphones 1 
i had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get some relief 0 
i would not recommend this place 0 
the pizza tasted old super chewy in not a good way 0 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
barney is definitely super de duper 1 
it was pretty gross 0 
even when the women finally show up there is no sign of improvement the most expected things happen and by the time the film is over you might be far asleep 0 
the place was fairly clean but the food simply wasnt worth it 0 
what a waste 0 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
i am very happy 1 
i am not a filmmaker nor am i a director but i would hide my head in the sand if id spent whatever amount of money and time on this movie 0 
i hate to disagree with my fellow yelpers but my husband and i were so disappointed with this place 0 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
i will never go back to this place and will never ever recommended this place to anyone 0 
the range is very decent ive been able to roam around my house with the phone in the living room with no receptionsound quality issues 1 
fantastic buy and will get again for whatever my next phone is 1 
great service and food 1 
how awful she is 0 
id say that would be the hardest decision honestly all of ms dishes taste how they are supposed to taste amazing 1 
what should have been a hilarious yummy christmas eve dinner to remember was the biggest fail of the entire trip for us 0 
all the bread is made inhouse 1 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
however the ear pads come off easily and after only one week i lost one 0 
i saw this film over christmas and what a great film it was 1 
there is however some pretty good acting at least for this type of film 1 
the headsets are easy to use and everyone loves them 1 
it is the best charger i have seen on the market yet 1 
a drive thru means you do not want to wait around for half an hour for your food but somehow when we end up going here they make us wait and wait 0 
the cast is good 1 
seafood was limited to boiled shrimp and crab legs but the crab legs definitely did not taste fresh 0 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
the sound is clear and the people i talk to on it are amazed at the quality too 1 
the pizza tasted old super chewy in not a good way 0 
by this time our side of the restaurant was almost empty so there was no excuse 0 
well never go again 0 
almost everyone involved must be return to school acting is utterly predictable and bad script is pile of garbage all round 0 
i own a jabra earset and was very happy with it but the sound quality especially outgoing on this is better 1 
mark my words this is one of those cult films like evil dead 2 or phantasm that people will still be discovering and falling in love with 20 30 40 years down the line 1 
i can say that the desserts were yummy 1 
i left with a stomach ache and felt sick the rest of the day 0 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
reaching for the bottom row is uncomfortable and the send and end keys are not where i expect them to be3 0 
the potatoes were like rubber and you could tell they had been made up ahead of time being kept under a warmer 0 
this one works and was priced right 1 
also the story and acting were weak 0 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
it clicks into place in a way that makes you wonder how long that mechanism would last 0 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
it features an outlandish array of memorable psychotic but lovable nuts 1 
one of my favorite purchases ever 1 
when my mom and i got home she immediately got sick and she only had a few bites of salad 0 
this if the first movie ive given a 10 to in years 1 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
i also didnt like the on button it felt like it would crack with use 0 
the lighting is just dark enough to set the mood 1 
tonight i had the elk filet specialand it sucked 0 
my phone doesnt slide around my car now and the grip prevents my phone from slipping out of my hand 1 
worst customer service ever 0 
the design is very good4 1 
still waiting im sure this item would work well if i ever recieve it 0 
battery chargelife is quite long 1 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
it was a drive to get there 0 
emily watsons character is very strong and she has only to give a quick glance and you understand everything 1 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
i like the fact that it rests lightly against your ear rather than inside 1 
what the hell kind of crap is that 0 
the meat was pretty dry i had the sliced brisket and pulled pork 0 
works as described 1 
this case has passed the one year mark and while it shows signs of wear it is 100 functional 1 
worst service to boot but that is the least of their worries 0 
this battery is an excellent bargain 1 
not my thing 0 
it really created a unique feeling though 1 
he is almost unbearable to watch on screen he has little to no charisma and terrible comedic timing 0 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
i am a fan of his this movie sucked really bad 0 
will go back next trip out 1 
worst phone ever 0 
nothing at all to recommend 0 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
a must study for anyone interested in the worst sins of industrial design 0 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
great place to relax and have an awesome burger and beer 1 
here in the wind and the lion we see a wonderful rendering of americas own imperial age 1 
first of all there are enough racial stereotypes and racial jokes to offend everyone 0 
its a feelgood film and thats how i felt when i came out of the cinema 1 
great time family dinner on a sunday night 1 
what a big waste of time 0 
go to place for gyros 1 
that being said for a phone the camera is very nice many cool effects to play with and video is decent as well 1 
i was so insulted 0 
my salad had a bland vinegrette on the baby greens and hearts of palm 0 
battery life is also great 1 
this pda rocks 1 
i keep watching it over and over 1 
hands down my favorite italian restaurant 1 
conclusion i loved it 1 
theres really nothing bad i can say about this headset 0 
but now that it is out of warranty the same problems reoccurebottom line put your money somewhere else cingular will not support it 0 
now we were chosen to be tortured with this disgusting piece of blatant american propaganda 0 
great product 1 
and i just love the colors 1 
no im going to eat the potato that i found some strangers hair in it 0 
i gave it a 10 1 
trouble is the writing and directing make it impossible to establish those things that make a movie watchable like character story theme and so on 0 
i know this is not like the other restaurants at all something is very off here 0 
these are fabulous 1 
i really loved the story line and the poler bear was kinda cutebut if anyone has a question about fort steele just ask away 1 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
the aerial scenes were welldone 1 
save your money ive had this item for 11 months now 0 
and those baby owls were adorable 1 
considering the relations off screen between taylor and stanwyck it was surprising how little chemistry there was on screen between the two of them 0 
but it picked up speed and got right to the point 1 
iam very pleased with my purchase 1 
motorola finally got the voice quality of a bluetooth headset right 1 
even when the women finally show up there is no sign of improvement the most expected things happen and by the time the film is over you might be far asleep 0
