im so sorry but i really cant recommend it to anyone 0 
good quality 1 
you can find better movies at youtube 0 
i have to use the smallest earpieces provided but it stays on pretty well 1 
and considering the two of us left there very full and happy for about 20 you just cant go wrong 1 
kids pizza is always a hit too with lots of great side dish options for the kiddos 1 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
the only downside is the service 0 
that just screams legit in my booksomethats also pretty rare here in vegas 1 
this is a really fantastic thai restaurant which is definitely worth a visit 1 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
doesnt do the job 0 
the puppets look really cheesy not in a good way like in the puppet master 80s flicks 0 
you cant beat that 1 
the ambience is wonderful and there is music playing 1 
its just painful 0 
the service was terrible food was mediocre 0 
the acting was bad the dialogs were extremely shallow and insincere 0 
the meat was pretty dry i had the sliced brisket and pulled pork 0 
how can that bethe audio quality is poor 0 
it was a long time that i didnt see a so charismatic actor on screen 1 
owners are really great people 1 
the story is lame not interesting and never really explains the sinister origins of the puppets 0 
the bipolarity of the ruthless thug one minute a ruthless killer the next minute a luvs diaper commercial is completely unconvincing 0 
and it was way to expensive 0 
what a waste of time 0 
disappointing experience 0 
today the graphics are crap 0 
the jabra eargels fit my ears very well 1 
avoid this establishment 0 
there are so many problems i dont know where to start 0 
the design might be ergonomic in theory but i could not stand having these in my ear 0 
i think not again 0 
i could not understand what kind of idiot would produce this mess in the first place not to mention several season 0 
worked great 1 
simple lightweight and great fit 1 
there is so much good food in vegas that i feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to rice and company 0 
which is precisely why i am giving it such a bad review 0 
everything on the menu is terrific and we were also thrilled that they made amazing accommodations for our vegetarian daughter 1 
hitchcock is a great director 1 
weird vibe from owners 0 
i really enjoyed eating here 1 
the food was outstanding and the prices were very reasonable 1 
good product good seller 1 
people who like european films and art movies will like this movie 1 
this wonderful experience made this place a muststop whenever we are in town again 1 
gets a signal when other verizon phones wont 1 
horrible 0 
the plot has more holes than a pair of fishnet stockings and the direction and editing is astonishingly ham fisted 0 
in the span of an hour i had two people exclaim whoa is that the new phone on tv 1 
ive also had problems with the phone reading the memory card in which i always turn it on and then off again 0 
the meat was pretty dry i had the sliced brisket and pulled pork 0 
for people who are first timers in film making i think they did an excellent job 1 
this is essentially a communications tool that does not communicate 0 
spoilers whatever else can or cant be said about it surface is superbly crafted 1 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
im so sorry but i really cant recommend it to anyone 0 
that was nice 1 
lifetime does not air it enough so if anyone knows what store sells it let me know because this is a musthave 1 
very disappointing 0 
very funny 1 
i can take a little bad service but the food sucks 0 
it was so funny 1 
it is a really good show to watch 1 
dont buy it 0 
best breakfast buffet 1 
looks great and is strong 1 
great food and great service in a clean and friendly setting 1 
very poor service 0 
bad day or not i have a very low tolerance for rude customer service people it is your job to be nice and polite wash dishes otherwise 0 
linksys should have some way to exchange a bad phone for a refurb unit or something 0 
great pocket pc phone combination 1 
battery is terrible 0 
as for the service im a fan because its quick and youre being served by some nice folks 1 
this pair of headphones is the worst that i have ever had soundwise 0 
yet plantronincs continues to use the same flawed charger design 0 
i am very happy 1 
using all earpieces left or right this thing will not stay on my ear 0 
the text messaging feature is really tricky to use 0 
my girlfriends veal was very bad 0 
just spicy enough perfect actually 1 
very bad performance plays angela bennett a computer expert who is at home all the time 0 
i could eat their bruschetta all day it is devine 1 
host staff were for lack of a better word bitches 0 
this is a really fantastic thai restaurant which is definitely worth a visit 1 
this movie is also revealing 1 
the telephone repair man was really funny and his reactions to the nuts and bitchy boss were truly genuine 1 
excellent product for the price 1 
this product is clearly not ready for prime time i dont care how cool it looks if you cant tell a call is coming in its worthless 0 
host staff were for lack of a better word bitches 0 
i am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this 1 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
okay i like to consider myself a fair critic so ill give credit where credits duethe creature effects were actually pretty cool 1 
i dont each much pasta but i love the homemade hand made pastas and thin pizzas here 1 
both actors truly understand and become their particular character delivering a convincing sincere performance 1 
i have two more years left in this contract and i hate this phone 0 
steamboat willie is an amazingly important film to our cinema history 1 
better than expected 1 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
so there is no way for me to plug it in here in the us unless i go by a converter 0 
very very disappointed ordered the 35 big bay plater 0 
save your money ive had this item for 11 months now 0 
lordy the khao soi is a dish that is not to be missed for curry lovers 1 
the malta settings are as dry and as barren as the dialogue 0 
now this dish was quite flavourful 1 
this is definitely one of the better documentaries i have seen looking at family relationships and marriage 1 
this pda rocks 1 
the company shipped my product very promptly and it works well 1 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
lastly the mozzarella sticks they were the best thing we ordered 1 
our server was super nice and checked on us many times 1 
bt50 battery junk 0 
this is an outstanding little restaurant with some of the best food i have ever tasted 1 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
i had to go to a store and bought a new nokia phone which is working great 1 
this place has it 1 
i am glad i purchased it 1 
everything was fresh and delicious 1 
as for the mains also uninspired 0 
i never walked out of a movie faster 0 
babie bop is very cute 1 
nice spicy and tender 1 
while you dont yet hear mickey speak there are tons of sound effects and music throughout the filmsomething we take for granted now but which was a huge crowd pleaser in 1928 1 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
it presents a idyllic yet serious portrayal of the ups and downs of the characters lives 1 
i kept catching the cable on the seat and i had to pull the phone out to turn it on an off 0 
i especially love the long battery life 1 
awesome selection of beer 1 
why are these sad little vegetables so overcooked 0 
i dont think well be going back anytime soon 0 
the only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive 1 
its worth driving up from tucson 1 
please dont waste your money 0 
when im on this side of town this will definitely be a spot ill hit up again 1 
food was delicious 1 
the croutons also taste homemade which is an extra plus 1 
i cant wait to go back 1 
no actress has been worse used that june allison in this movie 0 
he is almost unbearable to watch on screen he has little to no charisma and terrible comedic timing 0 
i recommend igo to anyone with different brand cell phonesmp3 players in the family 1 
the acting as youd expect from this cast is top notch 1 
i gave it 5 stars because of the sound quality 1 
after one bite i was hooked 1 
this phone is very fast with sending any kind of messages and web browsing is significantly faster than previous phones i have used 1 
the movie was so boring that i sometimes found myself occupied peaking in the paper instead of watching never happened during a columbo movie before 0 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
summary the witticisms werent witty 0 
i own a jabra earset and was very happy with it but the sound quality especially outgoing on this is better 1 
youll love how thin it is 1 
i am going to have to be the first to negatively review this product 0 
i guess that nobody at the network that aired this dribble watched it before putting it on 0 
if you have several dozen or several hundred contacts then imagine the fun of sending each of them one by one 0 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
top line dont waste your time and money on this one its as bad as it comes 0 
when im on this side of town this will definitely be a spot ill hit up again 1 
i have had tmobile service for 2 or 3 years now and i am pretty happy with it 1 
i agree with jessica this movie is pretty bad 0 
instead we got a bore fest about a whiny spoiled brat babysitting 0 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
sending it back 0 
works great when my cat attacked the phone he scratched the protective strip instead of destroying the screen 1 
i mean this in a terrible way 0 
it has kept up very well 1 
im in az all the time and now have my new spot 1 
at around 4 pm i bought it at around 8pm i started to watch at around 815pm i fast forwarded the remaining film to see if there was anything left watchable for a human being with a brain but there wasnt 0 
i highly recommend these and encourage people to give them a try 1 
this is a disgrace 0 
mobile phone tools are a must have 1 
the acting by the whole cast could be put on a scale and balanced perfectly between overacting and underacting 0 
it is worth the drive 1 
the selection was probably the worst ive seen in vegasthere was none 0 
this is an unbelievable bargain 1 
i understand that its supposed to be a cheap popcorn comedy but that doesnt mean that it has to completely insult our intelligence and have writing so incredibly hackneyed that it borders on offensive 0 
a drive thru means you do not want to wait around for half an hour for your food but somehow when we end up going here they make us wait and wait 0 
muddy low quality sound and the casing around the wires insert was poorly super glued and slid off 0 
i left the theater with a lilt in my step joy in my heart and hope for the human race 1 
it felt like a very gripping intelligent stage play but without the overly theatrical feeling one actually gets from watching people on a stage which plays on everyones terror of a white lie escalating to monstrous consequences 1 
having to humour him just to get by and get through the day was so apt 1 
its one of the most boring horror movies from the 90s mainly because it starts slow and centers in a boring atmosphere 0 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
best ive found so far ive tried 2 other bluetooths and this one has the best quality for both me and the listener as well as ease of using 1 
great phone 1 
then a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use 0 
yes its that bad 0 
walked in and the place smelled like an old grease trap and only 2 others there eating 0 
his performance is simply genius 1 
probably not in a hurry to go back 0 
this is the phone to get for 2005 i just bought my s710a and all i can say is wow 1 
im not impressed with the concept or the food 0 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
we loved the biscuits 1 
the sound quality is good and functionality is awesome 1 
the steak and the shrimp are in my opinion the best entrees at gc 1 
i will not return 0 
when achille and philippa beautifully sing a duet from don giovanni that perfectly describes their situation in the movie you appreciate the subtle layers of this excellent film 1 
the fries were not hot and neither was my burger 0 
its very slow 0 
its welldesigned and very sharp the blue is a very nice color 1 
if you want a sandwich just go to any firehouse 1 
also its slim enough to fit into my alarm clock docking station without removing the case 1 
a usable keyboard actually turns a pda into a realworld useful machine instead of just a neat gadget 1 
im trying to return it for a refund 0 
it doesnt make you look cool 0 
we made the drive all the way from north scottsdale and i was not one bit disappointed 1 
its extremely slow and takes forever to do anything with it 0 
dont go here 0 
i came over from verizon because cingulair has nicer cell phones the first thing i noticed was the really bad service 0 
and the rest of it just sits there being awful with soldiers singing songs about the masculinity they pledge themselves to hairsplitting about purity the admiration of swords etc 0 
this film offers many delights and surprises 1 
this movie is possibly one of the most creative works of horror ever 1 
we enjoy their pizza and brunch 1 
worked perfectly 1 
both actors truly understand and become their particular character delivering a convincing sincere performance 1 
the flair bartenders are absolutely amazing 1 
it has kept up very well 1 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
as for the mains also uninspired 0 
a disappointment 0 
very good product well made 1 
youll love how thin it is 1 
i would have casted her in that role after ready the script 1 
overall i rate this movie a 10 out of a 110 scale 1 
i loved it it was really scary 1 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
this place is good 1 
what happened next was prettyoff putting 0 
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0 
i can take a little bad service but the food sucks 0 
the best place in vegas for breakfast just check out a sat or sun 1 
the jamaican mojitos are delicious 1 
everything stinks 0 
this is so embarassing and also my ears hurt if i try to push the ear plug into my ear 0 
not even a hello we will be right with you 0 
just reading on the specs alone makes you say wow 1 
lange had become a great actress 1 
i have been in more than a few bars in vegas and do not ever recall being charged for tap water 0 
the scenes are often funny and occasionally touching as the characters evaluate their lives and where they are going 1 
id say that would be the hardest decision honestly all of ms dishes taste how they are supposed to taste amazing 1 
very very disappointed ordered the 35 big bay plater 0 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
i got the car charger and not even after a week the charger was brokeni went to plug it in and it started smoking 0 
the fact is this film is a wonderful heartwarming tale about two people chasing their dreams 1 
its too bad that everyone else involved didnt share crowes level of dedication to quality for if they did wed have a far better film on our hands than this subpar mess 0 
what is even more stupid is that who had thought an idea that there should be a volcano in los angeles 0 
any grandmother can make a roasted chicken better than this one 0 
its a campy sort of film thats a joy to watch 1 
i love this place 1 
i like armand assante my cable companys summary sounded interesting so i watched it twice already and probably will again 1 
cheap but hey it works was pleasantly suprised given the low cost of this item 1 
the show would begin with smart ass ed comments to each other that would be totally off the wall and uncalled for 0 
i dont think ill be running back to carlys anytime soon for food 0 
despite the pans of reviewers i liked this movie 1 
his costars dont fare much better with people like morgan freeman jonah hill and ed helms just wasted 0 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
the plantains were the worst ive ever tasted 0 
great food and awesome service 1 
sounds good reasonably priced and effective its that simple 1 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
similarly the delivery man did not say a word of apology when our food was 45 minutes late 0 
the performances are not improved by improvisation because the actors now have twice as much to worry about not only whether theyre delivering the line well but whether the line itself is any good 0 
definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly will return next time im in vegas 1 
if this premise sound stupid thats because it is 0 
elias koteasjack palance play good roles angelina is hot and gets nakedbilly drago appears in this and is cool as usual a cameo by sven ole thorsen helps make this a very enjoyable movie with good acting and a decent budget 1 
a usable keyboard actually turns a pda into a realworld useful machine instead of just a neat gadget 1 
i find this inexcusable and so will probably be returning this phone and perhaps changing carriers 0 
you cant beat the price on these 1 
for a self proclaimed coffee cafe i was wildly disappointed 0 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
if it were possible to give them zero stars theyd have it 0 
portable and it works 1 
five star plus plus 1 
trying to make a call on these is an exercise in frustration 0 
its a sad movie but very good 1 
very good product well made 1 
the restaurant is very clean and has a family restaurant feel to it 1 
i will never forget it now 1 
not even good for camp value 0 
i didnt realize how wonderful the short really is until the last two scenes 1 
i find this inexcusable and so will probably be returning this phone and perhaps changing carriers 0 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
this place is not worth your time let alone vegas 0 
bad fit way too big 0 
trying to make a call on these is an exercise in frustration 0 
they refuse to refund or replace 0 
battery lasts only a few hours 0 
this film has no redeeming features 0 
voice quality signal strength dropped calls 0 
reaching for the bottom row is uncomfortable and the send and end keys are not where i expect them to be3 0 
the pizza tasted old super chewy in not a good way 0 
very nice and relaxing late night viewing 1 
very true to shakespear and a must for all shakespear fans 1 
the sweet potato fries were very good and seasoned well 1 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
the film has an ultracheap look to it 0 
works for me 1 
ive missed numerous calls because of this reason 0 
the sweet potato fries were very good and seasoned well 1 
join the club and get awesome offers via email 1 
brilliant 1 
if you see it you should probably just leave it on the shelf 0 
best tater tots in the southwest 1 
last night was my second time dining here and i was so happy i decided to go back 1 
but what really made it unwatchable was the direction 0 
aailiyah was pretty good as akasha in places compelling her first entrance and mini dance scene 1 
the cashier had no care what so ever on what i had to say it still ended up being wayyy overpriced 0 
about half way through this film i started to dislike it 0 
new battery works great in phone 1 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
now the burgers arent as good the pizza which used to be amazing is doughy and flavorless 0 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
its an empty hollow shell of a movie 0 
steve martin delivers a really funny performance of a middleaged upper class uptight white guy 1 
things that went wrong they burned the saganaki 0 
and i just love the colors 1 
the kids are very cool too 1 
the story unfolds in 18th century jutland and the use of period music played on period instruments is just one more fine touch 1 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
i left with a stomach ache and felt sick the rest of the day 0 
it is well made easy to access the phone and has a handy detachable belt clip 1 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
it just blew 0 
but this movie is definitely a below average rent 0 
great pocket pc phone combination 1 
there is simply no excuse for something this poorly done 0 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
the soundtrack sucked 0 
the movie was very interesting from beginning to the end 1 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
this place has it 1 
i kept catching the cable on the seat and i had to pull the phone out to turn it on an off 0 
jabra ear gels r the best 1 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
the movie in movie situations in the beginning and through the game that is played with her by the acting coach are fascinating 1 
i loved their mussels cooked in this wine reduction the duck was tender and their potato dishes were delicious 1 
the majority of the logitech earbud headsets failed 0 
excellent starter wireless headset 0 
and the chef was generous with his time even came around twice so we can take pictures with him 1 
i ordered the lemon raspberry ice cocktail which was also incredible 1 
this is the phone to get for 2005 i just bought my s710a and all i can say is wow 1 
im translating movies for a living and this is the first movie in my 5year working experience that i found offensive to my intelligence 0 
the fries were great too 1 
great it was new packaged nice works good no problems and it came in less time then i expected 1 
im returning them 0 
performed awful muffled tinny incoming sound and severe echo for those on the other end of the call 0 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
this film offers many delights and surprises 1 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
it showed exactly how the government and the scientist argued for humanity and the reasons of the gadget 1 
the mic there is a joke and the volume is quite low 0 
the film is well paced understated and one of the best courtroom documentaries ive seen 1 
i saw this movie and i thought this is a stupid movie 0 
we had fantastic service and were pleased by the atmosphere 1 
i mean in a realistic world she would never have gotten into that ballet repertory the whole thing was quite pathetic 0 
i mean this in a terrible way 0 
id love to go back 1 
i found this move beautiful enjoyable and uplifting 1 
they know how to make them here 1 
seriously its not worth wasting your or your kids time on 0 
the food is good 1 
i believe the screenwriter did a good job of tying up the loose ends 1 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
great product 1 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
worst customer service 0 
i even fully charged it before i went to bed and turned off blue tooth and wifi and noticed that it only had 20 left in the morning 0 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
will never ever go back and have told many people what had happened 0 
unreliable im giving up 0 
the movie seemed a little slow at first 0 
everything was fresh and delicious 1 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
i think i was one of the people who found this another one of roths pearls 1 
the phone gets extremely hot 0 
worthless product 0 
it is well made easy to access the phone and has a handy detachable belt clip 1 
gotta love those closeups of slimy drooling teeth 1 
we have tried 2 units and they both failed within 2 months pros 0 
needless to say i wont be going back anytime soon 0 
thank you for wasting my money 0 
will order from them again 1 
do not waste your time 0 
i received my orders well within the shipping timeframe everything was in good working order and overall i am very excited to have this source 1 
just dont know why they were so slow 0 
i seriously cannot believe that the owner has so many unexperienced employees that all are running around like chickens with their heads cut off 0 
after arguing with verizon regarding the dropped calls we returned the phones after two days 0 
his losing his marbles so early in the proceedings is totally implausible and unconvincing 0 
the igo chargers and tips are really great 1 
i love this cable it allows me to connect any miniusb device to my pc 1 
i found this move beautiful enjoyable and uplifting 1 
do not make the same mistake as me 0 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
2 times very bad customer service 0 
terrible my car will not accept this cassette 0 
worse theres an incredibly weak subplot thrown in that follows a little band of latterday mansonites as they go after a reporter whos working on a story on the anniversary of the killings 0 
it ranks highly as a great noircrimedrama incredible performances by belmondo and lino ventura 1 
so badwellits just bad 0 
disappointing experience 0 
lame would be the best way to describe it 0 
so flavorful and has just the perfect amount of heat 1 
no shifting no bubbling no peeling not even a scratch nothingi couldnt be more happier with my new one for the droid 1 
camerawork again bad 0 
you wont be disappointed 1 
i really like this product over the motorola because it is allot clearer on the ear piece and the mic 1 
when i received my pita it was huge it did have a lot of meat in it so thumbs up there 1 
do not waste your time 0 
im happy about this purchase good quality and low price 1 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
the story unfolds in 18th century jutland and the use of period music played on period instruments is just one more fine touch 1 
what a waste 0 
however the ear pads come off easily and after only one week i lost one 0 
disappointing experience 0 
i dont think there are any redeeming qualities in this remake 0 
never heard of any of them except cole who was totally unbelievable in the part 0 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
it has kept up very well 1 
i saw this film over christmas and what a great film it was 1 
im not sure what he was trying to do with this film 0 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
this product is clearly not ready for prime time i dont care how cool it looks if you cant tell a call is coming in its worthless 0 
regrettably the film fails 0 
the food is not tasty at all not to say its real traditional hunan style 0 
i dont think you will be disappointed 1 
the update procedure is difficult and cumbersome 0 
great bluetooth 1 
motorola finally got the voice quality of a bluetooth headset right 1 
the noise shield is incrediable 1 
otherwise easy to install and use clear sound 1 
this pair of headphones is the worst that i have ever had soundwise 0 
this movie now joins revenge of the boogeyman and zombiez as part of the hellish trinity of horror films 0 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
the whole experience was underwhelming and i think well just go to ninja sushi next time 0 
the acting from all involved and that includes those like shatner and nimoy is bad and washed out and making them seem as old as they look in real life the special effects are tacky like when spock has to rescue kirk on a jet pack when he falls down from a mountain 0 
i mean this in a terrible way 0 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
lewis blacks considerable talent is wasted here too as he is at his most incendiary when he is unrestrained which the pg13 rating certainly wont allow 0 
ive also had problems with the phone reading the memory card in which i always turn it on and then off again 0 
after 20 minutes wait i got a table 0 
some may say this buffet is pricey but i think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot 1 
the update procedure is difficult and cumbersome 0 
i would definitely recommend the jabra bt250v for those who are looking for comfort clarity and a great price 1 
avoid at all costs 0 
all i have to say is the food was amazing 1 
not recommended 0 
i got to enjoy the seafood salad with a fabulous vinegrette 1 
1010 1 
definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly will return next time im in vegas 1 
there still are good actors around 1 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
battery is terrible 0 
i would have casted her in that role after ready the script 1 
i really do recommend this place you can go wrong with this donut place 1 
excellent product 1 
i love the pho and the spring rolls oh so yummy you have to try 1 
avoid at all costs 0 
the phone takes forever to charge like 2 to 5 hours literally 0 
also the phone doesnt seem to accept anything except cbr mp3s preferably ripped by windows media player 0 
great character actors telly savalas and peter boyle 1 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
very satisifed with that 1 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
unfortunately inexperience of direction meant that scene after scene passed with little in the way of dramatic tension or conflict 0 
i thoroughly enjoyed it when christopher eccleston took control of the tardis and the continuation of the series 1 
give this one a look 1 
he really didnt seem to want to be hosting his voiceovers were monotonous didnt get involved with the guests 0 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
i wish i could enter negative values admins 0 
best breakfast buffet 1 
nice solid keyboard 1 
perabo has a nice energy level and is obviously very comfortable in front of a camera 1 
however my girl was complain that some time the phone doesnt wake up like normal phone does 0 
these headphones were a great find and i think they are perhaps the best purchase ive made in the last several years seriously 1 
worst customer service ever 0 
audio quality is poor very poor 0 
i purcashed this for the car charger and it does not work 0 
shes poised and amazing 1 
very very fun chef 1 
it has everything i need and i couldnt ask for more 1 
very poor service 0 
the only thing worse than taylors acting was stanwycks singing 0 
i loved their mussels cooked in this wine reduction the duck was tender and their potato dishes were delicious 1 
what makes this story different are the terrific production values faultless photography composition and editing the terrific casting the underappreciated brian keith playing a bully teddy and vivid history 1 
she ordered a toasted english muffin that came out untoasted 0 
its one of the movies i need to see whenever it comes on tvnever mind the fact that i already have it memorized 1 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
it plays louder than any other speaker of this size the price is so low that most would think the quality is lacking however its not 1 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
it was an inexpensive piece but i would still have expected better quality 0 
if you hate earbugs avoid this phone by all means 0 
on three different occasions i asked for well done or medium well and all three times i got the bloodiest piece of meat on my plate 0 
awsome device works great 1 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
headset works great was packaged nicely to avoid any damage 1 
a bit predictable 0 
the poor actors 0 
great phone 1 
its just lame 0 
its the best headset i have used 1 
defective crap 0 
the stories were powerful explorations of the nature of man and of art 1 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
the waitress was friendly and happy to accomodate for veganveggie options 1 
i highly recommend this movie for anyone interested in art poetry theater politics or japanese history 1 
go and see it 1 
ive owned this phone for 7 months now and can say that its the best mobile phone ive had 1 
then theres the plot holes 0 
i could eat their bruschetta all day it is devine 1 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
1010 1 
i love this place 1 
its quite simply the highest most superlative form of cinema imaginable 1 
great food and great service in a clean and friendly setting 1 
took an hour to get our food only 4 tables in restaurant my food was luke warm our sever was running around like he was totally overwhelmed 0 
about ten minutes into this film i started having second thoughts 0 
wont ever go here again 0 
battery chargelife is quite long 1 
price is good too 1 
i had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get some relief 0 
but then they came back cold 0 
great product and price 1 
absolutel junk 0 
first of all there are enough racial stereotypes and racial jokes to offend everyone 0 
every element of this story was so over the top excessively phony and contrived that it was painful to sit through 0 
i great reception all the time 1 
im not impressed with the concept or the food 0 
i am so pleased to know such a modern day genius is out there letting is passion for art drive him and taking us as an audience with him 1 
good price 1 
returned 8 hours later 0 
its a campy sort of film thats a joy to watch 1 
which has more depth and character than the man underneath it 0 
it holds a charge for a long time is reasonably comfortable under longwearing conditions and the quality of sound is tremendous 1 
their onscreen chemistry critical to the entire film is genuine 1 
this is my new fav vegas buffet spot 1 
if good intentions made a film great then this film might be one of the greatest films ever made 1 
the service was great even the manager came and helped with our table 1 
so i am here to warn youdo not rent this movie it is the dumbest thing you have never seen 0 
so flavorful and has just the perfect amount of heat 1 
to call this movie a drama is ridiculous 0 
all it took was one drop from about 6 inches above the kitchen counter and it was crackedi am not impressed and i am not laughing 0 
poor quality and service 0 
food was really boring 0 
today the graphics are crap 0 
gotta love those closeups of slimy drooling teeth 1 
avoid this film at all costs 0 
poor construction 0 
i believe that this place is a great stop for those with a huge belly and hankering for sushi 1 
reversible plug works great 1 
the phone loads super 1 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
i have never had such bland food which surprised me considering the article we read focused so much on their spices and flavor 0 
definitely a turn off for me i doubt ill be back unless someone else is buying 0 
this movie contained an allstar cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i havent seen before 1 
i purcashed this for the car charger and it does not work 0 
i dont understand how this garbage got on the shelves of the movie store its not even a real movie 0 
this product had a strong rubberpetroleum smell that was unbearable after a while and caused me to return it 0 
exceptionally bad 0 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
i would highly recommend this 1 
they could be used as exemplars for any set designer 1 
food was great and so was the serivce 1 
everything about it is just bad 0 
when a song could explain the emotions of the subjects better such as when jay adams unfortunate life was a subject of talk the song old man by neil young was played which evokes many emotions 1 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
echo problemvery unsatisfactory 0 
dont buy it 0 
john wayne did an incredible job for being so young in the movie industry 1 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
it was a pale color instead of nice and char and has no flavor 0 
i had strawberry tea which was good 1 
i hate those things as much as cheap quality black olives 0 
after 3 months screen just went black all of a sudden 0 
if you havent gone here go now 1 
really pleased with this product so far 1 
all this movie does is make you sick watching all these slackers make excuses for their stupid actions for 90 minutes 0 
this place is great 1 
avoid this film at all costs 0 
my brother in law who works at the mall ate here same day and guess what he was sick all night too 0 
we thought youd have to venture further away to get good sushi but this place really hit the spot that night 1 
hayao miyazakis latest and eighth film for studio ghibili gake no ue no ponyo ponyo on the cliff by the sea is a wonderfully fun and imaginative look at childhood 1 
best tater tots in the southwest 1 
ive also had problems with the phone reading the memory card in which i always turn it on and then off again 0 
sucked most of the stuff does not work with my phone 0 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
the nachos are a must have 1 
just reading on the specs alone makes you say wow 1 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
point your finger at any item on the menu order it and you wont be disappointed 1 
they have great dinners 1 
greatno problems at all 1 
all the characters in this film are tremendously well played 1 
insults profound deuchebaggery and had to go outside for a smoke break while serving just to solidify it 0 
frozen pucks of disgust with some of the worst people behind the register 0 
not worth it 0 
victor mclaglen was even bad and brian donlevy was almost unrecognizable 0 
and if that isnt enough of a mess of a movie for you the picture is also marred with a constant use of studio sets and indoor exteriors 0 
fantastic service here 1 
strike 2 who wants to be rushed 0 
a standout scene 1 
we ordered the duck rare and it was pink and tender on the inside with a nice char on the outside 1 
secondly hitchcock pretty much perfected the thriller and chase movie 1 
i am very happy 1 
it does everything the description said it would 1 
phenomenal food service and ambiance 1 
the owner used to work at nobu so this place is really similar for half the price 1 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
although i very much liked the look and sound of this place the actual experience was a bit disappointing 0 
i could barely stomach the meal but didnt complain because it was a business lunch 0 
great product for the price 1 
i mean this in a terrible way 0 
it was an inexpensive piece but i would still have expected better quality 0 
what a piece of junk i lose more calls on this phone 0 
battery lasts only a few hours 0 
everything on the menu is terrific and we were also thrilled that they made amazing accommodations for our vegetarian daughter 1 
it is perfect for a sitdown family meal or get together with a few friends 1 
waste of money 0 
woa talk about awful 0 
punishment park is a brilliant piece of cinema 1 
jabra ear gels r the best 1 
there still are good actors around 1 
avoid at all costs 0 
those phones are working just fine now 1 
lots of holes in the script 0 
heres where the movie really pied me off 0 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
after my phone got to be about a year old its been slowly breaking despite much care on my part 0 
good case excellent value 1 
recommend with confidence 1 
the sound quality is excellent as well 1 
hes a national treasure 1 
but now that it is out of warranty the same problems reoccurebottom line put your money somewhere else cingular will not support it 0 
this results in the phone being either stuck at max volume or mute 0 
linksys should have some way to exchange a bad phone for a refurb unit or something 0 
updatewent back for a second time and it was still just as amazing 1 
total letdown i would much rather just go to the camelback flower shop and cartel coffee 0 
i really recommend this faceplates since it looks very nice elegant and cool 1 
for that its worth checking out 1 
the story line is totally predictable 0 
cheap but hey it works was pleasantly suprised given the low cost of this item 1 
do not waste your money here 0 
i have two more years left in this contract and i hate this phone 0 
we ordered some old classics and some new dishes after going there a few times and were sorely disappointed with everything 0 
will order from them again 1 
just whatever you do avoid groove as its the antithesis of all that is good about human traffic 0 
an hour and a half i wish i could bring back 0 
call me a nut but i think this is one of the best movies ever 1
