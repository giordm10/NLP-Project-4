not tasty and the texture was just nasty 0 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
i can say that the desserts were yummy 1 
love the margaritas too 1 
prosgood camera very nice pictures also has cool styles like black and white and more 1 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
they do not last forever but is not overly expensive to replaceeasy to operate and the sound is much better than others i have tried 1 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
this movie was kind of long in length but i enjoyed every minute of it 1 
it is light has plenty of battery capacity and is very confortable to wear for somewhat extended periods of time 1 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
hitchcock is a great director 1 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
it looks very nice 1 
friends pasta also bad he barely touched it 0 
we enjoy their pizza and brunch 1 
the food sucked which we expected but it sucked more than we could have imagined 0 
the portion was huge 1 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
every thing on phone work perfectly she like it 1 
total brunch fail 0 
awesome selection of beer 1 
all the characters in this film are tremendously well played 1 
this is a great deal 1 
she carries the movie well 1 
i wasnt the least bit interested 0 
customer service was terrible 0 
the chicken i got was definitely reheated and was only ok the wedges were cold and soggy 0 
i believe the screenwriter did a good job of tying up the loose ends 1 
if it was to turn my good day feeling into a night of disturbing memories than i guess he succeeded 0 
that said our mouths and bellies were still quite pleased 1 
there is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again 0 
comes with a strong light that you can use to light up your camera shots and even flash sos signals seriously 1 
a greasy unhealthy meal 0 
oh and i forgot to also mention the weird color effect it has on your phone 0 
this product had a strong rubberpetroleum smell that was unbearable after a while and caused me to return it 0 
it definitely was not as good as my s11 1 
its welldesigned and very sharp the blue is a very nice color 1 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
they have been around for years and carries the highest quality of antiglare screen protector that i have found to date 1 
one nice thing was that they added gratuity on the bill since our party was larger than 6 or 8 and they didnt expect more tip than that 1 
i great reception all the time 1 
awful service 0 
the service was poor and thats being nice 0 
poor product 0 
its one of the movies i need to see whenever it comes on tvnever mind the fact that i already have it memorized 1 
the earpiece on this is too large or too heavyit keeps falling out of my ear 0 
this place is way too overpriced for mediocre food 0 
then scene where they debated whether or not to sack the trumpeter who falsely was accused for the murder is pure horror really stupid 0 
it is an insane game 1 
great price too 1 
it was so bad i had lost the heart to finish it 0 
on a positive note our server was very attentive and provided great service 1 
for sushi on the strip this is the place to go 1 
im a big fan of this series mostly due to anne rices style sensitivities and treatments 1 
i wear glasses and it fits fine with them 1 
at least think to refill my water before i struggle to wave you over for 10 minutes 0 
echo problemvery unsatisfactory 0 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
steer clear of this product and go with the genuine palm replacementr pens which come in a threepack 0 
i cant believe theres even a sequel to this 0 
i kept catching the cable on the seat and i had to pull the phone out to turn it on an off 0 
a week later after i activated it it suddenly died 0 
the food is rich so order accordingly 1 
the warm beer didnt help 0 
the camera really likes her in this movie 1 
one of my favorite purchases ever 1 
what a mistake 0 
the acting is fantastic the stories are seamlessly woven together and the dogs are splendid a must rent view or see 1 
buyer beware you could flush money right down the toilet 0 
not even a hello we will be right with you 0 
wont work right or atleast for me 0 
i as well wouldve given godfathers zero stars if possible 0 
the story unfolds in 18th century jutland and the use of period music played on period instruments is just one more fine touch 1 
the best example of how dumb the writing is when its established that you can turn the zombiestudents back into humans by removing a necklace containing a piece of the meteorite 0 
the film gives meaning to the phrase never in the history of human conflict has so much been owed by so many to so few 1 
the potato chip order was sad i could probably count how many chips were in that box and it was probably around 12 0 
that was nice 1 
this place receives stars for their appetizers 1 
the acting sucks the music sucks the script sucks the pacing sucks the special fx suck the directing sucks basically this movie sucks 0 
ive had better not only from dedicated boba tea spots but even from jenni pho 0 
it was also the right balance of war and love 1 
im really disappointed all i have now is a charger that doesnt work 0 
i must say i have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again 1 
con spotty service 0 
i wasted my little money with this earpiece 0 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
this is an unbelievable bargain 1 
the transfers are very good 1 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
if you look for authentic thai food go else where 0 
wed definitely go back here again 1 
everything captain howdy says is either laughable or just plain stupid 0 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
i hate those things as much as cheap quality black olives 0 
ive had this bluetoooth headset for some time now and still not comfortable with the way it fits on the ear 0 
highly recommended for all ages although the younger set will probably not appreciate some of the more subtle references they will certainly appreciate one galley scene in particular 1 
this is an outstanding little restaurant with some of the best food i have ever tasted 1 
its a long time since i was so entertained by a movie 1 
this fixes all the problems 1 
the script is a big flawed mess 0 
if she had not rolled the eyes we may have stayed not sure if we will go back and try it again 0 
if you stay in vegas you must get breakfast here at least once 1 
good product incredible value 1 
go and see it 1 
also makes it easier to hold on to 1 
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 
i knew when i saw the film that more great things were to come from this gifted actor 1 
we had 7 at our table and the service was pretty fast 1 
love it great armband 1 
did not like at all 0 
these are the central themes of the film and they are handled ineptly stereotypically and with no depth of imagination 0 
i thoroughly enjoyed it when christopher eccleston took control of the tardis and the continuation of the series 1 
the seller is very understanding and patient i would definitely buy from them again 1 
the art style has the appearance of crayonpencil drawings and is wonderfully colorful and fanciful 1 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
each track commands sentiment actually contributing to the scenes and characters 1 
food was really good and i got full petty fast 1 
the service was great even the manager came and helped with our table 1 
i work in the hospitality industry in paradise valley and have refrained from recommending cibo any longer 0 
i will continue to come here on ladies night andddd date night highly recommend this place to anyone who is in the area 1 
so good i am going to have to review this place twice once hereas a tribute to the place and once as a tribute to an event held here last night 1 
the performances are not improved by improvisation because the actors now have twice as much to worry about not only whether theyre delivering the line well but whether the line itself is any good 0 
otherwise easy to install and use clear sound 1 
clear crisp sound 1 
graphics is far from the best part of the game 0 
if you look for authentic thai food go else where 0 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
ive missed numerous calls because of this reason 0 
lousy product 0 
very serious spoilers this movie was a huge disappointment 0 
this is a great deal 1 
it is perfect for a sitdown family meal or get together with a few friends 1 
the acting from all involved and that includes those like shatner and nimoy is bad and washed out and making them seem as old as they look in real life the special effects are tacky like when spock has to rescue kirk on a jet pack when he falls down from a mountain 0 
cheap but hey it works was pleasantly suprised given the low cost of this item 1 
the point is the journey a journey that touches every member of the family 1 
i especially love the long battery life 1 
only like 3 or 4 buildings used a couple of locations maybe poor hummh 0 
this place is good 1 
avoid at all cost 0 
mobile phone tools are a must have 1 
the acting from all involved and that includes those like shatner and nimoy is bad and washed out and making them seem as old as they look in real life the special effects are tacky like when spock has to rescue kirk on a jet pack when he falls down from a mountain 0 
everything was good and tasty 1 
this scene is very strong and unpleasant 0 
this is one of the best movies out there that shows such strong sibling bond for each other 1 
the script is bad very bad  it contains both cheesiness and unethical joke that you normally see in rated r or nc17 movie 0 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
this place is not worth your time let alone vegas 0 
wow what a bad film 0 
i was very excited to get this headset because i thought it was really cute 1 
this place is not worth your time let alone vegas 0 
product was excellent and works better than the verizon one and boy was it cheaper 1 
i highly recommend this device to everyone 1 
the acting was decidely wooden though no worse than a period universal b movie 0 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
everything was fresh and delicious 1 
first time there and might just be the last 0 
prosgood camera very nice pictures also has cool styles like black and white and more 1 
one more thing i can tolerate political incorrectness very well im all for artistic freedom and suspension of disbelief but the slavic female character was just too much 0 
very good though 1 
not too screamy not to masculine but just right 1 
unfortunately it was not good 0 
the food is very good for your typical bar food 1 
horrible 0 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
probably not in a hurry to go back 0 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
worthless product 0 
im glad i found this product on amazon it is hard to find it wasnt high priced 1 
delicious 1 
cant upload ringtones from a third party 0 
for a product that costs as much as this one does i expect it to work far better and with greater ease than this thing does 0 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
also great directing and photography 1 
juano hernandez an exceptional actor who played supporting roles in many films of the era is a proud black man who is accused of murdering a white man in the south 1 
this was my first time and i cant wait until the next 1 
this convention never worked well in the past and certainly doesnt work here 0 
the battery runs down quickly 0 
in conclusion i will not bother with this movie because a volcano in los angeles is nothing but nonsense 0 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
my fiancé and i came in the middle of the day and we were greeted and seated right away 1 
nobody identifies with these characters because theyre all cardboard cutouts and stereotypes or predictably reversestereotypes 0 
easy to pair with my samsung cell 1 
on the up side their cafe serves really good food 1 
i liked the patio and the service was outstanding 1 
i would recommend this 1 
we waited an hour for what was a breakfast i could have done 100 times better at home 0 
tasted like dirt 0 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
i am very happy 1 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
the films sole bright spot was jonah hill who will look almost unrecognizable to fans of the recent superbad due to the amount of weight he lost in the interim 1 
the point is the journey a journey that touches every member of the family 1 
before i go in to why i gave a 1 star rating please know that this was my third time eating at bachi burger before writing a review 0 
treo and tmobile refused to replace it again and forced me to buy another phone without any kind of upgrade discount 0 
special thanks to dylan t for the recommendation on what to order all yummy for my tummy 1 
hell no will i go back 0 
i can take a little bad service but the food sucks 0 
but what really made it unwatchable was the direction 0 
yet plantronincs continues to use the same flawed charger design 0 
excellent service 1 
always a great time at dos gringos 1 
this movie does an excellent job of revealing the complexity of the task and the incredible challenges facing south africa 1 
awesome device 1 
i have had mine for about a year and this christmas i bought some for the rest of the family 1 
im still trying to get over how bad it was 0 
the plot is nonsense that doesnt interest in the slightest way or have any uniqueness to it 0 
we sat another ten minutes and finally gave up and left 0 
it definitely was not as good as my s11 1 
light weight i hardly notice it is there 1 
i bought this battery with a coupon from amazon and im very happy with my purchase 1 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
a disappointment 0 
and if that isnt enough of a mess of a movie for you the picture is also marred with a constant use of studio sets and indoor exteriors 0 
it really created a unique feeling though 1 
a truly truly bad film 0 
damn good steak 1 
battery is terrible 0 
i hate writing bad reviews about films especially those in which i really like the star but this film is so bad i dont believe for one second that anyone could have been proud of it 0 
this second appearance of mickey mouse following the silent plane crazy earlier that year is probably his most famous filmmostly because it was so groundbreaking 1 
and finally after all that we get to an ending that wouldve been great had it been handled by competent people and not jerry falwell 0 
couldnt use the unit with sunglasses not good in texas 0 
it has a great camera thats 2mp and the pics are nice and clear with great picture quality 1 
it has northern humour and positive about the community it represents 1 
the plot well i said id let that one go 0 
the point is the journey a journey that touches every member of the family 1 
cinematography noteworthy including fine views of barcelona and its famed gaudi towers 1 
sorry i will not be getting food from here anytime soon 0 
kind of hard to mess up a steak but they did 0 
conclusion very filling meals 1 
items stated as included from the description are not included 0 
last time buying from you 0 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
best tater tots in the southwest 1 
why was this film made 0 
its a feelgood film and thats how i felt when i came out of the cinema 1 
the phone is sturdy and waterproof 1 
this place is not worth your time let alone vegas 0 
it is worth the drive 1 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
the puppets look really cheesy not in a good way like in the puppet master 80s flicks 0 
this movie contained an allstar cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i havent seen before 1 
clear crisp sound 1 
1010 1 
first time there and might just be the last 0 
the warmth it generates is in contrast to its austere backdrop 1 
not sure who was more lost the flat characters or the audience nearly half of whom walked out 0 
friends pasta also bad he barely touched it 0 
the film gives meaning to the phrase never in the history of human conflict has so much been owed by so many to so few 1 
the staff are great the ambiance is great 1 
this movie now joins revenge of the boogeyman and zombiez as part of the hellish trinity of horror films 0 
there is a brilliant twist ending 1 
but it does get better reception and clarity than any phone ive had before 1 
i dont each much pasta but i love the homemade hand made pastas and thin pizzas here 1 
works great 1 
this is the phone to get for 2005 i just bought my s710a and all i can say is wow 1 
i like the fact that it rests lightly against your ear rather than inside 1 
5 stars for the brick oven bread app 1 
at around 4 pm i bought it at around 8pm i started to watch at around 815pm i fast forwarded the remaining film to see if there was anything left watchable for a human being with a brain but there wasnt 0 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
there is a lot of beautiful places 1 
both films are terrible but to the credit of the 1986 version it was watchable 0 
initially the local sites in the film which was filmed here in buffalo intrigued me 1 
all in all id expected a better consumer experience from motorola 0 
you can even take self portraits with the outside exterior display very cool 1 
i came back today since they relocated and still not impressed 0 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
it is so small and you dont even realize that it is there after a while of getting used to it 1 
but the convoluted plot just didnt convince me and much of the film was watched with a weird questioning glance 0 
we will not be coming back 0 
the greek dressing was very creamy and flavorful 1 
i even dropped this phone into a stream and it was submerged for 15 seconds and it still works great 1 
too politically correct 0 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
a greasy unhealthy meal 0 
yet plantronincs continues to use the same flawed charger design 0 
as for the killer dont expect anything original or even remotely frightening 0 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
for people who are first timers in film making i think they did an excellent job 1 
there is simply no excuse for something this poorly done 0 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
poor construction 0 
the pairing of the two devices was so easy it barely took a couple minutes before i started making calls with the voice dialing feature 1 
love it great armband 1 
its a long time since i was so entertained by a movie 1 
i am very impressed with the job that motorola did on the sturdiness of this phone 1 
however paul schrader has indeed made a film about mishima that is both superb complex 1 
however paul schrader has indeed made a film about mishima that is both superb complex 1 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
of course the acting is blah 0 
i am so tired of clichés that is just lazy writing and here they come in thick and fast 0 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
incredible 1 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
useless phone simply deaf 0 
its fits like a glove and is strong secure and durable 1 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
fans of the genre will be in heaven 1 
the only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive 1 
unfortunately we must have hit the bakery on leftover day because everything we ordered was stale 0 
everyone is treated equally special 1 
gave up trying to eat any of the crust teeth still sore 0 
the bt headset was such a disapoinment 0 
my rating just 3 out of 10 0 
helen baxendale is a very credible lady macbeth who can be very cheerfull at times and sometimes she just looks like a naughty girl but deadly in her taste for blood and evil 1 
but the convoluted plot just didnt convince me and much of the film was watched with a weird questioning glance 0 
20th century foxs road house 1948 is not only quite a silly noir but is an implausible unmitigated bore of a movie 0 
definitely a turn off for me i doubt ill be back unless someone else is buying 0 
his performance is simply genius 1 
the lighting is just dark enough to set the mood 1 
some may say this buffet is pricey but i think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot 1 
1 long lasting battery you dont have to recharge it as frequentyly as some of the flip phones2 0 
if you havent gone here go now 1 
so dont go there if you are looking for good food 0 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
hell no will i go back 0 
but even the talented carrell cant save this 0 
easy to pair with my samsung cell 1 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
i have purchased these for both family and friends and all enjoy their clarity and ease of use 1 
the kids are annoying 0 
not as good as i had hoped 0 
the lead man is charismafree 0 
it has a great camera thats 2mp and the pics are nice and clear with great picture quality 1 
this place is way too overpriced for mediocre food 0 
good quality 1 
first of all it doesnt wear well 0 
his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic 1 
this particular model would not work with my motorola q smartphone 0 
it really is impressive that the place hasnt closed down 0 
id say that would be the hardest decision honestly all of ms dishes taste how they are supposed to taste amazing 1 
i probably wont be coming back here 0 
i thoroughly enjoyed it when christopher eccleston took control of the tardis and the continuation of the series 1 
were jerks on the phone 0 
the ending is so so perfect youll shed a tear 1 
the songs were the best and the muppets were so hilarious 1 
disappointed 0 
the directing seems too pretentious 0 
personally i think it shows that people should learn to find a compromise them self without involving other people into issue 1 
food was great and so was the serivce 1 
it was way over fried 0 
say bye bye to your tip lady 0 
it does everything the description said it would 1 
bluetooth does not work phone locks up screens just flash up and now it just makes calls randomly while in my pocket locked 0 
not enough volume 0 
this movie was kind of long in length but i enjoyed every minute of it 1 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
couldnt use the unit with sunglasses not good in texas 0 
the only thing worse than taylors acting was stanwycks singing 0 
it presents a idyllic yet serious portrayal of the ups and downs of the characters lives 1 
their chow mein is so good 1 
one of my favorite purchases ever 1 
for the price this was a great deal 1 
amazon sucks 0 
the acting from all involved and that includes those like shatner and nimoy is bad and washed out and making them seem as old as they look in real life the special effects are tacky like when spock has to rescue kirk on a jet pack when he falls down from a mountain 0 
i had a salad with the wings and some ice cream for dessert and left feeling quite satisfied 1 
and generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode 0 
this movie contained an allstar cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i havent seen before 1 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
unfortunately it did not work 0 
down the drain because of a weak snap 0 
nice case feels good in your hands 1 
this is not moviemaking 0 
at around 4 pm i bought it at around 8pm i started to watch at around 815pm i fast forwarded the remaining film to see if there was anything left watchable for a human being with a brain but there wasnt 0 
artless camerawork endlessly presents us with the ugliest setting imaginable ie 0 
the reception has been generally good 1 
shrimp when i unwrapped it i live only 12 a mile from brushfire it was literally ice cold 0 
i had about two bites and refused to eat anymore 0 
the story is lame not interesting and never really explains the sinister origins of the puppets 0 
this movie is possibly one of the most creative works of horror ever 1 
lame would be the best way to describe it 0 
it is unusable in a moving car at freeway speed 0 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
to my disbelief each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods i have ever tasted 0 
great price also 1 
this is actually a very smart movie 1 
1 hour 54 minutes of sheer tedium melodrama and horrible acting a mess of a script and a sinking feeling of good lord what were they thinking 0 
i had verizon 2 years ago and really liked their service 1 
never been to hard rock casino before will never ever step forward in it again 0 
definitely not worth the 3 i paid 0 
the construction of the headsets is poor 0 
very satisifed with that 1 
give this one a look 1 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
i cannot make calls at certain places 0 
the tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu 0 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
the decor is nice and the piano music soundtrack is pleasant 1 
youll love it 1 
this phone is very fast with sending any kind of messages and web browsing is significantly faster than previous phones i have used 1 
i dont think there are any redeeming qualities in this remake 0 
gets the job done 1 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
the waitress and manager are so friendly 1 
delete this film from your mind 0 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
owners are really great people 1 
john wayne did an incredible job for being so young in the movie industry 1 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
i received my supposedly new motorola 375 and apparently there was not a match between the phone and the charger 0 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
it was a very superficial movie and it gave me the feeling that i was watching play rather than a film 0 
paolo sorrentino has written a wonderful story about loneliness and tony has built one of the most unforgettable characters seen in movies in recent years 1 
the ri style calamari was a joke 0 
however the keypads are so tinny that i sometimes reach the wrong buttons 0 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
the plot doesnt hang together at all and the acting is absolutely appalling 0 
saggy floppy piece of junk 0 
this is probably the most irritating show i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
still i do like this movie for its empowerment of women theres not enough movies out there like this one 1 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
i went to bachi burger on a friends recommendation and was not disappointed 1 
battery is holding up well 1 
i believe the screenwriter did a good job of tying up the loose ends 1 
i have two more years left in this contract and i hate this phone 0 
cinematography noteworthy including fine views of barcelona and its famed gaudi towers 1 
trying to make a call on these is an exercise in frustration 0 
we had so much to say about the place before we walked in that he expected it to be amazing but was quickly disappointed 0 
this place is disgusting 0 
it fits my ear well and is comfortable on 1 
we enjoy their pizza and brunch 1 
everything about it is fine and reasonable for the price ie 1 
after a year the battery went completely dead on my headset 0 
this does not fit the palm tungsten e2 and it broke the first time i tried to plug it in 0 
we received a white colored battery that goes dead after a couple hoursthe original used to last a week but still lasts longer than thereplacement 0 
this mostly routine factbased tv drama gets a boost from the fine performance by cole 1 
i have had tmobile service for 2 or 3 years now and i am pretty happy with it 1 
we waited for thirty minutes to be seated although there were 8 vacant tables and we were the only folks waiting 0 
this movie is also revealing 1 
when im on this side of town this will definitely be a spot ill hit up again 1 
best tacos in town by far 1 
so they performed 1 
a very charming film with wonderful sentiment and heart 1 
the entire audience applauded at the conclusion of the film 1 
have been going since 2007 and every meal has been awesome 1 
w810i is just superb 1 
comfortable nice range good battery life 1 
we asked for the bill to leave without eating and they didnt bring that either 0 
the service was extremely slow 0 
dont make the same mistake i did 0 
if you havent choked in your own vomit by the end by all the cheap drama and worthless dialogue youve must have bored yourself to death with this waste of time 0 
we had a group of 70 when we claimed we would only have 40 and they handled us beautifully 1 
im trying to return it for a refund 0 
see it 1 
he came running after us when he realized my husband had left his sunglasses on the table 1 
i am very impressed with the job that motorola did on the sturdiness of this phone 1 
verizons bills however are difficult to understand even though their pricing plans are simple 0 
both great 1 
but its just not funny 0 
nothing special 0 
these are the nicest restaurant owners ive ever come across 1 
kind of flops around 0 
the holster that arrived did not match the photo in the ad 0 
very bad performance plays angela bennett a computer expert who is at home all the time 0 
he is an amazing film artist one of the most important whoever lived 1 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
doesnt work at all i bougth it for my l7c and its not working 0 
the only thing i did like was the prime rib and dessert section 1 
im terribly disappointed that this film would receive so many awards and accolades especially when there are far more deserving works of film out there 0 
not a good bargain 0 
i have been in more than a few bars in vegas and do not ever recall being charged for tap water 0 
jabra ear gels r the best 1 
great sound and service 1 
please dont waste your money 0 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
great character actors telly savalas and peter boyle 1 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
keep up the good work amazon 1 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
these products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet 0 
battery is terrible 0 
the soundtrack wasnt terrible either 1 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
1010 1 
also the fries are without a doubt the worst fries ive ever had 0 
everything about this movie is stupid 0 
id advise anyone to go and see it 1 
never heard of any of them except cole who was totally unbelievable in the part 0 
all things considered a job very well done 1 
why was this film made 0 
he also came back to check on us regularly excellent service 1 
the food sucked which we expected but it sucked more than we could have imagined 0 
i will be back many times soon 1 
i can barely ever hear on it and am constantly saying what 0 
not a weekly haunt but definitely a place to come back to every once in a while 1 
see it 1 
it doesnt make you look cool 0 
yes its shiny on front side and i love it 1 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
jawbone era is awesome too 1 
its one of the movies i need to see whenever it comes on tvnever mind the fact that i already have it memorized 1 
do not make the same mistake as me 0 
your staff spends more time talking to themselves than me 0 
you wont regret it 1 
the text messaging feature is really tricky to use 0 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
im in az all the time and now have my new spot 1 
there is no real plot 0 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
that company is a joke 0 
this was like the final blow 0 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
if you dont find it too bad as again the unit comes with one earpad onlyi would not recommend this to anyone 0 
the story is also both funny and poignant at times 1 
my salad had a bland vinegrette on the baby greens and hearts of palm 0 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
we had so much to say about the place before we walked in that he expected it to be amazing but was quickly disappointed 0 
emily watsons character is very strong and she has only to give a quick glance and you understand everything 1 
this particular model would not work with my motorola q smartphone 0 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
it looks very nice 1 
the phone takes forever to charge like 2 to 5 hours literally 0 
it was a good thing that the tickets only cost five dollars because i would be mad if id have paid 750 to see this crap 0 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
the bose noise cancelling is amazing which is very important for a nyc commuter 1

appetite instantly gone 0 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
classywarm atmosphere fun and fresh appetizers succulent steaks baseball steak 1 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
the scenery that the two daughters paint and photograph are beautiful 1 
doesnt work at all i bougth it for my l7c and its not working 0 
this is an extraordinary film 1 
the movie lacks visual interest drama expression of feeling and celebration of the very patriotism that underlines the narrative 0 
i wish i could enter negative values admins 0 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
to summarize the food was incredible nay transcendant but nothing brings me joy quite like the memory of the pneumatic condiment dispenser 1 
definitely will come back here again 1 
great brunch spot 1 
it was too predictable even for a chick flick 0 
kieslowski never ceases to amaze me 1 
after trying many many handsfree gadgets this is the one that finally works well 1 
id say that would be the hardest decision honestly all of ms dishes taste how they are supposed to taste amazing 1 
the worst one of the series 0 
the staff are great the ambiance is great 1 
an instant classic with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits 1 
ive never been treated so bad 0 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
in addition it feels amp looks as if the phone is all lightweight cheap plastic 0

in my house i was getting dropped coverage upstairs and no coverage in my basement 0 
great place to relax and have an awesome burger and beer 1 
he was extremely rude and really there are so many other restaurants i would love to dine at during a weekend in vegas 0 
i love lane but ive never seen her in a movie this lousy 0 
not good by any stretch of the imagination 0 
this frog phone charm is adorable and very eye catching 1 
the film has great actors a master director a significant themeat least a wouldbe significant theme undertone of fifties existential worldweariness aerial scenes that ought to have thrilled both senses and imagination and characters about which one might deeply care 1 
for that price i can think of a few place i would have much rather gone 0 
poor product 0 
often the dialogue doesnt really follow from one line to another or fit the surroundings 0 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
the loudspeaker option is great the bumpers with the lights is very appealing 0 
you truly take this journey through the eyes and soul of a child 1 
what did bother me was the slow service 0 
lots of holes in the script 0 
the range is very decent ive been able to roam around my house with the phone in the living room with no receptionsound quality issues 1 
i have to mention this and it is a huge spoiler i loved the ending how all the characters of the three films were the remaining survivors of the ferry disaster with valentine and the young judge together and the old man watching it on her tv solidifying his happiness over the suffering which he dealt with for those many years 1 
i took back my money and got outta there 0 
he came running after us when he realized my husband had left his sunglasses on the table 1 
kind of hard to mess up a steak but they did 0 
we sat another ten minutes and finally gave up and left 0 
clear crisp sound 1 
also notable is john baileys fine crisp beautifully colored cinematography and the great production design costumes by eiko ishioka who went on to do the memorable costumes for coppolas dracula for which she received a well deserved oscar 1 
the story is lame not interesting and never really explains the sinister origins of the puppets 0 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
my fiancé and i came in the middle of the day and we were greeted and seated right away 1 
the worst experience ever 0 
very slow at seating even with reservation 0 
however after finally watching this film i realized that not only had i had a closed mind to the brilliance it depicts i also found myself watching it over and over again 1 
its too bad the food is so damn generic 0 
at a time when it seems that film animation has been dominated by disneypixars cgi masterpieces it is both refreshing and comforting to know that miyazaki is still relying on traditional handdrawn animation to tell his charming and enchanting stories 1 
this movie has a cutting edge to it 1 
talk about useless customer service 0 
now imagine that every single one of those decisions was made wrong 0 
i totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is 1 
bad characters bad story and bad acting 0 
the movie is not completely perfect but titta di girolamo will stay with you for a long time after the vision of the movie 1 
love it great armband 1 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
5 stars for the brick oven bread app 1 
sprint charges for this service 0 
im glad i found this product on amazon it is hard to find it wasnt high priced 1 
i love the ringtones because they are so upbeat 1 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
mark my words this is one of those cult films like evil dead 2 or phantasm that people will still be discovering and falling in love with 20 30 40 years down the line 1 
the poor actors 0 
i thought errol flynn was brilliant as custer and has since become my favourite actor 1 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
pretty cool i would say 1 
i wear glasses and it fits fine with them 1 
it plays louder than any other speaker of this size the price is so low that most would think the quality is lacking however its not 1 
it sure does beat the nachos at the movies but i would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant 0 
unfortunately it did not work 0 
who in their right mind is gonna buy this battery 0 
you wont regret it 1 
great brunch spot 1 
20th century foxs road house 1948 is not only quite a silly noir but is an implausible unmitigated bore of a movie 0 
not only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic but it also managed to give away the entire movie and im not exaggerating every moment every plot point every joke is told in the trailer 0 
i paid too much 0 
i felt insulted and disrespected how could you talk and judge another human being like that 0 
i bought this to use with my kindle fire and absolutely loved it 1 
comfortable nice range good battery life 1 
this scene is very strong and unpleasant 0 
no real improvement 0 
the phone gets extremely hot 0 
great phone 1 
i got home to see the driest damn wings ever 0 
so dont go there if you are looking for good food 0 
the jamaican mojitos are delicious 1 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
but the premise of the film was so ridiculous that the president of the us 0 
i think that it is a must see older john wayne film 1 
every thing on phone work perfectly she like it 1 
ive had this for nearly 2 years and it has worked great for me 1 
terrible service 0 
its extremely slow and takes forever to do anything with it 0 
im surprised this is a good quality car charger and theres not much reviews about it 1 
the jalapeno bacon is soooo good 1 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
items stated as included from the description are not included 0 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
i would give this television series a 10 plus if i could 1 
design flaw 0 
wasted two hours 0 
food was great and so was the serivce 1 
will never ever go back and have told many people what had happened 0 
they know how to make them here 1 
my friend loved the salmon tartar 1 
after the first charge kept going dead after 12 minutes 0 
lifetime does not air it enough so if anyone knows what store sells it let me know because this is a musthave 1 
wont work right or atleast for me 0 
he was terrible 0 
i tried talking real loud but shouting on the telephone gets old and i was still told it wasnt great 0 
works great 1 
it is unusable in a moving car at freeway speed 0 
but what really made it unwatchable was the direction 0 
it was attached to a gas station and that is rarely a good sign 0 
eclectic selection 1 
it looses connection to the phone even when it is within a couple feet between the two 0 
i found a six inch long piece of wire in my salsa 0 
after the first charge kept going dead after 12 minutes 0 
its a gloriously fun fast paced and fairly accurate portrayal of the night of a raver 1 
the food amazing 1 
i ended up sliding it on the edge of my pants or back pockets instead 1
