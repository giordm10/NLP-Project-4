it was that loudglad to say that the plantronics 510 maintains a flawless connection to my cell and with no static during normal use 1 
food was great and so was the serivce 1 
this is a beautiful phone 1 
tied to charger for conversations lasting more than 45 minutesmajor problems 0 
i will never go back to this place and will never ever recommended this place to anyone 0 
not a pleasant voyage of selfdiscovery 0 
youll love it 1 
overall i was not impressed and would not go back 0 
easy to use 1 
if this premise sound stupid thats because it is 0 
if you love authentic mexican food and want a whole bunch of interesting yet delicious meats to choose from you need to try this place 1 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
first the bathrooms at this location were dirty seat covers were not replenished just plain yucky 0 
and his subtle connections between the three films are awesome 1 
integrated seamlessly with the motorola razr phone 1 
sorry i will not be getting food from here anytime soon 0 
after 3 months screen just went black all of a sudden 0 
would not go back 0 
it looses connection to the phone even when it is within a couple feet between the two 0 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
i hate movies like that 0 
it really is impressive that the place hasnt closed down 0 
i think it was robert ryans best film because he portrayed someone like my father and he was a schizophrenic in real lifemy father although he never murdered anyone but was affected more so during the second world war which made him worse 1 
the server was very negligent of our needs and made us feel very unwelcome i would not suggest this place 0 
i like design and look of jabra behing the ear headsets and 5020 is pretty comfortible to wear 24 hours a day without pain in the ear 1 
total brunch fail 0 
i could care less the interior is just beautiful 1 
it was probably dirt 0 
its a sad movie but very good 1 
excellent phone 1 
it was a great phone 1 
the food is about on par with dennys which is to say not good at all 0 
definitely worth checking out 1 
i had verizon 2 years ago and really liked their service 1 
i immediately said i wanted to talk to the manager but i did not want to talk to the guy who was doing shots of fireball behind the bar 0 
great service and food 1 
this is definitely one of the better documentaries i have seen looking at family relationships and marriage 1 
special thanks to dylan t for the recommendation on what to order all yummy for my tummy 1 
i found the product to be easy to set up and use 1 
ive never been more insulted or felt disrespected 0 
people couldnt hear me talk and i had to pull out the earphone and talk on the phone 0 
if you want a real scare rent this one 1 
overall i am psyched to have a phone which has all my appointments and contacts in and gets great reception 1 
i was sitting in my vehicle with the cradle on my belt and the headset lost signal 0 
works fine 1 
i dont have to be an accountant to know im getting screwed 0 
a film not easily forgotten 1 
when i received my pita it was huge it did have a lot of meat in it so thumbs up there 1 
avoid at all costs 0 
why are these sad little vegetables so overcooked 0 
none of the new ones have ever quite worked properly 0 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
nargile i think you are great 1 
yeah the movie pretty much sucked 0 
another note about this phones appearance is that it really looks rather bland especially in the all black model 0 
but the service was beyond bad 0 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
great choice 1 
delicious and i will absolutely be back 1 
bought mainly for the charger which broke soon after purchasing 0 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
see it with your kids if you have a chanceit will open up some amazing dialog about how far race relations have come in the last 50 years 1 
the food is about on par with dennys which is to say not good at all 0 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
i wasnt the least bit interested 0 
and the rest of it just sits there being awful with soldiers singing songs about the masculinity they pledge themselves to hairsplitting about purity the admiration of swords etc 0 
heres where the movie really pied me off 0 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
phone is sturdy as all nokia bar phones are 1 
this little device has transformed my organizational capability and made my life a whole lot easier 1 
great character actors telly savalas and peter boyle 1 
damian is so talented and versatile in so many ways of writing and portraying different characters on screen 1 
the pairing of the two devices was so easy it barely took a couple minutes before i started making calls with the voice dialing feature 1 
keep up the good work amazon 1 
you learn a lot about the real inside emotions of people in this movie and a lot about the movie business itself 1 
the plot simply rumbles on like a machine desperately depending on the addition of new scenes 0 
avoid this one if you can 0 
sending it back 0 
you could only take 2 videos at a time and the quality was very poor 0 
nice sound 1 
heres where the movie really pied me off 0 
but i definitely would not eat here again 0 
overall i was not impressed and would not go back 0 
the structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema 1 
omg the food was delicioso 1 
we wont be returning 0 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
any grandmother can make a roasted chicken better than this one 0 
my boyfriend and i sat at the bar and had a completely delightful experience 1 
i got it because it was so small and adorable 1 
very good product well made 1 
their daily specials are always a hit with my group 1 
works great when my cat attacked the phone he scratched the protective strip instead of destroying the screen 1 
my gyro was basically lettuce only 0 
i dont have to be an accountant to know im getting screwed 0 
perhaps i caught them on an off night judging by the other reviews but im not inspired to go back 0 
dont buy it 0 
nicest chinese restaurant ive been in a while 1 
plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job 1 
works for me 1 
food was average at best 0 
this place is great 1 
it probably would have been better if the director hadnt spent most of the movie showcasing his own art work which really isnt that noteworthy 0 
it was so bad i had lost the heart to finish it 0 
all this movie does is make you sick watching all these slackers make excuses for their stupid actions for 90 minutes 0 
started watching this but didnt believe in any of the characters 0 
will order from them again 1 
we had a group of 70 when we claimed we would only have 40 and they handled us beautifully 1 
does not fit 0 
the instruction manual is lacking 0 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
she carries the movie well 1 
some applause should be given to the prelude however 1 
here in the wind and the lion we see a wonderful rendering of americas own imperial age 1 
although i very much liked the look and sound of this place the actual experience was a bit disappointing 0 
the writers were smack on and i think the best actors and actresses were a bonus to the showthese characters were so real 1 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clich√©s to be admitted elsewhere 0 
great character actors telly savalas and peter boyle 1 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
thanks good a movie like this was done and released 1 
nargile i think you are great 1 
im probably one of the few people to ever go to ians and not like it 0 
it wasnt busy at all and now we know why 0 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
dont waste your money 0 
waiter was a jerk 0 
characters are onedimensional even the good guys and especially the bad guys 0 
it showed exactly how the government and the scientist argued for humanity and the reasons of the gadget 1 
utter crap sound quality is terrible 0 
really bad 0 
i dont have to be an accountant to know im getting screwed 0 
is pretty funny 1 
ive bought 5 wired headphones that sound better than these 0 
i never walked out of a movie faster 0 
best of all is the rotating feature very helpful 1 
2 thumbs up to this seller 1 
the real disappointment was our waiter 0 
works as described 1 
see it 1 
the food was excellent and service was very good 1 
i work in the hospitality industry in paradise valley and have refrained from recommending cibo any longer 0 
wed definitely go back here again 1 
as a sushi lover avoid this place by all means 0 
because both ears are occupied background is not distracting at all 1 
it was equally awful 0 
it crackles with an unpredictable youthful energy but honestly i found it hard to follow and concentrate on it meanders so badly 0 
nothing short of magnificent photographycinematography in this film 1 
otherwise easy to install and use clear sound 1 
defective crap 0 
never got it 0 
not sure who was more lost the flat characters or the audience nearly half of whom walked out 0 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
they were excellent 1 
highly unprofessional and rude to a loyal patron 0 
i have 23 bars on my cell phone when i am home but you cant not hear anything 0 
avoid this film at all costs 0 
the show would begin with smart ass ed comments to each other that would be totally off the wall and uncalled for 0 
i believe the screenwriter did a good job of tying up the loose ends 1 
if it was to turn my good day feeling into a night of disturbing memories than i guess he succeeded 0 
i recommend igo to anyone with different brand cell phonesmp3 players in the family 1 
great pizza and salads 1 
everyone is treated equally special 1 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
its this pandering to the audience that sabotages most of his films 0 
the movie seemed a little slow at first 0 
this movie creates its own universe and is fascinating in every way 1 
not enough volume 0 
pretty piece of junk 0 
very cheap plastic creaks like an old wooden floor 0 
the cast is good 1 
a standout scene 1 
this gets a 1 out of 10 simply because theres nothing lower 0 
couldnt use the unit with sunglasses not good in texas 0 
the only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive 1 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
the potatoes were like rubber and you could tell they had been made up ahead of time being kept under a warmer 0 
stopped by during the late may bank holiday off rick steve recommendation and loved it 1 
this place is good 1 
an extensive menu provides lots of options for breakfast 1 
however my girl was complain that some time the phone doesnt wake up like normal phone does 0 
but the convoluted plot just didnt convince me and much of the film was watched with a weird questioning glance 0 
i had strawberry tea which was good 1 
50 down the drain 0 
there is no plot or storyline 0 
i had verizon 2 years ago and really liked their service 1 
never got it 0 
they know how to make them here 1 
defective crap 0 
the owners are super friendly and the staff is courteous 1 
i give it 2 thumbs down 0 
110 and only because there is no setting for 010 0 
what a big waste of time 0 
this movie has a cutting edge to it 1 
ill put this gem up against any movie in terms of screenplay cinematography acting postproduction editing directing or any other aspect of filmmaking 1 
the 12 mega pixel camera being a part of a phone is reasonably good7 1 
love this headset 1 
a very very very slowmoving aimless movie about a distressed drifting young man 0 
ordered an appetizer and took 40 minutes and then the pizza another 10 minutes 0 
ive only had my bluetooth for a few weeks but i really like it 1 
think it over when you plan to own this onethis sure is the last moto phone for me 0 
the acting was bad 0 
the acting was decidely wooden though no worse than a period universal b movie 0 
couldnt use the unit with sunglasses not good in texas 0 
everything about this film is simply incredible 1 
poor voice clarity 0 
of course the acting is blah 0 
this is a great product sure beats using your fingers 1 
it was so cool 1 
the attempts at humor were pitiful and story is so awful it dosent bear thinking about which basically involves a vulcan stealing the enterprise to find god seriously i just didnt care about any of this film and oh not to mention uhura does a belly dance to distract male guards 0 
they really want to make your experience a good one 1 
dont waste your time here 0 
however my girl was complain that some time the phone doesnt wake up like normal phone does 0 
instead we got a bore fest about a whiny spoiled brat babysitting 0 
works for me 1 
very disappointing 0 
this is so embarassing and also my ears hurt if i try to push the ear plug into my ear 0 
thanks good a movie like this was done and released 1 
i wasnt really impressed with strip steak 0 
waste your money on this game 1 
there still are good actors around 1 
the script is a big flawed mess 0 
i especially love the long battery life 1 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
a greasy unhealthy meal 0 
you have to hold the phone at a particular angle for the other party to hear you clearly 0 
if you want healthy authentic or ethic food try this place 1 
it plays louder than any other speaker of this size the price is so low that most would think the quality is lacking however its not 1 
very disappointing 0 
nice ambiance 1 
there is a lot of beautiful places 1 
lightweight and works well 1 
the selection was probably the worst ive seen in vegasthere was none 0 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
have been going since 2007 and every meal has been awesome 1 
aailiyah was pretty good as akasha in places compelling her first entrance and mini dance scene 1 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
he is one of my favourite directors and one of the most talented directors in the history of cinema 1 
trouble is the writing and directing make it impossible to establish those things that make a movie watchable like character story theme and so on 0 
if you see it you should probably just leave it on the shelf 0 
weve tried to like this place but after 10 times i think were done with them 0 
of all the dishes the salmon was the best but all were great 1 
i ended up sliding it on the edge of my pants or back pockets instead 1 
verizons bills however are difficult to understand even though their pricing plans are simple 0 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
i have had this phone for over a year now and i will tell you its not that great 0 
why was this film made 0 
i think this restaurant suffers from not trying hard enough 0 
i probably wont be coming back here 0 
was not happy 0 
this is probably the most irritating show i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
i found this move beautiful enjoyable and uplifting 1 
the range is very decent ive been able to roam around my house with the phone in the living room with no receptionsound quality issues 1 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
wow what a bad film 0 
i have had this phone for over a year now and i will tell you its not that great 0 
which are small and not worth the price 0 
i really recommend this faceplates since it looks very nice elegant and cool 1 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
everything captain howdy says is either laughable or just plain stupid 0 
unreliable im giving up 0 
but i thought his acting was skilled 1 
razr battery good buy 1 
and dont even get me started on the jerky camerawork 0 
10 out of 10 stars 1 
the feel of the dining room was more college cooking course than high class dining and the service was slow at best 0 
he really didnt seem to want to be hosting his voiceovers were monotonous didnt get involved with the guests 0 
rating 1 out of 10 0 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
he also came back to check on us regularly excellent service 1 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
this early film from future goremeister lucio fulci is a very good addition to the giallo subgenre 1 
i was shocked because no signs indicate cash only 0 
at first i thought i was grtting a good deal at 744 until i plugged it into my phone v3c razr 0 
i agree with jessica this movie is pretty bad 0 
i left the theater with a lilt in my step joy in my heart and hope for the human race 1 
i liked it 1 
overall a great experience 1 
the cashier was friendly and even brought the food out to me 1 
cant store anything but phone numbers to sim 0 
i wear glasses and it fits fine with them 1 
excellent product for the price 1 
special thanks to dylan t for the recommendation on what to order all yummy for my tummy 1 
cant say enough good things about this place 1 
they keep getting better and better this is my third one and ive had numerous palms too 1 
im so sorry but i really cant recommend it to anyone 0 
both films are terrible but to the credit of the 1986 version it was watchable 0 
if there is a wind it is completely useless 0 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
generally it just lacked imagination 0 
bought mainly for the charger which broke soon after purchasing 0 
star trek v the final frontier is the worst in the series 0 
i put the latest os on it v115g and it now likes to slow to a crawl and lock up every once in a while 0 
he also came back to check on us regularly excellent service 1 
buyer beware you could flush money right down the toilet 0 
what possesed me to get this junk i have no idea 0 
it never condescends all the characters have good genuine hearts and believable problems 1 
yes its shiny on front side and i love it 1 
this is my new fav vegas buffet spot 1 
an interesting premise and billy drago is always good as a dangerous nutbag side note id love to see drago stephen mchattie and lance hendrikson in a flick together talk about raging cheekbones 1 
would not reccommend 0 
the story which was told so eloquently by francis ford coppola 25 years earlier really unfolds gradually and leaves room for the characters to develop 1 
anyways the food was definitely not filling at all and for the price you pay you should expect more 0 
piece of trash 0 
no additional ear gels provided and no instructions whatsoever 0 
bt50 battery junk 0 
the pan cakes everyone are raving about taste like a sugary disaster tailored to the palate of a six year old 0 
i got the car charger and not even after a week the charger was brokeni went to plug it in and it started smoking 0 
started watching this but didnt believe in any of the characters 0 
after 3 months screen just went black all of a sudden 0 
bacon is hella salty 1 
im a bit disappointed 0 
unfortunately inexperience of direction meant that scene after scene passed with little in the way of dramatic tension or conflict 0 
an interesting premise and billy drago is always good as a dangerous nutbag side note id love to see drago stephen mchattie and lance hendrikson in a flick together talk about raging cheekbones 1 
very very fun chef 1 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
i thought it was bad 0 
all in all ha long bay was a bit of a flop 0 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
it is a joy to use 1 
all the pretty pictures in the world cannot make up for a piece of work that is flawed at the core 0 
what i really like there is the crepe station 1 
there is however some pretty good acting at least for this type of film 1 
these headphones were a great find and i think they are perhaps the best purchase ive made in the last several years seriously 1 
on a positive note our server was very attentive and provided great service 1 
dont buy it 0 
the reception is excellent 1 
there was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters 0 
my fella got the huevos rancheros and they didnt look too appealing 0 
disappointed 0 
it kept getting worse and worse so now im officially done 0 
went in for happy hour great list of wines 1 
if you have several dozen or several hundred contacts then imagine the fun of sending each of them one by one 0 
what i really like there is the crepe station 1 
these are fabulous 1 
the concert sequences just sucked 0 
dont go here 0 
i want my money back 0 
so anyone near you will hear part of your conversation 0 
i dont know what the big deal is about this place but i wont be back yaall 0 
ordered an appetizer and took 40 minutes and then the pizza another 10 minutes 0 
cheap but hey it works was pleasantly suprised given the low cost of this item 1 
it was a long time that i didnt see a so charismatic actor on screen 1 
bacon is hella salty 1 
best headset ever 1 
in other words the content level of this film is enough to easily fill a dozen other films 1 
in other words the content level of this film is enough to easily fill a dozen other films 1 
i would avoid this place if you are staying in the mirage 0 
ive tried several different earpieces for my cell phone and this jabra one is the first one ive found that fits my ear comfortably 1 
saw the movie today and thought it was a good effort good messages for kids 1 
its just lame 0 
join the club and get awesome offers via email 1 
i totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is 1 
the chips and salsa were really good the salsa was very fresh 1 
the memories are murky but i can only say that i enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show 1 
exactly what i wanted 1 
great product 1 
better than expected 1 
its a mediocre miserable hollow laughable and predictable piece of garbage 0 
later i found myself lost in the power of the film 1 
the food is not tasty at all not to say its real traditional hunan style 0 
all in all id expected a better consumer experience from motorola 0 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
i saw this short film on hbo the other day and absolutely loved it 1 
but if you liked movies like the matrix and better yet their sequels i think youll appreciate the thought provoking mindblowing experience this film will give you 1 
damn good steak 1 
worst customer service 0 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
there was a warm feeling with the service and i felt like their guest for a special treat 1 
yet i enjoy watching it 1 
i would recommend purchasing the jabra jx10 series 2 which works flawlessly with my moto q go figure 1 
my breakfast was perpared great with a beautiful presentation of 3 giant slices of toast lightly dusted with powdered sugar 1 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
definitely a bargain 1 
same evening him and i are both drastically sick 0 
saw the movie today and thought it was a good effort good messages for kids 1 
cheap but hey it works was pleasantly suprised given the low cost of this item 1 
when achille and philippa beautifully sing a duet from don giovanni that perfectly describes their situation in the movie you appreciate the subtle layers of this excellent film 1 
painful on the ear 0 
also if your phone is dropped this case is not going to save it specially when dropped face down 0 
there is a totally unnecessary trainroller coaster scene 0 
this is a beautiful phone 1 
plus its only 8 bucks 1 
all i have to say is the food was amazing 1 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
emily watsons character is very strong and she has only to give a quick glance and you understand everything 1 
both the hot sour the egg flower soups were absolutely 5 stars 1 
integrated seamlessly with the motorola razr phone 1 
the chefs were friendly and did a good job 1 
do not make the same mistake as me 0 
as for the service im a fan because its quick and youre being served by some nice folks 1 
the shower area is outside so you can only rinse not take a full shower unless you dont mind being nude for everyone to see 0 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
sound quality on both end is excellent i use headset to call my wife and ask my wife to use headset to call me 2 1 
thus far have only visited twice and the food was absolutely delicious each time 1 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
i checked out this place a couple years ago and was not impressed 0 
seller shipped quickly and much cheaper than the competitors 1 
delicious nyc bagels good selections of cream cheese real lox with capers even 1 
the bathroom is just next door and very nice 1 
it is light has plenty of battery capacity and is very confortable to wear for somewhat extended periods of time 1 
great product fast shipping 1 
this was reflected not only in the cast but also in the belowpar script which borrowed much from the earlier classic 0 
i have seen many movies starring jaclyn smith but my god this was one of her best though it came out 12 years ago 1 
as i said abovepretty useless 0 
its quite simply the highest most superlative form of cinema imaginable 1 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
probably not in a hurry to go back 0 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
wow loved this place 1 
it is shameful 0 
how can you call yourself a steakhouse if you cant properly cook a steak i dont understand 0 
what a mistake that was 0 
the visual effects were awful 0 
very nice and relaxing late night viewing 1 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
overall i was not impressed and would not go back 0 
everything about it is just bad 0 
all in all i can assure you ill be back 1 
seriously its not worth wasting your or your kids time on 0 
it shouldnt take 30 min for pancakes and eggs 0 
the film deserves strong kudos for taking this stand for having exceptional acting from its mostly lesserknown cast and for the superintelligent script that doesnt insult the audience or take the easy way out when it comes to white racism 1 
very very fun chef 1 
a standout scene 1 
one thing i hate is the mode set button at the side 0 
it is a very well acted and done tv movie 1 
the chicken wings contained the driest chicken meat i have ever eaten 0 
the food is about on par with dennys which is to say not good at all 0 
its a fresh subtle and rather sublime effect 1 
bad quality 0 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
good quality 1 
i purcashed this for the car charger and it does not work 0 
my friend did not like his bloody mary 0 
barney is definitely super de duper 1 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
waaaaaayyyyyyyyyy over rated is all i am saying 0 
2 thumbs up 1 
the puppets look really cheesy not in a good way like in the puppet master 80s flicks 0 
the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach 0 
the nachos are a must have 1 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
the new characters werent all that memorable and i found myself forgetting who was who 0 
it deserves strong love 1 
the songs were the best and the muppets were so hilarious 1 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
its kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly its embarrassing how childlike the company is 0 
the point is the journey a journey that touches every member of the family 1 
the food sucked which we expected but it sucked more than we could have imagined 0 
this film tries to be a serious and sophisticated thrillerhorror flick and it fails miserably 0 
for a self proclaimed coffee cafe i was wildly disappointed 0 
cant say enough good things about this place 1 
the acting sucked 0 
performed awful muffled tinny incoming sound and severe echo for those on the other end of the call 0 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
very pleased with this headset 1 
poor product 0 
wont go back 0 
good service very clean and inexpensive to boot 1 
they do not care about the consumer one bit 0 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
the structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema 1 
steamboat willie is an amazingly important film to our cinema history 1 
this was my first and only vegas buffet and it did not disappoint 1 
the story is lame not interesting and never really explains the sinister origins of the puppets 0 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
i cant believe theres even a sequel to this 0 
she ordered a toasted english muffin that came out untoasted 0 
i waited and waited 0 
then as if i hadnt wasted enough of my life there they poured salt in the wound by drawing out the time it took to bring the check 0 
it doesnt make you look cool 0 
its quite simply the highest most superlative form of cinema imaginable 1 
when my order arrived one of the gyros was missing 0 
the fish is badly made and some of its underwater shots are repeated a thousand times in the film 0 
the show would begin with smart ass ed comments to each other that would be totally off the wall and uncalled for 0 
have been going since 2007 and every meal has been awesome 1 
the reception is excellent 1 
1010 1 
this is the kind of money that is wasted properly 1 
started watching this but didnt believe in any of the characters 0 
prosgood camera very nice pictures also has cool styles like black and white and more 1 
dont buy this product it fails 0 
i mean this in a terrible way 0 
i was deeply impressed with the character he played 1 
we waited an hour for what was a breakfast i could have done 100 times better at home 0 
i want to first say our server was great and we had perfect service 1 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
reasonably priced also 1 
the 12 mega pixel camera being a part of a phone is reasonably good7 1 
this place is good 1 
no ear loop needed its tiny and the sound is great 1 
we had a group of 70 when we claimed we would only have 40 and they handled us beautifully 1 
i dont know exactly what it is about this movie but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our familys memories 1 
think of the film being like a dream 1 
you cant go wrong with any of the food here 1 
exceptionally bad 0 
freezes frequently4 0 
the restaurant is very clean and has a family restaurant feel to it 1 
very good quality though 1 
if you hate earbugs avoid this phone by all means 0 
this frog phone charm is adorable and very eye catching 1 
alexander nevsky is a great film 1 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
it was probably dirt 0 
he also came back to check on us regularly excellent service 1 
it deserves strong love 1 
because both ears are occupied background is not distracting at all 1 
kieslowski never ceases to amaze me 1 
they could be used as exemplars for any set designer 1 
service is also cute 1 
the battery life is highly unacceptable 0 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
it wasnt busy either also the building was freezing cold 0 
it has a great camera thats 2mp and the pics are nice and clear with great picture quality 1 
but kevin spacey is an excellent verbal tsunami as buddy ackerman ¬ñ and totally believable because he is a great actor 1 
bought mainly for the charger which broke soon after purchasing 0 
we made the drive all the way from north scottsdale and i was not one bit disappointed 1 
horrible horrible protector 0 
the camera really likes her in this movie 1 
an amazing finale to possibly the best trilogy of all time 1 
i had high hopes for this place since the burgers are cooked over a charcoal grill but unfortunately the taste fell flat way flat 0 
we had a group of 70 when we claimed we would only have 40 and they handled us beautifully 1 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
unless youre just out to visually collect all extant films of austens work you can skip this one 0 
this gets a 1 out of 10 simply because theres nothing lower 0 
the soundtrack wasnt terrible either 1 
im in az all the time and now have my new spot 1 
plug was the wrong size 0 
overall the film is interesting and thoughtprovoking 1 
so in a nutshell 1 the restaraunt smells like a combination of a dirty fish market and a sewer 0 
there is simply no excuse for something this poorly done 0 
if you are looking for a good quality motorola headset keep looking this isnt it 0 
thus far have only visited twice and the food was absolutely delicious each time 1 
i dont think i will be back for a very long time 0 
i came over from verizon because cingulair has nicer cell phones the first thing i noticed was the really bad service 0 
ive had no trouble accessing the internet downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions 1 
however my girl was complain that some time the phone doesnt wake up like normal phone does 0 
at around 4 pm i bought it at around 8pm i started to watch at around 815pm i fast forwarded the remaining film to see if there was anything left watchable for a human being with a brain but there wasnt 0 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
we recently witnessed her poor quality of management towards other guests as well 0 
this movie is so awesome 1 
the cashew cream sauce was bland and the vegetables were undercooked 0 
and considering the two of us left there very full and happy for about 20 you just cant go wrong 1 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
the portion was huge 1 
disappointment i hate anything that goes in my ear 0 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
setup went very smoothly 1 
very disappointed in accessoryone 0 
will never ever go back 0 
it has everything i need and i couldnt ask for more 1 
the design is very good4 1 
very pleased with this headset 1 
worst customer service ever 0 
great product 1 
have been going since 2007 and every meal has been awesome 1 
maybe if they werent cold they would have been somewhat edible 0 
were jerks on the phone 0 
i got the aluminum case for my new palm vx and it worked really wellit has protected my handheld perfectly so far 1 
penne vodka excellent 1 
im not sure how long we stood there but it was long enough for me to begin to feel awkwardly out of place 0 
its hard not to fall headoverheels in love with that girl 1 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
2 thumbs up to this seller 1 
ordered burger rare came in well done 0 
the chains which im no fan of beat this place easily 0 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
its been my choice headset for yearsgreat sound good volume good noise cancellation 1 
i wouldnt see this movie again for free 0 
i hate movies like that 0 
basically the service was very bad 0 
delicious 1 
wow very spicy but delicious 1 
these were so good we ordered them twice 1 
star trek v the final frontier is the worst in the series 0 
this was a poor remake of my best friends wedding 0 
this is an extraordinary film 1 
the problem was the script 0 
its a case of so bad it is laughable 0 
the range is very decent ive been able to roam around my house with the phone in the living room with no receptionsound quality issues 1 
the buttons for on and off are bad 0 
the roast beef sandwich tasted really good 1 
perhaps my phone is defective but people cannot hear me when i use this 0 
i have always used corded headsets and the freedom from the wireless is very helpful 1 
so i basically threw my money out the window for nothing 0 
this would not even be good as a made for tv flick 0 
the block was amazing 1 
good food good service 1 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
it looks very nice 1 
it was attached to a gas station and that is rarely a good sign 0 
ill even say it again ¬ñ this is torture 0 
dont waste your time here 0 
avoid this one if you can 0 
as for the mains also uninspired 0 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
i only hear garbage for audio 0 
bought mainly for the charger which broke soon after purchasing 0 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
the most annoying thing about cover girl is the way in which rita hayworth is put up on a pedestal 0 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
i always order from the vegetarian menu during dinner which has a wide array of options to choose from 1 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
i paid the bill but did not tip because i felt the server did a terrible job 0 
this is the place where i first had pho and it was amazing 1 
i liked this movie way too much 1 
disappointing 0 
this is a stunning movie 1 
it fits my ear well and is comfortable on 1 
disappointing accessory from a good manufacturer 0 
with the originality and freshness of the first movie now spent this remake had little else to offer 0 
just reading on the specs alone makes you say wow 1 
its one of the most boring horror movies from the 90s mainly because it starts slow and centers in a boring atmosphere 0 
blue ant is easy to use 1 
this is actually a very smart movie 1 
one of my favorite purchases ever 1 
none of the new ones have ever quite worked properly 0 
the building itself seems pretty neat the bathroom is pretty trippy but i wouldnt eat here again 0 
bad fit way too big 0 
a world better than 95 of the garbage in the theatres today 1 
the place was fairly clean but the food simply wasnt worth it 0 
the plot doesnt hang together at all and the acting is absolutely appalling 0 
by far the best cheesecurds we have ever had 1 
this blueant supertooth handsfree phone speaker is awesome 1 
how can you call yourself a steakhouse if you cant properly cook a steak i dont understand 0 
shes poised and amazing 1 
we loved the place 1 
the worst one of the series 0 
service is quick and even to go orders are just like we like it 1 
i dont think well be going back anytime soon 0 
the best phone in market 1 
ill be looking for a new earpiece 0 
you also cannot take pictures with it in the case because the lense is covered 0 
prosgood camera very nice pictures also has cool styles like black and white and more 1 
its pure brilliance 1 
the staff are also very friendly and efficient 1 
the plot such as it is is so derivative and predictable that the ending is like a mercy killing 0 
i think the most wonderful parts literally full of wonder are the excerpts from his works 1 
integrated seamlessly with the motorola razr phone 1 
that company is a joke 0 
the majority of the logitech earbud headsets failed 0
