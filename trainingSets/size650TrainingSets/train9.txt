im so sorry but i really cant recommend it to anyone 0 
totally believable 1 
this is a great phone 1 
i tried the cape cod ravoli chickenwith cranberrymmmm 1 
the seasonal fruit was fresh white peach puree 1 
too bad you have to pay up to a month for the service 0 
we wont be going back anytime soon 0 
i mean this in a terrible way 0 
i was so insulted 0 
excellent short film 1 
either way it sucks 0 
the plot is nonsense that doesnt interest in the slightest way or have any uniqueness to it 0 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
jamie foxx absolutely is ray charles 1 
people couldnt hear me talk and i had to pull out the earphone and talk on the phone 0 
this movie totally grates on my nerves 0 
the vegetables are so fresh and the sauce feels like authentic thai 1 
this is some seriously good pizza and im an expertconnisseur on the topic 1 
each day of the week they have a different deal and its all so delicious 1 
overall i was not impressed and would not go back 0 
really awful 0 
dont waste your on this one 0 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
strike 2 who wants to be rushed 0 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
the phone crashed completely and now i have to get it replaced 0 
and it was way to expensive 0 
the sets especially designed to work with the camera are amazingstylized beautiful and effective 1 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
prosgood camera very nice pictures also has cool styles like black and white and more 1 
i give it 2 thumbs down 0 
also difficult to put onid recommend avoiding this product 0 
the only thing really worth watching was the scenery and the house because it is beautiful 1 
they will customize your order any way youd like my usual is eggplant with green bean stir fry love it 1 
avoid at all costs 0 
but when i check voice mail at night the keypad backlight turns off a few seconds into the first message and then im lost 0 
lewis blacks considerable talent is wasted here too as he is at his most incendiary when he is unrestrained which the pg13 rating certainly wont allow 0 
this is high adventure at its best 1 
ive also had problems with the phone reading the memory card in which i always turn it on and then off again 0 
the food was great as always compliments to the chef 1 
not tasty and the texture was just nasty 0 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
rip off over charge shipping 0 
avoid at all cost 0 
for a product that costs as much as this one does i expect it to work far better and with greater ease than this thing does 0 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
the first thing that happened was that the tracking was off 0 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
worst thai ever 0 
it fits so securely that the ear hook does not even need to be used and the sound is better directed through your ear canal 1 
the pan cakes everyone are raving about taste like a sugary disaster tailored to the palate of a six year old 0 
its the one movie that never ceases to interest me simply because it keeps me alert as i try to attempt to decipher its meanings 1 
generally it just lacked imagination 0 
ive dropped my phone more times than i can say even on concrete and my phone is still great knock on wood 1 
this is a great little item 1 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
its practically perfect in all of them  a true masterpiece in a sea of faux masterpieces 1 
i struggle to find anything bad to say about it 1 
this is a great deal 1 
im big fan of rpg games too but this movie its a disgrace to any selfrespecting rpger there is 0 
fans of the genre will be in heaven 1 
would not recommend to others 0 
the guys all had steaks and our steak loving son who has had steak at the best and worst places said it was the best steak hes ever eaten 1 
i am far from a sushi connoisseur but i can definitely tell the difference between good food and bad food and this was certainly bad food 0 
internet is excrutiatingly slow 0 
keep up the good work amazon 1 
all in all i can assure you ill be back 1 
we wont be going back anytime soon 0 
the best place in vegas for breakfast just check out a sat or sun 1 
the burger is good beef cooked just right 1 
the potatoes were great and so was the biscuit 1 
all in all i can assure you ill be back 1 
i must say i have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again 1 
car charger as well as ac charger are included to make sure you never run out of juicehighy recommended 1 
i will not return 0 
it was so funny 1 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
there was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters 0 
disapointing results 0 
it didnt work people can not hear me when i talk 0 
ryans bar is definitely one edinburgh establishment i wont be revisiting 0 
woa talk about awful 0 
it is shameful 0 
the soundtrack sucked 0 
10 out of 10 for both the movie and trilogy 1 
if you do go see this movie bring a pillow or a girlfriendboyfriend to keep you occupied through out 0 
these products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet 0 
i can barely ever hear on it and am constantly saying what 0 
worst martini ever 0 
the two main characters may be two of the most believable children i ever saw put on screen 1 
case was more or less an extra that i originally put on but later discarded because it scratched my ear 0 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
the instructions didnt explain that a microphone jack could be used 0 
exactly what i wanted 1 
tom wilkinson broke my heart at the end and everyone elses judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike 1 
avoid this film at all costs 0 
he was terrible 0 
if this premise sound stupid thats because it is 0 
he was very impressed when going from the original battery to the extended battery 1 
i dont think i will be back for a very long time 0 
the croutons also taste homemade which is an extra plus 1 
the movie showed a lot of florida at its best made it look very appealing 1 
youll love how thin it is 1 
service is friendly and inviting 1 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
overall i rate this movie a 10 out of a 110 scale 1 
i am also very happy with the price 1 
what the hell kind of crap is that 0 
to sum the film up breeders is a terrible cheaply made horror movie that should be avoided like the ebola virus 0 
great product for the price 1 
on three different occasions i asked for well done or medium well and all three times i got the bloodiest piece of meat on my plate 0 
will order from them again 1 
worth every penny 1 
im still infatuated with this phone 1 
i am a fan of his this movie sucked really bad 0 
i probably would not go here again 0 
his costars dont fare much better with people like morgan freeman jonah hill and ed helms just wasted 0 
there is so much good food in vegas that i feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to rice and company 0 
i recently had problems where i could not stay connected for more than 10 minutes before being disconnected 0 
the han nan chicken was also very tasty 1 
the phone crashed completely and now i have to get it replaced 0 
youll love how thin it is 1 
lifetime does not air it enough so if anyone knows what store sells it let me know because this is a musthave 1 
the seller is very understanding and patient i would definitely buy from them again 1 
poor voice clarity 0 
service was very prompt 1 
the steaks are all well trimmed and also perfectly cooked 1 
youll love how thin it is 1 
the staff are great the ambiance is great 1 
he deserves 5 stars 1 
i saw this short film on hbo the other day and absolutely loved it 1 
great phone 1 
service is quick and even to go orders are just like we like it 1 
the story itself is just predictable and lazy 0 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
this is a great little item 1 
eew this location needs a complete overhaul 0 
the first time i ever came here i had an amazing experience i still tell people how awesome the duck was 1 
very easy to use 1 
maybe if they werent cold they would have been somewhat edible 0 
i will continue to come here on ladies night andddd date night highly recommend this place to anyone who is in the area 1 
the fact is this film is a wonderful heartwarming tale about two people chasing their dreams 1 
he is an amazing film artist one of the most important whoever lived 1 
very clear quality sound and you dont have to mess with the sound on your ipod since you have the sound buttons on the headset 1 
doesnt last long 0 
another note about this phones appearance is that it really looks rather bland especially in the all black model 0 
perfect for the ps3 1 
if you do watch it however there are small consolations the actresses playing annes sisters each do a wonderful job with their roles 1 
there is so much good food in vegas that i feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to rice and company 0 
maybe if they werent cold they would have been somewhat edible 0 
over rated 0 
not loud enough and doesnt turn on like it should 0 
w810i is just superb 1 
plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job 1 
cinematography noteworthy including fine views of barcelona and its famed gaudi towers 1 
it was attached to a gas station and that is rarely a good sign 0 
jabra ear gels r the best 1 
what makes this story different are the terrific production values faultless photography composition and editing the terrific casting the underappreciated brian keith playing a bully teddy and vivid history 1 
the sweet potato fries were very good and seasoned well 1 
no actress has been worse used that june allison in this movie 0 
about 30 minutes of footage is wasted to show mediocre elderly actors awkwardly babbling overwrought pseudosatanic gibberish corny enough to make a teen goth blush almost always in olde english and sometimes in latin that may or may not be made up words 0 
punishment park is a brilliant piece of cinema 1 
shes poised and amazing 1 
juano hernandez an exceptional actor who played supporting roles in many films of the era is a proud black man who is accused of murdering a white man in the south 1 
some applause should be given to the prelude however 1 
i am going to have to be the first to negatively review this product 0 
did not like at all 0 
the acting as youd expect from this cast is top notch 1 
any ring toneoverall good phone to buy 1 
omelets are to die for 1 
as an earlier review noted plug in this charger and nothing happens 0 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
there was no chemistry between ben affleck and sandra bullock in this film and i couldnt understand why he would consider even leaving his wifetobe for this chick that he supposedly was knocked out by 0 
the cow tongue and cheek tacos are amazing 1 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
the acting as youd expect from this cast is top notch 1 
comfortable fit you need your headset to be comfortable for at least an hour at a time if not for an entire day 1 
well packaged arrived on time and works as intended 1 
also difficult to put onid recommend avoiding this product 0 
reaching for the bottom row is uncomfortable and the send and end keys are not where i expect them to be3 0 
and dont even get me started on the jerky camerawork 0 
nice leather 1 
i would not recommend this place 0 
big disappointment with calendar sync 0 
glad i didnt pay to see it 0 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
i love this place 1 
at least think to refill my water before i struggle to wave you over for 10 minutes 0 
and considering the two of us left there very full and happy for about 20 you just cant go wrong 1 
good case excellent value 1 
also difficult to put onid recommend avoiding this product 0 
mediocre food 0 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
nicest chinese restaurant ive been in a while 1 
very true to shakespear and a must for all shakespear fans 1 
total letdown i would much rather just go to the camelback flower shop and cartel coffee 0 
this mostly routine factbased tv drama gets a boost from the fine performance by cole 1 
i wouldnt return 0 
i definitly recommend 1 
the chains which im no fan of beat this place easily 0 
they have horrible attitudes towards customers and talk down to each one when customers dont enjoy their food 0 
its a sad movie but very good 1 
verizon tech support walked my through a few procedures none of which worked and i ended up having to do a hard reset wiping out all my data 0 
food was so gooodd 1 
service is perfect and the family atmosphere is nice to see 1 
very bad experience 0 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
very disappointed 0 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
but if you liked movies like the matrix and better yet their sequels i think youll appreciate the thought provoking mindblowing experience this film will give you 1 
does not fit 0 
this place was such a nice surprise 1 
much more interesting more action more suspense and less of the unneeded controversy 1 
service is also cute 1 
and sometimes it was so embarrassing that i had to look away 0 
sweetest phone 1 
good value great food great service 1 
too bad you have to pay up to a month for the service 0 
he was terrible 0 
i wasnt really impressed with strip steak 0 
my rating just 3 out of 10 0 
omelets are to die for 1 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
i find wasting food to be despicable but this just wasnt food 0 
it was forced like everything in this movie 0 
i received my orders well within the shipping timeframe everything was in good working order and overall i am very excited to have this source 1 
it really is impressive that the place hasnt closed down 0 
after the first charge kept going dead after 12 minutes 0 
totally believable 1 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
reasonably priced also 1 
this blueant supertooth handsfree phone speaker is awesome 1 
i dont know exactly what it is about this movie but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our familys memories 1 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
service stinks here 0 
gets a signal when other verizon phones wont 1 
schrader has made a resume full of lousy amateurish films 0 
worth every penny 1 
i have been in more than a few bars in vegas and do not ever recall being charged for tap water 0 
last time buying from you 0 
nothing at all to recommend 0 
your staff spends more time talking to themselves than me 0 
this scene is very strong and unpleasant 0 
totally believable 1 
as for the service im a fan because its quick and youre being served by some nice folks 1 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
as many people complained i found this headsets microphone was very weak 0 
the death row scenes were entirely unmoving 0 
i found the product to be easy to set up and use 1 
personally i think it shows that people should learn to find a compromise them self without involving other people into issue 1 
the camera really likes her in this movie 1 
the update procedure is difficult and cumbersome 0 
nice design and quality 1 
problem is that the ear loops are made of weak material and break easily 0 
i was shocked because no signs indicate cash only 0 
we are sending it back 0 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
this film and i use that word loosely is an insult to the moviegoing public 0 
we are so glad we found this place 1 
now we were chosen to be tortured with this disgusting piece of blatant american propaganda 0 
the food is not tasty at all not to say its real traditional hunan style 0 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
the volume switch rocketed out of the unit to a destination unknown 0 
all in all im quite satisfied with this purchase 1 
the attractive set used throughout most of the film is an eyepleasing gem 1 
the cast is always entertaining as usual 1 
a world better than 95 of the garbage in the theatres today 1 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
special mention should be made of the superb music score and sound effects which are an integral element in helping to make this such a memorable and enjoyable cartoon 1 
none of them are engaging or exciting 0 
during several different 2 minute calls i experienced 5 drops and it was in an area that had 5 bars 0 
i love the ownerchef his one authentic japanese cool dude 1 
i believe every one should see this movie as i think few people outside of south africa understand its past and what is being attempted in the truth and reconciliation process 1 
first of all there are enough racial stereotypes and racial jokes to offend everyone 0 
this phone tries very hard to do everything but fails at its very ability to be a phone 0 
it is very comfortable to wear as well which is probably the most important aspect about using a case 1 
wasted two hours 0 
it looked like a wonderful story 1 
ill put this gem up against any movie in terms of screenplay cinematography acting postproduction editing directing or any other aspect of filmmaking 1 
we wont be returning 0 
brilliance indeed 1 
this is a very average phone with bad battery life that operates on a weak network 0 
not a pleasant voyage of selfdiscovery 0 
no plot whatsoever 0 
to call this movie a drama is ridiculous 0 
this is the phone to get for 2005 i just bought my s710a and all i can say is wow 1 
i love the ownerchef his one authentic japanese cool dude 1 
i love this thing 1 
imdb ratings only go as low 1 for awful its time to get some negative numbers in there for cases such as these 0 
doesnt last long 0 
also notable is john baileys fine crisp beautifully colored cinematography and the great production design costumes by eiko ishioka who went on to do the memorable costumes for coppolas dracula for which she received a well deserved oscar 1 
the football scenes at the end were perplexing 0 
i have to use the smallest earpieces provided but it stays on pretty well 1 
black water is a thriller that manages to completely transcend its limitations its an indie flick by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience 1 
buttons are too small 0 
very slow at seating even with reservation 0 
the seller is very understanding and patient i would definitely buy from them again 1 
the chips and sals a here is amazing 1 
the inside is really quite nice and very clean 1 
verizons bills however are difficult to understand even though their pricing plans are simple 0 
just really good so far probably the best bt headset i have ever had 1 
does not fit 0 
the poor actors 0 
this is was due to the fact that it took 20 minutes to be acknowledged then another 35 minutes to get our foodand they kept forgetting things 0 
it failed to convey the broad sweep of landscapes that were a great part of the original 0 
the instruction manual is lacking 0 
steamboat willie is an amazingly important film to our cinema history 1 
the best place to go for a tasty bowl of pho 1 
the place was fairly clean but the food simply wasnt worth it 0 
i have only had it for a few weeks but so far so good 1 
just dont know why they were so slow 0 
the steaks are all well trimmed and also perfectly cooked 1 
this company charge me a restocking fee and still not given me my refund back 0 
i had the chicken pho and it tasted very bland 0 
bad fit way too big 0 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
one nice thing was that they added gratuity on the bill since our party was larger than 6 or 8 and they didnt expect more tip than that 1 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
the charger worked for about a week and then completely stopped charging my phone 0 
their onscreen chemistry critical to the entire film is genuine 1 
it isnt even an achievement as a sobaditsgood or sobaditsmemorable movie 0 
you share general loewenhielms exquisite joy in his partaking of the cailles en sarcophage even though you are just watching a movie but you do wish for just a small sample to savor 1 
there was a warm feeling with the service and i felt like their guest for a special treat 1 
trouble is the writing and directing make it impossible to establish those things that make a movie watchable like character story theme and so on 0 
i love this device 1 
in fact this stinker smells like a directtovideo release 0 
very good food great atmosphere1 1 
setup couldnt have been simpler 1 
raw and sublimely moving 1 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
will never ever go back and have told many people what had happened 0 
by far the best cheesecurds we have ever had 1 
bluetooth range is good a few days ago i left my phone in the trunk got a call and carried the conversation without a hitch 1 
the staff is always super friendly and helpful which is especially cool when you bring two small boys and a baby 1 
the inside is really quite nice and very clean 1 
tonight i had the elk filet specialand it sucked 0 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
does not fit 0 
started watching this but didnt believe in any of the characters 0 
the cashier was friendly and even brought the food out to me 1 
it sure does beat the nachos at the movies but i would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant 0 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
this is probably the most irritating show i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
there were several moments in the movie that just didnt need to be there and were excruciatingly slow moving 0 
weve tried to like this place but after 10 times i think were done with them 0 
these were so good we ordered them twice 1 
comfortable nice range good battery life 1 
the pairing of the two devices was so easy it barely took a couple minutes before i started making calls with the voice dialing feature 1 
alexander nevsky is a great film 1 
integrated seamlessly with the motorola razr phone 1 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
jamie foxx absolutely is ray charles 1 
i hate those things as much as cheap quality black olives 0 
this is hands down the best phone ive ever had 1 
disappointment i hate anything that goes in my ear 0 
if she had not rolled the eyes we may have stayed not sure if we will go back and try it again 0 
the shipping time was also very quick 1 
avoid at all cost 0 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
i got home to see the driest damn wings ever 0 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
the earpiece on this is too large or too heavyit keeps falling out of my ear 0 
one nice thing was that they added gratuity on the bill since our party was larger than 6 or 8 and they didnt expect more tip than that 1 
the price was very good and with the free shipping and all it was a good purchase 1 
i received it quickly and it works great 1 
this movie now joins revenge of the boogeyman and zombiez as part of the hellish trinity of horror films 0 
rip off over charge shipping 0 
i recommend this for everyone who loves film movies anythinga work of art 1 
even when the women finally show up there is no sign of improvement the most expected things happen and by the time the film is over you might be far asleep 0 
good case 1 
this is an unbelievable bargain 1 
then scene where they debated whether or not to sack the trumpeter who falsely was accused for the murder is pure horror really stupid 0 
just does not work 0 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
this pda rocks 1 
i paid the bill but did not tip because i felt the server did a terrible job 0 
great product and price 1 
the company shipped my product very promptly and it works well 1 
doesnt hold charge 0 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
wasted two hours 0 
also the fries are without a doubt the worst fries ive ever had 0 
if you are looking for a good quality motorola headset keep looking this isnt it 0 
its like a bad two hour tv movie 0 
friends pasta also bad he barely touched it 0 
it quit working after id used it for about 18 months so i just purchased another one because this is the best headset ive ever owned 1 
in an interesting part of town this place is amazing 1 
awful service 0 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
dont buy this product 0 
we have gotten a lot of compliments on it 1 
unfortunately any virtue in this films production work was lost on a regrettable script 0 
bacon is hella salty 1 
i purcashed this for the car charger and it does not work 0 
in fact i liked it better than interview with a vampire and i liked this lestat stuart townsend better than cruises attempt 1 
good price 1 
why was this film made 0 
if she had not rolled the eyes we may have stayed not sure if we will go back and try it again 0 
excellent short film 1 
lasted one day and then blew up 0 
its a great item 1 
it is cheap and it feel and look just as cheap 0 
the food is rich so order accordingly 1 
however i recently watched the whole thing again on dvd and i was completely struck by how extremely stupid the storyline was how it contained holes inconsistencies and frankly a whole lot of crap and how horrid the dancing was 0 
its this pandering to the audience that sabotages most of his films 0 
not good by any stretch of the imagination 0 
couldnt use the unit with sunglasses not good in texas 0 
that was funny 1 
reasonably priced also 1 
it has kept up very well 1 
worst customer service 0 
this was a different cut than the piece the other day but still wonderful and tender s well as well flavored 1 
im terribly disappointed that this film would receive so many awards and accolades especially when there are far more deserving works of film out there 0 
the sound quality is excellent as well 1 
on the up side their cafe serves really good food 1 
definitely will come back here again 1 
its still wild stuff though and is highly recommended to fans of giallo cinema 1 
item arrived quickly and works great with my metro pcs samsung schr450 slider phone and sony premium sound in ear plugs 1 
exactly what i wanted 1 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
everything about this movie is stupid 0 
wow loved this place 1 
characters are onedimensional even the good guys and especially the bad guys 0 
i recently tried caballeros and i have been back every week since 1 
i could not understand what kind of idiot would produce this mess in the first place not to mention several season 0 
the good cinematography also makes her and monica bellucci look very beautiful 1 
a cheap and cheerless heist movie with poor characterisation lots of underbite style stoic emoting think chow yun fat in a better tomorrow and some cheesy clichés thrown into an abandoned factory ready for a few poorly executed flying judo rolls a la john woo 0 
it was delicious 1 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
personally i think it shows that people should learn to find a compromise them self without involving other people into issue 1 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
first of all it doesnt wear well 0 
about 30 minutes of footage is wasted to show mediocre elderly actors awkwardly babbling overwrought pseudosatanic gibberish corny enough to make a teen goth blush almost always in olde english and sometimes in latin that may or may not be made up words 0 
what possesed me to get this junk i have no idea 0 
love this phone 1 
not a weekly haunt but definitely a place to come back to every once in a while 1 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
the fact is this film is a wonderful heartwarming tale about two people chasing their dreams 1 
amazon sucks 0 
it was just too horrible 0 
overall i rate this movie a 10 out of a 110 scale 1 
everything was gross 0 
all in all a great disappointment 0 
it was horrible 0 
what possesed me to get this junk i have no idea 0 
however after about a year the fliptop started to get loose and wobbly and eventually my screen went black and i couldnt receive and place calls 0 
highquality chicken on the chicken caesar salad 1 
that was nice 1 
the folks at otto always make us feel so welcome and special 1 
this phone is slim and light and the display is beautiful 1 
soyo technology sucks 0 
if you plan to use this in a car forget about it 0 
i will come back here every time im in vegas 1 
after i pulled up my car i waited for another 15 minutes before being acknowledged 0 
pretty awesome place 1 
best of all is the rotating feature very helpful 1 
this movie does an excellent job of revealing the complexity of the task and the incredible challenges facing south africa 1 
raw and sublimely moving 1 
i keep watching it over and over 1 
lewis blacks considerable talent is wasted here too as he is at his most incendiary when he is unrestrained which the pg13 rating certainly wont allow 0 
omit watching this 0 
you get extra minutes so that you can carry out the call and not get cut off 1 
his performance as awarded was stunning 1 
wont work right or atleast for me 0 
how awesome is that 1 
add betty white and jean smart and you have a great cast everyone played their parts really well 1 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
disappointed 0 
if you check the directors filmography on this site you will see why this film didnt have a chance 0 
i did not have any problem with this item and would order it again if needed 1 
i will continue to come here on ladies night andddd date night highly recommend this place to anyone who is in the area 1 
perabo has a nice energy level and is obviously very comfortable in front of a camera 1 
my side greek salad with the greek dressing was so tasty and the pita and hummus was very refreshing 1 
but the service was beyond bad 0 
the owners are super friendly and the staff is courteous 1 
incredible 1 
the problem was the script 0 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
there are the usual hitchcock logic flaws 0 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
of course the footage from the 70s was grainy but that only enhanced the film 1 
then scene where they debated whether or not to sack the trumpeter who falsely was accused for the murder is pure horror really stupid 0 
steve martin delivers a really funny performance of a middleaged upper class uptight white guy 1 
delicious nyc bagels good selections of cream cheese real lox with capers even 1 
i have read others reviews here but i havent had any problem with it 1 
i purcashed this for the car charger and it does not work 0 
i would definitely recommend the jabra bt250v for those who are looking for comfort clarity and a great price 1 
excellent product 1 
rip off over charge shipping 0 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
crust is not good 0 
its pure brilliance 1 
this place is not quality sushi it is not a quality restaurant 0 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic 1 
owners are really great people 1 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
its not user friendly 0 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
i had to wait over 30 minutes to get my drink and longer to get 2 arepas 0 
went in for happy hour great list of wines 1 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
he was very impressed when going from the original battery to the extended battery 1 
happy so far 1 
the real killer is the volume and of course it breaking 0 
this is not moviemaking 0 
overall i rate this movie a 10 out of a 110 scale 1 
both do good jobs and are quite amusing 1 
ryans bar is definitely one edinburgh establishment i wont be revisiting 0 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
and the red curry had so much bamboo shoots and wasnt very tasty to me 0 
ample portions and good prices 1 
special thanks to dylan t for the recommendation on what to order all yummy for my tummy 1 
the puppets look really cheesy not in a good way like in the puppet master 80s flicks 0 
will be back again 1 
i can barely ever hear on it and am constantly saying what 0 
its practically perfect in all of them  a true masterpiece in a sea of faux masterpieces 1 
we loved the place 1 
i loved it 1 
good case 1 
an absolute must visit 1 
very good phone 1 
the burger had absolutely no flavor the meat itself was totally bland the burger was overcooked and there was no charcoal flavor 0 
well never go again 0 
what a great double cheeseburger 1 
this is the place where i first had pho and it was amazing 1 
the food was great as always compliments to the chef 1 
i will continue to come here on ladies night andddd date night highly recommend this place to anyone who is in the area 1 
not good enough for the price 0 
all in all a great disappointment 0 
then theres the plot holes 0 
in other words the content level of this film is enough to easily fill a dozen other films 1 
i mean in a realistic world she would never have gotten into that ballet repertory the whole thing was quite pathetic 0 
i vomited in the bathroom mid lunch 0 
my rating just 3 out of 10 0 
there is no plot here to keep you going in the first place 0 
similarly the delivery man did not say a word of apology when our food was 45 minutes late 0 
a truly truly bad film 0 
the plot was the same as pretty much every other cheap horror 0 
this is a stunning movie 1 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
i want to first say our server was great and we had perfect service 1 
comfortable in my hand 1 
really bad 0 
i love being able to use one headset for both by landline and cell 1 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
damn good steak 1 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
i dont think ill be running back to carlys anytime soon for food 0 
one of the best mexican movies ever and one of the less understood even by mexican themselves no matter how identified the should have felt with it 1 
great product 1 
very poor service 0 
it shouldnt take 30 min for pancakes and eggs 0 
it is easy to turn on and off when you are in the car and the volume controls are quite accessable 1 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
the burger is good beef cooked just right 1 
i could barely stomach the meal but didnt complain because it was a business lunch 0 
if only someone involved with it knew how to string together narrative 0 
the best place in vegas for breakfast just check out a sat or sun 1 
then theres the plot holes 0 
their regular toasted bread was equally satisfying with the occasional pats of butter mmmm 1 
no one at the table thought the food was above average or worth the wait that we had for it 0 
i took back my money and got outta there 0 
the writer gorman bechard undoubtedly did his homework because all references are industry and characterage appropriate 1 
the writers were smack on and i think the best actors and actresses were a bonus to the showthese characters were so real 1 
i will never go back to this place and will never ever recommended this place to anyone 0 
the croutons also taste homemade which is an extra plus 1 
do not purchase this phone 0 
i was left shattered from the experience of watching this film and i took a good two hours to fully recover 0 
it was awesome 1 
they have a really nice atmosphere 1 
this is a great product sure beats using your fingers 1 
hard to judge whether these sides were good because we were grossed out by the melted styrofoam and didnt want to eat it for fear of getting sick 0 
the bottowm lineanother worthless cheap gimmick from sprint 0 
these are certainly very comfortable and functionality is decent 1 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
new battery works great in phone 1 
but its just not funny 0 
camera color balance is awful 0 
oh and i forgot to also mention the weird color effect it has on your phone 0 
doesnt do the job 0 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
20th century foxs road house 1948 is not only quite a silly noir but is an implausible unmitigated bore of a movie 0 
the best electronics of the available fm transmitters 1 
and finally after all that we get to an ending that wouldve been great had it been handled by competent people and not jerry falwell 0 
is it possible for a movie to get any worse than this 0 
it failed to convey the broad sweep of landscapes that were a great part of the original 0 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
i recently had problems where i could not stay connected for more than 10 minutes before being disconnected 0 
because both ears are occupied background is not distracting at all 1 
its really easy 1 
i wont spoil it but the ending in pretty amazing 1 
the phone was unusable and was not new 0 
how stupid is that 0 
the service was a bit lacking 0 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
the movie in movie situations in the beginning and through the game that is played with her by the acting coach are fascinating 1 
the bartender was also nice 1 
good quality 1 
restaurant is always full but never a wait 1 
razr battery good buy 1 
i cannot make calls at certain places 0 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
if there was ever an indication of a writer and a directors ability to meld two highly volatile temperaments into a seamless union of creativity then this is it 1 
my ribeye steak was cooked perfectly and had great mesquite flavor 1 
meredith m was better than all right 1 
this place is not quality sushi it is not a quality restaurant 0 
i put the latest os on it v115g and it now likes to slow to a crawl and lock up every once in a while 0 
this isnt a small family restaurant this is a fine dining establishment 1 
so i had to take the battery out of the phone put it all back together and then restart it 0 
see it with your kids if you have a chanceit will open up some amazing dialog about how far race relations have come in the last 50 years 1 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
bacon is hella salty 1 
last time buying from you 0 
the incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film 1 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
i have always used corded headsets and the freedom from the wireless is very helpful 1 
however paul schrader has indeed made a film about mishima that is both superb complex 1 
needless to say we will never be back here again 0 
disappointed 0 
you need at least 3 mins to get to your phone book from the time you first turn on the phonebattery life is short 0 
it is a very well acted and done tv movie 1 
im pleased 1 
not easy to watch 0 
wont work right or atleast for me 0 
terrible service 0 
bad choice 0 
i love this phone it is very handy and has a lot of features 1 
they are so easy to love but even more easy to identify with 1 
all of the tapas dishes were delicious 1 
the waiter wasnt helpful or friendly and rarely checked on us 0 
i found this move beautiful enjoyable and uplifting 1 
restaurant is always full but never a wait 1 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
all in all im quite satisfied with this purchase 1 
the sound quality is excellent as well 1 
will not be back 0 
good service very clean and inexpensive to boot 1 
i was very pleased to see that i could replace my well travled swivel holster for my blackberry flip 1 
the phone was unusable and was not new 0 
how awful she is 0 
the story is beyond stupid 0 
what a waste of money and time 0
