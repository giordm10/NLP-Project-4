service sucks 0 
youll love how thin it is 1 
the chains which im no fan of beat this place easily 0 
customer service was terrible 0 
bela lugosi was totally extraneous intoning odd lines 0 
i wasted my little money with this earpiece 0 
my sister has one also and she loves it 1 
the service was meh 0 
in the summer you can dine in a charming outdoor patio so very delightful 1 
i have tried these cables with my computer and my ipod and it works just fine 1 
worst ever 0 
i think this restaurant suffers from not trying hard enough 0 
all in all id expected a better consumer experience from motorola 0 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
i dont think i will be back for a very long time 0 
please dont waste your money 0 
but the convoluted plot just didnt convince me and much of the film was watched with a weird questioning glance 0 
nice blanket of moz over top but i feel like this was done to cover up the subpar food 1 
very prompt service 1 
great food and great service in a clean and friendly setting 1 
great food and great service in a clean and friendly setting 1 
it is wonderful and inspiring to watch and i hope that it gets released again on to video or dvd 1 
product is useless since it does not have enough charging current to charge the 2 cellphones i was planning to use it with 0 
ordered a double cheeseburger got a single patty that was falling apart picture uploaded yeah still sucks 0 
avoid at all costs 0 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
the veggitarian platter is out of this world 1 
woa talk about awful 0 
we ordered the duck rare and it was pink and tender on the inside with a nice char on the outside 1 
i use this product in a motor control center where there is a lot of high voltage humming from the equipment and it works great 1 
this really is how vegas fine dining used to be right down to the menus handed to the ladies that have no prices listed 1 
i guess it was supposed to be clever twist then shed some light on the situation but it was just stupid 0 
excellent starter wireless headset 0 
i will never forget it now 1 
this place is amazing 1 
but it wasnt until i watched this film that i realised how great he actually was 1 
incredible 1 
i do love sushi but i found kabuki to be overpriced overhip and underservices 0 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
waitress was sweet and funny 1 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
its pretty surprising that this wonderful film was made in 1949 as hollywood generally had its collective heads in the sand concerning black and white issues at that time 1 
we got sitting fairly fast but ended up waiting 40 minutes just to place our order another 30 minutes before the food arrived 0 
the buttons for on and off are bad 0 
i also decided not to send it back because our waitress looked like she was on the verge of having a heart attack 0 
we wont be going back anytime soon 0 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
bad quality 0 
but other than that the movie seemed to drag and the heroes didnt really work for their freedom 0 
i thoroughly enjoyed it when christopher eccleston took control of the tardis and the continuation of the series 1 
great product for the price 1 
probably never coming back and wouldnt recommend it 0 
none of the new ones have ever quite worked properly 0 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
all of the main players are mesmerising 1 
the worst was the salmon sashimi 0 
the phone loads super 1 
i love this bluetooth 1 
in conclusion i will not bother with this movie because a volcano in los angeles is nothing but nonsense 0 
everything about this film is simply incredible 1 
its a great item 1 
one character is totally annoying with a voice that gives me the feeling of fingernails on a chalkboard 0 
trouble is the writing and directing make it impossible to establish those things that make a movie watchable like character story theme and so on 0 
all in all i can assure you ill be back 1 
predictable but not a bad watch 1 
truly awful 0 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
the service was not up to par either 0 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
i saw it as a child on tv back in 1973 when it was the stranger and i loved it 1 
echo problemvery unsatisfactory 0 
we wont be going back anytime soon 0 
bluetooth does not work phone locks up screens just flash up and now it just makes calls randomly while in my pocket locked 0 
if you havent choked in your own vomit by the end by all the cheap drama and worthless dialogue youve must have bored yourself to death with this waste of time 0 
very good though 1 
why was this film made 0 
avoid at all costs 0 
i kept looking at the time and it had soon become 35 minutes yet still no food 0 
poor talk time performance 0 
i have been very happy with the 510 and have had no complaints from any one regarding my sound quality on their end 1 
i guess maybe we went on an off night but it was disgraceful 0 
thank you for such great service 1 
i came back today since they relocated and still not impressed 0 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
very prompt service 1 
the battery works great 1 
the food is very good for your typical bar food 1 
gotta love those closeups of slimy drooling teeth 1 
honeslty it didnt taste that fresh 0 
full of unconvincing cardboard characters it is blandly written by edward chodorov who also produced and is surprisingly directed by jean negulesco from whom one would expect a great deal more 0 
generally it just lacked imagination 0 
this wonderful experience made this place a muststop whenever we are in town again 1 
i was able to do voice dialing in the car with no problem 1 
comfort for our whole family 1 
sweetest phone 1 
everything about this product is wrongfirst 0 
victor mclaglen was even bad and brian donlevy was almost unrecognizable 0 
not much seafood and like 5 strings of pasta at the bottom 0 
so far so good 1 
ordered burger rare came in well done 0 
it felt too light and tinny 0 
dont buy it 0 
for those that havent seen it dont waste your time 0 
also were served hot bread and butter and home made potato chips with bacon bits on topvery original and very good 1 
i love this place 1 
the cocktails are all handmade and delicious 1 
i exchanged the sony ericson z500a for this and im pretty happy with that decision 1 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
the feel of the dining room was more college cooking course than high class dining and the service was slow at best 0 
logitech bluetooth headset is a 10 1 
verizons bills however are difficult to understand even though their pricing plans are simple 0 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
timely shipment and quality product 1 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
constantine gives everything the right intensity and seems to have a good understanding of the underlying psychological motivations 1 
i have to mention this and it is a huge spoiler i loved the ending how all the characters of the three films were the remaining survivors of the ferry disaster with valentine and the young judge together and the old man watching it on her tv solidifying his happiness over the suffering which he dealt with for those many years 1 
very good phone 1 
for that price i can think of a few place i would have much rather gone 0 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
i guess i should have known that this place would suck because it is inside of the excalibur but i didnt use my common sense 0 
hence the whole story lacks a certain energy 0 
hes a national treasure 1 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
the food was terrible 0 
i felt as though her going to ireland did absolutely nothing whatsoever 0 
this little device has transformed my organizational capability and made my life a whole lot easier 1 
it dit not work most of the time with my nokia 5320 0 
i had the chicken pho and it tasted very bland 0 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
worked perfectly 1 
the yellowtail carpaccio was melt in your mouth fresh 1 
great software for motorolas 1 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
the accompanied software is almost brilliant 1 
highly recommended a 1 
she carries the movie well 1 
tonight i had the elk filet specialand it sucked 0 
the roast beef sandwich tasted really good 1 
i had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get some relief 0 
no shifting no bubbling no peeling not even a scratch nothingi couldnt be more happier with my new one for the droid 1 
best of luck to the rude and noncustomer service focused new management 0 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
worst foodservice ive had in a while 0 
this place is not quality sushi it is not a quality restaurant 0 
try them in the airport to experience some tasty food and speedy friendly service 1 
waited 2 hours never got either of our pizzas as many other around us who came in later did 0 
the fish is badly made and some of its underwater shots are repeated a thousand times in the film 0 
i hate those things as much as cheap quality black olives 0 
theres really nothing bad i can say about this headset 0 
but the convoluted plot just didnt convince me and much of the film was watched with a weird questioning glance 0 
good protection and does not make phone too bulky 1 
the good cinematography also makes her and monica bellucci look very beautiful 1 
restored my phone to like new performance 1 
an hour and a half i wish i could bring back 0 
if there was ever a movie that needed wordofmouth to promote this is it 1 
the management is rude 0 
then as if i hadnt wasted enough of my life there they poured salt in the wound by drawing out the time it took to bring the check 0 
simple lightweight and great fit 1 
then i watched it again two sundays ago march 20th 2005 and i began to really enjoy it and this time i taped the entire thing 1 
the phone loads super 1 
server did a great job handling our large rowdy table 1 
as for the service im a fan because its quick and youre being served by some nice folks 1 
wow very spicy but delicious 1 
bought mainly for the charger which broke soon after purchasing 0 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
thank you for wasting my money 0 
omg the food was delicioso 1 
you truly take this journey through the eyes and soul of a child 1 
everything captain howdy says is either laughable or just plain stupid 0 
this is one of the better buffets that i have been to 1 
bad day or not i have a very low tolerance for rude customer service people it is your job to be nice and polite wash dishes otherwise 0 
the nachos are a must have 1 
their menu is diverse and reasonably priced 1 
weird vibe from owners 0 
poor sound quality 0 
i recently had problems where i could not stay connected for more than 10 minutes before being disconnected 0 
the staff is always super friendly and helpful which is especially cool when you bring two small boys and a baby 1 
its a feelgood film and thats how i felt when i came out of the cinema 1 
great earpiece 1 
the acting is terrible and the writing is worse 0 
only like 3 or 4 buildings used a couple of locations maybe poor hummh 0 
this place is good 1 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
dont waste your money 0 
will be back again 1 
also if your phone is dropped this case is not going to save it specially when dropped face down 0 
as for the killer dont expect anything original or even remotely frightening 0 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
but the movie makes a lot of serious mistakes 0 
extremely tasty 1 
i agree with jessica this movie is pretty bad 0 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
everything about it is just bad 0 
regardless the film fails on most levels 0 
i wasnt really impressed with strip steak 0 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
the warmth it generates is in contrast to its austere backdrop 1 
the bose noise cancelling is amazing which is very important for a nyc commuter 1 
does everything it should and more 1 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
it felt like a very gripping intelligent stage play but without the overly theatrical feeling one actually gets from watching people on a stage which plays on everyones terror of a white lie escalating to monstrous consequences 1 
could not get strong enough signal 0 
unfortunately cover girl is an example of how hollywood used to exploit women for financial gain 0 
disapointing results 0 
but what really made it unwatchable was the direction 0 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
john garfield ann revere lilli plmer william conrad canada leeand filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screenjames wong howe 1 
the food is about on par with dennys which is to say not good at all 0 
having trouble with volume 0 
truly awful 0 
the poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying 0 
the selection of food was not the best 0 
piece of trash 0 
unfortunately it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees 0 
my sister has one also and she loves it 1 
do not buy for d807wrongly advertised for d807 0 
i enjoyed it 1 
sucked most of the stuff does not work with my phone 0 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
the burrittos blah 0 
it works fine on my motorola 325 cellphone and a lot better than the wornout battery did 1 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
and the rest of it just sits there being awful with soldiers singing songs about the masculinity they pledge themselves to hairsplitting about purity the admiration of swords etc 0 
the plastic breaks really easy on this clip 0 
there is nothing privileged about workingeating there 0 
this place is pretty good nice little vibe in the restaurant 1 
the story itself is just predictable and lazy 0 
my boyfriend and i came here for the first time on a recent trip to vegas and could not have been more pleased with the quality of food and service 1 
best breakfast buffet 1 
camerawork again bad 0 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
buttons are too small 0 
i dont think well be going back anytime soon 0 
dont make the same mistake i did 0 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
basically the service was very bad 0 
waste your money on this game 1 
we ordered the duck rare and it was pink and tender on the inside with a nice char on the outside 1 
i mean really how do you get so famous for your fish and chips when its so terrible 0 
not easy to watch 0 
the real disappointment was our waiter 0 
i want to first say our server was great and we had perfect service 1 
and his subtle connections between the three films are awesome 1 
makes it easier to keep up with my bluetooth when im not wearing it 0 
dont buy this product 0 
the service was terrible though 0 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
there is a lot of beautiful places 1 
i dressed up to be treated so rudely 0 
it ranks highly as a great noircrimedrama incredible performances by belmondo and lino ventura 1 
we loved the biscuits 1 
good protection and does not make phone too bulky 1 
go watch it 1 
poor sound quality 0 
a good quality bargain i bought this after i bought a cheapy from big lots that sounded awful and people on the other end couldnt hear me 1 
the secondary plot line is incomprehensible and its relation to the primary plot line is mystifying 0 
i will continue to come here on ladies night andddd date night highly recommend this place to anyone who is in the area 1 
we would recommend these to others 1 
after my phone got to be about a year old its been slowly breaking despite much care on my part 0 
poor reliability 0 
the films dialogue is natural real to life 1 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
this movie is so awesome 1 
the casting is also horrible cause all you see is a really really bad actors period 0 
i use this product in a motor control center where there is a lot of high voltage humming from the equipment and it works great 1 
battery life is real good 1 
i have purchased these for both family and friends and all enjoy their clarity and ease of use 1 
the flair bartenders are absolutely amazing 1 
design flaw 0 
i love the pho and the spring rolls oh so yummy you have to try 1 
hes a national treasure 1 
you get incredibly fresh fish prepared with care 1 
piece of junk 0 
it dit not work most of the time with my nokia 5320 0 
worked very well paired with a treo 700w and as a skype headset on my pc using a usb bluetooth transceiver 1 
it didnt charge for me 0 
my mother and brother had to do thiswhen i saw robert ryan portraying this type of man it was a very good imitation of this type of individual and i was impressed 1 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
the eargels channel the sound directly into your ear and seem to increase the sound volume and clarity 1 
i think not again 0 
it was a bit too sweet not really spicy enough and lacked flavor 0 
this product is great it makes working a lot easier i can go to the copier while waiting on hold for something 1 
that one didnt work either 0 
so there is no way for me to plug it in here in the us unless i go by a converter 0 
no complaints 1 
alexander nevsky is a great film 1 
what should have been a hilarious yummy christmas eve dinner to remember was the biggest fail of the entire trip for us 0 
i am not a filmmaker nor am i a director but i would hide my head in the sand if id spent whatever amount of money and time on this movie 0 
this phone is slim and light and the display is beautiful 1 
for readers who have already seen one of miyazakis films he is still in top form and made another worthwhile experience 1 
the chips and sals a here is amazing 1 
call me a nut but i think this is one of the best movies ever 1 
conclusion very filling meals 1 
an italian reviewer called this a small great film and thats right 1 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
the decor is nice and the piano music soundtrack is pleasant 1 
im still trying to get over how bad it was 0 
its hard not to fall headoverheels in love with that girl 1 
it is indescribably the most annoying and idiotic show i have ever seen 0 
never been to hard rock casino before will never ever step forward in it again 0 
when it opens the battery connection is broken and the device is turned off 0 
if you love death and decay and shakespears lyrics this is the one 1 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
doesnt work 0 
it will drive you barking mad 0 
i ordered albondigas soup which was just warm and tasted like tomato soup with frozen meatballs 0 
the lead man is charismafree 0 
there are massive levels massive unlockable characters its just a massive game 1 
buyer beware you could flush money right down the toilet 0 
all the other cases ive tried normally fall apart after a few months but this one seems to be in for the long haul 1 
this is a chilly unremarkable movie about an author livingworking in a chilly abstruse culture 0 
disappointment i hate anything that goes in my ear 0 
fits comfortably came with three sizes of earbud tips 1 
110 and only because there is no setting for 010 0 
we received a white colored battery that goes dead after a couple hoursthe original used to last a week but still lasts longer than thereplacement 0 
cant store anything but phone numbers to sim 0 
we are so glad we found this place 1 
sucked most of the stuff does not work with my phone 0 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
very nice and relaxing late night viewing 1 
hot dishes are not hot cold dishes are close to room tempi watched staff prepare food with bare hands no gloveseverything is deep fried in oil 0 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
do not waste your money here 0 
this is the first phone ive had that has been so cheaply made 0 
the real killer is the volume and of course it breaking 0 
but now i was completely grossed out 0 
im translating movies for a living and this is the first movie in my 5year working experience that i found offensive to my intelligence 0 
they have a really nice atmosphere 1 
to sum the film up breeders is a terrible cheaply made horror movie that should be avoided like the ebola virus 0 
very funny 1 
even allowing for poor production values for the time 1971 and the format some kind of miniseries this is baaaaaad 0 
the first time i ever came here i had an amazing experience i still tell people how awesome the duck was 1 
just spicy enough perfect actually 1 
very bad performance plays angela bennett a computer expert who is at home all the time 0 
but the movie makes a lot of serious mistakes 0 
generally it just lacked imagination 0 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
i really hope the team behind this movie makes more movies and that they will continue to do so in their own some kinda weird style 1 
third the cheese on my friends burger was cold 0 
the soundtrack wasnt terrible either 1 
when i saw it in the theater i thought i was going to be sick 0 
utter crap sound quality is terrible 0 
i did not have any problem with this item and would order it again if needed 1 
there was so much hype over this phone that i assumed it was the best my mistake 0 
imdb ratings only go as low 1 for awful its time to get some negative numbers in there for cases such as these 0 
the characters are interesting and you really care for them 1 
alexander nevsky is a great film 1 
this is my new fav vegas buffet spot 1 
the desserts were a bit strange 0 
as for the service im a fan because its quick and youre being served by some nice folks 1 
eclectic selection 1 
then as if i hadnt wasted enough of my life there they poured salt in the wound by drawing out the time it took to bring the check 0 
another note about this phones appearance is that it really looks rather bland especially in the all black model 0 
im terribly disappointed that this film would receive so many awards and accolades especially when there are far more deserving works of film out there 0 
no additional ear gels provided and no instructions whatsoever 0 
the veggitarian platter is out of this world 1 
if only someone involved with it knew how to string together narrative 0 
the movie is not completely perfect but titta di girolamo will stay with you for a long time after the vision of the movie 1 
steve martin delivers a really funny performance of a middleaged upper class uptight white guy 1 
but this movie is not funny considering the ridiculousness of it 0 
earbud piece breaks easily 0 
cheap but hey it works was pleasantly suprised given the low cost of this item 1 
much less than the jawbone i was going to replace it with 1 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
will never ever go back 0 
this is so embarassing and also my ears hurt if i try to push the ear plug into my ear 0 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
theres really nothing bad i can say about this headset 0 
now i know that i made a wise decision 1 
ps the only scene in the movie that was cool is when the central character finds her room blown up 1 
this wonderful experience made this place a muststop whenever we are in town again 1 
dont make the same mistake that i did and please dont buy this phone 0 
the worst piece of crap ever along with the verizon customer service 0 
the chips and salsa were really good the salsa was very fresh 1 
ive seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie 0 
then the film just dropped the ball 0 
we would recommend these to others 1 
yes i am simplifying things here for the sake of brevity for this really is at the core of the problems with this film it has too much going on without any real fulfilling explanation 0 
service sucks 0 
i love this place 1 
i purcashed this for the car charger and it does not work 0 
this case has passed the one year mark and while it shows signs of wear it is 100 functional 1 
the igo chargers and tips are really great 1 
that movie was bad 0 
very good food great atmosphere1 1 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
nothing new there 0 
but when i check voice mail at night the keypad backlight turns off a few seconds into the first message and then im lost 0 
these are the nicest restaurant owners ive ever come across 1 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
my boyfriend and i came here for the first time on a recent trip to vegas and could not have been more pleased with the quality of food and service 1 
comfort for our whole family 1 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
i especially liked the noncliche choices with the parents in other movies i could predict the dialog verbatim but the writing in this movie made better selections 1 
this was a different cut than the piece the other day but still wonderful and tender s well as well flavored 1 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
very happy with this product 1 
but this movie is not funny considering the ridiculousness of it 0 
very disappointed in accessoryone 0 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
the movie had you on the edge of your seat and made you somewhat afraid to go to your car at the end of the night 1 
crostini that came with the salad was stale 0 
the construction of the headsets is poor 0 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
i cant see how this movie can be an inspiration to anyone to come out or overcome fear and rejection 0 
nice design and quality 1 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
it was a bit too sweet not really spicy enough and lacked flavor 0 
a standout scene 1 
almost all of the songs in cover girl are oldfashioned and not very tuneful 0 
avoid at any and all costs 0 
this product had a strong rubberpetroleum smell that was unbearable after a while and caused me to return it 0 
still its quite interesting and entertaining to follow 1 
and considering the two of us left there very full and happy for about 20 you just cant go wrong 1 
just what i wanted 1 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
over rated 0 
very serious spoilers this movie was a huge disappointment 0 
after trying many many handsfree gadgets this is the one that finally works well 1 
i really dont see how anyone could enjoy this movie 0 
i love the ownerchef his one authentic japanese cool dude 1 
i totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is 1 
i checked everywhere and there is no feature for it which is really disappointing 0 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
this place is not worth your time let alone vegas 0 
big disappointment with calendar sync 0 
the script is bad very bad  it contains both cheesiness and unethical joke that you normally see in rated r or nc17 movie 0 
if you stay in vegas you must get breakfast here at least once 1 
ill be looking for a new earpiece 0 
the potatoes were like rubber and you could tell they had been made up ahead of time being kept under a warmer 0 
i can barely ever hear on it and am constantly saying what 0 
this blueant supertooth handsfree phone speaker is awesome 1 
the battery runs down quickly 0 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
you get what you pay for i guess 0 
i had about two bites and refused to eat anymore 0 
omg i felt like i had never eaten thai food until this dish 1 
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 
2 thumbs up 1 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
cant say enough good things about this place 1 
arrived quickly and much less expensive than others being sold 1 
i probably wont be coming back here 0 
first off the reception sucks i have never had more than 2 bars ever 0 
piece of junk 0 
but this movie is definitely a below average rent 0 
no ear loop needed its tiny and the sound is great 1 
works great 1 
love this phone 1 
the film is well paced understated and one of the best courtroom documentaries ive seen 1 
i dont understand how this garbage got on the shelves of the movie store its not even a real movie 0 
comfortable fit you need your headset to be comfortable for at least an hour at a time if not for an entire day 1 
the warm beer didnt help 0 
actually the graphics were good at the time 1 
his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic 1 
the cast is always entertaining as usual 1 
i saw this film over christmas and what a great film it was 1 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
will be back again 1 
emily watsons character is very strong and she has only to give a quick glance and you understand everything 1 
the only consistent thread holding the series together were the amazing performances of leni parker and anita laselva as the two taelons in quiet idealogical conflict 0 
comfortable nice range good battery life 1 
all the pretty pictures in the world cannot make up for a piece of work that is flawed at the core 0 
the only suspense i was feeling was the frustration at just how retarded the girls were 0 
the awful dialogue and hopeless overacting by everyone who gets shot top off a real waste of space and time 0 
i think not again 0 
the structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema 1 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
after the first charge kept going dead after 12 minutes 0 
there was no chemistry between ben affleck and sandra bullock in this film and i couldnt understand why he would consider even leaving his wifetobe for this chick that he supposedly was knocked out by 0 
the kids are very cool too 1 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
the films dialogue is natural real to life 1 
this is not moviemaking 0 
we had so much to say about the place before we walked in that he expected it to be amazing but was quickly disappointed 0 
he owns the film just as spacek owned coal miners daughter and quaid owned great balls of fire 1 
the steak was amazingrge fillet relleno was the best seafood plate i have ever had 1 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
the file browser offers all the options that one needshandsfree is great 1 
rip off over charge shipping 0 
love this headset 1 
then i exchanged for the same phone even that had the same problem 0 
my 5year old nokia 2160 from tracfone holds the charge a lot better than this 0 
yeah the movie pretty much sucked 0 
if the food isnt bad enough for you then enjoy dealing with the worlds worstannoying drunk people 0 
the classic maine lobster roll was fantastic 1 
the concert sequences just sucked 0 
this movie is terrible 0 
buttons are too small 0 
i had verizon 2 years ago and really liked their service 1 
oh the charger seems to work fine 1 
bad quality 0 
everything about this movie is stupid 0 
the 12 mega pixel camera being a part of a phone is reasonably good7 1 
the tracfonewebsite is user friendly and makes it easy toactivate etc 1 
the movie is full of wonderful dancing hence the title 1 
waste your money on this game 1 
there are massive levels massive unlockable characters its just a massive game 1 
their frozen margaritas are way too sugary for my taste 0 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
the live music on fridays totally blows 0 
about ten minutes into this film i started having second thoughts 0 
i particularly remember my senses being assaulted by strident cords of music that would blare out with very little warning and even less meaning 0 
this film offers many delights and surprises 1 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
i love their fries and their beans 1 
the puppets look really cheesy not in a good way like in the puppet master 80s flicks 0 
piece of trash 0 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
jamie foxx absolutely is ray charles 1 
overall i like this place a lot 1 
aside from its terrible lead this film has loads of other debits 0 
this is cool because most cases are just open there allowing the screen to get all scratched up 1 
you cant relate with them hell you barely can understand them 0 
any ring toneoverall good phone to buy 1 
i was particularly pleased with the acting ability of dwight schultz 1 
i kept catching the cable on the seat and i had to pull the phone out to turn it on an off 0 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
works like a charm it work the same as the one i got with the phone 1 
i gave it a 10 1 
so for our enjoyment we get to see them run around play games and be dangerous 1 
some may say this buffet is pricey but i think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot 1 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
every element of this story was so over the top excessively phony and contrived that it was painful to sit through 0 
i wont spoil it but the ending in pretty amazing 1 
the design is very good4 1 
they will customize your order any way youd like my usual is eggplant with green bean stir fry love it 1 
the vegetables are so fresh and the sauce feels like authentic thai 1 
there still are good actors around 1 
i think i was one of the people who found this another one of roths pearls 1 
excellent sound battery life and inconspicuous to boot 1 
the waitress was friendly and happy to accomodate for veganveggie options 1 
the best scene in the movie was when gerardo is trying to find a song that keeps running through his head 1 
this would not even be good as a made for tv flick 0 
good transmit audio 1 
i bought this to use with my kindle fire and absolutely loved it 1 
not nearly as good looking as the amazon picture makes it look 0 
fast service 1 
plug was the wrong size 0 
unless youre just out to visually collect all extant films of austens work you can skip this one 0 
the salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop which was perfectly cooked 1 
the new characters werent all that memorable and i found myself forgetting who was who 0 
there was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth but it didnt really work into the rest of the plot 0 
piece of junk 0 
despite how hard i rate businesses its actually rare for me to give a 1 star 0 
some may say this buffet is pricey but i think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot 1 
an interesting premise and billy drago is always good as a dangerous nutbag side note id love to see drago stephen mchattie and lance hendrikson in a flick together talk about raging cheekbones 1 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
this is one of the best italian thrillers of the early 70s 1 
wasted two hours 0 
the turkey and roast beef were bland 0 
the staff are also very friendly and efficient 1 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
there are so many problems i dont know where to start 0 
i still maintain that monkeys shouldnt make headphones we just obviously dont share enough dna to copy the design over to humans 0 
ive bought 5 wired headphones that sound better than these 0 
what a mistake 0 
all in all its an insult to ones intelligence and a huge waste of money 0 
definitely a turn off for me i doubt ill be back unless someone else is buying 0 
must have been an off night at this place 0 
this film highlights the fundamental flaws of the legal process that its not about discovering guilt or innocence but rather is about who presents better in court 1 
but when someone strives for greatness and poetry but delivers a muddled and often ridiculous story a bunch of disparate scenes pretentious dialogue then you get the worst kind of a movie that some other reviewer very accurately defined as pretentious crap 0 
the ambiance was incredible 1 
bad choice 0 
i have been in more than a few bars in vegas and do not ever recall being charged for tap water 0 
i was not happy with this item 0 
sounds good reasonably priced and effective its that simple 1 
the service was meh 0 
definitely worth checking out 1 
everything was good and tasty 1 
new battery works great in phone 1 
this was utterly confusing at first which caused me to lose a couple of very very important contacts 0 
what a mistake that was 0 
glad i didnt pay to see it 0 
cant say enough good things about this place 1 
but even the talented carrell cant save this 0 
very much disappointed with this company 0 
last time buying from you 0 
this would not even be good as a made for tv flick 0 
do not purchase this phone 0 
too politically correct 0 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
i dont know what the big deal is about this place but i wont be back yaall 0 
overall i rate this movie a 10 out of a 110 scale 1 
very funny 1 
internet is excrutiatingly slow 0 
i can take a little bad service but the food sucks 0 
as for the mains also uninspired 0 
if you dont find it too bad as again the unit comes with one earpad onlyi would not recommend this to anyone 0 
all in all im quite satisfied with this purchase 1 
i saw it as a child on tv back in 1973 when it was the stranger and i loved it 1 
the cashier was friendly and even brought the food out to me 1 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
damn good steak 1 
doesnt last long 0 
couldnt figure it out 0 
the instructions didnt explain that a microphone jack could be used 0 
an amazing finale to possibly the best trilogy of all time 1 
will never ever go back 0 
ive seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie 0 
and the accents are absolutely abysmal 0 
would come back again if i had a sushi craving while in vegas 1 
im in az all the time and now have my new spot 1 
very disappointed 0 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
i left with a stomach ache and felt sick the rest of the day 0 
we loved the place 1 
i especially liked the noncliche choices with the parents in other movies i could predict the dialog verbatim but the writing in this movie made better selections 1 
worst customer service ever 0 
my phone doesnt slide around my car now and the grip prevents my phone from slipping out of my hand 1 
there is really nothing for me at postinos hope your experience is better 0 
couldnt use the unit with sunglasses not good in texas 0 
sam shepards portrayal of a gung ho marine was sobering 1 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
pretty cool i would say 1 
hard to judge whether these sides were good because we were grossed out by the melted styrofoam and didnt want to eat it for fear of getting sick 0 
a great way to finish a great 1 
oh the charger seems to work fine 1 
they refuse to refund or replace 0 
bad day or not i have a very low tolerance for rude customer service people it is your job to be nice and polite wash dishes otherwise 0 
cant upload ringtones from a third party 0 
a drive thru means you do not want to wait around for half an hour for your food but somehow when we end up going here they make us wait and wait 0 
avoid at all cost 0 
service was fantastic 1 
but then they came back cold 0 
i ordered this for sony ericsson w810i but i think it only worked once thats when i first used it 0 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
its a fresh subtle and rather sublime effect 1 
for people who are first timers in film making i think they did an excellent job 1 
everyone is very attentive providing excellent customer service 1 
tied to charger for conversations lasting more than 45 minutesmajor problems 0 
soggy and not good 0 
four stars for the food the guy in the blue shirt for his great vibe still letting us in to eat 1 
this is essentially a communications tool that does not communicate 0 
for those that havent seen it dont waste your time 0 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
all of the tapas dishes were delicious 1 
i checked everywhere and there is no feature for it which is really disappointing 0 
it was that loudglad to say that the plantronics 510 maintains a flawless connection to my cell and with no static during normal use 1 
the classic maine lobster roll was fantastic 1 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
the service was a little slow considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace 0 
if you look for authentic thai food go else where 0 
this place is handsdown one of the best places to eat in the phoenix metro area 1 
the art style has the appearance of crayonpencil drawings and is wonderfully colorful and fanciful 1 
utterly without merit on any level this is akin to torture 0 
what the hell kind of crap is that 0 
no one at the table thought the food was above average or worth the wait that we had for it 0
