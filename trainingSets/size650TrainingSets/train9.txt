great pizza and salads 1 
feelings thoughtsgabriels discomfort during the danceall these intangibles leap to life and come within the viewers grasp in hustons portrayal 1 
very pleased with this headset 1 
pretty cool i would say 1 
it is an insane game 1 
i could care less the interior is just beautiful 1 
dont buy this product 0 
avoid at any and all costs 0 
waste of money 0 
better than expected 1 
one thing i hate is the mode set button at the side 0 
my husband said she was very rude did not even apologize for the bad food or anything 0 
i sat riveted to the tv screen 1 
also its slim enough to fit into my alarm clock docking station without removing the case 1 
the only suspense i was feeling was the frustration at just how retarded the girls were 0 
i dont understand how this garbage got on the shelves of the movie store its not even a real movie 0 
very very sad 0 
product was excellent and works better than the verizon one and boy was it cheaper 1 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
it came free with a dvd player i bought but i still turned the thing off halfway through because i was embarrassed for howell 0 
their daily specials are always a hit with my group 1 
this movie does an excellent job of revealing the complexity of the task and the incredible challenges facing south africa 1 
food was really boring 0 
wont work right or atleast for me 0 
i loved it 1 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
service was fantastic 1 
the battery is working well as a replacement for the original that came with the phone over 2 years ago 1 
kids pizza is always a hit too with lots of great side dish options for the kiddos 1 
it was equally awful 0 
this film has no redeeming features 0 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
if there is a wind it is completely useless 0 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
i mean this in a terrible way 0 
also its a real treat to see anthony quinn playing crazy horse 1 
his losing his marbles so early in the proceedings is totally implausible and unconvincing 0 
dont do it 0 
stay away from the q 0 
also notable is john baileys fine crisp beautifully colored cinematography and the great production design costumes by eiko ishioka who went on to do the memorable costumes for coppolas dracula for which she received a well deserved oscar 1 
didnt laugh or even smile once 0 
the only thing i did like was the prime rib and dessert section 1 
this was like the final blow 0 
the malta settings are as dry and as barren as the dialogue 0 
but in any case the best part is you can download these pictures to your laptop using ir or even send pictures from your laptop to the phone 1 
horrible 0 
now we were chosen to be tortured with this disgusting piece of blatant american propaganda 0 
i thought errol flynn was brilliant as custer and has since become my favourite actor 1 
i left with a stomach ache and felt sick the rest of the day 0 
only like 3 or 4 buildings used a couple of locations maybe poor hummh 0 
a week later after i activated it it suddenly died 0 
the soundtrack wasnt terrible either 1 
im not eating here 0 
my 5year old nokia 2160 from tracfone holds the charge a lot better than this 0 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
it has everything i need and i couldnt ask for more 1 
camera color balance is awful 0 
i mean in a realistic world she would never have gotten into that ballet repertory the whole thing was quite pathetic 0 
how stupid is that 0 
earbud piece breaks easily 0 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
i would highly recommend this 1 
the dialogue is composed of things that make little sense 0 
the cashier was friendly and even brought the food out to me 1 
clear skype calls long battery life long range 1 
first time going but i think i will quickly become a regular 1 
nice docking station for home or work 1 
not loud enough and doesnt turn on like it should 0 
you could drive a semi truck into these holes 0 
it really is impressive that the place hasnt closed down 0 
i always order from the vegetarian menu during dinner which has a wide array of options to choose from 1 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
if it was to turn my good day feeling into a night of disturbing memories than i guess he succeeded 0 
end of days is one of the worst bigbudget action movies ive ever seen 0 
comfortable fit you need your headset to be comfortable for at least an hour at a time if not for an entire day 1 
the only good thing was our waiter he was very helpful and kept the bloddy marys coming 1 
so i am here to warn youdo not rent this movie it is the dumbest thing you have never seen 0 
my only complaint is the standard sound volume is a little low even when turned up to 5of 5 0 
we had 7 at our table and the service was pretty fast 1 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
if you plan to use this in a car forget about it 0 
arrived quickly and much less expensive than others being sold 1 
im pleased 1 
the pleather case doesnt fit 0 
the wind and the lion is well written and superbly acted 1 
adapter does not provide enough charging current 0 
you can watch them preparing the delicious food 1 
having trouble with volume 0 
the voice recognition thru the handset is excellent 1 
by far the best cheesecurds we have ever had 1 
another thing i didnt really like is when a character got punched in the face a gallon of blood would spew forth soon after 0 
i had verizon 2 years ago and really liked their service 1 
it makes very strange ticking noises before it ends the call 0 
i am very happy 1 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
very disappointed 0 
this product is clearly not ready for prime time i dont care how cool it looks if you cant tell a call is coming in its worthless 0 
this frog phone charm is adorable and very eye catching 1 
product is useless since it does not have enough charging current to charge the 2 cellphones i was planning to use it with 0 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
bad fit way too big 0 
a film not easily forgotten 1 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
phenomenal food service and ambiance 1 
big disappointment with calendar sync 0 
o my gosh the best phone i have ever had 1 
i have 23 bars on my cell phone when i am home but you cant not hear anything 0 
i received it quickly and it works great 1 
however the ear pads come off easily and after only one week i lost one 0 
i am so tired of clichés that is just lazy writing and here they come in thick and fast 0 
but above all the exquisite visual composition of each moment with inventive and elegant use of closeup camera angle and lighting including pointillistic faux home movie footage is a wonder and joy to behold 1 
with great sound effects and impressive special effects i cant recommend this movie enough 1 
i was particularly pleased with the acting ability of dwight schultz 1 
the owners are super friendly and the staff is courteous 1 
we ordered the duck rare and it was pink and tender on the inside with a nice char on the outside 1 
appears to actually outperform the original battery from china that came with my v325i 1 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
a piece of junk that broke after being on my phone for 2 days 0 
even if you love bad movies do not watch this movie 0 
this place was such a nice surprise 1 
it is practically useless and did not add any kind of boost to my reception after i bought it 0 
it even has its sweet moments 1 
the live music on fridays totally blows 0 
the hockey scenes are terrible defensemen playing like theyre 5 years old goalies diving at shots that are 10 feet wide of the net etc 0 
if you do watch it however there are small consolations the actresses playing annes sisters each do a wonderful job with their roles 1 
often the dialogue doesnt really follow from one line to another or fit the surroundings 0 
disappointed 0 
the portion was huge 1 
could not get strong enough signal 0 
there are the usual hitchcock logic flaws 0 
the chicken wings contained the driest chicken meat i have ever eaten 0 
it fits so securely that the ear hook does not even need to be used and the sound is better directed through your ear canal 1 
i live in the neighborhood so i am disappointed i wont be back here because it is a convenient location 0 
my friend loved the salmon tartar 1 
it was pretty gross 0 
we started with the tuna sashimi which was brownish in color and obviously wasnt fresh 0 
classywarm atmosphere fun and fresh appetizers succulent steaks baseball steak 1 
i love my 350 headset my jabra350 bluetooth headset is great the reception is very good and the ear piece is a comfortable fit 1 
im not really sure how joeys was voted best hot dog in the valley by readers of phoenix magazine 0 
this is a great little item 1 
favorite place in town for shawarrrrrrma 1 
the food wasnt good 0 
it came free with a dvd player i bought but i still turned the thing off halfway through because i was embarrassed for howell 0 
do not buy for d807wrongly advertised for d807 0 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
integrated seamlessly with the motorola razr phone 1 
we received a white colored battery that goes dead after a couple hoursthe original used to last a week but still lasts longer than thereplacement 0 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
frankly after cotton club and unfaithful it was kind of embarrassing to watch lane and gere in this film because it is bad 0 
battery life is real good 1 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
what a waste 0 
i as well wouldve given godfathers zero stars if possible 0 
could not get strong enough signal 0 
a great film by a great director 1 
we ordered the duck rare and it was pink and tender on the inside with a nice char on the outside 1 
i love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it 1 
very disappointing 0 
unfortunately it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees 0 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
i wont say any more i dont like spoilers so i dont want to be one but i believe this film is worth your time 1 
everything about this film is simply incredible 1 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
the battery is working well as a replacement for the original that came with the phone over 2 years ago 1 
comes with a strong light that you can use to light up your camera shots and even flash sos signals seriously 1 
i wish i could enter negative values admins 0 
love this phone 1 
i didnt want the clip going over the top of my ear causing discomfort 0 
the movie has almost no action scenes in it and very little comedy 0 
everyone is very attentive providing excellent customer service 1 
dont go here 0 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
i loved it 1 
the sweet potato fries were very good and seasoned well 1 
painful on the ear 0 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
works like a charm it work the same as the one i got with the phone 1 
i have yet to run this new battery below two bars and thats three days without charging 1 
the battery life is highly unacceptable 0 
im super pissd 0 
emily watsons character is very strong and she has only to give a quick glance and you understand everything 1 
great bluetooth 1 
an awesome new look for fall 2000 1 
this is a masterful piece of filmmaking with many themes simmering and occasionally boiling over in this warts and all study of the poets bohemian selfindulgent wartime years that span the aerial bombardments of london and the outward tranquillity of a welsh coastal retreat the borderlines between friendship lust and love dedication to art and experience versus practical concerns jealousy rivalry cowardice and egotism versus heroism and selfsacrifice and more 1 
the battery life is highly unacceptable 0 
the only thing that i think could improve is the sound leaks out from the headset 0 
im trying to return it for a refund 0 
it even has its sweet moments 1 
the cast was great 1 
i do not know if this was emilio estevezs directorial debut but the pacing the interplay and development of the characters as well as some clever camera work surrounding the character estevez plays all suggest a natural eye 1 
does not fit 0 
if you simply want a small flip phone look elsewhere as the extra bells whistles are mediocre 0 
you cant beat that 1 
that one didnt work either 0 
one of the worst shows of all time 0 
though the wind and the lion is told largely through the eyes of the son every member of the family can identify with one of the characters whether it be sean connerys noble brigand candace bergens feisty heroine john hustons wily john hay or steve kanalys spiffy radiant ruthless cando lieutenant roosevelts big stick 1 
and finally after all that we get to an ending that wouldve been great had it been handled by competent people and not jerry falwell 0 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
wow very spicy but delicious 1 
i have always used corded headsets and the freedom from the wireless is very helpful 1 
its worth driving up from tucson 1 
service is friendly and inviting 1 
you could only take 2 videos at a time and the quality was very poor 0 
first of all there are enough racial stereotypes and racial jokes to offend everyone 0 
i wasnt expecting oscar material but this 0 
it was packed 0 
after watching this film i wanted to learn more about the works of this artist 1 
didnt laugh or even smile once 0 
it failed to convey the broad sweep of landscapes that were a great part of the original 0 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
food was average at best 0 
people who like european films and art movies will like this movie 1 
the pancake was also really good and pretty large at that 1 
wont ever go here again 0 
it was that year however that reminded us that huston was still at the top of his game as evinced by his faithful adaptation of james joyces acclaimed novella the dead 1 
omit watching this 0 
not good enough for the price 0 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
great case and price 1 
i could barely stomach the meal but didnt complain because it was a business lunch 0 
works fine 1 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
best breakfast buffet 1 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
someone shouldve invented this sooner 1 
the burger had absolutely no flavor the meat itself was totally bland the burger was overcooked and there was no charcoal flavor 0 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
great product 1 
overall i am psyched to have a phone which has all my appointments and contacts in and gets great reception 1 
this gets a 1 out of 10 simply because theres nothing lower 0 
lots of holes in the script 0 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
it is well made easy to access the phone and has a handy detachable belt clip 1 
only like 3 or 4 buildings used a couple of locations maybe poor hummh 0 
once your food arrives its meh 0 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
the only suspense i was feeling was the frustration at just how retarded the girls were 0 
very prompt service 1 
this short film certainly pulls no punches 0 
awesome device 1 
the movie has almost no action scenes in it and very little comedy 0 
id say that would be the hardest decision honestly all of ms dishes taste how they are supposed to taste amazing 1 
sauce was tasteless 0 
ray charles is legendary 1 
then our food came out disappointment ensued 0 
absolutel junk 0 
they were goldencrispy and delicious 1 
these are the central themes of the film and they are handled ineptly stereotypically and with no depth of imagination 0 
so for our enjoyment we get to see them run around play games and be dangerous 1 
but this movie is definitely a below average rent 0 
this is essentially a communications tool that does not communicate 0 
this little device has transformed my organizational capability and made my life a whole lot easier 1 
i have been in more than a few bars in vegas and do not ever recall being charged for tap water 0 
warning stay away 0 
it has northern humour and positive about the community it represents 1 
a film not easily forgotten 1 
it was clear that she had the range and ability to pull off this part 1 
nice quality build unlike some cheap s out there 1 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
best tacos in town by far 1 
shes poised and amazing 1 
painful on the ear 0 
this is a great deal 1 
i have to mention this and it is a huge spoiler i loved the ending how all the characters of the three films were the remaining survivors of the ferry disaster with valentine and the young judge together and the old man watching it on her tv solidifying his happiness over the suffering which he dealt with for those many years 1 
dont bother go to the store 0 
this case has passed the one year mark and while it shows signs of wear it is 100 functional 1 
this place has it 1 
great bluetooth 1 
as many people complained i found this headsets microphone was very weak 0 
great phone 1 
this review is long overdue since i consider a tale of two sisters to be the single greatest film ever made 1 
after watching this film i wanted to learn more about the works of this artist 1 
reversible plug works great 1 
nine out of ten for a truly lovely film 1 
the microphone also works well but according to people i have called it applifies everything 1 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
utterly without merit on any level this is akin to torture 0 
for readers who have already seen one of miyazakis films he is still in top form and made another worthwhile experience 1 
sending it back 0 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
all in all i can assure you ill be back 1 
this movie is greatespecially if you enjoy visual arts 1 
not as good as i had hoped 0 
great food and awesome service 1 
i could care less the interior is just beautiful 1 
people who like european films and art movies will like this movie 1 
food was really good and i got full petty fast 1 
ive had this bluetoooth headset for some time now and still not comfortable with the way it fits on the ear 0 
it was so boring 0 
dont buy it 0 
my husband said she was very rude did not even apologize for the bad food or anything 0 
a lot of websites have been rating this a very good phone and so do i 1 
this movie suffered because of the writing it needed more suspense 0 
however bt headsets are currently not good for real time games like firstperson shooters since the audio delay messes me up 0 
the food was excellent and service was very good 1 
it has a very good plot it holds your complete attention the acting is superb tom wilkinson was fantastic and emily watson was also very good 1 
other than that the leather is nice and soft the fit is very tight the cut out for the face is a good shape 1 
anyway the plot flowed smoothly and the malebonding scenes were a hoot 1 
oh yeah and the storyline was pathetic too 0 
integrated seamlessly with the motorola razr phone 1 
the waitresses are very friendly 1 
con spotty service 0 
all in all id expected a better consumer experience from motorola 0 
to my disbelief each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods i have ever tasted 0 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
this movie is excellentangel is beautiful and scamp is adorablehis little yelps when hes scaredand the funniest parts are whenscamp is caught under the curtain and when angel and scamp are singing ive never had this feeling beforei totally recommend this movieits coming out on special edition on june 20the cover has scamp on a garbage can and angel underneath the lid 1 
emily watsons character is very strong and she has only to give a quick glance and you understand everything 1 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
worst customer service 0 
waitress was a little slow in service 0 
when achille and philippa beautifully sing a duet from don giovanni that perfectly describes their situation in the movie you appreciate the subtle layers of this excellent film 1 
brilliant 1 
when it opens the battery connection is broken and the device is turned off 0 
editing the editing of this film was phenomenal in my opinion 1 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
if you plan to use this in a car forget about it 0 
all in all i think it was a good investment 1 
we thought youd have to venture further away to get good sushi but this place really hit the spot that night 1 
the voice recognition thru the handset is excellent 1 
what is even more stupid is that who had thought an idea that there should be a volcano in los angeles 0 
the plot doesnt hang together at all and the acting is absolutely appalling 0 
avoid at any and all costs 0 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
still its quite interesting and entertaining to follow 1 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
the building itself seems pretty neat the bathroom is pretty trippy but i wouldnt eat here again 0 
its not what it says it is 0 
they have great dinners 1 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
after my phone got to be about a year old its been slowly breaking despite much care on my part 0 
ive had no trouble accessing the internet downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions 1 
the meat was pretty dry i had the sliced brisket and pulled pork 0 
i was particularly pleased with the acting ability of dwight schultz 1 
still waiting im sure this item would work well if i ever recieve it 0 
very windresistant 1 
great charger 1 
thank you for such great service 1 
this is one of the better buffets that i have been to 1 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
but it wasnt anything at all just one big yawn 0 
if that bug never showed up i would have given a 4 for sure but on the other side of the wall where this bug was climbing was the kitchen 0 
the aerial scenes were welldone 1 
conclusion i loved it 1 
this is an outstanding little restaurant with some of the best food i have ever tasted 1 
which is precisely why i am giving it such a bad review 0 
i ate there twice on my last visit and especially enjoyed the salmon salad 1 
her lines seem to have been written by a fifteen year old though they are trying oh so so hard to sound like how a fifteen year old would really um you know well talk 0 
at first glance it is a lovely bakery cafe nice ambiance clean friendly staff 1 
the ri style calamari was a joke 0 
it doesnt make you look cool 0 
plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job 1 
i really wanted the plantronics 510 to be the right one but it has too many issues for methe good 0 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
dont bother go to the store 0 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
the death row scenes were entirely unmoving 0 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
the selection was probably the worst ive seen in vegasthere was none 0 
they refuse to refund or replace 0 
the movie is littered with overt racial slurs towards the black cast members and in return the whites are depicted as morons and boobs 0 
dont buy this product 0 
it came free with a dvd player i bought but i still turned the thing off halfway through because i was embarrassed for howell 0 
however my girl was complain that some time the phone doesnt wake up like normal phone does 0 
the battery works great 1 
this little device has transformed my organizational capability and made my life a whole lot easier 1 
my sashimi was poor quality being soggy and tasteless 0 
would come back again if i had a sushi craving while in vegas 1 
first time there and might just be the last 0 
im really disappointed all i have now is a charger that doesnt work 0 
with the originality and freshness of the first movie now spent this remake had little else to offer 0 
in an interesting part of town this place is amazing 1 
lucy bell is so much higher than this crap and for her to sink this low is quite depressing 0 
by the time the film ended i not only disliked it i despised it 0 
the bottowm lineanother worthless cheap gimmick from sprint 0 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
as always the evening was wonderful and the food delicious 1 
shrimp when i unwrapped it i live only 12 a mile from brushfire it was literally ice cold 0 
my experience was terrible this was my fourth bluetooth headset and while it was much more comfortable than my last jabra which i hated 0 
started watching this but didnt believe in any of the characters 0 
the accompanied software is almost brilliant 1 
to my disbelief each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods i have ever tasted 0 
oh yeah and the storyline was pathetic too 0 
but now i was completely grossed out 0 
this is truly an art movieit actually has a lot of art in it 1 
their onscreen chemistry critical to the entire film is genuine 1 
lewis blacks considerable talent is wasted here too as he is at his most incendiary when he is unrestrained which the pg13 rating certainly wont allow 0 
a standout scene 1 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
i mean really how do you get so famous for your fish and chips when its so terrible 0 
appears to actually outperform the original battery from china that came with my v325i 1 
an interesting premise and billy drago is always good as a dangerous nutbag side note id love to see drago stephen mchattie and lance hendrikson in a flick together talk about raging cheekbones 1 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
this is a masterful piece of filmmaking with many themes simmering and occasionally boiling over in this warts and all study of the poets bohemian selfindulgent wartime years that span the aerial bombardments of london and the outward tranquillity of a welsh coastal retreat the borderlines between friendship lust and love dedication to art and experience versus practical concerns jealousy rivalry cowardice and egotism versus heroism and selfsacrifice and more 1 
i will never go back to this place and will never ever recommended this place to anyone 0 
this game rocks 1 
i dont think there are any redeeming qualities in this remake 0 
dont waste your on this one 0 
reasonably priced also 1 
hayao miyazakis latest and eighth film for studio ghibili gake no ue no ponyo ponyo on the cliff by the sea is a wonderfully fun and imaginative look at childhood 1 
his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic 1 
what a disappointment 0 
product is useless since it does not have enough charging current to charge the 2 cellphones i was planning to use it with 0 
works good 1 
bluetooth range is good a few days ago i left my phone in the trunk got a call and carried the conversation without a hitch 1 
i am so tired of clichés that is just lazy writing and here they come in thick and fast 0 
funny clever hip just like prays previous film hype 1 
but even the talented carrell cant save this 0 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
i am far from a sushi connoisseur but i can definitely tell the difference between good food and bad food and this was certainly bad food 0 
if only someone involved with it knew how to string together narrative 0 
though the wind and the lion is told largely through the eyes of the son every member of the family can identify with one of the characters whether it be sean connerys noble brigand candace bergens feisty heroine john hustons wily john hay or steve kanalys spiffy radiant ruthless cando lieutenant roosevelts big stick 1 
the microphone also works well but according to people i have called it applifies everything 1 
not nearly as good looking as the amazon picture makes it look 0 
because both ears are occupied background is not distracting at all 1 
great for the jawbone 1 
theres really nothing bad i can say about this headset 0 
walked in and the place smelled like an old grease trap and only 2 others there eating 0 
i even dropped this phone into a stream and it was submerged for 15 seconds and it still works great 1 
very very disappointed ordered the 35 big bay plater 0 
meredith m was better than all right 1 
the service was a little slow considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace 0 
it even has its sweet moments 1 
very disappointing 0 
a good time 1 
it always cuts out and makes a beep beep beep sound then says signal failed 0 
very displeased 0 
this convention never worked well in the past and certainly doesnt work here 0 
i love it 1 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
it was attached to a gas station and that is rarely a good sign 0 
headset works great was packaged nicely to avoid any damage 1 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
i bought this phone as a replacement for my startac and have regretted it since 0 
great time family dinner on a sunday night 1 
the ripped banana was not only ripped but petrified and tasteless 0 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
we ordered the duck rare and it was pink and tender on the inside with a nice char on the outside 1 
you could only take 2 videos at a time and the quality was very poor 0 
im still infatuated with this phone 1 
a happy wonderful feel good ending 1 
the only good thing was that it fits comfortably on small ears 1 
also its a real treat to see anthony quinn playing crazy horse 1 
these products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet 0 
waste of money 0 
the restaurant is very clean and has a family restaurant feel to it 1 
mishima is extremely uninteresting 0 
it was also the right balance of war and love 1 
i swung in to give them a try but was deeply disappointed 0 
avoid at all costs 0 
clear skype calls long battery life long range 1 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
10 out of 10 stars 1 
now you know why i gave it a 10 1 
this totally unfunny movie is so over the top and pathetic and unrealistic that throughout the whole 90 minutes of utter torture i probably looked at my watch about 70000 times 0 
the design is very odd as the ear clip is not very comfortable at all 0 
appears to actually outperform the original battery from china that came with my v325i 1

no ear loop needed its tiny and the sound is great 1 
the cast was great 1

i as well wouldve given godfathers zero stars if possible 0 
tried to go here for lunch and it was a madhouse 0 
the pizza selections are good 1 
the owner used to work at nobu so this place is really similar for half the price 1 
all things considered a job very well done 1 
best of luck to the rude and noncustomer service focused new management 0 
piece of trash 0 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
i give it 2 thumbs down 0 
the greek dressing was very creamy and flavorful 1 
the holster that arrived did not match the photo in the ad 0 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
as a courtroom drama its compelling as an indictment on the american justice system its frightening 1 
this is by far the worst purchase ive made on amazon 0 
the crêpe was delicate and thin and moist 1 
for readers who have already seen one of miyazakis films he is still in top form and made another worthwhile experience 1

the ngage is still lacking in earbuds 0 
we thought youd have to venture further away to get good sushi but this place really hit the spot that night 1 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
so bad 0 
during several different 2 minute calls i experienced 5 drops and it was in an area that had 5 bars 0 
after 20 minutes wait i got a table 0 
much less than the jawbone i was going to replace it with 1 
this place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver 0 
this place receives stars for their appetizers 1 
drinks took close to 30 minutes to come out at one point 0

some applause should be given to the prelude however 1 
and his subtle connections between the three films are awesome 1 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1

now i know that i made a wise decision 1

the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1

kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
i bought this phone as a replacement for my startac and have regretted it since 0 
service is friendly and inviting 1 
i consider this theft 0 
a pretty good product 1 
the basic premise is wasted since it is sidelined by the inexplicable focus on the documentary crew 0 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
characters are onedimensional even the good guys and especially the bad guys 0 
ordered an appetizer and took 40 minutes and then the pizza another 10 minutes 0 
restaurant is always full but never a wait 1 
we thought youd have to venture further away to get good sushi but this place really hit the spot that night 1

very prompt service 1 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
honeslty it didnt taste that fresh 0 
best ive found so far ive tried 2 other bluetooths and this one has the best quality for both me and the listener as well as ease of using 1 
the sangria was about half of a glass wine full and was 12 ridiculous 0 
the only thing really worth watching was the scenery and the house because it is beautiful 1 
this place is not worth your time let alone vegas 0 
this is truly an art movieit actually has a lot of art in it 1 
in particular the relationship between the bakery assistant and the waitress just didnt work for me at all 0 
i must say i have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again 1 
i must say i have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again 1 
glad i didnt pay to see it 0 
the structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema 1 
there are the usual hitchcock logic flaws 0 
the headset fulfills my requirements so i am happy with my purchase 1 
im a big fan of this series mostly due to anne rices style sensitivities and treatments 1 
wont work right or atleast for me 0 
as always the evening was wonderful and the food delicious 1 
not tasty and the texture was just nasty 0 
then i watched it again two sundays ago march 20th 2005 and i began to really enjoy it and this time i taped the entire thing 1 
it rocked my world and is certainly a must see for anyone with no social or physical outlets 1 
ill definitely be in soon again 1 
so far it has worked like a charm 1 
classywarm atmosphere fun and fresh appetizers succulent steaks baseball steak 1 
works as described 1 
now i know that i made a wise decision 1 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
just as good as when i had it more than a year ago 1 
disappointed 0 
it even has its sweet moments 1 
very good though 1 
but despite these few flaws this case is of exceptional quality and well worth the additional costs of owning an official oem product 1 
its the best headset i have used 1 
first of all there are enough racial stereotypes and racial jokes to offend everyone 0 
i was not happy with this item 0

happy so far 1 
really bad 0 
so in a nutshell 1 the restaraunt smells like a combination of a dirty fish market and a sewer 0 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
the chains which im no fan of beat this place easily 0 
this was like the final blow 0 
reversible plug works great 1 
the acting from all involved and that includes those like shatner and nimoy is bad and washed out and making them seem as old as they look in real life the special effects are tacky like when spock has to rescue kirk on a jet pack when he falls down from a mountain 0 
happy so far 1 
the desserts were a bit strange 0 
my 810 score is mostly for the plot 1 
the sets especially designed to work with the camera are amazingstylized beautiful and effective 1 
it is a joy to use 1 
it is a very well acted and done tv movie 1 
nice sound 1 
i own 2 of these cases and would order another 1 
it wasnt busy either also the building was freezing cold 0 
not much seafood and like 5 strings of pasta at the bottom 0 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
this movie now joins revenge of the boogeyman and zombiez as part of the hellish trinity of horror films 0 
the cashier was friendly and even brought the food out to me 1

that movie was bad 0 
i loved it it was really scary 1 
you could drive a semi truck into these holes 0 
the eargels channel the sound directly into your ear and seem to increase the sound volume and clarity 1 
this is a chilly unremarkable movie about an author livingworking in a chilly abstruse culture 0 
ive seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie 0 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
ive only had my bluetooth for a few weeks but i really like it 1 
its just painful 0 
a piece of cinematic garbage captured on celluloid 0 
that said our mouths and bellies were still quite pleased 1 
highly unrecommended 0 
my 5year old nokia 2160 from tracfone holds the charge a lot better than this 0 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
what happened next was prettyoff putting 0 
were jerks on the phone 0 
the flair bartenders are absolutely amazing 1 
it makes very strange ticking noises before it ends the call 0 
omit watching this 0

i enjoyed reading this book to my children when they were little 1 
horrible had to switch 3 times 0 
its a little geeky but i think thats its sex on toast and it rocks and oozes sex right down to its battery embedded sleek stylish leather case 1 
the explosion of the gas tanks at the end was just as awful 0
