the delivery was on time 1 
this is a very average phone with bad battery life that operates on a weak network 0 
as always the evening was wonderful and the food delicious 1 
omit watching this 0 
babie bop is very cute 1 
trouble is the writing and directing make it impossible to establish those things that make a movie watchable like character story theme and so on 0 
never been to hard rock casino before will never ever step forward in it again 0 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
i paid the bill but did not tip because i felt the server did a terrible job 0 
both actors truly understand and become their particular character delivering a convincing sincere performance 1 
it was horrendous 0 
nice quality build unlike some cheap s out there 1 
this place is horrible and way overpriced 0 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
the management is rude 0 
there is so much good food in vegas that i feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to rice and company 0 
also the phone doesnt seem to accept anything except cbr mp3s preferably ripped by windows media player 0 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
nice quality build unlike some cheap s out there 1 
the lead man is charismafree 0 
i was not impressed by this product 0 
in a word it is embarrassing 0 
i left with a stomach ache and felt sick the rest of the day 0 
at first i thought i was grtting a good deal at 744 until i plugged it into my phone v3c razr 0 
walked in and the place smelled like an old grease trap and only 2 others there eating 0 
the results well are a shame 0 
its a campy sort of film thats a joy to watch 1 
its really easy 1 
buttons are too small 0 
ive also had problems with the phone reading the memory card in which i always turn it on and then off again 0 
i have recommended it to friends 1 
it was equally awful 0 
it lasts less than 3o minutes if i actually try to use the phonemy wife has the same phone with the same problem 0 
nice sound 1 
i mean in a realistic world she would never have gotten into that ballet repertory the whole thing was quite pathetic 0 
i came over from verizon because cingulair has nicer cell phones the first thing i noticed was the really bad service 0 
this is a great little item 1 
the script is a big flawed mess 0 
crostini that came with the salad was stale 0 
talk about great customer service of course we will be back 1 
it was a riot to see hugo weaving play a sexobsessed gay real estate salesman who uses his clients houses for his trysts with the flaming darren tom hollander 1 
the directing and the cinematography arent quite as good 0 
headset works great was packaged nicely to avoid any damage 1 
not much dialogue not much music the whole film was shot as elaborately and aesthetically like a sculpture 1 
im returning them 0 
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0 
went in for happy hour great list of wines 1 
poor product 0 
disappointing accessory from a good manufacturer 0 
portable and it works 1 
i can say that the desserts were yummy 1 
also the area where my unit broke im not too fond of the magnetic strap 0 
just whatever you do avoid groove as its the antithesis of all that is good about human traffic 0 
i have two more years left in this contract and i hate this phone 0 
i can assure you that you wont be disappointed 1 
only pros large seating area nice bar area great simple drink menu the best brick oven pizza with homemade dough 1 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
the phone crashed completely and now i have to get it replaced 0 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
essentially you can forget microsofts tech support 0 
case was more or less an extra that i originally put on but later discarded because it scratched my ear 0 
the staff are great the ambiance is great 1 
id advise anyone to go and see it 1 
after my phone got to be about a year old its been slowly breaking despite much care on my part 0 
i mean in a realistic world she would never have gotten into that ballet repertory the whole thing was quite pathetic 0 
the worst was the salmon sashimi 0 
gave up trying to eat any of the crust teeth still sore 0 
the only suspense i was feeling was the frustration at just how retarded the girls were 0 
great place fo take out or eat in 1 
it looks very nice 1 
excellent cast story line performances 1 
i would not recommend this place 0 
just spicy enough perfect actually 1 
comfort for our whole family 1 
im happy about this purchase good quality and low price 1 
interesting decor 1 
that just screams legit in my booksomethats also pretty rare here in vegas 1 
the 12 mega pixel camera being a part of a phone is reasonably good7 1 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
this is a great deal 1 
the plot was the same as pretty much every other cheap horror 0 
highly unrecommended 0 
never going back 0 
there is really nothing for me at postinos hope your experience is better 0 
but i thought his acting was skilled 1 
delicious and i will absolutely be back 1 
in addition to having one of the most lovely songs ever written french cancan also boasts one of the cutest leading ladies ever to grace the screen 1 
i have only had it for a few weeks but so far so good 1 
i love the camera its really pretty good quality 1 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
loved itfriendly servers great food wonderful and imaginative menu 1 
but then they came back cold 0 
it is well made easy to access the phone and has a handy detachable belt clip 1 
this is such a fun and funny movie 1 
it sure does beat the nachos at the movies but i would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant 0 
having to humour him just to get by and get through the day was so apt 1 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
a greasy unhealthy meal 0 
i also decided not to send it back because our waitress looked like she was on the verge of having a heart attack 0 
youll love how thin it is 1 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
its a campy sort of film thats a joy to watch 1 
the kids are very cool too 1 
cant say enough good things about this place 1 
the acting is like watching wooden puppets moving around and reading from a book thats how bad it is 0 
dont buy this product 0 
food was really boring 0 
i was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar not only because the quality is great but the service is fast and the food impeccable 1 
beautiful styling though 1 
the screen size is big key pad lit well enough and the camera quality is excellent for a camera phone 1 
bad day or not i have a very low tolerance for rude customer service people it is your job to be nice and polite wash dishes otherwise 0 
he was terrible 0 
this place is like chipotle but better 1 
never got it 0 
it is a joy to use 1 
the use of slowmotion needlessly repeats itself throughout the movie but is well backed up by bad acting and bad is a kind word here no continuity scenes that are thrown in for no reason whatsoever vehicles that looked like they were made from a corn flakes box and a directorial style that bordered on stupidity 0 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
i mean really how do you get so famous for your fish and chips when its so terrible 0 
the cast of veteran actors are more than just a nostalgia trip 1 
couldnt use the unit with sunglasses not good in texas 0 
well im satisfied 1 
the worst sappiest dialogue i could go on and on 0 
this is a great little item 1 
crash is a depressing little nothing that provokes emotion but teaches you nothing if you already know racism and prejudice are bad things 0 
dont waste your on this one 0 
would not recommend to others 0 
i know this is not like the other restaurants at all something is very off here 0 
worth every penny 1 
all the other cases ive tried normally fall apart after a few months but this one seems to be in for the long haul 1 
bad day or not i have a very low tolerance for rude customer service people it is your job to be nice and polite wash dishes otherwise 0 
but then they came back cold 0 
the reception has been generally good 1 
case was more or less an extra that i originally put on but later discarded because it scratched my ear 0 
i dont like this nokia either 0 
it works 1 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
you cant beat that 1 
i will not be eating there again 0 
it is just the sort of pap that is screened in the afternoon to punish the unemployed for not having jobs 0 
not my thing 0 
will never ever go back 0 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
but it wasnt anything at all just one big yawn 0 
earbud piece breaks easily 0 
i enjoyed reading this book to my children when they were little 1 
good audio quality 1 
the film has an ultracheap look to it 0 
battery has no life 0 
but it wasnt anything at all just one big yawn 0 
worst ever 0 
the sound is clear and the people i talk to on it are amazed at the quality too 1 
he really didnt seem to want to be hosting his voiceovers were monotonous didnt get involved with the guests 0 
i dont each much pasta but i love the homemade hand made pastas and thin pizzas here 1 
its so stupid to have to keep buying new chargers car chargers cradles headphones and car kits every time a new phone comes out 0 
this phone is pretty sturdy and ive never had any large problems with it 1 
the entire audience applauded at the conclusion of the film 1 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
you will leave the theater wanting to go out and dance under the stars 1 
a fly was in my apple juice a fly 0 
i think the most wonderful parts literally full of wonder are the excerpts from his works 1 
i would recommend this 1 
artless camerawork endlessly presents us with the ugliest setting imaginable ie 0 
we were promptly greeted and seated 1 
i struggle to find anything bad to say about it 1 
great food and service huge portions and they give a military discount 1 
their frozen margaritas are way too sugary for my taste 0 
the potatoes were great and so was the biscuit 1 
you cant beat the price on these 1 
my wife had the lobster bisque soup which was lukewarm 0 
great software for motorolas 1 
my brother in law who works at the mall ate here same day and guess what he was sick all night too 0 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
clever and a real crowdpleaserthis film still ranks among mickeys best films even after 80 wonderful years 1 
trumbull on i love lucy 1 
we ordered the duck rare and it was pink and tender on the inside with a nice char on the outside 1 
if you have not seen this movie i definitely recommend it 1 
this greedy corporation will never see another dime from me 0 
my 810 score is mostly for the plot 1 
every time he opened his mouth you expect to hear you see kids pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show 0 
the vegetables are so fresh and the sauce feels like authentic thai 1 
worse theres an incredibly weak subplot thrown in that follows a little band of latterday mansonites as they go after a reporter whos working on a story on the anniversary of the killings 0 
10 out of 10 for both the movie and trilogy 1 
the service was a bit lacking 0 
i kept looking at the time and it had soon become 35 minutes yet still no food 0 
so dont go there if you are looking for good food 0 
will order from them again 1 
i heart this place 1 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
i could not understand what kind of idiot would produce this mess in the first place not to mention several season 0 
ive missed numerous calls because of this reason 0 
the cast was great 1 
i mean in a realistic world she would never have gotten into that ballet repertory the whole thing was quite pathetic 0 
otherwise dont even waste your time on this 0 
still waiting im sure this item would work well if i ever recieve it 0 
very easy to use 1 
one character is totally annoying with a voice that gives me the feeling of fingernails on a chalkboard 0 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
i dont think it would hold it too securly on your belt 0 
excellent sound battery life and inconspicuous to boot 1 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
it was a good thing that the tickets only cost five dollars because i would be mad if id have paid 750 to see this crap 0 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
will never ever go back 0 
first the bathrooms at this location were dirty seat covers were not replenished just plain yucky 0 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
this phone is very fast with sending any kind of messages and web browsing is significantly faster than previous phones i have used 1 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
i had strawberry tea which was good 1 
i waited and waited 0 
the vanilla ice cream was creamy and smooth while the profiterole choux pastry was fresh enough 1 
integrated seamlessly with the motorola razr phone 1 
in addition it feels amp looks as if the phone is all lightweight cheap plastic 0 
did not like at all 0 
the concert sequences just sucked 0 
great bluetooth 1 
overall i like there food and the service 1 
the nano stated itmy son was dissapointed 0 
it was so boring 0 
i am very happy 1 
1010 1 
will be back again 1 
does not fit 0 
this place is great 1 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
it is an hour and half waste of time following a bunch of very pretty high schoolers whine and cry about life 0 
ill be looking for a new earpiece 0 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
they dropped more than the ball 0 
it is an hour and half waste of time following a bunch of very pretty high schoolers whine and cry about life 0 
the acting as youd expect from this cast is top notch 1 
owners are really great people 1 
similarly the delivery man did not say a word of apology when our food was 45 minutes late 0 
the only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port irda 0 
logitech bluetooth headset is a 10 1 
con spotty service 0 
the acting is beyond abysmal 0 
for people who are first timers in film making i think they did an excellent job 1 
come hungry leave happy and stuffed 1 
both actors truly understand and become their particular character delivering a convincing sincere performance 1 
just does not work 0 
as always the evening was wonderful and the food delicious 1 
very tough and very short on flavor 0 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
just spicy enough perfect actually 1 
i loved their mussels cooked in this wine reduction the duck was tender and their potato dishes were delicious 1 
using all earpieces left or right this thing will not stay on my ear 0 
down the drain because of a weak snap 0 
i came over from verizon because cingulair has nicer cell phones the first thing i noticed was the really bad service 0 
some great music and terrific scenery 1 
excellent sound battery life and inconspicuous to boot 1 
this place was such a nice surprise 1 
i dont have very many words to say about this place but it does everything pretty well 1 
i just saw this film and i recommend it 1 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
the songs were the best and the muppets were so hilarious 1 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
punishment park is a brilliant piece of cinema 1 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
service is perfect and the family atmosphere is nice to see 1 
stay away from the q 0 
characters are onedimensional even the good guys and especially the bad guys 0 
im not sure how long we stood there but it was long enough for me to begin to feel awkwardly out of place 0 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
i was amazed at the quick arrival of the two original lg cell phone batteries and and at a fraction of the price 1 
they made this case too small and is very difficult to install 0 
the malta settings are as dry and as barren as the dialogue 0 
i mean in a realistic world she would never have gotten into that ballet repertory the whole thing was quite pathetic 0 
trouble is the writing and directing make it impossible to establish those things that make a movie watchable like character story theme and so on 0 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
mark my words this is one of those cult films like evil dead 2 or phantasm that people will still be discovering and falling in love with 20 30 40 years down the line 1 
this really is how vegas fine dining used to be right down to the menus handed to the ladies that have no prices listed 1 
i loved their mussels cooked in this wine reduction the duck was tender and their potato dishes were delicious 1 
i saw it as a child on tv back in 1973 when it was the stranger and i loved it 1 
it is a very well acted and done tv movie 1 
what a mistake 0 
camerawork again bad 0 
he really didnt seem to want to be hosting his voiceovers were monotonous didnt get involved with the guests 0 
this is just a great movie 1 
a pretty good product 1 
we definately enjoyed ourselves 1 
also the phone doesnt seem to accept anything except cbr mp3s preferably ripped by windows media player 0 
if you dont find it too bad as again the unit comes with one earpad onlyi would not recommend this to anyone 0 
the voice recognition thru the handset is excellent 1 
great food and service huge portions and they give a military discount 1 
this isnt a small family restaurant this is a fine dining establishment 1 
im really disappointed all i have now is a charger that doesnt work 0 
however paul schrader has indeed made a film about mishima that is both superb complex 1 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
the selection on the menu was great and so were the prices 1 
this review is long overdue since i consider a tale of two sisters to be the single greatest film ever made 1 
my only problem is i thought the actor playing the villain was a low rent michael ironside 0 
exactly what i wanted 1 
best breakfast buffet 1 
the cashier had no care what so ever on what i had to say it still ended up being wayyy overpriced 0 
i really like this product over the motorola because it is allot clearer on the ear piece and the mic 1 
i believe that pitch black was done well 1 
i love the scream movies and all horror movies and this one ranks way up there 1 
i sat riveted to the tv screen 1 
the inside is really quite nice and very clean 1 
con spotty service 0 
what a piece of junk i lose more calls on this phone 0 
you wont regret it 1 
poorly contstruct hinge 0 
never been to hard rock casino before will never ever step forward in it again 0 
couldnt ask for a more satisfying meal 1 
the vegetables are so fresh and the sauce feels like authentic thai 1 
we wont be returning 0 
we ordered some old classics and some new dishes after going there a few times and were sorely disappointed with everything 0 
kind of hard to mess up a steak but they did 0 
crostini that came with the salad was stale 0 
the accompanied software is almost brilliant 1 
for a product that costs as much as this one does i expect it to work far better and with greater ease than this thing does 0 
im trying to return it for a refund 0 
those phones are working just fine now 1 
there are the usual hitchcock logic flaws 0 
i dont think i will be back for a very long time 0 
food was delicious 1 
if she had not rolled the eyes we may have stayed not sure if we will go back and try it again 0 
bluetooth range is good a few days ago i left my phone in the trunk got a call and carried the conversation without a hitch 1 
overall i was not impressed and would not go back 0 
really awful 0 
i can take a little bad service but the food sucks 0 
one of the worst shows of all time 0 
totally believable 1 
great brunch spot 1 
very nice and relaxing late night viewing 1 
its a case of so bad it is laughable 0 
not only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic but it also managed to give away the entire movie and im not exaggerating every moment every plot point every joke is told in the trailer 0 
the food was terrible 0 
my side greek salad with the greek dressing was so tasty and the pita and hummus was very refreshing 1 
it is just the sort of pap that is screened in the afternoon to punish the unemployed for not having jobs 0 
jamie foxx absolutely is ray charles 1 
one more thing i can tolerate political incorrectness very well im all for artistic freedom and suspension of disbelief but the slavic female character was just too much 0 
it was awesome 1 
i think that it is a must see older john wayne film 1 
used and dirty 0 
like the other reviewer said you couldnt pay me to eat at this place again 0 
full of unconvincing cardboard characters it is blandly written by edward chodorov who also produced and is surprisingly directed by jean negulesco from whom one would expect a great deal more 0 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
i got the car charger and not even after a week the charger was brokeni went to plug it in and it started smoking 0 
schrader has made a resume full of lousy amateurish films 0 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
very tough and very short on flavor 0 
also if your phone is dropped this case is not going to save it specially when dropped face down 0 
i was mortified 0 
the lighting is just dark enough to set the mood 1 
i got this phone on reccomendation from a relative and im glad i did 1 
brilliance indeed 1 
my experience was terrible this was my fourth bluetooth headset and while it was much more comfortable than my last jabra which i hated 0 
very happy with this product 1 
i still maintain that monkeys shouldnt make headphones we just obviously dont share enough dna to copy the design over to humans 0 
nevertheless yet another wonderful film from the great masters stable 1 
our server was super nice and checked on us many times 1 
this one is simply a disappointment 0 
as for the service im a fan because its quick and youre being served by some nice folks 1 
its kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly its embarrassing how childlike the company is 0 
also difficult to put onid recommend avoiding this product 0 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
this case has passed the one year mark and while it shows signs of wear it is 100 functional 1 
the burger had absolutely no flavor the meat itself was totally bland the burger was overcooked and there was no charcoal flavor 0 
i have had tmobile service for 2 or 3 years now and i am pretty happy with it 1 
if you have not seen this movie i definitely recommend it 1 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
comes with a strong light that you can use to light up your camera shots and even flash sos signals seriously 1 
the biggest complaint i have is the battery drains superfast 0 
the construction of the headsets is poor 0 
after my phone got to be about a year old its been slowly breaking despite much care on my part 0 
saw the movie today and thought it was a good effort good messages for kids 1 
one thing i hate is the mode set button at the side 0 
his performance as awarded was stunning 1 
but if you liked movies like the matrix and better yet their sequels i think youll appreciate the thought provoking mindblowing experience this film will give you 1 
the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach 0 
so anyone near you will hear part of your conversation 0 
otherwise easy to install and use clear sound 1 
bad characters bad story and bad acting 0 
a good time 1 
even in my bmw 3 series which is fairly quiet i have trouble hearing what the other person is saying 0 
damian is so talented and versatile in so many ways of writing and portraying different characters on screen 1 
hayao miyazakis latest and eighth film for studio ghibili gake no ue no ponyo ponyo on the cliff by the sea is a wonderfully fun and imaginative look at childhood 1 
started watching this but didnt believe in any of the characters 0 
im not impressed with the concept or the food 0 
i have to use the smallest earpieces provided but it stays on pretty well 1 
customer service was terrible 0 
love this product 1 
too bad you have to pay up to a month for the service 0 
i was very disappointed in the movie 0 
2 times very bad customer service 0 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
the guys all had steaks and our steak loving son who has had steak at the best and worst places said it was the best steak hes ever eaten 1 
they made this case too small and is very difficult to install 0 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
these are the central themes of the film and they are handled ineptly stereotypically and with no depth of imagination 0 
yes its shiny on front side and i love it 1 
nargile i think you are great 1 
his performance is simply genius 1 
i gave it 5 stars because of the sound quality 1 
does everything it should and more 1 
the service was terrible though 0 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
if the food isnt bad enough for you then enjoy dealing with the worlds worstannoying drunk people 0 
it is a true classic 1 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
those phones are working just fine now 1 
excellent cast story line performances 1 
kris kristoffersen is good in this movie and really makes a difference 1 
love it great armband 1 
would come back again if i had a sushi craving while in vegas 1 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
i have seen many movies starring jaclyn smith but my god this was one of her best though it came out 12 years ago 1 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
highly recommended a 1 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
this may be the only bad film he ever made 0 
we are so glad we found this place 1 
the service was meh 0 
stay away from this store be careful 0 
it was too predictable even for a chick flick 0 
youd have to have the iq of particularly stupid mollusk not to see that one coming 0 
loved the casting of jimmy buffet as the science teacher 1 
a usable keyboard actually turns a pda into a realworld useful machine instead of just a neat gadget 1 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
the tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu 0 
i had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get some relief 0 
at a time when it seems that film animation has been dominated by disneypixars cgi masterpieces it is both refreshing and comforting to know that miyazaki is still relying on traditional handdrawn animation to tell his charming and enchanting stories 1 
piece of junk 0 
i always order from the vegetarian menu during dinner which has a wide array of options to choose from 1 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
this may be the only bad film he ever made 0 
my rating just 3 out of 10 0 
both of them were truly unbelievably good and i am so glad we went back 1 
we have tried 2 units and they both failed within 2 months pros 0 
has been working great 1 
its welldesigned and very sharp the blue is a very nice color 1 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
the han nan chicken was also very tasty 1 
in conclusion i will not bother with this movie because a volcano in los angeles is nothing but nonsense 0 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
so far it has worked like a charm 1 
i wasted my little money with this earpiece 0 
to summarize the food was incredible nay transcendant but nothing brings me joy quite like the memory of the pneumatic condiment dispenser 1 
great phone 1 
awful service 0 
the price was very good and with the free shipping and all it was a good purchase 1 
i received it quickly and it works great 1 
i also didnt like the on button it felt like it would crack with use 0 
what a waste 0 
small sleek impressive looking practical setup with ample storage in place 1 
my wife had the lobster bisque soup which was lukewarm 0 
so absolutley fantastic 1 
his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic 1 
it defeats the purpose of a bluetooth headset 0 
cant say enough good things about this place 1 
damn good steak 1 
my side greek salad with the greek dressing was so tasty and the pita and hummus was very refreshing 1 
i checked out this place a couple years ago and was not impressed 0 
my boyfriend and i came here for the first time on a recent trip to vegas and could not have been more pleased with the quality of food and service 1 
the best place in vegas for breakfast just check out a sat or sun 1 
the camera really likes her in this movie 1 
some applause should be given to the prelude however 1 
here in the wind and the lion we see a wonderful rendering of americas own imperial age 1 
alexander nevsky is a great film 1 
we wont be returning 0 
elias koteasjack palance play good roles angelina is hot and gets nakedbilly drago appears in this and is cool as usual a cameo by sven ole thorsen helps make this a very enjoyable movie with good acting and a decent budget 1 
i felt as though her going to ireland did absolutely nothing whatsoever 0 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
i had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get some relief 0 
and i just love the colors 1 
i had absolutely no problem with this headset linking to my 8530 blackberry curve 1 
but now that it is out of warranty the same problems reoccurebottom line put your money somewhere else cingular will not support it 0 
i love the camera its really pretty good quality 1 
i am so tired of clichés that is just lazy writing and here they come in thick and fast 0 
also great directing and photography 1 
nobody identifies with these characters because theyre all cardboard cutouts and stereotypes or predictably reversestereotypes 0 
it works fine on my motorola 325 cellphone and a lot better than the wornout battery did 1 
fantastic buy and will get again for whatever my next phone is 1 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
one of the most disappointing aspects is the lack of notable gore 0 
the only thing i wasnt too crazy about was their guacamole as i dont like it puréed 0 
he was extremely rude and really there are so many other restaurants i would love to dine at during a weekend in vegas 0 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
the food sucked which we expected but it sucked more than we could have imagined 0 
soyo technology sucks 0 
this is cool because most cases are just open there allowing the screen to get all scratched up 1 
disappointing experience 0 
this phone is pretty sturdy and ive never had any large problems with it 1 
great food 1 
despite the pans of reviewers i liked this movie 1 
everything captain howdy says is either laughable or just plain stupid 0 
my friend loved the salmon tartar 1 
worst customer service 0 
only pros large seating area nice bar area great simple drink menu the best brick oven pizza with homemade dough 1 
damian is so talented and versatile in so many ways of writing and portraying different characters on screen 1 
also notable is john baileys fine crisp beautifully colored cinematography and the great production design costumes by eiko ishioka who went on to do the memorable costumes for coppolas dracula for which she received a well deserved oscar 1 
i guess that nobody at the network that aired this dribble watched it before putting it on 0 
when achille and philippa beautifully sing a duet from don giovanni that perfectly describes their situation in the movie you appreciate the subtle layers of this excellent film 1 
this is a great place to eat 1 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
every thing on phone work perfectly she like it 1 
phone is sturdy as all nokia bar phones are 1 
the mic there is a joke and the volume is quite low 0 
one of the worst shows of all time 0 
would not reccommend 0 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
i would advise to not purchase this item it never worked very well 0 
service is quick and even to go orders are just like we like it 1 
the ear buds only play music in one ear 0 
great time family dinner on a sunday night 1 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
but this movie is not funny considering the ridiculousness of it 0 
the food wasnt good 0 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
the service was not up to par either 0 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
setup couldnt have been simpler 1 
i did not expect this to be so good 1 
audio quality is poor very poor 0 
kind of flops around 0 
yeah the movie pretty much sucked 0 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
why are these sad little vegetables so overcooked 0 
as i said abovepretty useless 0 
there are the usual hitchcock logic flaws 0 
the vanilla ice cream was creamy and smooth while the profiterole choux pastry was fresh enough 1 
again no plot at all 0 
have been going since 2007 and every meal has been awesome 1 
the construction of the headsets is poor 0 
this fixes all the problems 1 
i know that sounds funny but to me it seemed like sketchy technology that wouldnt work wellwell this one works great 1 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
also its a real treat to see anthony quinn playing crazy horse 1 
1010 1 
the battery works great 1 
john garfield ann revere lilli plmer william conrad canada leeand filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screenjames wong howe 1 
what should have been a hilarious yummy christmas eve dinner to remember was the biggest fail of the entire trip for us 0 
this is a good battery and it got here really fast 1 
punishment park is a brilliant piece of cinema 1 
i am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this 1 
this pair of headphones is the worst that i have ever had soundwise 0 
really good product 1 
restored my phone to like new performance 1 
it just blew 0 
basically the service was very bad 0 
see both films if you can 1 
almost everyone involved must be return to school acting is utterly predictable and bad script is pile of garbage all round 0 
seems like a good quick place to grab a bite of some familiar pub food but do yourself a favor and look elsewhere 0 
if good intentions made a film great then this film might be one of the greatest films ever made 1 
but i dont like it 0 
if you hate earbugs avoid this phone by all means 0 
very disappointed 0 
the movie is terribly boring in places 0 
bluetooth range is good a few days ago i left my phone in the trunk got a call and carried the conversation without a hitch 1 
needless to say we will never be back here again 0 
drinks took close to 30 minutes to come out at one point 0 
fans of the genre will be in heaven 1 
it plays louder than any other speaker of this size the price is so low that most would think the quality is lacking however its not 1 
1010 1 
characters are onedimensional even the good guys and especially the bad guys 0 
the sound quality is excellent as well 1 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
i believe every one should see this movie as i think few people outside of south africa understand its past and what is being attempted in the truth and reconciliation process 1 
it has northern humour and positive about the community it represents 1 
it probably would have been better if the director hadnt spent most of the movie showcasing his own art work which really isnt that noteworthy 0 
i love their fries and their beans 1 
couldnt figure it out 0 
an interesting premise and billy drago is always good as a dangerous nutbag side note id love to see drago stephen mchattie and lance hendrikson in a flick together talk about raging cheekbones 1 
never again will i be dining at this place 0 
maybe there would be a reasonable explanation for this atrocity 0 
this is one of the best movies out there that shows such strong sibling bond for each other 1 
it kept getting worse and worse so now im officially done 0 
we definately enjoyed ourselves 1 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
when im on this side of town this will definitely be a spot ill hit up again 1 
highly unrecommended 0 
seriously its not worth wasting your or your kids time on 0 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
the fries were not hot and neither was my burger 0 
this was one of the worst films i have ever seen 0 
barney is definitely super de duper 1 
the steaks are all well trimmed and also perfectly cooked 1 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
elias koteasjack palance play good roles angelina is hot and gets nakedbilly drago appears in this and is cool as usual a cameo by sven ole thorsen helps make this a very enjoyable movie with good acting and a decent budget 1 
same evening him and i are both drastically sick 0 
judith light is one of my favorite actresses and i think she does a superb job in this film 1 
dont buy this product it fails 0 
if you want a real scare rent this one 1 
i am pairing this with my iphone and i could not be happier with it so far 1 
the movie was very interesting from beginning to the end 1 
i know that sounds funny but to me it seemed like sketchy technology that wouldnt work wellwell this one works great 1 
these were so good we ordered them twice 1 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
i recommend this for everyone who loves film movies anythinga work of art 1 
the phone was unusable and was not new 0 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
overall the film is interesting and thoughtprovoking 1 
last time buying from you 0 
much less than the jawbone i was going to replace it with 1 
better than new 1 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
you have to hold the phone at a particular angle for the other party to hear you clearly 0 
an absolute must visit 1 
i love that they put their food in nice plastic containers as opposed to cramming it in little paper takeout boxes 1 
so anyone near you will hear part of your conversation 0 
def coming back to bowl next time 1 
this is the place where i first had pho and it was amazing 1 
there was hardly any meat 0 
we literally sat there for 20 minutes with no one asking to take our order 0 
im glad the film didnt go for the most obvious choice as a lesser film certainly would have 1 
i had to wait over 30 minutes to get my drink and longer to get 2 arepas 0 
magical help 1 
a week later after i activated it it suddenly died 0 
the accompanied software is almost brilliant 1 
no shifting no bubbling no peeling not even a scratch nothingi couldnt be more happier with my new one for the droid 1 
what should have been a hilarious yummy christmas eve dinner to remember was the biggest fail of the entire trip for us 0 
the fish is badly made and some of its underwater shots are repeated a thousand times in the film 0 
ill even say it again  this is torture 0 
top line dont waste your time and money on this one its as bad as it comes 0 
this is some seriously good pizza and im an expertconnisseur on the topic 1 
after the first charge kept going dead after 12 minutes 0 
saggy floppy piece of junk 0 
you wont regret it 1 
all the other cases ive tried normally fall apart after a few months but this one seems to be in for the long haul 1 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
the acting is fantastic the stories are seamlessly woven together and the dogs are splendid a must rent view or see 1 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
i went to bachi burger on a friends recommendation and was not disappointed 1 
the directing and the cinematography arent quite as good 0 
this short film certainly pulls no punches 0 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
i never come again 0 
the seller is very understanding and patient i would definitely buy from them again 1 
couldnt use the unit with sunglasses not good in texas 0 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
everything about it is just bad 0 
dont buy it 0 
do not purchase this phone 0 
this product is great it makes working a lot easier i can go to the copier while waiting on hold for something 1 
characters are onedimensional even the good guys and especially the bad guys 0 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
good product incredible value 1 
the least said about the acting the better 0 
the malta settings are as dry and as barren as the dialogue 0 
i wish i could return the unit and get back my money 0 
i really hope the team behind this movie makes more movies and that they will continue to do so in their own some kinda weird style 1 
i saw this movie and i thought this is a stupid movie 0 
all in all its an insult to ones intelligence and a huge waste of money 0
