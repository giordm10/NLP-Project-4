the battery is completely useless to me 0 
delicious and i will absolutely be back 1 
and considering the two of us left there very full and happy for about 20 you just cant go wrong 1 
the staff are also very friendly and efficient 1 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
when achille and philippa beautifully sing a duet from don giovanni that perfectly describes their situation in the movie you appreciate the subtle layers of this excellent film 1 
go rent it 1 
i was shocked because no signs indicate cash only 0 
id love to go back 1 
i have had this phone for over a year now and i will tell you its not that great 0 
no plot whatsoever 0 
the results well are a shame 0 
i highly recommend this movie for anyone interested in art poetry theater politics or japanese history 1 
beware this is not a trashy cult movie this is trash period 0 
definitely not worth the 3 i paid 0 
it did not work in my cell phone plug i am very up set with the charger 0 
the food wasnt good 0 
integrated seamlessly with the motorola razr phone 1 
if there were zero stars i would give it zero stars 0 
as i said abovepretty useless 0 
not loud enough and doesnt turn on like it should 0 
the service was poor and thats being nice 0 
in fact its hard to remember that the part of ray charles is being acted and not played by the man himself 1 
love it great armband 1 
delicious 1 
the budget was evidently very limited 0 
the incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film 1 
i wouldnt see this movie again for free 0 
everything was perfect the night we were in 1 
i am pairing this with my iphone and i could not be happier with it so far 1 
in a word it is embarrassing 0 
a lot of websites have been rating this a very good phone and so do i 1 
its been my choice headset for yearsgreat sound good volume good noise cancellation 1 
the bathrooms are clean and the place itself is well decorated 1 
in fact im going to round up to 4 stars just because she was so awesome 1 
seems like a good quick place to grab a bite of some familiar pub food but do yourself a favor and look elsewhere 0 
to be honest with you this is unbelievable nonsense and very foolish 0 
lange had become a great actress 1 
just really good so far probably the best bt headset i have ever had 1 
dont bother coming here 0 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
they never brought a salad we asked for 0 
i dont think ive ever gone to a movie and disliked it as much 0 
the acting is beyond abysmal 0 
i was shocked because no signs indicate cash only 0 
returned 8 hours later 0 
i saw this film over christmas and what a great film it was 1 
gets a signal when other verizon phones wont 1 
the only thing i did like was the prime rib and dessert section 1 
useless phone simply deaf 0 
when my order arrived one of the gyros was missing 0 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
very disappointed in accessoryone 0 
would not go back 0 
i think the most wonderful parts literally full of wonder are the excerpts from his works 1 
very slow at seating even with reservation 0 
saw the movie today and thought it was a good effort good messages for kids 1 
also the fries are without a doubt the worst fries ive ever had 0 
went in for happy hour great list of wines 1 
the sergeant pepper beef sandwich with auju sauce is an excellent sandwich as well 1 
its a shame to see good actors like thomerson and james make a living in a mess like this 0 
great food and awesome service 1 
i also didnt like the on button it felt like it would crack with use 0 
every thing on phone work perfectly she like it 1 
this is a really fantastic thai restaurant which is definitely worth a visit 1 
i have had mine for about a year and this christmas i bought some for the rest of the family 1 
brilliance indeed 1 
terrible my car will not accept this cassette 0 
best breakfast buffet 1 
if you are looking for a good quality motorola headset keep looking this isnt it 0 
what a mistake 0 
it was so boring 0 
the movie was very interesting from beginning to the end 1 
seafood was limited to boiled shrimp and crab legs but the crab legs definitely did not taste fresh 0 
service was exceptional and food was a good as all the reviews 1 
almost all of the songs in cover girl are oldfashioned and not very tuneful 0 
the phone gets extremely hot 0 
im trying to return it for a refund 0 
so just beware 0 
still i do like this movie for its empowerment of women theres not enough movies out there like this one 1 
again no plot at all 0 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
totally believable 1 
the file browser offers all the options that one needshandsfree is great 1 
not easy to watch 0 
the tracfonewebsite is user friendly and makes it easy toactivate etc 1 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
i had high hopes for this place since the burgers are cooked over a charcoal grill but unfortunately the taste fell flat way flat 0 
this short film certainly pulls no punches 0 
dont waste your money 0 
insults profound deuchebaggery and had to go outside for a smoke break while serving just to solidify it 0 
the bose noise cancelling is amazing which is very important for a nyc commuter 1 
that company is a joke 0 
the characters are fleshed out surprisingly well particularly grimes and blake and all the actors deliver their sharply scripted lines with just the right amount of deadpan tongue in cheek to make the dialogue both hilarious and realistic 1 
service was very prompt 1 
love this headset 1 
the aerial scenes were welldone 1 
the portion was huge 1 
for sushi on the strip this is the place to go 1 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
service is perfect and the family atmosphere is nice to see 1 
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1 
the best place to go for a tasty bowl of pho 1 
its the one movie that never ceases to interest me simply because it keeps me alert as i try to attempt to decipher its meanings 1 
im happy about this purchase good quality and low price 1 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
this review is long overdue since i consider a tale of two sisters to be the single greatest film ever made 1 
but kevin spacey is an excellent verbal tsunami as buddy ackerman Â– and totally believable because he is a great actor 1 
the headset fulfills my requirements so i am happy with my purchase 1 
the steaks are all well trimmed and also perfectly cooked 1 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
omg the food was delicioso 1 
the pancake was also really good and pretty large at that 1 
the film deserves strong kudos for taking this stand for having exceptional acting from its mostly lesserknown cast and for the superintelligent script that doesnt insult the audience or take the easy way out when it comes to white racism 1 
weve have gotten a much better service from the pizza place next door than the services we received from this restaurant 0 
the food came out at a good pace 1 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
you have to hold the phone at a particular angle for the other party to hear you clearly 0 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
also makes it easier to hold on to 1 
i give wirefly 1 stari will contact cingularatt and inform them of this practice 0 
this one wants to surf on the small wave of space movies in 1998 deep impact and armageddon and this one fails everywhere 0 
it failed to convey the broad sweep of landscapes that were a great part of the original 0 
it showed exactly how the government and the scientist argued for humanity and the reasons of the gadget 1 
dee snider just plain sucks 0 
the problem was the script 0 
after 3 months screen just went black all of a sudden 0 
this is an unbelievable bargain 1 
perfect for someone me who only likes beer ice cold or in this case even colder 1 
over rated 0 
best tacos in town by far 1 
i checked everywhere and there is no feature for it which is really disappointing 0 
both of them were truly unbelievably good and i am so glad we went back 1 
what should have been a hilarious yummy christmas eve dinner to remember was the biggest fail of the entire trip for us 0 
the structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema 1 
so anyone near you will hear part of your conversation 0 
and i really did find them funny 1 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
it was a pale color instead of nice and char and has no flavor 0 
i will not be eating there again 0 
it will drive you barking mad 0 
not much dialogue not much music the whole film was shot as elaborately and aesthetically like a sculpture 1 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
your servers suck wait correction our server heimer sucked 0 
i have been to very few places to eat that under no circumstances would i ever return to and this tops the list 0 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
you wont forget this movie 1 
motorola finally got the voice quality of a bluetooth headset right 1 
fantastic food 1 
i really liked that 1 
this phone is pretty sturdy and ive never had any large problems with it 1 
the real disappointment was our waiter 0 
the bt headset was such a disapoinment 0 
i didnt realize how wonderful the short really is until the last two scenes 1 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
good protection and does not make phone too bulky 1 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
i particularly remember my senses being assaulted by strident cords of music that would blare out with very little warning and even less meaning 0 
i put the latest os on it v115g and it now likes to slow to a crawl and lock up every once in a while 0 
omg i felt like i had never eaten thai food until this dish 1 
eclectic selection 1 
service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is vegas and located inside the crystals shopping mall by aria 1 
the acting was bad the dialogs were extremely shallow and insincere 0 
food was delicious 1 
the steak and the shrimp are in my opinion the best entrees at gc 1 
were jerks on the phone 0 
ill put this gem up against any movie in terms of screenplay cinematography acting postproduction editing directing or any other aspect of filmmaking 1 
i love this cable it allows me to connect any miniusb device to my pc 1 
dont make the same mistake i did 0 
the meat was pretty dry i had the sliced brisket and pulled pork 0 
which are small and not worth the price 0 
i could not recommend these more 0 
as a sushi lover avoid this place by all means 0 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
youd have to have the iq of particularly stupid mollusk not to see that one coming 0 
fantastic service here 1 
a good film by a great director 1 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
lifetime does not air it enough so if anyone knows what store sells it let me know because this is a musthave 1 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
oh the charger seems to work fine 1 
this product is clearly not ready for prime time i dont care how cool it looks if you cant tell a call is coming in its worthless 0 
as many people complained i found this headsets microphone was very weak 0 
the worst phone ive ever had only had it for a few months 0 
i as well wouldve given godfathers zero stars if possible 0 
the descriptions said yum yum sauce and another said eel sauce yet another said spicy mayowell none of the rolls had sauces on them 0 
i was hoping for more 0 
this case has passed the one year mark and while it shows signs of wear it is 100 functional 1 
i like design and look of jabra behing the ear headsets and 5020 is pretty comfortible to wear 24 hours a day without pain in the ear 1 
it works 1 
it probably would have been better if the director hadnt spent most of the movie showcasing his own art work which really isnt that noteworthy 0 
i recently had problems where i could not stay connected for more than 10 minutes before being disconnected 0 
i work in the hospitality industry in paradise valley and have refrained from recommending cibo any longer 0 
the pizza selections are good 1 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
i went to bachi burger on a friends recommendation and was not disappointed 1 
i cant tell you how disappointed i was 0 
also great directing and photography 1 
not good enough for the price 0 
bad quality 0 
join the club and get awesome offers via email 1 
i like armand assante my cable companys summary sounded interesting so i watched it twice already and probably will again 1 
this is a really fantastic thai restaurant which is definitely worth a visit 1 
my rating just 3 out of 10 0 
it was pretty gross 0 
fits comfortably came with three sizes of earbud tips 1 
i had high hopes for this place since the burgers are cooked over a charcoal grill but unfortunately the taste fell flat way flat 0 
battery life is real good 1 
the charger arrived within the promised timeframe but it did not work 0 
it quit working after id used it for about 18 months so i just purchased another one because this is the best headset ive ever owned 1 
clear crisp sound 1 
constantine gives everything the right intensity and seems to have a good understanding of the underlying psychological motivations 1 
will be back again 1 
i searched the internet and found this one to be the best value 1 
as always the evening was wonderful and the food delicious 1 
i even fully charged it before i went to bed and turned off blue tooth and wifi and noticed that it only had 20 left in the morning 0 
i dont like this nokia either 0 
were jerks on the phone 0 
by the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant i was bored and didnt care what happened next and so i switched off 0 
often the dialogue doesnt really follow from one line to another or fit the surroundings 0 
perfect for someone me who only likes beer ice cold or in this case even colder 1 
the story which was told so eloquently by francis ford coppola 25 years earlier really unfolds gradually and leaves room for the characters to develop 1 
also makes it easier to hold on to 1 
this product is great it makes working a lot easier i can go to the copier while waiting on hold for something 1 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
the cast was great 1 
battery life is real good 1 
i dont think it would hold it too securly on your belt 0 
the steak and the shrimp are in my opinion the best entrees at gc 1 
i checked everywhere and there is no feature for it which is really disappointing 0 
in an interesting part of town this place is amazing 1 
i had strawberry tea which was good 1 
the burger had absolutely no flavor the meat itself was totally bland the burger was overcooked and there was no charcoal flavor 0 
clear crisp sound 1 
i dont know what the big deal is about this place but i wont be back yaall 0 
tried to go here for lunch and it was a madhouse 0 
poor reliability 0 
the service was outshining i definitely recommend the halibut 1 
love this place hits the spot when i want something healthy but not lacking in quantity or flavor 1 
will definitely be back 1 
its a feelgood film and thats how i felt when i came out of the cinema 1 
terrible my car will not accept this cassette 0 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
avoid this establishment 0 
highly unrecommended 0 
it finds my cell phone right away when i enter the car 1 
everything on the menu is terrific and we were also thrilled that they made amazing accommodations for our vegetarian daughter 1 
dont bother coming here 0 
the plantains were the worst ive ever tasted 0 
even in my bmw 3 series which is fairly quiet i have trouble hearing what the other person is saying 0 
the holster that arrived did not match the photo in the ad 0 
horrible phone 0 
i exchanged the sony ericson z500a for this and im pretty happy with that decision 1 
a must study for anyone interested in the worst sins of industrial design 0 
cant upload ringtones from a third party 0 
very disappointing 0 
its pretty surprising that this wonderful film was made in 1949 as hollywood generally had its collective heads in the sand concerning black and white issues at that time 1 
his performance is simply genius 1 
but this movie really got to me 1 
great it was new packaged nice works good no problems and it came in less time then i expected 1 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
it didnt make me scared horrified or make me sympathetic towards the characters it was simply annoying 0 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
the story starts too fast with absolutely no suspense or buildup in the slightest 0 
wonderful lil tapas and the ambience made me feel all warm and fuzzy inside 1 
all in all i think it was a good investment 1 
it is well made easy to access the phone and has a handy detachable belt clip 1 
1 hour 54 minutes of sheer tedium melodrama and horrible acting a mess of a script and a sinking feeling of good lord what were they thinking 0 
alexander nevsky is a great film 1 
very much disappointed with this company 0 
theres barely a boring moment in the film and there are plenty of humorous parts 1 
service was good and the company was better 1 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
this results in the phone being either stuck at max volume or mute 0 
hot dishes are not hot cold dishes are close to room tempi watched staff prepare food with bare hands no gloveseverything is deep fried in oil 0 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
cant upload ringtones from a third party 0 
in the summer you can dine in a charming outdoor patio so very delightful 1 
att is not clear sound is very distorted and you have to yell when you talk 0 
there was no chemistry between ben affleck and sandra bullock in this film and i couldnt understand why he would consider even leaving his wifetobe for this chick that he supposedly was knocked out by 0 
it has a very good plot it holds your complete attention the acting is superb tom wilkinson was fantastic and emily watson was also very good 1 
iam very pleased with my purchase 1 
so they performed 1 
the plot such as it is is so derivative and predictable that the ending is like a mercy killing 0 
the buttons for on and off are bad 0 
the movie is terribly boring in places 0 
i am sorry i made this purchase 0 
couldnt ask for a more satisfying meal 1 
what makes this story different are the terrific production values faultless photography composition and editing the terrific casting the underappreciated brian keith playing a bully teddy and vivid history 1 
a must study for anyone interested in the worst sins of industrial design 0 
id love to go back 1 
i know that sounds funny but to me it seemed like sketchy technology that wouldnt work wellwell this one works great 1 
the transfers are very good 1 
also the story and acting were weak 0 
definitely worth checking out 1 
ive missed numerous calls because of this reason 0 
special mention should be made of the superb music score and sound effects which are an integral element in helping to make this such a memorable and enjoyable cartoon 1 
however after finally watching this film i realized that not only had i had a closed mind to the brilliance it depicts i also found myself watching it over and over again 1 
the sweet potato fries were very good and seasoned well 1 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
this is one of peter watkins most accessible films 1 
the price is reasonable and the service is great 1 
service is friendly and inviting 1 
ive never been more insulted or felt disrespected 0 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
simple lightweight and great fit 1 
this case has passed the one year mark and while it shows signs of wear it is 100 functional 1 
howeverthe riingtones are not the best and neither are the games 0 
after one bite i was hooked 1 
very disappointing 0 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
their daily specials are always a hit with my group 1 
its been my choice headset for yearsgreat sound good volume good noise cancellation 1 
frankly after cotton club and unfaithful it was kind of embarrassing to watch lane and gere in this film because it is bad 0 
but it does get better reception and clarity than any phone ive had before 1 
the staff are also very friendly and efficient 1 
i would have given no star if i was able 0 
thus far have only visited twice and the food was absolutely delicious each time 1 
unfortunately the ability to actually know you are receiving a call is a rather important feature and this phone is pitiful in that respect 0 
frozen pucks of disgust with some of the worst people behind the register 0 
i ordered albondigas soup which was just warm and tasted like tomato soup with frozen meatballs 0 
every element of this story was so over the top excessively phony and contrived that it was painful to sit through 0 
i was very pleased to see that i could replace my well travled swivel holster for my blackberry flip 1 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
with great sound effects and impressive special effects i cant recommend this movie enough 1 
attempting artiness with black white and clever camera angles the movie disappointed became even more ridiculous as the acting was poor and the plot and lines almost nonexistent 0 
john wayne did an incredible job for being so young in the movie industry 1 
this company charge me a restocking fee and still not given me my refund back 0 
for people who are first timers in film making i think they did an excellent job 1 
i might have gotten a defect but i would not risk buying it again because of the built quality alone 0 
each track commands sentiment actually contributing to the scenes and characters 1 
when im on this side of town this will definitely be a spot ill hit up again 1 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
theres also enough hypocrisy in this film to make me vomit 0 
one nice thing was that they added gratuity on the bill since our party was larger than 6 or 8 and they didnt expect more tip than that 1 
aside from its terrible lead this film has loads of other debits 0 
a world better than 95 of the garbage in the theatres today 1 
but other than that the movie seemed to drag and the heroes didnt really work for their freedom 0 
the plug did not work very well 0 
great case and price 1 
the server was very negligent of our needs and made us feel very unwelcome i would not suggest this place 0 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
not too screamy not to masculine but just right 1 
best of all is the rotating feature very helpful 1 
none of it works just dont buy it 0 
what a waste 0 
the selection on the menu was great and so were the prices 1 
for a product that costs as much as this one does i expect it to work far better and with greater ease than this thing does 0 
avoid avoid avoid 0 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
the acting sucks the music sucks the script sucks the pacing sucks the special fx suck the directing sucks basically this movie sucks 0 
editing the editing of this film was phenomenal in my opinion 1 
i recently had problems where i could not stay connected for more than 10 minutes before being disconnected 0 
wow very spicy but delicious 1 
but it picked up speed and got right to the point 1 
what a piece of junk i lose more calls on this phone 0 
babie bop is very cute 1 
i like armand assante my cable companys summary sounded interesting so i watched it twice already and probably will again 1 
i love my 350 headset my jabra350 bluetooth headset is great the reception is very good and the ear piece is a comfortable fit 1 
i really liked that 1 
i never come again 0 
it defeats the purpose of a bluetooth headset 0 
lame would be the best way to describe it 0 
but in terms of the writing its very fresh and bold 1 
if you want a real scare rent this one 1 
i can take a little bad service but the food sucks 0 
yes this film does require a rather significant amount of puzzlesolving but the pieces fit together to create a beautiful picture 1 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
seriously killer hot chai latte 1 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
it was so cool 1 
summary the witticisms werent witty 0 
i immediately said i wanted to talk to the manager but i did not want to talk to the guy who was doing shots of fireball behind the bar 0 
cant say enough good things about this place 1 
then our food came out disappointment ensued 0 
things that went wrong they burned the saganaki 0 
the chicken dishes are ok the beef is like shoe leather 0 
doesnt last long 0 
then i had to continue pairing it periodically since it somehow kept dropping 0 
i could not recommend these more 0 
i love being able to use one headset for both by landline and cell 1 
it makes very strange ticking noises before it ends the call 0 
there are so many problems i dont know where to start 0 
and those baby owls were adorable 1 
think it over when you plan to own this onethis sure is the last moto phone for me 0 
this place deserves no stars 0 
you share general loewenhielms exquisite joy in his partaking of the cailles en sarcophage even though you are just watching a movie but you do wish for just a small sample to savor 1 
this is a disgrace 0 
pretty cool i would say 1 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
i wouldnt see this movie again for free 0 
it was either too cold not enough flavor or just bad 0 
highly unrecommended 0 
not too screamy not to masculine but just right 1 
i purchased this and within 2 days it was no longer working 0 
all in all i can assure you ill be back 1 
their daily specials are always a hit with my group 1 
the sound quality is good and functionality is awesome 1 
it looked like a wonderful story 1 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
reversible plug works great 1 
great it was new packaged nice works good no problems and it came in less time then i expected 1 
its a gloriously fun fast paced and fairly accurate portrayal of the night of a raver 1 
sooooo good 1 
for those that havent seen it dont waste your time 0 
an amazing finale to possibly the best trilogy of all time 1 
i purcashed this for the car charger and it does not work 0 
overall a delight 1 
i thoroughly enjoyed it when christopher eccleston took control of the tardis and the continuation of the series 1 
its not hard to make a decent hamburger 0 
yet i enjoy watching it 1 
not a good bargain 0 
it finds my cell phone right away when i enter the car 1 
car charger as well as ac charger are included to make sure you never run out of juicehighy recommended 1 
i felt asleep the first time i watched it so i can recommend it for insomniacs 0 
the atmosphere was great with a lovely duo of violinists playing songs we requested 1 
also great directing and photography 1 
have been going since 2007 and every meal has been awesome 1 
very very sad 0 
nice leather 1 
after two i felt disgusting 0 
warning do not buy 0 
this is probably one of the least effective and utterly unoriginal films i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
it has all the features i want 1 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
poor sound quality 0 
mobile phone tools are a must have 1 
so anyone near you will hear part of your conversation 0 
it never condescends all the characters have good genuine hearts and believable problems 1 
no additional ear gels provided and no instructions whatsoever 0 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
i would recommend it 1 
we are so glad we found this place 1 
the cg opening sequence in space looked like it could have been created on microsoft slideshow for gods sake 0 
you cant beat that 1 
reasonably priced also 1 
i wouldnt return 0 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
howeverthe riingtones are not the best and neither are the games 0 
dessert panna cotta was amazing 1 
it was quite comfortable in the ear 1 
very cheap plastic creaks like an old wooden floor 0 
this movie is greatespecially if you enjoy visual arts 1 
unfortunately the ability to actually know you are receiving a call is a rather important feature and this phone is pitiful in that respect 0 
overall i am psyched to have a phone which has all my appointments and contacts in and gets great reception 1 
the food amazing 1 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
his costars dont fare much better with people like morgan freeman jonah hill and ed helms just wasted 0 
they were goldencrispy and delicious 1 
only pros large seating area nice bar area great simple drink menu the best brick oven pizza with homemade dough 1 
its fits like a glove and is strong secure and durable 1 
seriously flavorful delights folks 1 
will not be back 0 
would come back again if i had a sushi craving while in vegas 1 
unfortunately it was not good 0 
you cant beat that 1 
the poor actors 0 
the majority of the logitech earbud headsets failed 0 
the attempts at humor were pitiful and story is so awful it dosent bear thinking about which basically involves a vulcan stealing the enterprise to find god seriously i just didnt care about any of this film and oh not to mention uhura does a belly dance to distract male guards 0 
magical help 1 
for that its worth checking out 1 
much better than the other ayce sushi place i went to in vegas 1 
a good commentary of todays love and undoubtedly a film worth seeing 1 
i will never go back to this place and will never ever recommended this place to anyone 0 
there were several moments in the movie that just didnt need to be there and were excruciatingly slow moving 0 
the camera really likes her in this movie 1 
i own a jabra earset and was very happy with it but the sound quality especially outgoing on this is better 1 
sounds good reasonably priced and effective its that simple 1 
never heard of any of them except cole who was totally unbelievable in the part 0 
performed awful muffled tinny incoming sound and severe echo for those on the other end of the call 0 
i will never forget it now 1 
after the disappointing dinner we went elsewhere for dessert 0 
overall i like there food and the service 1 
ive dropped my phone more times than i can say even on concrete and my phone is still great knock on wood 1 
the food is not tasty at all not to say its real traditional hunan style 0 
who in their right mind is gonna buy this battery 0 
this is a great phone 1 
the characters are interesting even if a bit predictable 1 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
spoilers whatever else can or cant be said about it surface is superbly crafted 1 
brilliant 1 
low quality 0 
woa talk about awful 0 
wont work right or atleast for me 0 
i wasnt expecting oscar material but this 0 
fantastic service here 1 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
but its just not funny 0 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
this film has no redeeming features 0 
i contacted the company and they told me that although the unit was still under warranty if i couldnt produce my receipt i was out of luck 0 
i hate those things as much as cheap quality black olives 0 
started watching this but didnt believe in any of the characters 0 
not recommended 0 
i left the theater with a lilt in my step joy in my heart and hope for the human race 1 
but even the talented carrell cant save this 0 
i believe every one should see this movie as i think few people outside of south africa understand its past and what is being attempted in the truth and reconciliation process 1 
looks great and is strong 1 
highly recommended for all ages although the younger set will probably not appreciate some of the more subtle references they will certainly appreciate one galley scene in particular 1 
the owners are super friendly and the staff is courteous 1 
the food wasnt good 0 
i live in the neighborhood so i am disappointed i wont be back here because it is a convenient location 0 
not tasty and the texture was just nasty 0 
really bad 0 
cant say enough good things about this place 1 
that said our mouths and bellies were still quite pleased 1 
very good food great atmosphere1 1 
not only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic but it also managed to give away the entire movie and im not exaggerating every moment every plot point every joke is told in the trailer 0 
worst martini ever 0 
just really good so far probably the best bt headset i have ever had 1 
i wear glasses and it fits fine with them 1 
the first thing that happened was that the tracking was off 0 
excellent product 1 
if you have several dozen or several hundred contacts then imagine the fun of sending each of them one by one 0 
a very very very slowmoving aimless movie about a distressed drifting young man 0 
however the ear pads come off easily and after only one week i lost one 0 
not much flavor to them and very poorly constructed 0 
food is way overpriced and portions are fucking small 0 
we watched our waiter pay a lot more attention to other tables and ignore us 0 
i saw this film over christmas and what a great film it was 1 
it fits my ear well and is comfortable on 1 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
if you do watch it however there are small consolations the actresses playing annes sisters each do a wonderful job with their roles 1 
kids pizza is always a hit too with lots of great side dish options for the kiddos 1 
its kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly its embarrassing how childlike the company is 0 
this is one of the best italian thrillers of the early 70s 1 
they could be used as exemplars for any set designer 1 
fast service 1 
as for the service i thought it was good 1 
the speaker is of low quality so as making the ring tones sound very cheap 0 
these are the central themes of the film and they are handled ineptly stereotypically and with no depth of imagination 0 
poor construction 0 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
the tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu 0 
sam shepards portrayal of a gung ho marine was sobering 1 
summary the witticisms werent witty 0 
it works 1 
i would recommend it 1 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
were jerks on the phone 0 
hot dishes are not hot cold dishes are close to room tempi watched staff prepare food with bare hands no gloveseverything is deep fried in oil 0 
the seasonal fruit was fresh white peach puree 1 
it has kept up very well 1 
you cant beat the price on these 1 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
ive had better not only from dedicated boba tea spots but even from jenni pho 0 
beware this is not a trashy cult movie this is trash period 0 
i love this cable it allows me to connect any miniusb device to my pc 1 
weve tried to like this place but after 10 times i think were done with them 0 
the biggest complaint i have is the battery drains superfast 0 
waitress was a little slow in service 0 
the story which was told so eloquently by francis ford coppola 25 years earlier really unfolds gradually and leaves room for the characters to develop 1 
there is nothing authentic about this place 0 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
elias koteasjack palance play good roles angelina is hot and gets nakedbilly drago appears in this and is cool as usual a cameo by sven ole thorsen helps make this a very enjoyable movie with good acting and a decent budget 1 
i think i was one of the people who found this another one of roths pearls 1 
waste of money 0 
i wouldnt return 0 
i checked everywhere and there is no feature for it which is really disappointing 0 
kind of flops around 0 
good value great food great service 1 
after the first charge kept going dead after 12 minutes 0 
you wont be disappointed 1 
in fact im going to round up to 4 stars just because she was so awesome 1 
save your money ive had this item for 11 months now 0 
delicious and i will absolutely be back 1 
what a mistake 0 
this film offers many delights and surprises 1 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
they do not last forever but is not overly expensive to replaceeasy to operate and the sound is much better than others i have tried 1 
ive seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie 0 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
macbeth jason connery moved me to tears with his final monolog out brief candle outhe gave the sphere of moral decay and dark forces a human face which makes it the more interesting 1 
the ri style calamari was a joke 0 
artless camerawork endlessly presents us with the ugliest setting imaginable ie 0 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
the point is the journey a journey that touches every member of the family 1 
you have to hold the phone at a particular angle for the other party to hear you clearly 0 
im really disappointed all i have now is a charger that doesnt work 0 
the sound quality is good and functionality is awesome 1 
im really disappointed all i have now is a charger that doesnt work 0 
i did not expect this to be so good 1 
i consider this theft 0 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
an instant classic with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits 1 
very slow at seating even with reservation 0 
this movie is so awesome 1 
the only consistent thread holding the series together were the amazing performances of leni parker and anita laselva as the two taelons in quiet idealogical conflict 0 
nargile i think you are great 1 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
the only downside is the service 0 
a film not easily forgotten 1 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
i hate to disagree with my fellow yelpers but my husband and i were so disappointed with this place 0 
in summary this was a largely disappointing dining experience 0 
this place is great 1 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
considering the relations off screen between taylor and stanwyck it was surprising how little chemistry there was on screen between the two of them 0 
at a time when it seems that film animation has been dominated by disneypixars cgi masterpieces it is both refreshing and comforting to know that miyazaki is still relying on traditional handdrawn animation to tell his charming and enchanting stories 1 
were jerks on the phone 0 
save your money ive had this item for 11 months now 0 
it has everything i need and i couldnt ask for more 1 
for the price on amazon it is an excellent product which i would highly recommend 1 
there is nothing privileged about workingeating there 0 
the cocktails are all handmade and delicious 1 
there is nothing privileged about workingeating there 0 
it was horrendous 0 
at least think to refill my water before i struggle to wave you over for 10 minutes 0 
this is a witty and delightful adaptation of the dr seuss book brilliantly animated by upas finest and thoroughly deserving of its academy award 1 
the movie has almost no action scenes in it and very little comedy 0 
wonderful lil tapas and the ambience made me feel all warm and fuzzy inside 1 
there is a totally unnecessary trainroller coaster scene 0 
in the span of an hour i had two people exclaim whoa is that the new phone on tv 1 
i am pairing this with my iphone and i could not be happier with it so far 1 
i think that it is a must see older john wayne film 1 
all in all a great disappointment 0 
it was horrendous 0 
it was a very superficial movie and it gave me the feeling that i was watching play rather than a film 0 
overall i was not impressed and would not go back 0 
to call this movie a drama is ridiculous 0 
i work in the hospitality industry in paradise valley and have refrained from recommending cibo any longer 0 
these were so good we ordered them twice 1 
you wont be disappointed 1 
it is light has plenty of battery capacity and is very confortable to wear for somewhat extended periods of time 1 
the dialogue is composed of things that make little sense 0 
im big fan of rpg games too but this movie its a disgrace to any selfrespecting rpger there is 0 
his use of the colours of the french flag in the three films was nothing short of incredible every shot every scene was like a work of art 1 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
they could be used as exemplars for any set designer 1 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
price is good too 1 
disappointed 0 
worst customer service ever 0 
overall i like there food and the service 1 
my drink was never empty and he made some really great menu suggestions 1 
the directing seems too pretentious 0 
try them in the airport to experience some tasty food and speedy friendly service 1 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
at a time when it seems that film animation has been dominated by disneypixars cgi masterpieces it is both refreshing and comforting to know that miyazaki is still relying on traditional handdrawn animation to tell his charming and enchanting stories 1 
very good stuff for the price 1 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
there is really nothing for me at postinos hope your experience is better 0 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
does everything it should and more 1 
lot of holes in the plot theres nothing about how he became the emperor nothing about where he spend 20 years between his childhood and mature age 0
