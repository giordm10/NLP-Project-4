for the price on amazon it is an excellent product which i would highly recommend 1 
the transfers are very good 1 
camera color balance is awful 0 
i have tried these cables with my computer and my ipod and it works just fine 1 
your servers suck wait correction our server heimer sucked 0 
problem is that the ear loops are made of weak material and break easily 0 
an amazing finale to possibly the best trilogy of all time 1 
we also ordered the spinach and avocado salad the ingredients were sad and the dressing literally had zero taste 0 
the only thing really worth watching was the scenery and the house because it is beautiful 1 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
great case and price 1 
host staff were for lack of a better word bitches 0 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
do not buy if you want to use the holster 0 
i would have given no star if i was able 0 
worst service to boot but that is the least of their worries 0 
i believe the screenwriter did a good job of tying up the loose ends 1 
but storm trooper is not even bad enough to make it to the list of wonderfully terrible movies 0 
my husband and i ate lunch here and were very disappointed with the food and service 0 
they refuse to refund or replace 0 
this is definitely a cult classic well worth viewing and sharing with others 1 
i was able to do voice dialing in the car with no problem 1 
works fine 1 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
i have had mine for about a year and this christmas i bought some for the rest of the family 1 
very very sad 0 
because both ears are occupied background is not distracting at all 1 
car charger as well as ac charger are included to make sure you never run out of juicehighy recommended 1 
disappointment i hate anything that goes in my ear 0 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
even when the women finally show up there is no sign of improvement the most expected things happen and by the time the film is over you might be far asleep 0 
looks great and is strong 1 
it also took her forever to bring us the check when we asked for it 0 
the soundtrack sucked 0 
his losing his marbles so early in the proceedings is totally implausible and unconvincing 0 
i loved their mussels cooked in this wine reduction the duck was tender and their potato dishes were delicious 1 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
hackneyed writing certainly but made even worse by the bad directing 0 
razr battery good buy 1 
cant get the software to work with my computer 0 
the movie seemed a little slow at first 0 
the acting was decidely wooden though no worse than a period universal b movie 0 
clear crisp sound 1 
the movie is littered with overt racial slurs towards the black cast members and in return the whites are depicted as morons and boobs 0 
i had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get some relief 0 
if there was ever a movie that needed wordofmouth to promote this is it 1 
in summary this was a largely disappointing dining experience 0 
they have a plethora of salads and sandwiches and everything ive tried gets my seal of approval 1 
maybe its just their vegetarian fare but ive been twice and i thought it was average at best 0 
my drink was never empty and he made some really great menu suggestions 1 
if i take a picture the battery drops a bar and starts beeping letting me know its dieing 0 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
the ambience is wonderful and there is music playing 1 
i purchased this and within 2 days it was no longer working 0 
the best electronics of the available fm transmitters 1 
worse theres an incredibly weak subplot thrown in that follows a little band of latterday mansonites as they go after a reporter whos working on a story on the anniversary of the killings 0 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
why are these sad little vegetables so overcooked 0 
personally i think it shows that people should learn to find a compromise them self without involving other people into issue 1 
this is probably the most irritating show i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
a good time 1 
very convenient since we were staying at the mgm 1 
highly unprofessional and rude to a loyal patron 0 
probably never coming back and wouldnt recommend it 0 
you get incredibly fresh fish prepared with care 1 
i will come back here every time im in vegas 1 
a very very very slowmoving aimless movie about a distressed drifting young man 0 
worst customer service ever 0 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
the service was poor and thats being nice 0 
terrible phone holder 0 
i would have given no star if i was able 0 
at a time when it seems that film animation has been dominated by disneypixars cgi masterpieces it is both refreshing and comforting to know that miyazaki is still relying on traditional handdrawn animation to tell his charming and enchanting stories 1 
very true to shakespear and a must for all shakespear fans 1 
it is a really good show to watch 1 
i love their fries and their beans 1 
it does everything the description said it would 1 
car charger as well as ac charger are included to make sure you never run out of juicehighy recommended 1 
i just cant explain this movie more than romanticcharminghilariousand adorablethe junkyard scenes are funnyall the junkyard dogs have something specialtoo funny i laughedkids will love itbuy it when it comes outit has new features 1 
i kept catching the cable on the seat and i had to pull the phone out to turn it on an off 0 
now we were chosen to be tortured with this disgusting piece of blatant american propaganda 0 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
this movie totally grates on my nerves 0 
the story is also both funny and poignant at times 1 
even the squibs look awful 0 
it was a drive to get there 0 
actually the graphics were good at the time 1 
great charger 1 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
this review is long overdue since i consider a tale of two sisters to be the single greatest film ever made 1 
my fiancé and i came in the middle of the day and we were greeted and seated right away 1 
the nokia ca42 usb cable did not work with my phone 0 
sam shepards portrayal of a gung ho marine was sobering 1 
rating 1 out of 10 0 
i was very pleased to see that i could replace my well travled swivel holster for my blackberry flip 1 
i will not return 0 
this hole in the wall has great mexican street tacos and friendly staff 1 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
this is one of the worst sandra bullock movie since speed 2 but not quite that bad 0 
i had strawberry tea which was good 1 
i cant wait to go back 1 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
down the drain because of a weak snap 0 
this is not moviemaking 0 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
it has northern humour and positive about the community it represents 1 
the buttons for on and off are bad 0 
it rocked my world and is certainly a must see for anyone with no social or physical outlets 1 
nicest chinese restaurant ive been in a while 1 
elias koteasjack palance play good roles angelina is hot and gets nakedbilly drago appears in this and is cool as usual a cameo by sven ole thorsen helps make this a very enjoyable movie with good acting and a decent budget 1 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
ps the only scene in the movie that was cool is when the central character finds her room blown up 1 
for those that havent seen it dont waste your time 0 
this place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver 0 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
youll love it 1 
looks great and is strong 1 
regrettably the film fails 0 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
as for the killer dont expect anything original or even remotely frightening 0 
they refuse to refund or replace 0 
weve tried to like this place but after 10 times i think were done with them 0 
the cast was great 1 
however after seeing the short again after about 25 years i was amazed at how timeless the film actually is 1 
very good though 1 
lovely little thriller from hitchcock with lots of nice shenanigans surrounding a murdered spy a kidnapped child a nasty church a foreign plot and some random taxidermists 1 
nevertheless yet another wonderful film from the great masters stable 1 
nice leather 1 
good product incredible value 1 
i would not recommend this place 0 
the decor is nice and the piano music soundtrack is pleasant 1 
unfortunately it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees 0 
this item is great installed it let it charged up overnite and it has been working good every since with no problems 1 
perhaps my phone is defective but people cannot hear me when i use this 0 
then scene where they debated whether or not to sack the trumpeter who falsely was accused for the murder is pure horror really stupid 0 
special thanks to dylan t for the recommendation on what to order all yummy for my tummy 1 
the food was terrible 0 
i cannot make calls at certain places 0 
very tough and very short on flavor 0 
and the rest of it just sits there being awful with soldiers singing songs about the masculinity they pledge themselves to hairsplitting about purity the admiration of swords etc 0 
i found this move beautiful enjoyable and uplifting 1 
at no point in the proceedings does it look remotely like america 0 
i know he was a contract player with little control over his scripts but the acting was as bad as the script 0 
the movie was so boring that i sometimes found myself occupied peaking in the paper instead of watching never happened during a columbo movie before 0 
it is not good 0 
needless to say we will never be back here again 0 
damian is so talented and versatile in so many ways of writing and portraying different characters on screen 1 
i dont think you will be disappointed 1 
i promise they wont disappoint 1 
four stars for the food the guy in the blue shirt for his great vibe still letting us in to eat 1 
to those who find this movie intelligent or even masterful i can only say its your intelligence and your imagination you obviously used to try and make some sense of this pitiful attempt its in our human nature to try and make sense of things 0 
anyway the plot flowed smoothly and the malebonding scenes were a hoot 1 
cant get the software to work with my computer 0 
i was very excited to get this headset because i thought it was really cute 1 
so dont go there if you are looking for good food 0 
it makes very strange ticking noises before it ends the call 0 
the mic there is a joke and the volume is quite low 0 
i guess i liked the details of his dysfunctionhe was believable 1 
the veggitarian platter is out of this world 1 
however this didnt make up for the fact that overall this was a tremendously boring movie 0 
i own a jabra earset and was very happy with it but the sound quality especially outgoing on this is better 1 
when it opens the battery connection is broken and the device is turned off 0 
also the phone doesnt seem to accept anything except cbr mp3s preferably ripped by windows media player 0 
i left with a stomach ache and felt sick the rest of the day 0 
simply beautiful 1 
what a waste of time 0 
not a good item it worked for a while then started having problems in my auto reverse tape player 0 
poor reliability 0 
does not work for listening to music with the cingular 8125 0 
the service was poor and thats being nice 0 
awful 0 
constantine gives everything the right intensity and seems to have a good understanding of the underlying psychological motivations 1 
i have two more years left in this contract and i hate this phone 0 
wonderful lil tapas and the ambience made me feel all warm and fuzzy inside 1 
not even good for camp value 0 
the place was fairly clean but the food simply wasnt worth it 0 
echo problemvery unsatisfactory 0 
wont work right or atleast for me 0 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
awesome device 1 
plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job 1 
these are fabulous 1 
poor voice clarity 0 
great phone 1 
worse theres an incredibly weak subplot thrown in that follows a little band of latterday mansonites as they go after a reporter whos working on a story on the anniversary of the killings 0 
updatewent back for a second time and it was still just as amazing 1 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
i never come again 0 
overall i wasnt very impressed with noca 0 
john garfield ann revere lilli plmer william conrad canada leeand filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screenjames wong howe 1 
perfect for someone me who only likes beer ice cold or in this case even colder 1 
the characters are interesting even if a bit predictable 1 
do not purchase this phone 0 
i totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is 1 
nothing new there 0 
utter crap sound quality is terrible 0 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
i had the chicken pho and it tasted very bland 0 
the service was poor and thats being nice 0 
works great when my cat attacked the phone he scratched the protective strip instead of destroying the screen 1 
the movie showed a lot of florida at its best made it look very appealing 1 
110 and only because there is no setting for 010 0 
i recently tried caballeros and i have been back every week since 1 
i searched the internet and found this one to be the best value 1 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
it does everything the description said it would 1 
and i just love the colors 1 
it is shameful 0 
i saw this film over christmas and what a great film it was 1 
cumbersome design 0 
i gave it a 10 1 
i thought it was bad 0 
the sides are delish mixed mushrooms yukon gold puree white corn beateous 1 
its very attractive and appears to be of good quality 1 
truly awful 0 
the food is about on par with dennys which is to say not good at all 0 
but now that it is out of warranty the same problems reoccurebottom line put your money somewhere else cingular will not support it 0 
when my order arrived one of the gyros was missing 0 
often the dialogue doesnt really follow from one line to another or fit the surroundings 0 
food was good service was good prices were good 1 
seriously flavorful delights folks 1 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
it feels poorly constructed the menus are difficult to navigate and the buttons are so recessed that it is difficult to push them 0 
it failed to convey the broad sweep of landscapes that were a great part of the original 0 
but storm trooper is not even bad enough to make it to the list of wonderfully terrible movies 0 
im probably one of the few people to ever go to ians and not like it 0 
phenomenal food service and ambiance 1 
bought mainly for the charger which broke soon after purchasing 0 
i have read others reviews here but i havent had any problem with it 1 
they have horrible attitudes towards customers and talk down to each one when customers dont enjoy their food 0 
not much dialogue not much music the whole film was shot as elaborately and aesthetically like a sculpture 1 
the sweet potato fries were very good and seasoned well 1 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
i am a fan of his this movie sucked really bad 0 
and i just love the colors 1 
id say that would be the hardest decision honestly all of ms dishes taste how they are supposed to taste amazing 1 
if you plan to use this in a car forget about it 0 
in fact im going to round up to 4 stars just because she was so awesome 1 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
i was particularly pleased with the acting ability of dwight schultz 1 
actually the graphics were good at the time 1 
doesnt work 0 
perhaps my phone is defective but people cannot hear me when i use this 0 
worst thai ever 0 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
after the first charge kept going dead after 12 minutes 0 
if there is a wind it is completely useless 0 
graphics is far from the best part of the game 0 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
but this movie really got to me 1 
food quality has been horrible 0 
hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in 0 
would recommend this item 1 
the best place to go for a tasty bowl of pho 1 
the script is was there a script 0 
after my phone got to be about a year old its been slowly breaking despite much care on my part 0 
it fits so securely that the ear hook does not even need to be used and the sound is better directed through your ear canal 1 
while you dont yet hear mickey speak there are tons of sound effects and music throughout the filmsomething we take for granted now but which was a huge crowd pleaser in 1928 1 
i will not return 0 
avoid at any and all costs 0 
service is perfect and the family atmosphere is nice to see 1 
it is easy to turn on and off when you are in the car and the volume controls are quite accessable 1 
works like a charm it work the same as the one i got with the phone 1 
nobody identifies with these characters because theyre all cardboard cutouts and stereotypes or predictably reversestereotypes 0 
this place deserves one star and 90 has to do with the food 0 
blue ant is easy to use 1 
the speaker is of low quality so as making the ring tones sound very cheap 0 
i just cant explain this movie more than romanticcharminghilariousand adorablethe junkyard scenes are funnyall the junkyard dogs have something specialtoo funny i laughedkids will love itbuy it when it comes outit has new features 1 
it seems completely secure both holding on to my belt and keeping the iphone inside 1 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
it was delicious 1 
sauce was tasteless 0 
it dit not work most of the time with my nokia 5320 0 
maybe there would be a reasonable explanation for this atrocity 0 
unfortunately the ability to actually know you are receiving a call is a rather important feature and this phone is pitiful in that respect 0 
this is a witty and delightful adaptation of the dr seuss book brilliantly animated by upas finest and thoroughly deserving of its academy award 1 
the ending is so so perfect youll shed a tear 1 
as an earlier review noted plug in this charger and nothing happens 0 
not a good item it worked for a while then started having problems in my auto reverse tape player 0 
my ribeye steak was cooked perfectly and had great mesquite flavor 1 
when my order arrived one of the gyros was missing 0 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
meredith m was better than all right 1 
using all earpieces left or right this thing will not stay on my ear 0 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
i had the mac salad and it was pretty bland so i will not be getting that again 0 
i vomited in the bathroom mid lunch 0 
best tater tots in the southwest 1 
service is friendly and inviting 1 
i got to enjoy the seafood salad with a fabulous vinegrette 1 
this is one of the best movies out there that shows such strong sibling bond for each other 1 
it worked very well 1 
wont ever go here again 0 
one character is totally annoying with a voice that gives me the feeling of fingernails on a chalkboard 0 
its pretty easy 1 
i really do recommend this place you can go wrong with this donut place 1 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
in the summer you can dine in a charming outdoor patio so very delightful 1 
but now that it is out of warranty the same problems reoccurebottom line put your money somewhere else cingular will not support it 0 
you cant beat that 1 
i mean really how do you get so famous for your fish and chips when its so terrible 0 
i especially love the long battery life 1 
this is a bad film with bad writing and good actorsan ugly cartoon crafted by paul haggis for people who cant handle anything but the bold strokes in storytellinga picture painted with crayons 0 
awful service 0 
love this place hits the spot when i want something healthy but not lacking in quantity or flavor 1 
i believe that pitch black was done well 1 
after watching this film i wanted to learn more about the works of this artist 1 
no shifting no bubbling no peeling not even a scratch nothingi couldnt be more happier with my new one for the droid 1 
brilliant 1 
hot dishes are not hot cold dishes are close to room tempi watched staff prepare food with bare hands no gloveseverything is deep fried in oil 0 
would recommend this item 1 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
the charger worked for about a week and then completely stopped charging my phone 0 
after charging overnight these batteries work great 1 
we ordered some old classics and some new dishes after going there a few times and were sorely disappointed with everything 0 
an hour seriously 0 
this is such a fun and funny movie 1 
love the margaritas too 1 
what the hell kind of crap is that 0 
does not work for listening to music with the cingular 8125 0 
it shouldnt take 30 min for pancakes and eggs 0 
the best electronics of the available fm transmitters 1 
the puppets look really cheesy not in a good way like in the puppet master 80s flicks 0 
we sat another ten minutes and finally gave up and left 0 
it doesnt make you look cool 0 
their daily specials are always a hit with my group 1 
he is an amazing film artist one of the most important whoever lived 1 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
the phone crashed completely and now i have to get it replaced 0 
if you want a real scare rent this one 1 
oh the charger seems to work fine 1 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
waste of money 0 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
its too bad the food is so damn generic 0 
nice quality build unlike some cheap s out there 1 
the very idea of it was lame take a minor character from a mediocre pg13 film and make a complete nonsequel while changing its tone to a pgrated family movie 0 
i wont be back 0 
very displeased 0 
if you look for authentic thai food go else where 0 
i recommend igo to anyone with different brand cell phonesmp3 players in the family 1 
20th century foxs road house 1948 is not only quite a silly noir but is an implausible unmitigated bore of a movie 0 
i was bored throughout the whole damn thing 0 
a world better than 95 of the garbage in the theatres today 1 
the characters are interesting even if a bit predictable 1 
we waited for forty five minutes in vain 0 
this really is how vegas fine dining used to be right down to the menus handed to the ladies that have no prices listed 1 
enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film 1 
great choice 1 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
eew this location needs a complete overhaul 0 
the music in the film is really nice too 1 
delicious and i will absolutely be back 1 
the scenes with the ohsomature neighbourgirl are a misplace 0 
amazon sucks 0 
id love to go back 1 
either way it sucks 0 
i had strawberry tea which was good 1 
in an interesting part of town this place is amazing 1 
it is a true classic 1 
ive had no trouble accessing the internet downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions 1 
weve have gotten a much better service from the pizza place next door than the services we received from this restaurant 0 
unreliable im giving up 0 
were jerks on the phone 0 
great phone 1 
the holster that arrived did not match the photo in the ad 0 
they refuse to refund or replace 0 
the service was meh 0 
service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is vegas and located inside the crystals shopping mall by aria 1 
we recently witnessed her poor quality of management towards other guests as well 0 
her role was played well 1 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
also the story and acting were weak 0 
the worst one of the series 0 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
the burrittos blah 0 
we walked away stuffed and happy about our first vegas buffet experience 1 
speaking of the music it is unbearably predictably and kitchy 0 
battery has no life 0 
im probably one of the few people to ever go to ians and not like it 0 
worst customer service ever 0 
i have had problems wit hit dropping signal and more 0 
i find wasting food to be despicable but this just wasnt food 0 
the bt headset was such a disapoinment 0 
but other than that the movie seemed to drag and the heroes didnt really work for their freedom 0 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
very slow at seating even with reservation 0 
i like armand assante my cable companys summary sounded interesting so i watched it twice already and probably will again 1 
it is so small and you dont even realize that it is there after a while of getting used to it 1 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
elias koteasjack palance play good roles angelina is hot and gets nakedbilly drago appears in this and is cool as usual a cameo by sven ole thorsen helps make this a very enjoyable movie with good acting and a decent budget 1 
definitely a turn off for me i doubt ill be back unless someone else is buying 0 
the sides are delish mixed mushrooms yukon gold puree white corn beateous 1 
it was a pale color instead of nice and char and has no flavor 0 
good works fine 1 
the film is way too long 0 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
the design might be ergonomic in theory but i could not stand having these in my ear 0 
overall i like there food and the service 1 
but she is still a bad actress repeating her robotic face moves in each of her pictures 0 
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
it holds a charge for a long time is reasonably comfortable under longwearing conditions and the quality of sound is tremendous 1 
the potatoes were great and so was the biscuit 1 
were jerks on the phone 0 
the ambiance isnt much better 0 
this place is handsdown one of the best places to eat in the phoenix metro area 1 
the waitress and manager are so friendly 1 
i had about two bites and refused to eat anymore 0 
disappointed with battery 0 
the voice recognition thru the handset is excellent 1 
i wasnt expecting oscar material but this 0 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
not my thing 0 
great character actors telly savalas and peter boyle 1 
i sat riveted to the tv screen 1 
loved itfriendly servers great food wonderful and imaginative menu 1 
this was my first and only vegas buffet and it did not disappoint 1 
the screen size is big key pad lit well enough and the camera quality is excellent for a camera phone 1 
a week later after i activated it it suddenly died 0 
unfortunately the ability to actually know you are receiving a call is a rather important feature and this phone is pitiful in that respect 0 
the poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying 0 
110 and only because there is no setting for 010 0 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
if you simply want a small flip phone look elsewhere as the extra bells whistles are mediocre 0 
looks great and is strong 1 
i have had tmobile service for 2 or 3 years now and i am pretty happy with it 1 
otherwise dont even waste your time on this 0 
trying to make a call on these is an exercise in frustration 0 
the movie is full of wonderful dancing hence the title 1 
it felt too light and tinny 0 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
you cant go wrong with any of the food here 1 
the point is the journey a journey that touches every member of the family 1 
this case seems well made 1 
the new characters werent all that memorable and i found myself forgetting who was who 0 
but whatever it was that cost them so much it didnt translate to quality thats for sure 0 
to my disbelief each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods i have ever tasted 0 
due to this happening on every call i was forced to stop using this headset 0 
it is a very well acted and done tv movie 1 
the pizza selections are good 1 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
unfortunately it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees 0 
you get what you pay for i guess 0 
all in all id expected a better consumer experience from motorola 0 
cooked to perfection and the service was impeccable 1 
this was my first time and i cant wait until the next 1 
great headset very impressed h500 1 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
sounds good reasonably priced and effective its that simple 1 
the chips and sals a here is amazing 1 
were jerks on the phone 0 
it never condescends all the characters have good genuine hearts and believable problems 1 
this is a great restaurant at the mandalay bay 1 
his performance as awarded was stunning 1 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
hot dishes are not hot cold dishes are close to room tempi watched staff prepare food with bare hands no gloveseverything is deep fried in oil 0 
not a good bargain 0 
your brain will attempt to shutdown as part of a primal impulse of selfpreservation 0 
i was shocked because no signs indicate cash only 0 
i advise everyone do not be fooled 0 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
but what really made it unwatchable was the direction 0 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
your brain will attempt to shutdown as part of a primal impulse of selfpreservation 0 
this place is horrible and way overpriced 0 
what happened next was prettyoff putting 0 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
camera color balance is awful 0 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
but when i check voice mail at night the keypad backlight turns off a few seconds into the first message and then im lost 0 
their chow mein is so good 1 
1010 1 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
now this dish was quite flavourful 1 
disappointment i hate anything that goes in my ear 0 
this movie creates its own universe and is fascinating in every way 1 
works like a charm it work the same as the one i got with the phone 1 
feelings thoughtsgabriels discomfort during the danceall these intangibles leap to life and come within the viewers grasp in hustons portrayal 1 
by far the best cheesecurds we have ever had 1 
good audio quality 1 
regardless the film fails on most levels 0 
they have horrible attitudes towards customers and talk down to each one when customers dont enjoy their food 0 
incredible 1 
some applause should be given to the prelude however 1 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
battery chargelife is quite long 1 
also the phone doesnt seem to accept anything except cbr mp3s preferably ripped by windows media player 0 
one character is totally annoying with a voice that gives me the feeling of fingernails on a chalkboard 0 
i would recommend this 1 
this particular model would not work with my motorola q smartphone 0 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
i have been very happy with the 510 and have had no complaints from any one regarding my sound quality on their end 1 
we waited for thirty minutes to be seated although there were 8 vacant tables and we were the only folks waiting 0 
despite the pans of reviewers i liked this movie 1 
five star plus plus 1 
i will not return 0 
works great 1 
we wont be going back 0 
if that bug never showed up i would have given a 4 for sure but on the other side of the wall where this bug was climbing was the kitchen 0 
there was hardly any meat 0 
very friendly staff 1 
it is a really good show to watch 1 
kids pizza is always a hit too with lots of great side dish options for the kiddos 1 
shrimp when i unwrapped it i live only 12 a mile from brushfire it was literally ice cold 0 
you get extra minutes so that you can carry out the call and not get cut off 1 
i put the latest os on it v115g and it now likes to slow to a crawl and lock up every once in a while 0 
very good stuff for the price 1 
i would highly recommend this product 1 
but whatever it was that cost them so much it didnt translate to quality thats for sure 0 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
i dont think i will be back for a very long time 0 
but this movie is not funny considering the ridiculousness of it 0 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
and it was way to expensive 0 
the ending is so so perfect youll shed a tear 1 
i dont know what kind it is but they have the best iced tea 1 
this allows the possibility of double booking for the same date and time after the first 0 
waaaaaayyyyyyyyyy over rated is all i am saying 0 
macbeth jason connery moved me to tears with his final monolog out brief candle outhe gave the sphere of moral decay and dark forces a human face which makes it the more interesting 1 
the staff are also very friendly and efficient 1 
1 long lasting battery you dont have to recharge it as frequentyly as some of the flip phones2 0 
great phone 1 
we are so glad we found this place 1 
i got it because it was so small and adorable 1 
fantastic buy and will get again for whatever my next phone is 1 
this game rocks 1 
we started with the tuna sashimi which was brownish in color and obviously wasnt fresh 0 
i own a jabra earset and was very happy with it but the sound quality especially outgoing on this is better 1 
im so sorry but i really cant recommend it to anyone 0 
the staff are also very friendly and efficient 1 
the food is about on par with dennys which is to say not good at all 0 
pretty good beer selection too 1 
i dont each much pasta but i love the homemade hand made pastas and thin pizzas here 1 
soyo technology sucks 0 
despite the pans of reviewers i liked this movie 1 
we had fantastic service and were pleased by the atmosphere 1 
it seems completely secure both holding on to my belt and keeping the iphone inside 1 
was not happy 0 
nothing short of magnificent photographycinematography in this film 1 
for readers who have already seen one of miyazakis films he is still in top form and made another worthwhile experience 1 
we waited for thirty minutes to be seated although there were 8 vacant tables and we were the only folks waiting 0 
all i have to say is the food was amazing 1 
this item is fantastic and works perfectly 1 
if you are razr owneryou must have this 1 
there was no chemistry between ben affleck and sandra bullock in this film and i couldnt understand why he would consider even leaving his wifetobe for this chick that he supposedly was knocked out by 0 
the chips that came out were dripping with grease and mostly not edible 0 
its this pandering to the audience that sabotages most of his films 0 
we got the food and apparently they have never heard of salt and the batter on the fish was chewy 0 
that was done in the second movie 0 
things that went wrong they burned the saganaki 0 
unfortunately this is a bad movie that is just plain bad 0 
i am so tired of clichés that is just lazy writing and here they come in thick and fast 0 
for service i give them no stars 0 
but when i check voice mail at night the keypad backlight turns off a few seconds into the first message and then im lost 0 
even in my bmw 3 series which is fairly quiet i have trouble hearing what the other person is saying 0 
my headset works just peachykeen 1 
the earpiece on this is too large or too heavyit keeps falling out of my ear 0 
the best phone in market 1 
it is a really good show to watch 1 
what on earth is irons doing in this film 0 
an extensive menu provides lots of options for breakfast 1 
great phone 1 
hell no will i go back 0 
i cannot believe that the actors agreed to do this film 0 
no shifting no bubbling no peeling not even a scratch nothingi couldnt be more happier with my new one for the droid 1 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
i recently tried caballeros and i have been back every week since 1 
but it picked up speed and got right to the point 1 
he was very impressed when going from the original battery to the extended battery 1 
the movie is terribly boring in places 0 
maybe there would be a reasonable explanation for this atrocity 0 
service is perfect and the family atmosphere is nice to see 1 
the only thing worse than taylors acting was stanwycks singing 0 
today was my first taste of a buldogis gourmet hot dog and i have to tell you it was more than i ever thought possible 1 
we have tried 2 units and they both failed within 2 months pros 0 
i bought this to use with my kindle fire and absolutely loved it 1 
i literally vomited while watching this film 0 
they keep getting better and better this is my third one and ive had numerous palms too 1 
it was too predictable even for a chick flick 0 
these were so good we ordered them twice 1 
also the story and acting were weak 0 
works fine 1 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
this was reflected not only in the cast but also in the belowpar script which borrowed much from the earlier classic 0 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
nothing short of magnificent photographycinematography in this film 1 
i like steiners because its dark and it feels like a bar 1 
simply beautiful 1 
the battery works great 1 
dont waste your time 0 
this phone works great 1 
the performances are real and gripping the crocdodile is extremely well done indeed if the black water website is to be believed thats because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous 1 
the bt headset was such a disapoinment 0 
totally believable 1 
it is well made easy to access the phone and has a handy detachable belt clip 1 
i got to enjoy the seafood salad with a fabulous vinegrette 1 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
ps the only scene in the movie that was cool is when the central character finds her room blown up 1 
this movie has a cutting edge to it 1 
ive never been more insulted or felt disrespected 0 
the transfers are very good 1 
the food was great as always compliments to the chef 1 
do not purchase this phone 0 
excellent service 1 
the ambience is wonderful and there is music playing 1 
i do love sushi but i found kabuki to be overpriced overhip and underservices 0 
couldnt figure it out 0 
this place has it 1 
its quite simply the highest most superlative form of cinema imaginable 1 
the dialogue sucked 0 
has been working great 1 
the script is a big flawed mess 0 
i heart this place 1 
if i take a picture the battery drops a bar and starts beeping letting me know its dieing 0 
no additional ear gels provided and no instructions whatsoever 0 
this place is pretty good nice little vibe in the restaurant 1 
id say that would be the hardest decision honestly all of ms dishes taste how they are supposed to taste amazing 1 
if it were possible to give them zero stars theyd have it 0 
i love being able to use one headset for both by landline and cell 1 
the cast was great 1 
food is way overpriced and portions are fucking small 0 
i rate this movie 910 1 
i live in the neighborhood so i am disappointed i wont be back here because it is a convenient location 0 
lasted one day and then blew up 0 
great for ipods too 1 
very windresistant 1 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
the acting is like watching wooden puppets moving around and reading from a book thats how bad it is 0 
horrible 0 
i was deeply impressed with the character he played 1 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
design flaw 0 
this was one of the worst films i have ever seen 0 
its too bad that everyone else involved didnt share crowes level of dedication to quality for if they did wed have a far better film on our hands than this subpar mess 0 
they are so easy to love but even more easy to identify with 1 
the script is bad very bad  it contains both cheesiness and unethical joke that you normally see in rated r or nc17 movie 0 
at any rate this film stinks its not funny and fulci should have stayed with giallo and supernatural zombie movies 0 
i highly recommend this device to everyone 1 
the movie had you on the edge of your seat and made you somewhat afraid to go to your car at the end of the night 1 
anyways the food was definitely not filling at all and for the price you pay you should expect more 0 
its like a really sexy party in your mouth where youre outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party 1 
i am pairing this with my iphone and i could not be happier with it so far 1
