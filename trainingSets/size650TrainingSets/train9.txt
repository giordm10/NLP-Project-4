the tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu 0 
that said our mouths and bellies were still quite pleased 1 
this short film certainly pulls no punches 0 
love this phone 1 
im still infatuated with this phone 1 
everything captain howdy says is either laughable or just plain stupid 0 
she carries the movie well 1 
the films sole bright spot was jonah hill who will look almost unrecognizable to fans of the recent superbad due to the amount of weight he lost in the interim 1 
the memories are murky but i can only say that i enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show 1 
top line dont waste your time and money on this one its as bad as it comes 0 
nice case feels good in your hands 1 
it is shameful 0 
it is perfect for a sitdown family meal or get together with a few friends 1 
i thought errol flynn was brilliant as custer and has since become my favourite actor 1 
bad choice 0 
both of them were truly unbelievably good and i am so glad we went back 1 
it rocked my world and is certainly a must see for anyone with no social or physical outlets 1 
both the hot sour the egg flower soups were absolutely 5 stars 1 
everything captain howdy says is either laughable or just plain stupid 0 
this place is amazing 1 
its pretty surprising that this wonderful film was made in 1949 as hollywood generally had its collective heads in the sand concerning black and white issues at that time 1 
but in terms of the writing its very fresh and bold 1 
design flaw 0 
the structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema 1 
why was this film made 0 
it was quite comfortable in the ear 1 
buyer beware you could flush money right down the toilet 0 
the nokia ca42 usb cable did not work with my phone 0 
the color is even prettier than i thought it would be and the graphics are incredibly sharp 1 
the shipping time was also very quick 1 
how can that bethe audio quality is poor 0 
my experience was terrible this was my fourth bluetooth headset and while it was much more comfortable than my last jabra which i hated 0 
2 thumbs up 1 
it features an outlandish array of memorable psychotic but lovable nuts 1 
great audio 1 
poor sound quality 0 
the cast was great 1 
camerawork again bad 0 
great product 1 
i live in the neighborhood so i am disappointed i wont be back here because it is a convenient location 0 
wonderful lil tapas and the ambience made me feel all warm and fuzzy inside 1 
but the premise of the film was so ridiculous that the president of the us 0 
service is perfect and the family atmosphere is nice to see 1 
i was disgusted because i was pretty sure that was human hair 0 
love this product 1 
the worst was the salmon sashimi 0 
im returning them 0 
the films sole bright spot was jonah hill who will look almost unrecognizable to fans of the recent superbad due to the amount of weight he lost in the interim 1 
kind of flops around 0 
the service was not up to par either 0 
my experience was terrible this was my fourth bluetooth headset and while it was much more comfortable than my last jabra which i hated 0 
how can anyone in their right mind ask for anything more from a movie than this 1 
bluetooth range is good a few days ago i left my phone in the trunk got a call and carried the conversation without a hitch 1 
perhaps my phone is defective but people cannot hear me when i use this 0 
waitress was a little slow in service 0 
then as if i hadnt wasted enough of my life there they poured salt in the wound by drawing out the time it took to bring the check 0 
if you see it you should probably just leave it on the shelf 0 
disappointing accessory from a good manufacturer 0 
utterly without merit on any level this is akin to torture 0 
the building itself seems pretty neat the bathroom is pretty trippy but i wouldnt eat here again 0 
so absolutley fantastic 1 
i am going to have to be the first to negatively review this product 0 
i have eaten here multiple times and each time the food was delicious 1 
the problem i have is that they charge 1199 for a sandwich that is no bigger than a subway sub which offers better and more amount of vegetables 0 
i connected my wifes bluetoothmotorola hs850 to my phone and it worked like a charm whether the phone was in my pocket or the case 1 
sorry i will not be getting food from here anytime soon 0 
wow what a bad film 0 
bad quality 0 
spend your money elsewhere 0 
you never know if you pushed it hard enough or the right number of times for the function you want or not 0 
this is a simple little phone to use but the breakage is unacceptible 0 
its pretty surprising that this wonderful film was made in 1949 as hollywood generally had its collective heads in the sand concerning black and white issues at that time 1 
raw and sublimely moving 1 
my side greek salad with the greek dressing was so tasty and the pita and hummus was very refreshing 1 
the music in the film is really nice too 1 
wonderful lil tapas and the ambience made me feel all warm and fuzzy inside 1 
bad reception 0 
oh yeah and the storyline was pathetic too 0 
nice docking station for home or work 1 
overall i wasnt very impressed with noca 0 
very easy to use 1 
it definitely was not as good as my s11 1 
the last 15 minutes of movie are also not bad as well 1 
hated it 0 
110 and only because there is no setting for 010 0 
it was too predictable even for a chick flick 0 
end of days is one of the worst bigbudget action movies ive ever seen 0 
while you dont yet hear mickey speak there are tons of sound effects and music throughout the filmsomething we take for granted now but which was a huge crowd pleaser in 1928 1 
for service i give them no stars 0 
my boyfriend and i came here for the first time on a recent trip to vegas and could not have been more pleased with the quality of food and service 1 
nargile i think you are great 1 
ill definitely be in soon again 1 
to sum the film up breeders is a terrible cheaply made horror movie that should be avoided like the ebola virus 0 
they have great dinners 1 
both rickman and stowe play their roles to the hilt in this tale of a childrens book writer who maybe has written a subversive tract 1 
i really loved the story line and the poler bear was kinda cutebut if anyone has a question about fort steele just ask away 1 
it is unusable in a moving car at freeway speed 0 
very very disappointed ordered the 35 big bay plater 0 
it just blew 0 
i believe that pitch black was done well 1 
unfortunately this is a bad movie that is just plain bad 0 
the folks at otto always make us feel so welcome and special 1 
all of the tapas dishes were delicious 1 
ill be looking for a new earpiece 0 
jawbone era is awesome too 1 
not too screamy not to masculine but just right 1 
i dont each much pasta but i love the homemade hand made pastas and thin pizzas here 1 
the structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema 1 
we are sending it back 0 
this was a different cut than the piece the other day but still wonderful and tender s well as well flavored 1 
the fries were not hot and neither was my burger 0 
so far it has worked like a charm 1 
the steak and the shrimp are in my opinion the best entrees at gc 1 
i dont think ive ever gone to a movie and disliked it as much 0 
kieslowski never ceases to amaze me 1 
left very frustrated 0 
its a great tool for entertainment communication and data managementoh be sure to use activesync 42 for optimal data synchronization results 1 
freezes frequently4 0 
im super pissd 0 
their steaks are 100 recommended 1 
they do not last forever but is not overly expensive to replaceeasy to operate and the sound is much better than others i have tried 1 
the screen does get smudged easily because it touches your ear and face 0 
all in all i can assure you ill be back 1 
great product fast shipping 1 
it dit not work most of the time with my nokia 5320 0 
the nokia ca42 usb cable did not work with my phone 0 
a piece of junk that broke after being on my phone for 2 days 0 
setup couldnt have been simpler 1 
the steaks are all well trimmed and also perfectly cooked 1 
to those who find this movie intelligent or even masterful i can only say its your intelligence and your imagination you obviously used to try and make some sense of this pitiful attempt its in our human nature to try and make sense of things 0 
all in all id expected a better consumer experience from motorola 0 
it feels poorly constructed the menus are difficult to navigate and the buttons are so recessed that it is difficult to push them 0 
also the story and acting were weak 0 
must have been an off night at this place 0 
i have bought this nokia cell phone a few weeks ago and it was a nightmare 0 
my rating just 3 out of 10 0 
dont buy this product 0 
they do not last forever but is not overly expensive to replaceeasy to operate and the sound is much better than others i have tried 1 
for 40 bucks a head i really expect better food 0 
uncomfortable in the ear dont use with lg vx9900 env 0 
this is cool because most cases are just open there allowing the screen to get all scratched up 1 
started watching this but didnt believe in any of the characters 0 
clear skype calls long battery life long range 1 
the stories were as unbelievable as the actors 0 
the problem i have is that they charge 1199 for a sandwich that is no bigger than a subway sub which offers better and more amount of vegetables 0 
people couldnt hear me talk and i had to pull out the earphone and talk on the phone 0 
i love the camera its really pretty good quality 1 
then the film just dropped the ball 0 
also great directing and photography 1 
battery life is also great 1 
see it with your kids if you have a chanceit will open up some amazing dialog about how far race relations have come in the last 50 years 1 
and if that isnt enough of a mess of a movie for you the picture is also marred with a constant use of studio sets and indoor exteriors 0 
i enjoyed it 1 
very disappointed 0 
my rating just 3 out of 10 0 
the nachos are a must have 1 
none of it works just dont buy it 0 
initially the local sites in the film which was filmed here in buffalo intrigued me 1 
this is a great place to eat 1 
i did not expect this to be so good 1 
cumbersome design 0 
the shipping time was also very quick 1 
i purchased this and within 2 days it was no longer working 0 
nice ambiance 1 
it was clear that she had the range and ability to pull off this part 1 
magical help 1 
1 long lasting battery you dont have to recharge it as frequentyly as some of the flip phones2 0 
not nearly as good looking as the amazon picture makes it look 0 
i even fully charged it before i went to bed and turned off blue tooth and wifi and noticed that it only had 20 left in the morning 0 
it is very educational for children 1 to 8 years old 1 
i loved it it was really scary 1 
the chips that came out were dripping with grease and mostly not edible 0 
i promise they wont disappoint 1 
you wont forget this movie 1 
and considering the two of us left there very full and happy for about 20 you just cant go wrong 1 
you cant go wrong with any of the food here 1 
my order was not correct 0 
great place to eat reminds me of the little mom and pop shops in the san francisco bay area 1 
yes this film does require a rather significant amount of puzzlesolving but the pieces fit together to create a beautiful picture 1 
disappointing 0 
great phone 1 
by the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant i was bored and didnt care what happened next and so i switched off 0 
just whatever you do avoid groove as its the antithesis of all that is good about human traffic 0 
it is so small and you dont even realize that it is there after a while of getting used to it 1 
its also great to see that renowned silent screenwriter frances marion hasnt missed a step going from silent to sound 1 
i wouldnt return 0 
how awful she is 0 
i know this is not like the other restaurants at all something is very off here 0 
my drink was never empty and he made some really great menu suggestions 1 
i seriously cannot believe that the owner has so many unexperienced employees that all are running around like chickens with their heads cut off 0 
i really liked that 1 
it is a really good show to watch 1 
over rated 0 
it is a very well acted and done tv movie 1 
great hands free device 1 
now you know why i gave it a 10 1 
classywarm atmosphere fun and fresh appetizers succulent steaks baseball steak 1 
but when i check voice mail at night the keypad backlight turns off a few seconds into the first message and then im lost 0 
after the first charge kept going dead after 12 minutes 0 
food was delicious 1 
i went to bachi burger on a friends recommendation and was not disappointed 1 
the scallop dish is quite appalling for value as well 0 
i ended up sliding it on the edge of my pants or back pockets instead 1 
the jerky camera movements were also annoying 0 
works great when my cat attacked the phone he scratched the protective strip instead of destroying the screen 1 
you can even take self portraits with the outside exterior display very cool 1 
keep up the good work amazon 1 
the turkey and roast beef were bland 0 
its still wild stuff though and is highly recommended to fans of giallo cinema 1 
today the graphics are crap 0 
the camera really likes her in this movie 1 
now the burgers arent as good the pizza which used to be amazing is doughy and flavorless 0 
poor sound quality 0 
unfortunately it was not good 0 
it is very educational for children 1 to 8 years old 1 
so just beware 0 
and the accents are absolutely abysmal 0 
the cast was great 1 
blue ant is easy to use 1 
voice quality signal strength dropped calls 0 
avoid at all costs 0 
a great touch 1 
the food is about on par with dennys which is to say not good at all 0 
for people who are first timers in film making i think they did an excellent job 1 
the structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema 1 
defective crap 0 
one nice thing was that they added gratuity on the bill since our party was larger than 6 or 8 and they didnt expect more tip than that 1 
it is practically useless and did not add any kind of boost to my reception after i bought it 0 
i bought two of them and neither will charge 0 
the sets especially designed to work with the camera are amazingstylized beautiful and effective 1 
the camera although rated at an impressive 13 megapixels renders images that fall well below expectations of such a relatively high resolution 0 
i also didnt like the on button it felt like it would crack with use 0 
a piece of cinematic garbage captured on celluloid 0 
the film succeeds despite or perhaps because of an obviously meagre budget 1 
but in any case the best part is you can download these pictures to your laptop using ir or even send pictures from your laptop to the phone 1 
how can you call yourself a steakhouse if you cant properly cook a steak i dont understand 0 
special thanks to dylan t for the recommendation on what to order all yummy for my tummy 1 
it really is impressive that the place hasnt closed down 0 
dont waste your money 0 
walked in and the place smelled like an old grease trap and only 2 others there eating 0 
then i exchanged for the same phone even that had the same problem 0 
director paul matthews who also wrotedirected the weak 1995 monster movie grim clearly doesnt know how to pace his films 0 
finally after three or four times the spring of the latch broke and i could not use it any longer on the visor 0 
great steak great sides great wine amazing desserts 1 
at any rate this film stinks its not funny and fulci should have stayed with giallo and supernatural zombie movies 0 
having to humour him just to get by and get through the day was so apt 1 
it has northern humour and positive about the community it represents 1 
del taco is pretty nasty and should be avoided if possible 0 
i never come again 0 
it is worth the drive 1 
think it over when you plan to own this onethis sure is the last moto phone for me 0 
camerawork again bad 0 
regrettably the film fails 0 
they have horrible attitudes towards customers and talk down to each one when customers dont enjoy their food 0 
i have tried these cables with my computer and my ipod and it works just fine 1 
the first time i ever came here i had an amazing experience i still tell people how awesome the duck was 1 
highquality chicken on the chicken caesar salad 1 
the worst phone from samsungcrap this crappy samsung e715 is the worst i have ever seeen 0 
if you plan to use this in a car forget about it 0 
however my girl was complain that some time the phone doesnt wake up like normal phone does 0 
the best place to go for a tasty bowl of pho 1 
so anyone near you will hear part of your conversation 0 
this if the first movie ive given a 10 to in years 1 
great atmosphere friendly and fast service 1 
maybe if they werent cold they would have been somewhat edible 0 
excellent phone 1 
however i needed some better instructions 0 
this place is handsdown one of the best places to eat in the phoenix metro area 1 
not a weekly haunt but definitely a place to come back to every once in a while 1 
its also great to see that renowned silent screenwriter frances marion hasnt missed a step going from silent to sound 1 
its not user friendly 0 
great pocket pc phone combination 1 
i love the ringtones because they are so upbeat 1 
an instant classic with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits 1 
even when the women finally show up there is no sign of improvement the most expected things happen and by the time the film is over you might be far asleep 0 
four stars for the food the guy in the blue shirt for his great vibe still letting us in to eat 1 
i mean really how do you get so famous for your fish and chips when its so terrible 0 
i dont have very many words to say about this place but it does everything pretty well 1 
as always the evening was wonderful and the food delicious 1 
what a disappointment 0 
some may say this buffet is pricey but i think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot 1 
great for the jawbone 1 
while i managed to bend the leaf spring back in place the metal now has enough stress that it will break on the next drop 0 
bad purchase 0 
there was hardly any meat 0 
phone now holds charge like it did when it was new 1 
in summary this was a largely disappointing dining experience 0 
absolutel junk 0 
fantastic buy and will get again for whatever my next phone is 1 
i asked multiple times for the wine list and after some time of being ignored i went to the hostess and got one myself 0 
the worst piece of crap ever along with the verizon customer service 0 
the acting is terrible and the writing is worse 0 
the acting as youd expect from this cast is top notch 1 
do not buy do not buyit sucks 0 
item arrived quickly and works great with my metro pcs samsung schr450 slider phone and sony premium sound in ear plugs 1 
but it wasnt until i watched this film that i realised how great he actually was 1 
my friend loved the salmon tartar 1 
the only good thing was that it fits comfortably on small ears 1 
50 down the drain 0 
uncomfortable in the ear dont use with lg vx9900 env 0 
the cast was great 1 
the flair bartenders are absolutely amazing 1 
it dit not work most of the time with my nokia 5320 0 
service is quick and friendly 1 
my friend did not like his bloody mary 0 
owners are really great people 1 
come hungry leave happy and stuffed 1 
good item low price 1 
great product fast shipping 1 
it was so cool 1 
i cannot believe that the actors agreed to do this film 0 
dont waste your time here 0 
this wonderful experience made this place a muststop whenever we are in town again 1 
in summary this was a largely disappointing dining experience 0 
i totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is 1 
service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is vegas and located inside the crystals shopping mall by aria 1 
the writer gorman bechard undoubtedly did his homework because all references are industry and characterage appropriate 1 
also notable is john baileys fine crisp beautifully colored cinematography and the great production design costumes by eiko ishioka who went on to do the memorable costumes for coppolas dracula for which she received a well deserved oscar 1 
jawbone era is awesome too 1 
i guess i should have known that this place would suck because it is inside of the excalibur but i didnt use my common sense 0 
an hour seriously 0 
an amazing finale to possibly the best trilogy of all time 1 
if i take a picture the battery drops a bar and starts beeping letting me know its dieing 0 
my friend loved the salmon tartar 1 
this movie has a cutting edge to it 1 
its too bad the food is so damn generic 0 
if youre not familiar check it out 1 
i recommend this for everyone who loves film movies anythinga work of art 1 
i found the product to be easy to set up and use 1 
it will drive you barking mad 0 
dont buy this product 0 
the mic is great 1 
ive missed numerous calls because of this reason 0 
the volume for the ringer is real good you have choices how loud 1 
this pda rocks 1 
i have been to very few places to eat that under no circumstances would i ever return to and this tops the list 0 
see it with your kids if you have a chanceit will open up some amazing dialog about how far race relations have come in the last 50 years 1 
the writer gorman bechard undoubtedly did his homework because all references are industry and characterage appropriate 1 
the pan cakes everyone are raving about taste like a sugary disaster tailored to the palate of a six year old 0 
after a year the battery went completely dead on my headset 0 
the cashew cream sauce was bland and the vegetables were undercooked 0 
not nearly as good looking as the amazon picture makes it look 0 
battery has no life 0 
i only hear garbage for audio 0 
there arent death scenes like in previous movies and the fx are terrible 0 
i got home to see the driest damn wings ever 0 
the films dialogue is natural real to life 1 
the buttons for on and off are bad 0 
whatever prompted such a documentary is beyond me 0 
they will customize your order any way youd like my usual is eggplant with green bean stir fry love it 1 
a truly truly bad film 0 
it didnt work people can not hear me when i talk 0 
the fries were great too 1 
i had a salad with the wings and some ice cream for dessert and left feeling quite satisfied 1 
this was my first and only vegas buffet and it did not disappoint 1 
made very sturdy 1 
the instruction manual is lacking 0 
excellent performance 1 
the design is very odd as the ear clip is not very comfortable at all 0 
not recommended 0 
the ear buds only play music in one ear 0 
the steaks are all well trimmed and also perfectly cooked 1 
battery life is real good 1 
this place is like chipotle but better 1 
i probably would not go here again 0 
it has a great camera thats 2mp and the pics are nice and clear with great picture quality 1 
which is precisely why i am giving it such a bad review 0 
totally different with loads of understatement and black comedy this is a film few get to see but those who do will remember it 1 
there was no chemistry between ben affleck and sandra bullock in this film and i couldnt understand why he would consider even leaving his wifetobe for this chick that he supposedly was knocked out by 0 
great headset very impressed h500 1 
bluetooth does not work phone locks up screens just flash up and now it just makes calls randomly while in my pocket locked 0 
utterly without merit on any level this is akin to torture 0 
there is a brilliant twist ending 1 
good price 1 
rating 1 out of 10 0 
the scenes are often funny and occasionally touching as the characters evaluate their lives and where they are going 1 
phone is sturdy as all nokia bar phones are 1 
im in az all the time and now have my new spot 1 
i do think tom hanks is a good actor 1 
it features an outlandish array of memorable psychotic but lovable nuts 1 
the acting from all involved and that includes those like shatner and nimoy is bad and washed out and making them seem as old as they look in real life the special effects are tacky like when spock has to rescue kirk on a jet pack when he falls down from a mountain 0 
as an earlier review noted plug in this charger and nothing happens 0 
it was a drive to get there 0 
horrible dont waste your time and money 0 
my side greek salad with the greek dressing was so tasty and the pita and hummus was very refreshing 1 
give this one a look 1 
all in all i can assure you ill be back 1 
great product and price 1 
i wear glasses and it fits fine with them 1 
we are so glad we found this place 1 
some highlights great quality nigiri here 1 
imdb ratings only go as low 1 for awful its time to get some negative numbers in there for cases such as these 0 
this isnt a small family restaurant this is a fine dining establishment 1 
its the one movie that never ceases to interest me simply because it keeps me alert as i try to attempt to decipher its meanings 1 
cant get the software to work with my computer 0 
good product incredible value 1 
otherwise dont even waste your time on this 0 
painful on the ear 0 
trouble is the writing and directing make it impossible to establish those things that make a movie watchable like character story theme and so on 0 
i will come back here every time im in vegas 1 
i enjoyed reading this book to my children when they were little 1 
damian is so talented and versatile in so many ways of writing and portraying different characters on screen 1 
while i managed to bend the leaf spring back in place the metal now has enough stress that it will break on the next drop 0 
what happened next was prettyoff putting 0 
i loved their mussels cooked in this wine reduction the duck was tender and their potato dishes were delicious 1 
this battery is an excellent bargain 1 
talk about great customer service of course we will be back 1 
you need at least 3 mins to get to your phone book from the time you first turn on the phonebattery life is short 0 
interesting decor 1 
ordered burger rare came in well done 0 
this hole in the wall has great mexican street tacos and friendly staff 1 
the pan cakes everyone are raving about taste like a sugary disaster tailored to the palate of a six year old 0 
it was also the right balance of war and love 1 
the plantains were the worst ive ever tasted 0 
the aerial scenes were welldone 1 
we got the food and apparently they have never heard of salt and the batter on the fish was chewy 0 
i love the pho and the spring rolls oh so yummy you have to try 1 
still i do like this movie for its empowerment of women theres not enough movies out there like this one 1 
but even the talented carrell cant save this 0 
i have only had it for a few weeks but so far so good 1 
nothing new there 0 
battery has no life 0 
service is friendly and inviting 1 
it was either too cold not enough flavor or just bad 0 
will never ever go back and have told many people what had happened 0 
this place is like chipotle but better 1 
the charger arrived within the promised timeframe but it did not work 0 
what a piece of junk i lose more calls on this phone 0 
the reception has been generally good 1 
cinematography noteworthy including fine views of barcelona and its famed gaudi towers 1 
the reception is excellent 1 
started watching this but didnt believe in any of the characters 0 
great atmosphere friendly and fast service 1 
every element of this story was so over the top excessively phony and contrived that it was painful to sit through 0 
this place is awesome if you want something light and healthy during the summer 1 
the plot such as it is is so derivative and predictable that the ending is like a mercy killing 0 
excellent bluetooth headset 1 
this is my new fav vegas buffet spot 1 
i saw mirrormask last night and it was an unsatisfactory experience 0 
waste of money 0 
i own a jabra earset and was very happy with it but the sound quality especially outgoing on this is better 1 
this phone might well be the worst ive ever had in any brand 0 
a good film by a great director 1 
internet is excrutiatingly slow 0 
chinese forgeries abound 0 
i just saw this film and i recommend it 1 
design flaw 0 
just really good so far probably the best bt headset i have ever had 1 
waitress was sweet and funny 1 
but when someone strives for greatness and poetry but delivers a muddled and often ridiculous story a bunch of disparate scenes pretentious dialogue then you get the worst kind of a movie that some other reviewer very accurately defined as pretentious crap 0 
the spaghetti is nothing special whatsoever 0 
its a feelgood film and thats how i felt when i came out of the cinema 1 
frozen pucks of disgust with some of the worst people behind the register 0 
for readers who have already seen one of miyazakis films he is still in top form and made another worthwhile experience 1 
when my order arrived one of the gyros was missing 0 
the worst piece of crap ever along with the verizon customer service 0 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
i particularly remember my senses being assaulted by strident cords of music that would blare out with very little warning and even less meaning 0 
its extremely slow and takes forever to do anything with it 0 
what this film lacks is a convincing script 0 
overall i am psyched to have a phone which has all my appointments and contacts in and gets great reception 1 
i got the aluminum case for my new palm vx and it worked really wellit has protected my handheld perfectly so far 1 
a must study for anyone interested in the worst sins of industrial design 0 
i would highly recommend this product 1 
i was shocked because no signs indicate cash only 0 
he cant act one of the least scary villains i have ever seen he cant write did he write this damn movie in his sleep 0 
its practically perfect in all of them  a true masterpiece in a sea of faux masterpieces 1 
best ive found so far ive tried 2 other bluetooths and this one has the best quality for both me and the listener as well as ease of using 1 
i also didnt like the on button it felt like it would crack with use 0 
this product had a strong rubberpetroleum smell that was unbearable after a while and caused me to return it 0 
judith light is one of my favorite actresses and i think she does a superb job in this film 1 
great food and great service in a clean and friendly setting 1 
unless youre just out to visually collect all extant films of austens work you can skip this one 0 
unfortunately it was not good 0 
the design might be ergonomic in theory but i could not stand having these in my ear 0 
good works fine 1 
i especially love the long battery life 1 
this greedy corporation will never see another dime from me 0 
i have two more years left in this contract and i hate this phone 0 
on a positive note our server was very attentive and provided great service 1 
so far it has worked like a charm 1 
the folks at otto always make us feel so welcome and special 1 
it is well made easy to access the phone and has a handy detachable belt clip 1 
what the hell kind of crap is that 0 
i guess i liked the details of his dysfunctionhe was believable 1 
the acting helps the writing along very well maybe the idiotsavant sister could have been played better and it is a real joy to watch 1 
worked great 1 
love this phone 1 
the use of slowmotion needlessly repeats itself throughout the movie but is well backed up by bad acting and bad is a kind word here no continuity scenes that are thrown in for no reason whatsoever vehicles that looked like they were made from a corn flakes box and a directorial style that bordered on stupidity 0 
the acting from all involved and that includes those like shatner and nimoy is bad and washed out and making them seem as old as they look in real life the special effects are tacky like when spock has to rescue kirk on a jet pack when he falls down from a mountain 0 
very disappointing 0 
logitech bluetooth headset is a 10 1 
we walked away stuffed and happy about our first vegas buffet experience 1 
ive also had problems with the phone reading the memory card in which i always turn it on and then off again 0 
i guess maybe we went on an off night but it was disgraceful 0 
also the phone doesnt seem to accept anything except cbr mp3s preferably ripped by windows media player 0 
dont go here 0 
the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach 0 
end of days is one of the worst bigbudget action movies ive ever seen 0 
good service very clean and inexpensive to boot 1 
was not happy 0 
i hate to disagree with my fellow yelpers but my husband and i were so disappointed with this place 0 
sweetest phone 1 
the success of the film depends on the casting of sydney greenstreet as the alexander yardley character 1 
id like to return it 0 
id say that would be the hardest decision honestly all of ms dishes taste how they are supposed to taste amazing 1 
it was a waste of my money 0 
the presentation of the food was awful 0 
their rotating beers on tap is also a highlight of this place 1 
dont buy this product 0 
trouble is the writing and directing make it impossible to establish those things that make a movie watchable like character story theme and so on 0 
i dont think ive ever gone to a movie and disliked it as much 0 
ive owned this phone for 7 months now and can say that its the best mobile phone ive had 1 
give this one a look 1 
every element of this story was so over the top excessively phony and contrived that it was painful to sit through 0 
went in for happy hour great list of wines 1 
to sum the film up breeders is a terrible cheaply made horror movie that should be avoided like the ebola virus 0 
great brunch spot 1 
i understand that its supposed to be a cheap popcorn comedy but that doesnt mean that it has to completely insult our intelligence and have writing so incredibly hackneyed that it borders on offensive 0 
i got the aluminum case for my new palm vx and it worked really wellit has protected my handheld perfectly so far 1 
the ripped banana was not only ripped but petrified and tasteless 0 
after trying many many handsfree gadgets this is the one that finally works well 1 
her lines seem to have been written by a fifteen year old though they are trying oh so so hard to sound like how a fifteen year old would really um you know well talk 0 
it is perfect for a sitdown family meal or get together with a few friends 1 
i thought it was bad 0 
i bought this phone as a replacement for my startac and have regretted it since 0 
simple lightweight and great fit 1 
terrible management 0 
there is simply no excuse for something this poorly done 0 
check it out 1 
reaching for the bottom row is uncomfortable and the send and end keys are not where i expect them to be3 0 
in addition to having one of the most lovely songs ever written french cancan also boasts one of the cutest leading ladies ever to grace the screen 1 
excellent dualpurpose headset 1 
i give wirefly 1 stari will contact cingularatt and inform them of this practice 0 
works as described 1 
this film has no redeeming features 0 
it was pretty gross 0 
the vegetables are so fresh and the sauce feels like authentic thai 1 
its a mediocre miserable hollow laughable and predictable piece of garbage 0 
the chicken wings contained the driest chicken meat i have ever eaten 0 
its an empty hollow shell of a movie 0 
just does not work 0 
nice sound 1 
both of them were truly unbelievably good and i am so glad we went back 1 
horrible dont waste your time and money 0 
this movie was kind of long in length but i enjoyed every minute of it 1 
very good food great atmosphere1 1 
i think i was one of the people who found this another one of roths pearls 1 
phone now holds charge like it did when it was new 1 
oh and i forgot to also mention the weird color effect it has on your phone 0 
i love the ownerchef his one authentic japanese cool dude 1 
the holster that arrived did not match the photo in the ad 0 
the first thing that happened was that the tracking was off 0 
cant upload ringtones from a third party 0 
poor talk time performance 0 
while i managed to bend the leaf spring back in place the metal now has enough stress that it will break on the next drop 0 
paolo sorrentino has written a wonderful story about loneliness and tony has built one of the most unforgettable characters seen in movies in recent years 1 
this hole in the wall has great mexican street tacos and friendly staff 1 
its one of the most boring horror movies from the 90s mainly because it starts slow and centers in a boring atmosphere 0 
these are fabulous 1 
mediocre food 0 
overall i was not impressed and would not go back 0 
and i really did find them funny 1 
food was average at best 0 
they refuse to refund or replace 0 
this movie totally grates on my nerves 0 
her lines seem to have been written by a fifteen year old though they are trying oh so so hard to sound like how a fifteen year old would really um you know well talk 0 
it didnt make me scared horrified or make me sympathetic towards the characters it was simply annoying 0 
the entire audience applauded at the conclusion of the film 1 
useless phone simply deaf 0 
also great directing and photography 1 
big disappointment with calendar sync 0 
the jerky camera movements were also annoying 0 
i loved it it was really scary 1 
the success of the film depends on the casting of sydney greenstreet as the alexander yardley character 1 
will not be back 0 
i hate writing bad reviews about films especially those in which i really like the star but this film is so bad i dont believe for one second that anyone could have been proud of it 0 
recommend with confidence 1 
putting the race card aside lets look at the major flaw in the film they destroy latifas character 0 
so good i am going to have to review this place twice once hereas a tribute to the place and once as a tribute to an event held here last night 1 
battery lasts only a few hours 0 
earbud piece breaks easily 0 
del taco is pretty nasty and should be avoided if possible 0 
i could care less the interior is just beautiful 1 
raw and sublimely moving 1 
all of the tapas dishes were delicious 1 
the service was not up to par either 0 
it shouldnt take 30 min for pancakes and eggs 0 
they are so cool 1 
it shouldnt take 30 min for pancakes and eggs 0 
overall i would recommend this phone over the new walkman 1 
i bought this battery with a coupon from amazon and im very happy with my purchase 1 
good protection and does not make phone too bulky 1 
i will come back here every time im in vegas 1 
this is a great phone 1 
he was terrible 0 
the file browser offers all the options that one needshandsfree is great 1 
horrible had to switch 3 times 0 
you can even take self portraits with the outside exterior display very cool 1 
its uncomfortable and the sound quality is quite poor compared with the phone razr or with my previous wired headset that plugged into an lg 0 
unfortunately the ability to actually know you are receiving a call is a rather important feature and this phone is pitiful in that respect 0 
amazon sucks 0 
i gave it 5 stars because of the sound quality 1 
yes its shiny on front side and i love it 1 
battery lasts only a few hours 0 
wed definitely go back here again 1 
great product and price 1 
hes a national treasure 1 
this movie creates its own universe and is fascinating in every way 1 
great for ipods too 1 
the only very disappointing thing was there was no speakerphone 0 
this movie is excellentangel is beautiful and scamp is adorablehis little yelps when hes scaredand the funniest parts are whenscamp is caught under the curtain and when angel and scamp are singing ive never had this feeling beforei totally recommend this movieits coming out on special edition on june 20the cover has scamp on a garbage can and angel underneath the lid 1 
works great when my cat attacked the phone he scratched the protective strip instead of destroying the screen 1 
the acting helps the writing along very well maybe the idiotsavant sister could have been played better and it is a real joy to watch 1 
i would recommend saving room for this 1 
the nokia ca42 usb cable did not work with my phone 0 
you never know if you pushed it hard enough or the right number of times for the function you want or not 0 
this product is clearly not ready for prime time i dont care how cool it looks if you cant tell a call is coming in its worthless 0 
it was way over fried 0 
the service was outshining i definitely recommend the halibut 1 
its one of the movies i need to see whenever it comes on tvnever mind the fact that i already have it memorized 1 
of all the dishes the salmon was the best but all were great 1 
my side greek salad with the greek dressing was so tasty and the pita and hummus was very refreshing 1 
its so stupid to have to keep buying new chargers car chargers cradles headphones and car kits every time a new phone comes out 0 
it was a very superficial movie and it gave me the feeling that i was watching play rather than a film 0 
in summary this was a largely disappointing dining experience 0 
much more interesting more action more suspense and less of the unneeded controversy 1 
the problem was the script 0 
i purcashed this for the car charger and it does not work 0 
couldnt use the unit with sunglasses not good in texas 0 
you can watch them preparing the delicious food 1 
though the wind and the lion is told largely through the eyes of the son every member of the family can identify with one of the characters whether it be sean connerys noble brigand candace bergens feisty heroine john hustons wily john hay or steve kanalys spiffy radiant ruthless cando lieutenant roosevelts big stick 1 
very serious spoilers this movie was a huge disappointment 0 
rating 010 grade z note the show is so bad that even mother of the cast pull her daughter out of the show 0 
i was left shattered from the experience of watching this film and i took a good two hours to fully recover 0 
perfect for the ps3 1 
great product and price 1 
at first i thought i was grtting a good deal at 744 until i plugged it into my phone v3c razr 0 
i was able to do voice dialing in the car with no problem 1 
i work in the hospitality industry in paradise valley and have refrained from recommending cibo any longer 0 
spend your money elsewhere 0 
returned 8 hours later 0 
the scallop dish is quite appalling for value as well 0 
its also great to see that renowned silent screenwriter frances marion hasnt missed a step going from silent to sound 1 
we watched our waiter pay a lot more attention to other tables and ignore us 0 
very nice and relaxing late night viewing 1 
one character is totally annoying with a voice that gives me the feeling of fingernails on a chalkboard 0 
im so happy to be here 1 
i would recommend saving room for this 1 
my first visit to hiro was a delight 1
