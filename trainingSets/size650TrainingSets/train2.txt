this is definitely a cult classic well worth viewing and sharing with others 1 
judith light is one of my favorite actresses and i think she does a superb job in this film 1 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
it has a great camera thats 2mp and the pics are nice and clear with great picture quality 1 
bacon is hella salty 1 
food was really good and i got full petty fast 1 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
bad reception 0 
the camera on the phone may be used as a dustpan when indoors id rather be using a disposable then this 0 
this is some seriously good pizza and im an expertconnisseur on the topic 1 
rating 1 out of 10 0 
we loved the place 1 
the only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive 1 
constantine gives everything the right intensity and seems to have a good understanding of the underlying psychological motivations 1 
reasonably priced also 1 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
the owner used to work at nobu so this place is really similar for half the price 1 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
everything was fresh and delicious 1 
10 out of 10 for both the movie and trilogy 1 
the waitress and manager are so friendly 1 
an awesome new look for fall 2000 1 
o my gosh the best phone i have ever had 1 
his performance is simply genius 1 
pretty good beer selection too 1 
if there was ever an indication of a writer and a directors ability to meld two highly volatile temperaments into a seamless union of creativity then this is it 1 
i struggle to find anything bad to say about it 1 
i found this move beautiful enjoyable and uplifting 1 
the characters are interesting and you want to find out more about them the longer the movie goes on and i think people will be surprised by who does and doesnt make it 1 
it was a bit too sweet not really spicy enough and lacked flavor 0 
total brunch fail 0 
i am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this 1 
the fries were not hot and neither was my burger 0 
if you are reading this please dont go there 0 
great for ipods too 1 
i love the camera its really pretty good quality 1 
never been to hard rock casino before will never ever step forward in it again 0 
the story line is totally predictable 0 
the opening sequence of this gem is a classic and the cat n mouse games that follow are a delight to watch 1 
the phone was unusable and was not new 0 
i had absolutely no problem with this headset linking to my 8530 blackberry curve 1 
im not sure how long we stood there but it was long enough for me to begin to feel awkwardly out of place 0 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
this was reflected not only in the cast but also in the belowpar script which borrowed much from the earlier classic 0 
excellent product for the price 1 
this place is handsdown one of the best places to eat in the phoenix metro area 1 
long whiny and pointless 0 
conclusion very filling meals 1 
i was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar not only because the quality is great but the service is fast and the food impeccable 1 
we started with the tuna sashimi which was brownish in color and obviously wasnt fresh 0 
phone falls out easily 0 
110 and only because there is no setting for 010 0 
i wish i could return the unit and get back my money 0 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
dont buy it 0 
but the premise of the film was so ridiculous that the president of the us 0 
sound quality on both end is excellent i use headset to call my wife and ask my wife to use headset to call me 2 1 
the transfers are very good 1 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
however the ear pads come off easily and after only one week i lost one 0 
the opening sequence of this gem is a classic and the cat n mouse games that follow are a delight to watch 1 
its too bad the food is so damn generic 0 
five star plus plus 1 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
really pleased with this product so far 1 
it has a great camera thats 2mp and the pics are nice and clear with great picture quality 1 
third the cheese on my friends burger was cold 0 
after my phone got to be about a year old its been slowly breaking despite much care on my part 0 
the fact is this film is a wonderful heartwarming tale about two people chasing their dreams 1 
i am very happy 1 
for the price on amazon it is an excellent product which i would highly recommend 1 
actually the graphics were good at the time 1 
i am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this 1 
i would have given no star if i was able 0 
i advise you to look out for it 1 
the biggest complaint i have is the battery drains superfast 0 
of course the footage from the 70s was grainy but that only enhanced the film 1 
i guess it was supposed to be clever twist then shed some light on the situation but it was just stupid 0 
fits comfortably came with three sizes of earbud tips 1 
if you love authentic mexican food and want a whole bunch of interesting yet delicious meats to choose from you need to try this place 1 
the shipping time was also very quick 1 
level 5 spicy was perfect where spice didnt overwhelm the soup 1 
the movie is terribly boring in places 0 
it was a great phone 1 
i didnt realize how wonderful the short really is until the last two scenes 1 
great place to relax and have an awesome burger and beer 1 
the pan cakes everyone are raving about taste like a sugary disaster tailored to the palate of a six year old 0 
see it 1 
att is not clear sound is very distorted and you have to yell when you talk 0 
this really is how vegas fine dining used to be right down to the menus handed to the ladies that have no prices listed 1 
the plot well i said id let that one go 0 
the concert sequences just sucked 0 
she ordered a toasted english muffin that came out untoasted 0 
very prompt service 1 
if you are reading this please dont go there 0 
the tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu 0 
my husband and i ate lunch here and were very disappointed with the food and service 0 
i was deeply impressed with the character he played 1 
all the other cases ive tried normally fall apart after a few months but this one seems to be in for the long haul 1 
the cast was great 1 
the food is very good for your typical bar food 1 
i wish i could enter negative values admins 0 
you wont regret it 1 
treo and tmobile refused to replace it again and forced me to buy another phone without any kind of upgrade discount 0 
other than that the leather is nice and soft the fit is very tight the cut out for the face is a good shape 1 
i especially liked the noncliche choices with the parents in other movies i could predict the dialog verbatim but the writing in this movie made better selections 1 
the sweet potato tots were good but the onion rings were perfection or as close as i have had 1 
also notable is john baileys fine crisp beautifully colored cinematography and the great production design costumes by eiko ishioka who went on to do the memorable costumes for coppolas dracula for which she received a well deserved oscar 1 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
cute quaint simple honest 1 
by this time our side of the restaurant was almost empty so there was no excuse 0 
it came free with a dvd player i bought but i still turned the thing off halfway through because i was embarrassed for howell 0 
awesome device 1 
this is one of the worst sandra bullock movie since speed 2 but not quite that bad 0 
cant say enough good things about this place 1 
the lines the cuts the audio everything is wrong 0 
great audio 1 
all in all id expected a better consumer experience from motorola 0 
the noise shield is incrediable 1 
i bought this battery with a coupon from amazon and im very happy with my purchase 1 
the pizza selections are good 1 
loved the casting of jimmy buffet as the science teacher 1 
best of all is the rotating feature very helpful 1 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
i thought errol flynn was brilliant as custer and has since become my favourite actor 1 
o my gosh the best phone i have ever had 1 
then a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use 0 
very easy to use 1 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
very funny 1 
this place is pretty good nice little vibe in the restaurant 1 
id say that would be the hardest decision honestly all of ms dishes taste how they are supposed to taste amazing 1 
you truly take this journey through the eyes and soul of a child 1 
very friendly staff 1 
does not fit 0 
what makes this story different are the terrific production values faultless photography composition and editing the terrific casting the underappreciated brian keith playing a bully teddy and vivid history 1 
i could not stand to even watch it for very long for fear of losing iq 0 
dessert panna cotta was amazing 1 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
the only suspense i was feeling was the frustration at just how retarded the girls were 0 
it deserves strong love 1 
highly recommended a 1 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
the 12 mega pixel camera being a part of a phone is reasonably good7 1 
crash is a depressing little nothing that provokes emotion but teaches you nothing if you already know racism and prejudice are bad things 0 
the bottowm lineanother worthless cheap gimmick from sprint 0 
the movie is terribly boring in places 0 
i did not expect this to be so good 1 
avoid this one if you can 0 
ordered a double cheeseburger got a single patty that was falling apart picture uploaded yeah still sucks 0 
lasted one day and then blew up 0 
this movie was kind of long in length but i enjoyed every minute of it 1 
but now i was completely grossed out 0 
the crêpe was delicate and thin and moist 1 
i went on motorolas website and followed all directions but could not get it to pair again 0 
after arguing with verizon regarding the dropped calls we returned the phones after two days 0 
i really dont see how anyone could enjoy this movie 0 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
its a gloriously fun fast paced and fairly accurate portrayal of the night of a raver 1 
but it picked up speed and got right to the point 1 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
the concert sequences just sucked 0 
i wouldnt see this movie again for free 0 
the sweet potato tots were good but the onion rings were perfection or as close as i have had 1 
all i can do is whine on the internet so here it goesthe more i use the thing the less i like it 0 
my fiancé and i came in the middle of the day and we were greeted and seated right away 1 
i immediately said i wanted to talk to the manager but i did not want to talk to the guy who was doing shots of fireball behind the bar 0 
talk about useless customer service 0 
the jerky camera movements were also annoying 0 
there is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again 0 
i literally vomited while watching this film 0 
you share general loewenhielms exquisite joy in his partaking of the cailles en sarcophage even though you are just watching a movie but you do wish for just a small sample to savor 1 
the whole experience was underwhelming and i think well just go to ninja sushi next time 0 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
omg the food was delicioso 1 
in a word it is embarrassing 0 
a happy wonderful feel good ending 1 
i got it because it was so small and adorable 1 
it was awesome 1 
of course the acting is blah 0 
the chicken wings contained the driest chicken meat i have ever eaten 0 
often the dialogue doesnt really follow from one line to another or fit the surroundings 0 
the atmosphere is modern and hip while maintaining a touch of coziness 1 
artless camerawork endlessly presents us with the ugliest setting imaginable ie 0 
ryans bar is definitely one edinburgh establishment i wont be revisiting 0 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
the songs were the best and the muppets were so hilarious 1 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
i struggle to find anything bad to say about it 1 
i went on motorolas website and followed all directions but could not get it to pair again 0 
im not sure what he was trying to do with this film 0 
its just adorable seeing mickey playing turkey in the straw in a highly imaginative if occasionally cruel way 1 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
my drink was never empty and he made some really great menu suggestions 1 
the potatoes were like rubber and you could tell they had been made up ahead of time being kept under a warmer 0 
this is a masterful piece of filmmaking with many themes simmering and occasionally boiling over in this warts and all study of the poets bohemian selfindulgent wartime years that span the aerial bombardments of london and the outward tranquillity of a welsh coastal retreat the borderlines between friendship lust and love dedication to art and experience versus practical concerns jealousy rivalry cowardice and egotism versus heroism and selfsacrifice and more 1 
if this premise sound stupid thats because it is 0 
it is an insane game 1 
regrettably the film fails 0 
we watched our waiter pay a lot more attention to other tables and ignore us 0 
disappointment i hate anything that goes in my ear 0 
we wont be returning 0 
the transfers are very good 1 
yes its shiny on front side and i love it 1 
an amazing finale to possibly the best trilogy of all time 1 
nice quality build unlike some cheap s out there 1 
tied to charger for conversations lasting more than 45 minutesmajor problems 0 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
i totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is 1 
absolutely great 1 
the text messaging feature is really tricky to use 0 
sooooo good 1 
it looked like a wonderful story 1 
very disappointing 0 
however i needed some better instructions 0 
the food is not tasty at all not to say its real traditional hunan style 0 
food was so gooodd 1 
the stories were as unbelievable as the actors 0 
the sweet potato tots were good but the onion rings were perfection or as close as i have had 1 
the burger is good beef cooked just right 1 
we wont be returning 0 
battery life is real good 1 
almost all of the songs in cover girl are oldfashioned and not very tuneful 0 
its a feelgood film and thats how i felt when i came out of the cinema 1 
i vomited in the bathroom mid lunch 0 
its pretty easy 1 
this place is amazing 1 
putting the race card aside lets look at the major flaw in the film they destroy latifas character 0 
they are so cool 1 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
the waitress and manager are so friendly 1 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
this is some seriously good pizza and im an expertconnisseur on the topic 1 
but whatever it was that cost them so much it didnt translate to quality thats for sure 0 
my sanyo has survived dozens of drops on blacktop without ill effect 1 
2 thumbs up 1 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
yet i enjoy watching it 1 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
i came back today since they relocated and still not impressed 0 
i get absolutely horrible reception in my apartment where with other phones i have not had this problem 0 
great phone 1 
it looked like a wonderful story 1 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
it works fine on my motorola 325 cellphone and a lot better than the wornout battery did 1 
schrader has made a resume full of lousy amateurish films 0 
all in all im quite satisfied with this purchase 1 
every time he opened his mouth you expect to hear you see kids pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show 0 
what a waste of money and time 0 
excellent dualpurpose headset 1 
the atmosphere was great with a lovely duo of violinists playing songs we requested 1 
he also came back to check on us regularly excellent service 1 
ray charles is legendary 1 
my boyfriend and i came here for the first time on a recent trip to vegas and could not have been more pleased with the quality of food and service 1 
then a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use 0 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
i would definitely recommend the jabra bt250v for those who are looking for comfort clarity and a great price 1 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
i am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this 1 
the ambiance was incredible 1 
i would advise to not purchase this item it never worked very well 0 
you can find better movies at youtube 0 
speaking of the music it is unbearably predictably and kitchy 0 
the films sole bright spot was jonah hill who will look almost unrecognizable to fans of the recent superbad due to the amount of weight he lost in the interim 1 
and the chef was generous with his time even came around twice so we can take pictures with him 1 
kris kristoffersen is good in this movie and really makes a difference 1 
i cant see how this movie can be an inspiration to anyone to come out or overcome fear and rejection 0 
it is just the sort of pap that is screened in the afternoon to punish the unemployed for not having jobs 0 
in a word it is embarrassing 0 
a good quality bargain i bought this after i bought a cheapy from big lots that sounded awful and people on the other end couldnt hear me 1 
i will continue to come here on ladies night andddd date night highly recommend this place to anyone who is in the area 1 
my friend did not like his bloody mary 0 
it is so small and you dont even realize that it is there after a while of getting used to it 1 
seriously its not worth wasting your or your kids time on 0 
the 12 mega pixel camera being a part of a phone is reasonably good7 1 
i am pairing this with my iphone and i could not be happier with it so far 1 
i ordered albondigas soup which was just warm and tasted like tomato soup with frozen meatballs 0 
i have had problems wit hit dropping signal and more 0 
the worst phone from samsungcrap this crappy samsung e715 is the worst i have ever seeen 0 
emily watsons character is very strong and she has only to give a quick glance and you understand everything 1 
i liked it 1 
everything was good and tasty 1 
this is an unbelievable bargain 1 
2 thumbs up 1 
but whatever it was that cost them so much it didnt translate to quality thats for sure 0 
hayao miyazakis latest and eighth film for studio ghibili gake no ue no ponyo ponyo on the cliff by the sea is a wonderfully fun and imaginative look at childhood 1 
after my phone got to be about a year old its been slowly breaking despite much care on my part 0 
i vomited in the bathroom mid lunch 0 
maybe if they werent cold they would have been somewhat edible 0 
its a total package 1 
spend your money and time some place else 0 
not easy to watch 0 
the soundtrack sucked 0 
battery life is real good 1 
this place is awesome if you want something light and healthy during the summer 1 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
the scenes are often funny and occasionally touching as the characters evaluate their lives and where they are going 1 
i have had problems wit hit dropping signal and more 0 
the restaurant atmosphere was exquisite 1 
oh and i forgot to also mention the weird color effect it has on your phone 0 
great pocket pc phone combination 1 
the service was a little slow considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace 0 
i keep watching it over and over 1 
good protection and does not make phone too bulky 1 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
i was amazed at the quick arrival of the two original lg cell phone batteries and and at a fraction of the price 1 
best headset ever 1 
comfort for our whole family 1 
excellent product for the price 1 
all in all id expected a better consumer experience from motorola 0 
ill be looking for a new earpiece 0 
we sat another ten minutes and finally gave up and left 0 
i wasnt really impressed with strip steak 0 
the attempts at humor were pitiful and story is so awful it dosent bear thinking about which basically involves a vulcan stealing the enterprise to find god seriously i just didnt care about any of this film and oh not to mention uhura does a belly dance to distract male guards 0 
after a year the battery went completely dead on my headset 0 
the eargels channel the sound directly into your ear and seem to increase the sound volume and clarity 1 
i do think tom hanks is a good actor 1 
you also cannot take pictures with it in the case because the lense is covered 0 
total brunch fail 0 
her role was played well 1 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
the ripped banana was not only ripped but petrified and tasteless 0 
frozen pucks of disgust with some of the worst people behind the register 0 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
really bad 0 
great brunch spot 1 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
filmiing was less expansive 0 
i was disgusted because i was pretty sure that was human hair 0 
the tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu 0 
i would definitely recommend the jabra bt250v for those who are looking for comfort clarity and a great price 1 
this movie contained an allstar cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i havent seen before 1 
not enough volume 0 
some may say this buffet is pricey but i think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot 1 
very good though 1 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
not only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic but it also managed to give away the entire movie and im not exaggerating every moment every plot point every joke is told in the trailer 0 
there was hardly any meat 0 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
best tacos in town by far 1 
and those baby owls were adorable 1 
the bathroom is just next door and very nice 1 
it was also the right balance of war and love 1 
if there was ever an indication of a writer and a directors ability to meld two highly volatile temperaments into a seamless union of creativity then this is it 1 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
this is hands down the best phone ive ever had 1 
i had absolutely no problem with this headset linking to my 8530 blackberry curve 1 
its pure brilliance 1 
so i bought about 10 of these and saved alot of money 1 
1010 1 
it just blew 0 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
the camera on the phone may be used as a dustpan when indoors id rather be using a disposable then this 0 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
drinks took close to 30 minutes to come out at one point 0 
honeslty it didnt taste that fresh 0 
do not waste your money here 0 
it is an insane game 1 
nothing at all to recommend 0 
i hate writing bad reviews about films especially those in which i really like the star but this film is so bad i dont believe for one second that anyone could have been proud of it 0 
needless to say i wont be going back anytime soon 0 
very cheap plastic creaks like an old wooden floor 0 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
it is practically useless and did not add any kind of boost to my reception after i bought it 0 
we loved the biscuits 1 
perfect for the ps3 1 
the telephone repair man was really funny and his reactions to the nuts and bitchy boss were truly genuine 1 
attempting artiness with black white and clever camera angles the movie disappointed became even more ridiculous as the acting was poor and the plot and lines almost nonexistent 0 
i probably would not go here again 0 
cinematography noteworthy including fine views of barcelona and its famed gaudi towers 1 
on the up side their cafe serves really good food 1 
terrible phone holder 0 
as many people complained i found this headsets microphone was very weak 0 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
fantastic earphones 1 
schrader has made a resume full of lousy amateurish films 0 
the bipolarity of the ruthless thug one minute a ruthless killer the next minute a luvs diaper commercial is completely unconvincing 0 
the cg opening sequence in space looked like it could have been created on microsoft slideshow for gods sake 0 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
things that went wrong they burned the saganaki 0 
i would definitely recommend the jabra bt250v for those who are looking for comfort clarity and a great price 1 
never again will i be dining at this place 0 
great phone 1 
a great way to finish a great 1 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
favorite place in town for shawarrrrrrma 1 
logitech bluetooth headset is a 10 1 
do not buy do not buyit sucks 0 
some great music and terrific scenery 1 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
the screen does get smudged easily because it touches your ear and face 0 
verizon tech support walked my through a few procedures none of which worked and i ended up having to do a hard reset wiping out all my data 0 
the acting helps the writing along very well maybe the idiotsavant sister could have been played better and it is a real joy to watch 1 
the cast was great 1 
this place is pretty good nice little vibe in the restaurant 1 
ill put this gem up against any movie in terms of screenplay cinematography acting postproduction editing directing or any other aspect of filmmaking 1 
this is a great deal 1 
works well 1 
always a great time at dos gringos 1 
hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in 0 
this is a witty and delightful adaptation of the dr seuss book brilliantly animated by upas finest and thoroughly deserving of its academy award 1 
pretty good beer selection too 1 
it didnt work people can not hear me when i talk 0 
often the dialogue doesnt really follow from one line to another or fit the surroundings 0 
excellent hands free tool 1 
this place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver 0 
the worst piece of crap ever along with the verizon customer service 0 
i cannot believe that the actors agreed to do this film 0 
the volume for the ringer is real good you have choices how loud 1 
great place to relax and have an awesome burger and beer 1 
there is so much good food in vegas that i feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to rice and company 0 
1 hour 54 minutes of sheer tedium melodrama and horrible acting a mess of a script and a sinking feeling of good lord what were they thinking 0 
the art style has the appearance of crayonpencil drawings and is wonderfully colorful and fanciful 1 
nothing at all to recommend 0 
the dialogue is composed of things that make little sense 0 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
not a good bargain 0 
utterly without merit on any level this is akin to torture 0 
reversible plug works great 1 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
also the story and acting were weak 0 
i highly recommend this case 1 
w810i is just superb 1 
waited and waited and waited 0 
only like 3 or 4 buildings used a couple of locations maybe poor hummh 0 
the best phone in market 1 
you cant go wrong with any of the food here 1 
the ending is so so perfect youll shed a tear 1 
this gets a 1 out of 10 simply because theres nothing lower 0 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
good product good seller 1 
i love lane but ive never seen her in a movie this lousy 0 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
its this pandering to the audience that sabotages most of his films 0 
the only thing that i think could improve is the sound leaks out from the headset 0 
tom wilkinson broke my heart at the end and everyone elses judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike 1 
its a feelgood film and thats how i felt when i came out of the cinema 1 
i gave it a 10 1 
i would recommend purchasing the jabra jx10 series 2 which works flawlessly with my moto q go figure 1 
it shouldnt take 30 min for pancakes and eggs 0 
either way it sucks 0 
glad i didnt pay to see it 0 
all the characters in this film are tremendously well played 1 
if you hate earbugs avoid this phone by all means 0 
i had heard good things about this place but it exceeding every hope i could have dreamed of 1 
the restaurant is very clean and has a family restaurant feel to it 1 
however after seeing the short again after about 25 years i was amazed at how timeless the film actually is 1 
not loud enough and doesnt turn on like it should 0 
i want to first say our server was great and we had perfect service 1 
its too bad the food is so damn generic 0 
greatno problems at all 1 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
it works fine on my motorola 325 cellphone and a lot better than the wornout battery did 1 
the service here is fair at best 0 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
the cashew cream sauce was bland and the vegetables were undercooked 0 
worst hour and a half of my lifeoh my gosh 0 
save your money ive had this item for 11 months now 0 
the plot simply rumbles on like a machine desperately depending on the addition of new scenes 0 
it never condescends all the characters have good genuine hearts and believable problems 1 
its really easy 1 
brilliant 1 
frankly after cotton club and unfaithful it was kind of embarrassing to watch lane and gere in this film because it is bad 0 
thanks good a movie like this was done and released 1 
these were so good we ordered them twice 1 
the only thing worse than taylors acting was stanwycks singing 0 
you could drive a semi truck into these holes 0 
dont go here 0 
if that bug never showed up i would have given a 4 for sure but on the other side of the wall where this bug was climbing was the kitchen 0 
of all the dishes the salmon was the best but all were great 1 
the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach 0 
the film has an ultracheap look to it 0 
a usable keyboard actually turns a pda into a realworld useful machine instead of just a neat gadget 1 
i had heard good things about this place but it exceeding every hope i could have dreamed of 1 
the salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop which was perfectly cooked 1 
rude inconsiderate management 0 
i love it 1 
works for me 1 
overall i am psyched to have a phone which has all my appointments and contacts in and gets great reception 1 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
also the story and acting were weak 0 
the characters are interesting and you want to find out more about them the longer the movie goes on and i think people will be surprised by who does and doesnt make it 1 
this scene is very strong and unpleasant 0 
this particular model would not work with my motorola q smartphone 0 
good protection and does not make phone too bulky 1 
i highly recommend this movie for anyone interested in art poetry theater politics or japanese history 1 
the ambiance isnt much better 0 
the waiter wasnt helpful or friendly and rarely checked on us 0 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
this is an excellent tool especially when paired with your phones autoanswer 1 
today the graphics are crap 0 
i totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is 1 
dont buy this product 0 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
the volume switch rocketed out of the unit to a destination unknown 0 
it kept getting worse and worse so now im officially done 0 
very disappointed in accessoryone 0 
it feels poorly constructed the menus are difficult to navigate and the buttons are so recessed that it is difficult to push them 0 
the pan cakes everyone are raving about taste like a sugary disaster tailored to the palate of a six year old 0 
which has more depth and character than the man underneath it 0 
hackneyed writing certainly but made even worse by the bad directing 0 
overall the film is interesting and thoughtprovoking 1 
the soundtrack wasnt terrible either 1 
but when i check voice mail at night the keypad backlight turns off a few seconds into the first message and then im lost 0 
they do not last forever but is not overly expensive to replaceeasy to operate and the sound is much better than others i have tried 1 
these products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet 0 
it was a pale color instead of nice and char and has no flavor 0 
voice recognition is tremendous 1 
great food and awesome service 1 
uncomfortable in the ear dont use with lg vx9900 env 0 
that said our mouths and bellies were still quite pleased 1 
i had a seriously solid breakfast here 1 
the worst sappiest dialogue i could go on and on 0 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
aside from its terrible lead this film has loads of other debits 0 
worth every penny 1 
they will customize your order any way youd like my usual is eggplant with green bean stir fry love it 1 
very true to shakespear and a must for all shakespear fans 1 
rude inconsiderate management 0 
if you look for authentic thai food go else where 0 
also if your phone is dropped this case is not going to save it specially when dropped face down 0 
a cheap and cheerless heist movie with poor characterisation lots of underbite style stoic emoting think chow yun fat in a better tomorrow and some cheesy clichés thrown into an abandoned factory ready for a few poorly executed flying judo rolls a la john woo 0 
no complaints 1 
better than youd expect 1 
i might have gotten a defect but i would not risk buying it again because of the built quality alone 0 
couldnt use the unit with sunglasses not good in texas 0 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
i had the mac salad and it was pretty bland so i will not be getting that again 0 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
camerawork again bad 0 
definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly will return next time im in vegas 1 
i sat riveted to the tv screen 1 
i could care less the interior is just beautiful 1 
unreliable im giving up 0 
not too screamy not to masculine but just right 1 
just what i wanted 1 
would not go back 0 
wont work right or atleast for me 0 
would not go back 0 
the burger i got the gold standard a 17 burger and was kind of disappointed 0 
an hour and a half i wish i could bring back 0 
what happened next was prettyoff putting 0 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
for a self proclaimed coffee cafe i was wildly disappointed 0 
delicious nyc bagels good selections of cream cheese real lox with capers even 1 
if you want a real scare rent this one 1 
bacon is hella salty 1 
both the hot sour the egg flower soups were absolutely 5 stars 1 
then our food came out disappointment ensued 0 
made very sturdy 1 
there was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters 0 
arrived quickly and much less expensive than others being sold 1 
terrible service 0 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
it defeats the purpose of a bluetooth headset 0 
i love this cable it allows me to connect any miniusb device to my pc 1 
so i am here to warn youdo not rent this movie it is the dumbest thing you have never seen 0 
i had a pretty satifying experience 1 
everything was fresh and delicious 1 
i really dont see how anyone could enjoy this movie 0 
sounds good reasonably priced and effective its that simple 1 
for a self proclaimed coffee cafe i was wildly disappointed 0 
the camera really likes her in this movie 1 
itll be a regular stop on my trips to phoenix 1 
it did not work in my cell phone plug i am very up set with the charger 0 
they were goldencrispy and delicious 1 
which has more depth and character than the man underneath it 0 
this is probably one of the least effective and utterly unoriginal films i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
i have yet to run this new battery below two bars and thats three days without charging 1 
service is perfect and the family atmosphere is nice to see 1 
the crêpe was delicate and thin and moist 1 
come hungry leave happy and stuffed 1 
spend your money and time some place else 0 
food was really boring 0 
this is was due to the fact that it took 20 minutes to be acknowledged then another 35 minutes to get our foodand they kept forgetting things 0 
i can take a little bad service but the food sucks 0 
i have eaten here multiple times and each time the food was delicious 1 
he also came back to check on us regularly excellent service 1 
after one bite i was hooked 1 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
i bought this battery with a coupon from amazon and im very happy with my purchase 1 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
its so stupid to have to keep buying new chargers car chargers cradles headphones and car kits every time a new phone comes out 0 
it was too predictable even for a chick flick 0 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
i cannot make calls at certain places 0 
i exchanged the sony ericson z500a for this and im pretty happy with that decision 1 
we waited for thirty minutes to be seated although there were 8 vacant tables and we were the only folks waiting 0 
horrible had to switch 3 times 0 
sending it back 0 
great price too 1 
their menu is diverse and reasonably priced 1 
she ordered a toasted english muffin that came out untoasted 0 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
its one of the movies i need to see whenever it comes on tvnever mind the fact that i already have it memorized 1 
i give it 2 thumbs down 0 
at any rate this film stinks its not funny and fulci should have stayed with giallo and supernatural zombie movies 0 
the vegetables are so fresh and the sauce feels like authentic thai 1 
overall a great experience 1 
happy so far 1 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
the budget was evidently very limited 0 
i have tried these cables with my computer and my ipod and it works just fine 1 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
the malta settings are as dry and as barren as the dialogue 0 
try them in the airport to experience some tasty food and speedy friendly service 1 
the acting was bad 0 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
really awful 0 
things happen characters personalities change plot twists occur for no real reason other than that script calls for it 0 
if this premise sound stupid thats because it is 0 
with great sound effects and impressive special effects i cant recommend this movie enough 1 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
the steak was amazingrge fillet relleno was the best seafood plate i have ever had 1 
poor talk time performance 0 
for service i give them no stars 0 
but storm trooper is not even bad enough to make it to the list of wonderfully terrible movies 0 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
i was totally fascinated by the music the dancing everything 1 
do not make the same mistake as me 0 
i always order from the vegetarian menu during dinner which has a wide array of options to choose from 1 
now the pizza itself was good the peanut sauce was very tasty 1 
i went to bachi burger on a friends recommendation and was not disappointed 1 
i liked this movie way too much 1 
i was shocked because no signs indicate cash only 0 
i have to use the smallest earpieces provided but it stays on pretty well 1 
i just wanted to leave 0 
the fries were great too 1 
things happen characters personalities change plot twists occur for no real reason other than that script calls for it 0 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
went in for happy hour great list of wines 1 
i dont have to be an accountant to know im getting screwed 0 
this is one of the worst sandra bullock movie since speed 2 but not quite that bad 0 
overall i rate this movie a 10 out of a 110 scale 1 
best headset ever 1 
while you dont yet hear mickey speak there are tons of sound effects and music throughout the filmsomething we take for granted now but which was a huge crowd pleaser in 1928 1 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
lame would be the best way to describe it 0 
took an hour to get our food only 4 tables in restaurant my food was luke warm our sever was running around like he was totally overwhelmed 0 
this is a simple little phone to use but the breakage is unacceptible 0 
drinks took close to 30 minutes to come out at one point 0 
lately they have been extremely nice and helpful on the phone 1 
this was my first time and i cant wait until the next 1 
lifetime does not air it enough so if anyone knows what store sells it let me know because this is a musthave 1
