the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
the nano stated itmy son was dissapointed 0 
this is a good battery and it got here really fast 1 
why are these sad little vegetables so overcooked 0 
rude inconsiderate management 0 
worst service to boot but that is the least of their worries 0 
his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic 1 
its not what it says it is 0 
she carries the movie well 1 
poor product 0 
this was like the final blow 0 
ive had this for nearly 2 years and it has worked great for me 1 
great pocket pc phone combination 1 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
i can say that the desserts were yummy 1 
great product fast shipping 1 
arrived quickly and much less expensive than others being sold 1 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
no plot whatsoever 0 
otherwise dont even waste your time on this 0 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
it doesnt work in europe or asia 0 
phone now holds charge like it did when it was new 1 
people who like european films and art movies will like this movie 1 
the greek dressing was very creamy and flavorful 1 
maybe there would be a reasonable explanation for this atrocity 0 
i wont say any more i dont like spoilers so i dont want to be one but i believe this film is worth your time 1 
talk about great customer service of course we will be back 1 
the crÃªpe was delicate and thin and moist 1 
this mostly routine factbased tv drama gets a boost from the fine performance by cole 1 
keep up the good work amazon 1 
of course the acting is blah 0 
its still wild stuff though and is highly recommended to fans of giallo cinema 1 
omg the food was delicioso 1 
comes with a strong light that you can use to light up your camera shots and even flash sos signals seriously 1 
then scene where they debated whether or not to sack the trumpeter who falsely was accused for the murder is pure horror really stupid 0 
will not be back 0 
great phone 1 
very funny 1 
very very sad 0 
totally believable 1 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
see it with your kids if you have a chanceit will open up some amazing dialog about how far race relations have come in the last 50 years 1 
everything was perfect the night we were in 1 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
great food and great service in a clean and friendly setting 1 
the interplay between martin and emilio contains the same wonderful chemistry we saw in wall street with martin and charlie 1 
ambience is perfect 1 
just really good so far probably the best bt headset i have ever had 1 
great food and awesome service 1 
this totally unfunny movie is so over the top and pathetic and unrealistic that throughout the whole 90 minutes of utter torture i probably looked at my watch about 70000 times 0 
graphics is far from the best part of the game 0 
i highly recommend this device to everyone 1 
great food 1 
the story is lame not interesting and never really explains the sinister origins of the puppets 0 
the burrittos blah 0 
here in the wind and the lion we see a wonderful rendering of americas own imperial age 1 
good audio quality 1 
the kids are very cool too 1 
i wish i could enter negative values admins 0 
the interplay between martin and emilio contains the same wonderful chemistry we saw in wall street with martin and charlie 1 
my husband and i ate lunch here and were very disappointed with the food and service 0 
full of unconvincing cardboard characters it is blandly written by edward chodorov who also produced and is surprisingly directed by jean negulesco from whom one would expect a great deal more 0 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
what a waste of money and time 0 
the chefs were friendly and did a good job 1 
the flair bartenders are absolutely amazing 1 
im not eating here 0 
it deserves strong love 1 
piece of trash 0 
with the originality and freshness of the first movie now spent this remake had little else to offer 0 
i have yet to run this new battery below two bars and thats three days without charging 1 
it really created a unique feeling though 1 
brilliance indeed 1 
if you simply want a small flip phone look elsewhere as the extra bells whistles are mediocre 0 
overall a delight 1 
another thing i didnt really like is when a character got punched in the face a gallon of blood would spew forth soon after 0 
best of all is the rotating feature very helpful 1 
the volume for the ringer is real good you have choices how loud 1 
i great reception all the time 1 
their research and development division obviously knows what theyre doing 1 
enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film 1 
voice quality signal strength dropped calls 0 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
not much seafood and like 5 strings of pasta at the bottom 0 
i dont think well be going back anytime soon 0 
i tried talking real loud but shouting on the telephone gets old and i was still told it wasnt great 0 
utterly without merit on any level this is akin to torture 0 
the food is very good for your typical bar food 1 
great product 1 
buttons are too small 0 
this is a masterful piece of filmmaking with many themes simmering and occasionally boiling over in this warts and all study of the poets bohemian selfindulgent wartime years that span the aerial bombardments of london and the outward tranquillity of a welsh coastal retreat the borderlines between friendship lust and love dedication to art and experience versus practical concerns jealousy rivalry cowardice and egotism versus heroism and selfsacrifice and more 1 
the bose noise cancelling is amazing which is very important for a nyc commuter 1 
the service here leaves a lot to be desired 0 
great pocket pc phone combination 1 
the foreigner is not worth one second of your time 0 
the dialogue sucked 0 
the volume switch rocketed out of the unit to a destination unknown 0 
poorly contstruct hinge 0 
everything was gross 0 
and if that isnt enough of a mess of a movie for you the picture is also marred with a constant use of studio sets and indoor exteriors 0 
do not make the same mistake as me 0 
then i had to continue pairing it periodically since it somehow kept dropping 0 
the movie is not completely perfect but titta di girolamo will stay with you for a long time after the vision of the movie 1 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
this is simply the best bluetooth headset for sound quality 1 
great place to eat reminds me of the little mom and pop shops in the san francisco bay area 1 
an extensive menu provides lots of options for breakfast 1 
thanks good a movie like this was done and released 1 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
the result is a powerhouse achievement made more timely now perhaps because of our cultures disturbing fascination with celebrity and its distorted interpretations of fame 1 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
this is the phone to get for 2005 i just bought my s710a and all i can say is wow 1 
this is the place where i first had pho and it was amazing 1 
ambience is perfect 1 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
waited 2 hours never got either of our pizzas as many other around us who came in later did 0 
how can anyone in their right mind ask for anything more from a movie than this 1 
the bus boy on the other hand was so rude 0 
bad characters bad story and bad acting 0 
battery lasts only a few hours 0 
we had a group of 70 when we claimed we would only have 40 and they handled us beautifully 1 
i hate movies like that 0 
to my disbelief each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods i have ever tasted 0 
utter crap sound quality is terrible 0 
furthermore you cant even find hours of operation on the website 0 
i immediately said i wanted to talk to the manager but i did not want to talk to the guy who was doing shots of fireball behind the bar 0 
mishima is extremely uninteresting 0 
about 30 minutes of footage is wasted to show mediocre elderly actors awkwardly babbling overwrought pseudosatanic gibberish corny enough to make a teen goth blush almost always in olde english and sometimes in latin that may or may not be made up words 0 
which has more depth and character than the man underneath it 0 
it was that year however that reminded us that huston was still at the top of his game as evinced by his faithful adaptation of james joyces acclaimed novella the dead 1 
the steaks are all well trimmed and also perfectly cooked 1 
very comfortable 1 
dont make the same mistake i did 0 
im really disappointed all i have now is a charger that doesnt work 0 
the battery is completely useless to me 0 
generous portions and great taste 1 
i mean in a realistic world she would never have gotten into that ballet repertory the whole thing was quite pathetic 0 
the only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port irda 0 
the only thing i did like was the prime rib and dessert section 1 
every thing on phone work perfectly she like it 1 
this place is horrible and way overpriced 0 
lightweight and works well 1 
i rate this movie 910 1 
im glad i found this product on amazon it is hard to find it wasnt high priced 1 
design flaw 0 
personally i think it shows that people should learn to find a compromise them self without involving other people into issue 1 
mobile phone tools are a must have 1 
i think that it is a must see older john wayne film 1 
50 down the drain 0 
all in all an excellent restaurant highlighted by great service a unique menu and a beautiful setting 1 
first of all there are enough racial stereotypes and racial jokes to offend everyone 0 
i dont think i will be back for a very long time 0 
im using it with an iriver spinn with case and it fits fine 1 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
which is precisely why i am giving it such a bad review 0 
stay away from this store be careful 0 
great character actors telly savalas and peter boyle 1 
beware this is not a trashy cult movie this is trash period 0 
we had 7 at our table and the service was pretty fast 1 
very funny 1 
there is a totally unnecessary trainroller coaster scene 0 
this is definitely one of the better documentaries i have seen looking at family relationships and marriage 1 
piece of junk 0 
the films dialogue is natural real to life 1 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
they could be used as exemplars for any set designer 1 
i connected my wifes bluetoothmotorola hs850 to my phone and it worked like a charm whether the phone was in my pocket or the case 1 
i really enjoyed crema cafÃ© before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
dont do it 0 
this is a great little item 1 
w810i is just superb 1 
the potatoes were like rubber and you could tell they had been made up ahead of time being kept under a warmer 0 
great phone 1 
both actors truly understand and become their particular character delivering a convincing sincere performance 1 
this movie contained an allstar cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i havent seen before 1 
the service was extremely slow 0 
food was so gooodd 1 
it crackles with an unpredictable youthful energy but honestly i found it hard to follow and concentrate on it meanders so badly 0 
in a word it is embarrassing 0 
they never brought a salad we asked for 0 
steamboat willie is an amazingly important film to our cinema history 1 
id advise anyone to go and see it 1 
much more interesting more action more suspense and less of the unneeded controversy 1 
these headphones were a great find and i think they are perhaps the best purchase ive made in the last several years seriously 1 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
my experience was terrible this was my fourth bluetooth headset and while it was much more comfortable than my last jabra which i hated 0 
made very sturdy 1 
another thing i didnt really like is when a character got punched in the face a gallon of blood would spew forth soon after 0 
comfortable nice range good battery life 1 
check it out 1 
ive missed numerous calls because of this reason 0 
it lasts less than 3o minutes if i actually try to use the phonemy wife has the same phone with the same problem 0 
then i watched it again two sundays ago march 20th 2005 and i began to really enjoy it and this time i taped the entire thing 1 
the steak was amazingrge fillet relleno was the best seafood plate i have ever had 1 
overall a delight 1 
elias koteasjack palance play good roles angelina is hot and gets nakedbilly drago appears in this and is cool as usual a cameo by sven ole thorsen helps make this a very enjoyable movie with good acting and a decent budget 1 
wasted two hours 0 
avoid this establishment 0 
ive had better not only from dedicated boba tea spots but even from jenni pho 0 
by the time the film ended i not only disliked it i despised it 0 
awful service 0 
okay i like to consider myself a fair critic so ill give credit where credits duethe creature effects were actually pretty cool 1 
this is was due to the fact that it took 20 minutes to be acknowledged then another 35 minutes to get our foodand they kept forgetting things 0 
i was able to do voice dialing in the car with no problem 1 
i advise everyone do not be fooled 0 
made very sturdy 1 
for service i give them no stars 0 
started watching this but didnt believe in any of the characters 0 
cant say enough good things about this place 1 
did not like at all 0 
it really created a unique feeling though 1 
i dont think it would hold it too securly on your belt 0 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
dont buy this product 0 
this was reflected not only in the cast but also in the belowpar script which borrowed much from the earlier classic 0 
it always cuts out and makes a beep beep beep sound then says signal failed 0 
buttons are too small 0 
the scallop dish is quite appalling for value as well 0 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
i think not again 0 
i have had problems wit hit dropping signal and more 0 
the sweet potato tots were good but the onion rings were perfection or as close as i have had 1 
it is easy to turn on and off when you are in the car and the volume controls are quite accessable 1 
very clear quality sound and you dont have to mess with the sound on your ipod since you have the sound buttons on the headset 1 
the attempts at humor were pitiful and story is so awful it dosent bear thinking about which basically involves a vulcan stealing the enterprise to find god seriously i just didnt care about any of this film and oh not to mention uhura does a belly dance to distract male guards 0 
highly unprofessional and rude to a loyal patron 0 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
too bad cause i know its family owned i really wanted to like this place 0 
i probably would not go here again 0 
the good cinematography also makes her and monica bellucci look very beautiful 1 
bad quality 0 
one of the best mexican movies ever and one of the less understood even by mexican themselves no matter how identified the should have felt with it 1 
lot of holes in the plot theres nothing about how he became the emperor nothing about where he spend 20 years between his childhood and mature age 0 
i always order from the vegetarian menu during dinner which has a wide array of options to choose from 1 
how can you call yourself a steakhouse if you cant properly cook a steak i dont understand 0 
the restaurant atmosphere was exquisite 1 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
excellent sound quality 1 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
i had to wait over 30 minutes to get my drink and longer to get 2 arepas 0 
the headset fulfills my requirements so i am happy with my purchase 1 
bluetooth range is good a few days ago i left my phone in the trunk got a call and carried the conversation without a hitch 1 
the best phone in market 1 
because both ears are occupied background is not distracting at all 1 
i rate this movie 910 1 
in an interesting part of town this place is amazing 1 
works great 1 
bad day or not i have a very low tolerance for rude customer service people it is your job to be nice and polite wash dishes otherwise 0 
it makes very strange ticking noises before it ends the call 0 
maybe there would be a reasonable explanation for this atrocity 0 
everything was gross 0 
definitely a bargain 1 
please dont waste your money 0 
the best place to go for a tasty bowl of pho 1 
the poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying 0 
good show samsung 1 
in particular the relationship between the bakery assistant and the waitress just didnt work for me at all 0 
we thought youd have to venture further away to get good sushi but this place really hit the spot that night 1 
dont waste your time 0 
eclectic selection 1 
truly awful 0 
there are the usual hitchcock logic flaws 0 
youll love it 1 
i am also very happy with the price 1 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
the food came out at a good pace 1 
my wife had the lobster bisque soup which was lukewarm 0 
i as well wouldve given godfathers zero stars if possible 0 
they are so cool 1 
one of the worst shows of all time 0 
it makes very strange ticking noises before it ends the call 0 
i will come back here every time im in vegas 1 
all in all id expected a better consumer experience from motorola 0 
this is some seriously good pizza and im an expertconnisseur on the topic 1 
good audio quality 1 
i had verizon 2 years ago and really liked their service 1 
the meat was pretty dry i had the sliced brisket and pulled pork 0 
makes it easier to keep up with my bluetooth when im not wearing it 0 
that said our mouths and bellies were still quite pleased 1 
great character actors telly savalas and peter boyle 1 
if you look for authentic thai food go else where 0 
the only good thing was our waiter he was very helpful and kept the bloddy marys coming 1 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
he cant act one of the least scary villains i have ever seen he cant write did he write this damn movie in his sleep 0 
dont buy this product 0 
reception is terrible and full of static 0 
thats how id describe this painfully dreary timewaster of a film 0 
its a sad movie but very good 1 
i have been very happy with the 510 and have had no complaints from any one regarding my sound quality on their end 1 
as for the service im a fan because its quick and youre being served by some nice folks 1 
the bt headset was such a disapoinment 0 
the art style has the appearance of crayonpencil drawings and is wonderfully colorful and fanciful 1 
the spaghetti is nothing special whatsoever 0 
first time going but i think i will quickly become a regular 1 
great product and price 1 
the music in the film is really nice too 1 
kieslowski never ceases to amaze me 1 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
all in all i think it was a good investment 1 
ive dropped my phone more times than i can say even on concrete and my phone is still great knock on wood 1 
the phone is sturdy and waterproof 1 
great product and price 1 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
if you havent choked in your own vomit by the end by all the cheap drama and worthless dialogue youve must have bored yourself to death with this waste of time 0 
his performance is simply genius 1 
the inside is really quite nice and very clean 1 
kids pizza is always a hit too with lots of great side dish options for the kiddos 1 
kris kristoffersen is good in this movie and really makes a difference 1 
the service was a little slow considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace 0 
unfortunately it will not recharge my iphone 4s despite connecting it from multiple power sources imac external battery wall outlet etc 0 
the mic is great 1 
i swung in to give them a try but was deeply disappointed 0 
i dont understand how this garbage got on the shelves of the movie store its not even a real movie 0 
one more thing i can tolerate political incorrectness very well im all for artistic freedom and suspension of disbelief but the slavic female character was just too much 0 
to my disbelief each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods i have ever tasted 0 
this item worked great but it broke after 6 months of use 0 
took an hour to get our food only 4 tables in restaurant my food was luke warm our sever was running around like he was totally overwhelmed 0 
the ending is so so perfect youll shed a tear 1 
battery lasts only a few hours 0 
lovely little thriller from hitchcock with lots of nice shenanigans surrounding a murdered spy a kidnapped child a nasty church a foreign plot and some random taxidermists 1 
my sanyo has survived dozens of drops on blacktop without ill effect 1 
im translating movies for a living and this is the first movie in my 5year working experience that i found offensive to my intelligence 0 
i liked the patio and the service was outstanding 1 
they have horrible attitudes towards customers and talk down to each one when customers dont enjoy their food 0 
the movie was so boring that i sometimes found myself occupied peaking in the paper instead of watching never happened during a columbo movie before 0 
my gyro was basically lettuce only 0 
the price is reasonable and the service is great 1 
a happy wonderful feel good ending 1 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani Â particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
but then they came back cold 0 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
i got the aluminum case for my new palm vx and it worked really wellit has protected my handheld perfectly so far 1 
i keep watching it over and over 1 
it looses connection to the phone even when it is within a couple feet between the two 0 
it had some average acting from the main person and it was a low budget as you clearly can see 0 
it was either too cold not enough flavor or just bad 0 
weve have gotten a much better service from the pizza place next door than the services we received from this restaurant 0 
for a product that costs as much as this one does i expect it to work far better and with greater ease than this thing does 0 
horrible dont waste your time and money 0 
great sound and service 1 
my husband said she was very rude did not even apologize for the bad food or anything 0 
it isnt even an achievement as a sobaditsgood or sobaditsmemorable movie 0 
i didnt want the clip going over the top of my ear causing discomfort 0 
very well made and fits my surefire gx2 perfectly 1 
it was that year however that reminded us that huston was still at the top of his game as evinced by his faithful adaptation of james joyces acclaimed novella the dead 1 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
all in all id expected a better consumer experience from motorola 0 
it is so small and you dont even realize that it is there after a while of getting used to it 1 
the cast was great 1 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
they refuse to refund or replace 0 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
other than that the leather is nice and soft the fit is very tight the cut out for the face is a good shape 1 
good audio quality 1 
he cant act one of the least scary villains i have ever seen he cant write did he write this damn movie in his sleep 0 
must have been an off night at this place 0 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
everything stinks 0 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
the sound quality is excellent as well 1 
the noise shield is incrediable 1 
similarly the delivery man did not say a word of apology when our food was 45 minutes late 0 
the lines the cuts the audio everything is wrong 0 
however this didnt make up for the fact that overall this was a tremendously boring movie 0 
the staff was very attentive 1 
main thing i didnt enjoy is that the crowd is of older crowd around mid 30s and up 0 
makes it easier to keep up with my bluetooth when im not wearing it 0 
the jamaican mojitos are delicious 1 
highly unprofessional and rude to a loyal patron 0 
lucy bell is so much higher than this crap and for her to sink this low is quite depressing 0 
on the good side the staff was genuinely pleasant and enthusiastic a real treat 1 
i was very excited to get this headset because i thought it was really cute 1 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
i really enjoyed crema cafÃ© before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
this place is amazing 1 
very prompt service 1 
food was so gooodd 1 
well im satisfied 1 
not tasty and the texture was just nasty 0 
to my disbelief each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods i have ever tasted 0 
i understand that its supposed to be a cheap popcorn comedy but that doesnt mean that it has to completely insult our intelligence and have writing so incredibly hackneyed that it borders on offensive 0 
i received my headset in good time and was happy with it 1 
worth every penny 1 
i was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar not only because the quality is great but the service is fast and the food impeccable 1 
the charger worked for about a week and then completely stopped charging my phone 0 
you can watch them preparing the delicious food 1 
the acting was bad the dialogs were extremely shallow and insincere 0 
the management is rude 0 
im not really sure how joeys was voted best hot dog in the valley by readers of phoenix magazine 0 
the only thing i wasnt too crazy about was their guacamole as i dont like it purÃ©ed 0 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
i highly recommend these and encourage people to give them a try 1 
the plot well i said id let that one go 0 
service is perfect and the family atmosphere is nice to see 1 
good beer drink selection and good food selection 1 
started watching this but didnt believe in any of the characters 0 
how this piece of trash was ever released is beyond me the acting the story the characters the supposedly special effects etcits all wrong 0 
the biggest complaint i have is the battery drains superfast 0 
that was done in the second movie 0 
the script is was there a script 0 
this was my first time and i cant wait until the next 1 
it was absolutely amazing 1 
linksys should have some way to exchange a bad phone for a refurb unit or something 0 
it is unusable in a moving car at freeway speed 0 
this movie does an excellent job of revealing the complexity of the task and the incredible challenges facing south africa 1 
they refuse to refund or replace 0 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
this was a different cut than the piece the other day but still wonderful and tender s well as well flavored 1 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
not much dialogue not much music the whole film was shot as elaborately and aesthetically like a sculpture 1 
fantastic earphones 1 
the sound quality is good and functionality is awesome 1 
this is one of peter watkins most accessible films 1 
it is simple to use and i like it 1 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
so badwellits just bad 0 
the service here leaves a lot to be desired 0 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
this place is like chipotle but better 1 
the least said about the acting the better 0 
really ugly 0 
a lot of websites have been rating this a very good phone and so do i 1 
great choice 1 
doesnt work at all i bougth it for my l7c and its not working 0 
the camera really likes her in this movie 1 
i would have given no star if i was able 0 
when i placed my treo into the case not only was it not snug but there was a lot of extra room on the sides 0 
for a self proclaimed coffee cafe i was wildly disappointed 0 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvÃ¥g being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
left very frustrated 0 
the kids are annoying 0 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
i love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it 1 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
generally it just lacked imagination 0 
it isnt even an achievement as a sobaditsgood or sobaditsmemorable movie 0 
waitress was a little slow in service 0 
the keyboard is a nice compromise between a full qwerty and the basic cell phone number keypad 1 
excellent starter wireless headset 0 
this place is great 1 
in fact i liked it better than interview with a vampire and i liked this lestat stuart townsend better than cruises attempt 1 
this is was due to the fact that it took 20 minutes to be acknowledged then another 35 minutes to get our foodand they kept forgetting things 0 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
i was deeply impressed with the character he played 1 
the real disappointment was our waiter 0 
ps the only scene in the movie that was cool is when the central character finds her room blown up 1 
i would have given no star if i was able 0 
i waited and waited 0 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
wasted two hours 0 
for the price this was a great deal 1 
food quality has been horrible 0 
the steaks are all well trimmed and also perfectly cooked 1 
do not buy if you want to use the holster 0 
how can that bethe audio quality is poor 0 
yes its that bad 0 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
i have been to very few places to eat that under no circumstances would i ever return to and this tops the list 0 
service stinks here 0 
id advise anyone to go and see it 1 
the meat was pretty dry i had the sliced brisket and pulled pork 0 
left very frustrated 0 
seriously killer hot chai latte 1 
keep up the good work amazon 1 
aside from its terrible lead this film has loads of other debits 0 
each track commands sentiment actually contributing to the scenes and characters 1 
main thing i didnt enjoy is that the crowd is of older crowd around mid 30s and up 0 
i cannot believe that the actors agreed to do this film 0 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
then our food came out disappointment ensued 0 
what the hell kind of crap is that 0 
trying to make a call on these is an exercise in frustration 0 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
service is also cute 1 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
i great reception all the time 1 
it was a great phone 1 
the selection on the menu was great and so were the prices 1 
this is definitely a cult classic well worth viewing and sharing with others 1 
worst phone ever 0 
this early film from future goremeister lucio fulci is a very good addition to the giallo subgenre 1 
it rocked my world and is certainly a must see for anyone with no social or physical outlets 1 
same evening him and i are both drastically sick 0 
poorly contstruct hinge 0 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
a very good film indeed about great and unconditional love 1 
excellent dualpurpose headset 1 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
i got the aluminum case for my new palm vx and it worked really wellit has protected my handheld perfectly so far 1 
you cant relate with them hell you barely can understand them 0 
terrible my car will not accept this cassette 0 
all the bread is made inhouse 1 
i went to bachi burger on a friends recommendation and was not disappointed 1 
i also didnt like the on button it felt like it would crack with use 0 
host staff were for lack of a better word bitches 0 
last night was my second time dining here and i was so happy i decided to go back 1 
excellent product for the price 1 
ive bought 5 wired headphones that sound better than these 0 
its fits like a glove and is strong secure and durable 1 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
this short film certainly pulls no punches 0 
product is useless since it does not have enough charging current to charge the 2 cellphones i was planning to use it with 0 
the movie is littered with overt racial slurs towards the black cast members and in return the whites are depicted as morons and boobs 0 
the service was poor and thats being nice 0 
not much dialogue not much music the whole film was shot as elaborately and aesthetically like a sculpture 1 
great product 1 
phone now holds charge like it did when it was new 1 
this is a great restaurant at the mandalay bay 1 
all things considered a job very well done 1 
before i go in to why i gave a 1 star rating please know that this was my third time eating at bachi burger before writing a review 0 
it was pretty gross 0 
the sets especially designed to work with the camera are amazingstylized beautiful and effective 1 
the han nan chicken was also very tasty 1 
later i found myself lost in the power of the film 1 
from what my dinner companions told meeverything was very fresh with nice texture and taste 1 
the sound quality is excellent as well 1 
this movie is a good and humorous comment on life in 2006 1 
the story unfolds in 18th century jutland and the use of period music played on period instruments is just one more fine touch 1 
the plot well i said id let that one go 0 
however this didnt make up for the fact that overall this was a tremendously boring movie 0 
absolutel junk 0 
the scallop dish is quite appalling for value as well 0 
and considering the two of us left there very full and happy for about 20 you just cant go wrong 1 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
i have two more years left in this contract and i hate this phone 0 
the best place to go for a tasty bowl of pho 1 
it was a riot to see hugo weaving play a sexobsessed gay real estate salesman who uses his clients houses for his trysts with the flaming darren tom hollander 1 
when i saw it in the theater i thought i was going to be sick 0 
do not buy for d807wrongly advertised for d807 0 
not good enough for the price 0 
the use of slowmotion needlessly repeats itself throughout the movie but is well backed up by bad acting and bad is a kind word here no continuity scenes that are thrown in for no reason whatsoever vehicles that looked like they were made from a corn flakes box and a directorial style that bordered on stupidity 0 
they do not care about the consumer one bit 0 
you need two hands to operate the screenthis software interface is decade old and cannot compete with new software designs 0 
the story is beyond stupid 0 
in addition it feels amp looks as if the phone is all lightweight cheap plastic 0 
hands down my favorite italian restaurant 1 
being a 90s child i truly enjoyed this show and i can proudly say that i enjoyed it big time and even more than the classical wb cartoons 1 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
they are so easy to love but even more easy to identify with 1 
we waited for thirty minutes to be seated although there were 8 vacant tables and we were the only folks waiting 0 
a good film by a great director 1 
one more thing i can tolerate political incorrectness very well im all for artistic freedom and suspension of disbelief but the slavic female character was just too much 0 
service sucks 0 
the folks at otto always make us feel so welcome and special 1 
i ended up sliding it on the edge of my pants or back pockets instead 1 
restaurant is always full but never a wait 1 
this is definitely one of the better documentaries i have seen looking at family relationships and marriage 1 
its worth driving up from tucson 1 
everything about it is fine and reasonable for the price ie 1 
back to good bbq lighter fare reasonable pricing and tell the public they are back to the old ways 1 
so for our enjoyment we get to see them run around play games and be dangerous 1 
i saw this short film on hbo the other day and absolutely loved it 1 
i am pairing this with my iphone and i could not be happier with it so far 1 
i did not have any problem with this item and would order it again if needed 1 
hell no will i go back 0 
what possesed me to get this junk i have no idea 0 
otherwise easy to install and use clear sound 1 
the poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying 0 
it doesnt make you look cool 0 
i dont think there are any redeeming qualities in this remake 0 
the meat was pretty dry i had the sliced brisket and pulled pork 0 
i asked multiple times for the wine list and after some time of being ignored i went to the hostess and got one myself 0 
the attractive set used throughout most of the film is an eyepleasing gem 1 
if you havent gone here go now 1 
the plot such as it is is so derivative and predictable that the ending is like a mercy killing 0 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
delicious 1 
there arent death scenes like in previous movies and the fx are terrible 0 
excellent dualpurpose headset 1 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
love this product 1 
wont ever go here again 0 
it features an outlandish array of memorable psychotic but lovable nuts 1 
it is simple to use and i like it 1 
pretty good beer selection too 1 
i love the look and feel of samsung flipphones 1 
the story is lame not interesting and never really explains the sinister origins of the puppets 0 
the sound quality is good and functionality is awesome 1 
excellent cast story line performances 1 
the film gives meaning to the phrase never in the history of human conflict has so much been owed by so many to so few 1 
you get extra minutes so that you can carry out the call and not get cut off 1 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
we waited for thirty minutes to be seated although there were 8 vacant tables and we were the only folks waiting 0 
works as described 1 
the ripped banana was not only ripped but petrified and tasteless 0 
this game rocks 1 
like the other reviewer said you couldnt pay me to eat at this place again 0 
the food was terrible 0 
excellent cast story line performances 1 
comes with a strong light that you can use to light up your camera shots and even flash sos signals seriously 1 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
check it out 1 
it was an inexpensive piece but i would still have expected better quality 0 
i dont like this nokia either 0 
unfortunately we must have hit the bakery on leftover day because everything we ordered was stale 0 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
the food was outstanding and the prices were very reasonable 1 
it really created a unique feeling though 1 
ordered an appetizer and took 40 minutes and then the pizza another 10 minutes 0 
even worse than ticker 0 
the food is not tasty at all not to say its real traditional hunan style 0 
this phone might well be the worst ive ever had in any brand 0 
even allowing for poor production values for the time 1971 and the format some kind of miniseries this is baaaaaad 0 
i really loved the story line and the poler bear was kinda cutebut if anyone has a question about fort steele just ask away 1 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
this movie totally grates on my nerves 0 
ive missed numerous calls because of this reason 0 
fantastic buy and will get again for whatever my next phone is 1 
a pretty good product 1 
the songs were the best and the muppets were so hilarious 1 
we were promptly greeted and seated 1 
even worse than ticker 0 
very prompt service 1 
the sound quality is good and functionality is awesome 1 
this movie does an excellent job of revealing the complexity of the task and the incredible challenges facing south africa 1 
this is so embarassing and also my ears hurt if i try to push the ear plug into my ear 0 
i struggle to find anything bad to say about it 1 
a very very very slowmoving aimless movie about a distressed drifting young man 0 
the lines the cuts the audio everything is wrong 0 
lousy product 0 
by the time the film ended i not only disliked it i despised it 0 
at any rate this film stinks its not funny and fulci should have stayed with giallo and supernatural zombie movies 0 
nice leather 1 
trouble is the writing and directing make it impossible to establish those things that make a movie watchable like character story theme and so on 0 
host staff were for lack of a better word bitches 0 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job 1 
jabra ear gels r the best 1 
gotta love those closeups of slimy drooling teeth 1 
not loud enough and doesnt turn on like it should 0 
its just painful 0 
it was horrible 0 
worst foodservice ive had in a while 0 
then as if i hadnt wasted enough of my life there they poured salt in the wound by drawing out the time it took to bring the check 0 
i left with a stomach ache and felt sick the rest of the day 0 
we also ordered the spinach and avocado salad the ingredients were sad and the dressing literally had zero taste 0 
the buffet at bellagio was far from what i anticipated 0 
the cashier had no care what so ever on what i had to say it still ended up being wayyy overpriced 0 
ill give this film 10 out of 10 1 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
never got it 0 
the only thing i wasnt too crazy about was their guacamole as i dont like it purÃ©ed 0 
both of them were truly unbelievably good and i am so glad we went back 1
