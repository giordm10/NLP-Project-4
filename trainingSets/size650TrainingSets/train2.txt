it features an outlandish array of memorable psychotic but lovable nuts 1 
these are the central themes of the film and they are handled ineptly stereotypically and with no depth of imagination 0 
none of them are engaging or exciting 0 
what a disappointment 0 
the film gives meaning to the phrase never in the history of human conflict has so much been owed by so many to so few 1 
their steaks are 100 recommended 1 
the yellowtail carpaccio was melt in your mouth fresh 1 
after my phone got to be about a year old its been slowly breaking despite much care on my part 0 
i definitly recommend 1 
i probably wont be coming back here 0 
a standout scene 1 
and the sound quality is great 1 
it was too predictable even for a chick flick 0 
linked to my phone without effort 1 
linksys should have some way to exchange a bad phone for a refurb unit or something 0 
last time buying from you 0 
and the sound quality is great 1 
the plot simply rumbles on like a machine desperately depending on the addition of new scenes 0 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
all the characters in this film are tremendously well played 1 
comfortable fit you need your headset to be comfortable for at least an hour at a time if not for an entire day 1 
but this movie is not funny considering the ridiculousness of it 0 
then the film just dropped the ball 0 
doesnt last long 0 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
i could barely stomach the meal but didnt complain because it was a business lunch 0 
after the first charge kept going dead after 12 minutes 0 
waiter was a jerk 0 
this product had a strong rubberpetroleum smell that was unbearable after a while and caused me to return it 0 
the script is horrendously stupid 0 
otherwise easy to install and use clear sound 1 
predictable but not a bad watch 1 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
raw and sublimely moving 1 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
lousy product 0 
sounds good reasonably priced and effective its that simple 1 
excellent performance 1 
absolutely great 1 
they know how to make them here 1 
low quality 0 
not good when wearing a hat or sunglasses 0 
definitely worth seeing its the sort of thought provoking film that forces you to question your own threshold of loneliness 1 
i am very happy 1 
it had some average acting from the main person and it was a low budget as you clearly can see 0 
never got it 0 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
but it wasnt until i watched this film that i realised how great he actually was 1 
his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic 1 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
for 40 bucks a head i really expect better food 0 
all the pretty pictures in the world cannot make up for a piece of work that is flawed at the core 0 
still waiting im sure this item would work well if i ever recieve it 0 
if you do go see this movie bring a pillow or a girlfriendboyfriend to keep you occupied through out 0 
waste of money 0 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
things that went wrong they burned the saganaki 0 
what did bother me was the slow service 0 
good beer drink selection and good food selection 1 
im glad the film didnt go for the most obvious choice as a lesser film certainly would have 1 
it has been a winner for us 1 
i have always used corded headsets and the freedom from the wireless is very helpful 1 
excellent service 1 
that movie was bad 0 
crust is not good 0 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
i had to wait over 30 minutes to get my drink and longer to get 2 arepas 0 
its been my choice headset for yearsgreat sound good volume good noise cancellation 1 
crust is not good 0 
would not reccommend 0 
weird vibe from owners 0 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
about half way through this film i started to dislike it 0 
lately they have been extremely nice and helpful on the phone 1 
then i had to continue pairing it periodically since it somehow kept dropping 0 
the story unfolds in 18th century jutland and the use of period music played on period instruments is just one more fine touch 1 
comfortable fit you need your headset to be comfortable for at least an hour at a time if not for an entire day 1 
the kids are annoying 0 
cool phone 1 
i started this review with two stars but im editing it to give it only one 0 
our server was very nice and even though he looked a little overwhelmed with all of our needs he stayed professional and friendly until the end 1 
im not impressed with the concept or the food 0 
this is essentially a communications tool that does not communicate 0 
i have recommended it to friends 1 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
at around 4 pm i bought it at around 8pm i started to watch at around 815pm i fast forwarded the remaining film to see if there was anything left watchable for a human being with a brain but there wasnt 0 
the least said about the acting the better 0 
i guess it was supposed to be clever twist then shed some light on the situation but it was just stupid 0 
the movie is terribly boring in places 0 
great charger 1 
this is a great deal 1 
it is a joy to use 1 
love this headset 1 
cheap but hey it works was pleasantly suprised given the low cost of this item 1 
the awful dialogue and hopeless overacting by everyone who gets shot top off a real waste of space and time 0 
i mean this in a terrible way 0 
my order was not correct 0 
i believe every one should see this movie as i think few people outside of south africa understand its past and what is being attempted in the truth and reconciliation process 1 
the chicken wings contained the driest chicken meat i have ever eaten 0 
awesome device 1 
however i needed some better instructions 0 
poor voice clarity 0 
really bad 0 
everything stinks 0 
an italian reviewer called this a small great film and thats right 1 
the menu is always changing food quality is going down service is extremely slow 0 
in the span of an hour i had two people exclaim whoa is that the new phone on tv 1 
the nokia ca42 usb cable did not work with my phone 0 
nice design and quality 1 
then theres the plot holes 0 
happy so far 1 
the loudspeaker option is great the bumpers with the lights is very appealing 0 
dont waste your money 0 
it was horrendous 0 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
he deserves 5 stars 1 
not too screamy not to masculine but just right 1 
this is one of peter watkins most accessible films 1 
it defeats the purpose of a bluetooth headset 0 
i loved it it was really scary 1 
i dont think ill be running back to carlys anytime soon for food 0 
lordy the khao soi is a dish that is not to be missed for curry lovers 1 
my sanyo has survived dozens of drops on blacktop without ill effect 1 
i do not know if this was emilio estevezs directorial debut but the pacing the interplay and development of the characters as well as some clever camera work surrounding the character estevez plays all suggest a natural eye 1 
exceptionally bad 0 
tom wilkinson broke my heart at the end and everyone elses judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike 1 
it was just not a fun experience 1 
would not recommend to others 0 
ill even say it again  this is torture 0 
which is precisely why i am giving it such a bad review 0 
not good for the money 0 
a bit predictable 0 
steve martin delivers a really funny performance of a middleaged upper class uptight white guy 1 
great food 1 
the burger is good beef cooked just right 1 
the worst piece of crap ever along with the verizon customer service 0 
but what really made it unwatchable was the direction 0 
oh yeah and the storyline was pathetic too 0 
i love lane but ive never seen her in a movie this lousy 0 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
the food came out at a good pace 1 
despite the pans of reviewers i liked this movie 1 
these are the nicest restaurant owners ive ever come across 1 
i will not return 0 
steve martin delivers a really funny performance of a middleaged upper class uptight white guy 1 
bland and flavorless is a good way of describing the barely tepid meat 0 
i saw this short film on hbo the other day and absolutely loved it 1 
so anyone near you will hear part of your conversation 0 
great pork sandwich 1 
my friend did not like his bloody mary 0 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
worst thai ever 0 
we watched our waiter pay a lot more attention to other tables and ignore us 0 
in particular the relationship between the bakery assistant and the waitress just didnt work for me at all 0 
the characters are interesting and you want to find out more about them the longer the movie goes on and i think people will be surprised by who does and doesnt make it 1 
buyerbe very careful 0 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
price is good too 1 
they dropped more than the ball 0 
great audio 1 
his performance as awarded was stunning 1 
this place is pretty good nice little vibe in the restaurant 1 
cant say enough good things about this place 1 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
i was particularly pleased with the acting ability of dwight schultz 1 
im translating movies for a living and this is the first movie in my 5year working experience that i found offensive to my intelligence 0 
the grilled chicken was so tender and yellow from the saffron seasoning 1 
everything about it is just bad 0 
constantine gives everything the right intensity and seems to have a good understanding of the underlying psychological motivations 1 
the staff is great the food is delish and they have an incredible beer selection 1 
they refuse to refund or replace 0 
the buttons for on and off are bad 0 
not worth it 0 
oh this is such a thing of beauty this restaurant 1 
once your food arrives its meh 0 
the plastic breaks really easy on this clip 0 
bland and flavorless is a good way of describing the barely tepid meat 0 
i dont have to be an accountant to know im getting screwed 0 
our server was very nice and even though he looked a little overwhelmed with all of our needs he stayed professional and friendly until the end 1 
the film is way too long 0 
plus it was wellpaced and suited its relatively short run time 1 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
the sweet potato fries were very good and seasoned well 1 
over rated 0 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
nothing special 0 
you share general loewenhielms exquisite joy in his partaking of the cailles en sarcophage even though you are just watching a movie but you do wish for just a small sample to savor 1 
personally i think it shows that people should learn to find a compromise them self without involving other people into issue 1 
logitech bluetooth headset is a 10 1 
theres also enough hypocrisy in this film to make me vomit 0 
poor voice clarity 0 
do not buy if you want to use the holster 0 
arrived quickly and much less expensive than others being sold 1 
did not like at all 0 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
theres also enough hypocrisy in this film to make me vomit 0 
this one works and was priced right 1 
appetite instantly gone 0 
phone now holds charge like it did when it was new 1 
the best scene in the movie was when gerardo is trying to find a song that keeps running through his head 1 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
good item low price 1 
lets start with all the problemsthe acting especially from the lead professor was very very bad 0 
everyone is very attentive providing excellent customer service 1 
ill definitely be in soon again 1 
this review is long overdue since i consider a tale of two sisters to be the single greatest film ever made 1 
ive tried several different earpieces for my cell phone and this jabra one is the first one ive found that fits my ear comfortably 1 
works great 1 
awesome device 1 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
things that went wrong they burned the saganaki 0 
the food was great as always compliments to the chef 1 
the story is also both funny and poignant at times 1 
i searched the internet and found this one to be the best value 1 
they have a plethora of salads and sandwiches and everything ive tried gets my seal of approval 1 
very satisifed with that 1 
the classic maine lobster roll was fantastic 1 
the company shipped my product very promptly and it works well 1 
i struggle to find anything bad to say about it 1 
thanks good a movie like this was done and released 1 
walked in and the place smelled like an old grease trap and only 2 others there eating 0 
this case has passed the one year mark and while it shows signs of wear it is 100 functional 1 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
did not like at all 0 
the worst one of the series 0 
i think the most wonderful parts literally full of wonder are the excerpts from his works 1 
this wonderful experience made this place a muststop whenever we are in town again 1 
very cheap plastic creaks like an old wooden floor 0 
the chefs were friendly and did a good job 1 
it is easy to turn on and off when you are in the car and the volume controls are quite accessable 1 
this movie creates its own universe and is fascinating in every way 1 
if you are looking for a good quality motorola headset keep looking this isnt it 0 
the best electronics of the available fm transmitters 1 
the file browser offers all the options that one needshandsfree is great 1 
keep up the good work amazon 1 
if there is a wind it is completely useless 0 
i was so insulted 0 
another thing i didnt really like is when a character got punched in the face a gallon of blood would spew forth soon after 0 
i have had this phone for over a year now and i will tell you its not that great 0 
the salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop which was perfectly cooked 1 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
join the club and get awesome offers via email 1 
will be back again 1 
linked to my phone without effort 1 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
i have to mention this and it is a huge spoiler i loved the ending how all the characters of the three films were the remaining survivors of the ferry disaster with valentine and the young judge together and the old man watching it on her tv solidifying his happiness over the suffering which he dealt with for those many years 1 
all in all an excellent restaurant highlighted by great service a unique menu and a beautiful setting 1 
great price too 1 
its not what it says it is 0 
all i have to say is the food was amazing 1 
the place was fairly clean but the food simply wasnt worth it 0 
id like to return it 0 
very cheap plastic creaks like an old wooden floor 0 
there is no plot or storyline 0 
not only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic but it also managed to give away the entire movie and im not exaggerating every moment every plot point every joke is told in the trailer 0 
i am sorry i made this purchase 0 
i also decided not to send it back because our waitress looked like she was on the verge of having a heart attack 0 
this is hands down the best phone ive ever had 1 
i had to wait over 30 minutes to get my drink and longer to get 2 arepas 0 
i had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get some relief 0 
the design is very good4 1 
the potatoes were like rubber and you could tell they had been made up ahead of time being kept under a warmer 0 
crostini that came with the salad was stale 0 
has been working great 1 
initially the local sites in the film which was filmed here in buffalo intrigued me 1 
generally it just lacked imagination 0 
they dropped more than the ball 0 
what happened next was prettyoff putting 0 
food is way overpriced and portions are fucking small 0 
not worth it 0 
the guys all had steaks and our steak loving son who has had steak at the best and worst places said it was the best steak hes ever eaten 1 
clear crisp sound 1 
so dont go there if you are looking for good food 0 
not good by any stretch of the imagination 0 
very bad performance plays angela bennett a computer expert who is at home all the time 0 
excellent dualpurpose headset 1 
highly recommended for all ages although the younger set will probably not appreciate some of the more subtle references they will certainly appreciate one galley scene in particular 1 
very disappointed and wondered how it could be in the oscar shortlist 0 
soggy and not good 0 
and then tragedy struck 0 
its too bad the food is so damn generic 0 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
it was a good thing that the tickets only cost five dollars because i would be mad if id have paid 750 to see this crap 0 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
good transmit audio 1 
not my thing 0 
and it was way to expensive 0 
my order was not correct 0 
it also had a new problem 0 
great pork sandwich 1 
this is infuriating 0 
def coming back to bowl next time 1 
if there were zero stars i would give it zero stars 0 
this movie now joins revenge of the boogeyman and zombiez as part of the hellish trinity of horror films 0 
great charger 1 
also the fries are without a doubt the worst fries ive ever had 0 
i have 23 bars on my cell phone when i am home but you cant not hear anything 0 
i just wanted to leave 0 
the whole experience was underwhelming and i think well just go to ninja sushi next time 0 
its been my choice headset for yearsgreat sound good volume good noise cancellation 1 
this was my first time and i cant wait until the next 1 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
barney is definitely super de duper 1 
the only thing that i think could improve is the sound leaks out from the headset 0 
dont miss it 1 
and the chef was generous with his time even came around twice so we can take pictures with him 1 
portable and it works 1 
you never know if you pushed it hard enough or the right number of times for the function you want or not 0 
after 20 minutes wait i got a table 0 
the battery is working well as a replacement for the original that came with the phone over 2 years ago 1 
the ngage is still lacking in earbuds 0 
the writers were smack on and i think the best actors and actresses were a bonus to the showthese characters were so real 1 
it is not good 0 
the desserts were a bit strange 0 
and finally after all that we get to an ending that wouldve been great had it been handled by competent people and not jerry falwell 0 
it was horrible 0 
the phone takes forever to charge like 2 to 5 hours literally 0 
i just cant explain this movie more than romanticcharminghilariousand adorablethe junkyard scenes are funnyall the junkyard dogs have something specialtoo funny i laughedkids will love itbuy it when it comes outit has new features 1 
clever and a real crowdpleaserthis film still ranks among mickeys best films even after 80 wonderful years 1 
lifetime does not air it enough so if anyone knows what store sells it let me know because this is a musthave 1 
i hope this place sticks around 1 
this is a witty and delightful adaptation of the dr seuss book brilliantly animated by upas finest and thoroughly deserving of its academy award 1 
all i have to say is the food was amazing 1 
poorly contstruct hinge 0 
tasted like dirt 0 
waste your money on this game 1 
imdb ratings only go as low 1 for awful its time to get some negative numbers in there for cases such as these 0 
bad choice 0 
this phone might well be the worst ive ever had in any brand 0 
the problem was the script 0 
works great 1 
i received my headset in good time and was happy with it 1 
i really wanted the plantronics 510 to be the right one but it has too many issues for methe good 0 
despite the pans of reviewers i liked this movie 1 
happy so far 1 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
the art style has the appearance of crayonpencil drawings and is wonderfully colorful and fanciful 1 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
the fried rice was dry as well 0 
product is exactly as described 1 
clear crisp sound 1 
was not happy 0 
they could serve it with just the vinaigrette and it may make for a better overall dish but it was still very good 1 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
i like the fact that it rests lightly against your ear rather than inside 1 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
eew this location needs a complete overhaul 0 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
the directing and the cinematography arent quite as good 0 
however bt headsets are currently not good for real time games like firstperson shooters since the audio delay messes me up 0 
it lasts less than 3o minutes if i actually try to use the phonemy wife has the same phone with the same problem 0 
cant store anything but phone numbers to sim 0 
this phone is slim and light and the display is beautiful 1 
great phone 1 
good audio quality 1 
the food sucked which we expected but it sucked more than we could have imagined 0 
with great sound effects and impressive special effects i cant recommend this movie enough 1 
not even a hello we will be right with you 0 
i am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this 1 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
i will not be eating there again 0 
my sashimi was poor quality being soggy and tasteless 0 
this is my new fav vegas buffet spot 1 
w810i is just superb 1 
verizons bills however are difficult to understand even though their pricing plans are simple 0 
worked very well paired with a treo 700w and as a skype headset on my pc using a usb bluetooth transceiver 1 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
i have recommended it to friends 1 
as i said abovepretty useless 0 
great movie 1 
gets the job done 1 
lastly the mozzarella sticks they were the best thing we ordered 1 
dont waste your time watching this rubbish nonresearched film 0 
in other words the content level of this film is enough to easily fill a dozen other films 1 
anyways the food was definitely not filling at all and for the price you pay you should expect more 0 
i came over from verizon because cingulair has nicer cell phones the first thing i noticed was the really bad service 0 
voice quality signal strength dropped calls 0 
there was so much hype over this phone that i assumed it was the best my mistake 0 
i do not know if this was emilio estevezs directorial debut but the pacing the interplay and development of the characters as well as some clever camera work surrounding the character estevez plays all suggest a natural eye 1 
reception is terrible and full of static 0 
it does everything the description said it would 1 
but storm trooper is not even bad enough to make it to the list of wonderfully terrible movies 0 
these are certainly very comfortable and functionality is decent 1 
overall i was not impressed and would not go back 0 
i ordered the voodoo pasta and it was the first time id had really excellent pasta since going gluten free several years ago 1 
cute quaint simple honest 1 
i dont know exactly what it is about this movie but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our familys memories 1 
the phone crashed completely and now i have to get it replaced 0 
characters are onedimensional even the good guys and especially the bad guys 0 
up there with the best of melville 1 
avoid at any and all costs 0 
i dont understand how this garbage got on the shelves of the movie store its not even a real movie 0 
the folks at otto always make us feel so welcome and special 1 
i probably wont be coming back here 0 
whatever prompted such a documentary is beyond me 0 
maybe its just their vegetarian fare but ive been twice and i thought it was average at best 0 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
bela lugosi was totally extraneous intoning odd lines 0 
the jabra eargels fit my ears very well 1 
the turkey and roast beef were bland 0 
great pizza and salads 1 
the least said about the acting the better 0 
dont bother coming here 0 
predictable but not a bad watch 1 
the owners really really need to quit being soooooo cheap let them wrap my freaking sandwich in two papers not one 0 
10 out of 10 stars 1 
couldnt figure it out 0 
worked perfectly 1 
my fella got the huevos rancheros and they didnt look too appealing 0 
very serious spoilers this movie was a huge disappointment 0 
waited and waited and waited 0 
i immediately said i wanted to talk to the manager but i did not want to talk to the guy who was doing shots of fireball behind the bar 0 
level 5 spicy was perfect where spice didnt overwhelm the soup 1 
im not really sure how joeys was voted best hot dog in the valley by readers of phoenix magazine 0 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
it definitely was not as good as my s11 1 
the black eyed peas and sweet potatoes unreal 1 
shes poised and amazing 1 
what did bother me was the slow service 0 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
the waiter wasnt helpful or friendly and rarely checked on us 0 
well im satisfied 1 
all it took was one drop from about 6 inches above the kitchen counter and it was crackedi am not impressed and i am not laughing 0 
not only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic but it also managed to give away the entire movie and im not exaggerating every moment every plot point every joke is told in the trailer 0 
this place deserves one star and 90 has to do with the food 0 
it was horrible 0 
this pair of headphones is the worst that i have ever had soundwise 0 
the yellowtail carpaccio was melt in your mouth fresh 1 
add betty white and jean smart and you have a great cast everyone played their parts really well 1 
this place is way too overpriced for mediocre food 0 
trumbull on i love lucy 1 
i had to go to a store and bought a new nokia phone which is working great 1 
great charger 1 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
ive also had problems with the phone reading the memory card in which i always turn it on and then off again 0 
with the originality and freshness of the first movie now spent this remake had little else to offer 0 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
after i pulled up my car i waited for another 15 minutes before being acknowledged 0 
we enjoy their pizza and brunch 1 
what a great double cheeseburger 1 
the only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive 1 
kris kristoffersen is good in this movie and really makes a difference 1 
those phones are working just fine now 1 
conclusion very filling meals 1 
after i pulled up my car i waited for another 15 minutes before being acknowledged 0 
the wind and the lion is well written and superbly acted 1 
if only someone involved with it knew how to string together narrative 0 
everything about this film is simply incredible 1 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
i tried talking real loud but shouting on the telephone gets old and i was still told it wasnt great 0 
nice solid keyboard 1 
the acting was decidely wooden though no worse than a period universal b movie 0 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
i would recommend it 1 
im pleased 1 
kris kristoffersen is good in this movie and really makes a difference 1 
the portion was huge 1 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
i liked the patio and the service was outstanding 1 
we asked for the bill to leave without eating and they didnt bring that either 0 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
waited and waited and waited 0 
we waited for forty five minutes in vain 0 
ordered an appetizer and took 40 minutes and then the pizza another 10 minutes 0 
battery life is also great 1 
excellent product for the price 1 
first of all there are enough racial stereotypes and racial jokes to offend everyone 0 
service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is vegas and located inside the crystals shopping mall by aria 1 
i hope this place sticks around 1 
the script is bad very bad  it contains both cheesiness and unethical joke that you normally see in rated r or nc17 movie 0 
excellent product for the price 1 
very disappointed 0 
it was clear that she had the range and ability to pull off this part 1 
it was awesome 1 
nice ambiance 1 
when im on this side of town this will definitely be a spot ill hit up again 1 
linksys should have some way to exchange a bad phone for a refurb unit or something 0 
you also cannot take pictures with it in the case because the lense is covered 0 
every element of this story was so over the top excessively phony and contrived that it was painful to sit through 0 
is pretty funny 1 
crostini that came with the salad was stale 0 
john wayne did an incredible job for being so young in the movie industry 1 
i had a salad with the wings and some ice cream for dessert and left feeling quite satisfied 1 
the ri style calamari was a joke 0 
omg the food was delicioso 1 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
tried to go here for lunch and it was a madhouse 0 
improper description i had to return it 0 
i think this restaurant suffers from not trying hard enough 0 
i saw this movie and i thought this is a stupid movie 0 
you cant beat the price on these 1 
it came free with a dvd player i bought but i still turned the thing off halfway through because i was embarrassed for howell 0 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
all i can do is whine on the internet so here it goesthe more i use the thing the less i like it 0 
go rent it 1 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
poor talk time performance 0 
conclusion very filling meals 1 
i recently tried caballeros and i have been back every week since 1 
great audio 1 
i had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get some relief 0 
it sure does beat the nachos at the movies but i would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant 0 
its very slow 0 
do not buy if you want to use the holster 0 
setup couldnt have been simpler 1 
this movie now joins revenge of the boogeyman and zombiez as part of the hellish trinity of horror films 0 
the sound quality is excellent as well 1 
there was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth but it didnt really work into the rest of the plot 0 
unfortunately inexperience of direction meant that scene after scene passed with little in the way of dramatic tension or conflict 0 
good audio quality 1 
made very sturdy 1 
then a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use 0 
i wear it everyday and it holds up very well 1 
item arrived quickly and works great with my metro pcs samsung schr450 slider phone and sony premium sound in ear plugs 1 
in the span of an hour i had two people exclaim whoa is that the new phone on tv 1 
when a song could explain the emotions of the subjects better such as when jay adams unfortunate life was a subject of talk the song old man by neil young was played which evokes many emotions 1 
the roast beef sandwich tasted really good 1 
however i recently watched the whole thing again on dvd and i was completely struck by how extremely stupid the storyline was how it contained holes inconsistencies and frankly a whole lot of crap and how horrid the dancing was 0 
all in all id expected a better consumer experience from motorola 0 
i have tried these cables with my computer and my ipod and it works just fine 1 
you truly take this journey through the eyes and soul of a child 1 
i believe that this place is a great stop for those with a huge belly and hankering for sushi 1 
awful service 0 
i wont spoil it but the ending in pretty amazing 1 
the cg opening sequence in space looked like it could have been created on microsoft slideshow for gods sake 0 
i swung in to give them a try but was deeply disappointed 0 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
the battery works great 1 
great phone 1 
weve have gotten a much better service from the pizza place next door than the services we received from this restaurant 0 
the selection was probably the worst ive seen in vegasthere was none 0 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
their chow mein is so good 1 
the screen does get smudged easily because it touches your ear and face 0 
worthless product 0 
i especially love the long battery life 1 
worst foodservice ive had in a while 0 
this is probably the most irritating show i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
this is a very average phone with bad battery life that operates on a weak network 0 
frankly after cotton club and unfaithful it was kind of embarrassing to watch lane and gere in this film because it is bad 0 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
they know how to make them here 1 
still waiting im sure this item would work well if i ever recieve it 0 
this little device has transformed my organizational capability and made my life a whole lot easier 1 
my only problem is i thought the actor playing the villain was a low rent michael ironside 0 
we ordered some old classics and some new dishes after going there a few times and were sorely disappointed with everything 0 
cooked to perfection and the service was impeccable 1 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
razr battery good buy 1 
i am very happy 1 
enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film 1 
product is useless since it does not have enough charging current to charge the 2 cellphones i was planning to use it with 0 
point your finger at any item on the menu order it and you wont be disappointed 1 
worst customer service 0 
the camera although rated at an impressive 13 megapixels renders images that fall well below expectations of such a relatively high resolution 0 
almost all of the songs in cover girl are oldfashioned and not very tuneful 0 
each track commands sentiment actually contributing to the scenes and characters 1 
and the rest of it just sits there being awful with soldiers singing songs about the masculinity they pledge themselves to hairsplitting about purity the admiration of swords etc 0 
the food is not tasty at all not to say its real traditional hunan style 0 
it did not work in my cell phone plug i am very up set with the charger 0 
the battery is unreliable as well as the service use antena 0 
point your finger at any item on the menu order it and you wont be disappointed 1 
these are the central themes of the film and they are handled ineptly stereotypically and with no depth of imagination 0 
but this movie really got to me 1 
i really like this product over the motorola because it is allot clearer on the ear piece and the mic 1 
the burrittos blah 0 
this was utterly confusing at first which caused me to lose a couple of very very important contacts 0 
i also decided not to send it back because our waitress looked like she was on the verge of having a heart attack 0 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
have been going since 2007 and every meal has been awesome 1 
great software for motorolas 1 
overall i am psyched to have a phone which has all my appointments and contacts in and gets great reception 1 
if it were possible to give them zero stars theyd have it 0 
i also decided not to send it back because our waitress looked like she was on the verge of having a heart attack 0 
i would not recommend this place 0 
to summarize the food was incredible nay transcendant but nothing brings me joy quite like the memory of the pneumatic condiment dispenser 1 
the burger i got the gold standard a 17 burger and was kind of disappointed 0 
the kids are very cool too 1 
this is just a great movie 1 
worse theres an incredibly weak subplot thrown in that follows a little band of latterday mansonites as they go after a reporter whos working on a story on the anniversary of the killings 0 
my friend did not like his bloody mary 0 
great product 1 
i also didnt like the on button it felt like it would crack with use 0 
the show would begin with smart ass ed comments to each other that would be totally off the wall and uncalled for 0 
a good time 1 
once your food arrives its meh 0 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
the burger i got the gold standard a 17 burger and was kind of disappointed 0 
a very very very slowmoving aimless movie about a distressed drifting young man 0 
yeah the movie pretty much sucked 0 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
however after seeing the short again after about 25 years i was amazed at how timeless the film actually is 1 
from here on the widmark character turns unintentionally comical 0 
this film and i use that word loosely is an insult to the moviegoing public 0 
i great reception all the time 1 
do not waste your money here 0 
nice docking station for home or work 1 
the stories were powerful explorations of the nature of man and of art 1 
not what i wanted 0 
the burger i got the gold standard a 17 burger and was kind of disappointed 0 
but it wasnt until i watched this film that i realised how great he actually was 1 
i know that sounds funny but to me it seemed like sketchy technology that wouldnt work wellwell this one works great 1 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
you wont regret it 1 
regardless the film fails on most levels 0 
the calls drop the phone comes on and off at will the screen goes black and the worst of all it stops ringing intermittently 0 
it is very educational for children 1 to 8 years old 1 
i mean in a realistic world she would never have gotten into that ballet repertory the whole thing was quite pathetic 0 
aailiyah was pretty good as akasha in places compelling her first entrance and mini dance scene 1 
i love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it 1 
im probably one of the few people to ever go to ians and not like it 0 
i was amazed at the quick arrival of the two original lg cell phone batteries and and at a fraction of the price 1 
the instruction manual is lacking 0 
id advise anyone to go and see it 1 
overall a delight 1 
i love that they put their food in nice plastic containers as opposed to cramming it in little paper takeout boxes 1 
i love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it 1 
i sat riveted to the tv screen 1 
you truly take this journey through the eyes and soul of a child 1 
there is no real plot 0 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
he owns the film just as spacek owned coal miners daughter and quaid owned great balls of fire 1 
this fixes all the problems 1 
that was done in the second movie 0 
you could drive a semi truck into these holes 0 
i know that sounds funny but to me it seemed like sketchy technology that wouldnt work wellwell this one works great 1 
kieslowski never ceases to amaze me 1 
this is actually a very smart movie 1 
i go to far too many places and ive never seen any restaurant that serves a 1 egg breakfast especially for 400 0 
great brunch spot 1 
i could not understand what kind of idiot would produce this mess in the first place not to mention several season 0 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
im terribly disappointed that this film would receive so many awards and accolades especially when there are far more deserving works of film out there 0 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
phone now holds charge like it did when it was new 1 
clever and a real crowdpleaserthis film still ranks among mickeys best films even after 80 wonderful years 1 
one of the best mexican movies ever and one of the less understood even by mexican themselves no matter how identified the should have felt with it 1 
i particularly remember my senses being assaulted by strident cords of music that would blare out with very little warning and even less meaning 0
