i searched the internet and found this one to be the best value 1 
the goat taco didnt skimp on the meat and wow what flavor 1 
the instructions didnt explain that a microphone jack could be used 0 
great charger 1 
if you check the directors filmography on this site you will see why this film didnt have a chance 0 
for people who are first timers in film making i think they did an excellent job 1 
i cannot make calls at certain places 0 
food was so gooodd 1 
the songs were the best and the muppets were so hilarious 1 
the plastic breaks really easy on this clip 0 
everything about this movie is stupid 0 
im probably one of the few people to ever go to ians and not like it 0 
very friendly staff 1 
this phone might well be the worst ive ever had in any brand 0 
it is very comfortable to wear as well which is probably the most important aspect about using a case 1 
you can find better movies at youtube 0 
it felt like a very gripping intelligent stage play but without the overly theatrical feeling one actually gets from watching people on a stage which plays on everyones terror of a white lie escalating to monstrous consequences 1 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
the best scene in the movie was when gerardo is trying to find a song that keeps running through his head 1 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
but she is still a bad actress repeating her robotic face moves in each of her pictures 0 
worst service to boot but that is the least of their worries 0 
the camera on the phone may be used as a dustpan when indoors id rather be using a disposable then this 0 
he deserves 5 stars 1 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
if there was ever a movie that needed wordofmouth to promote this is it 1 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
i great reception all the time 1 
so just beware 0 
prosgood camera very nice pictures also has cool styles like black and white and more 1 
excellent phone 1 
i highly recommend this movie for anyone interested in art poetry theater politics or japanese history 1 
never again will i be dining at this place 0 
very disappointing 0 
perfect for someone me who only likes beer ice cold or in this case even colder 1 
its a little geeky but i think thats its sex on toast and it rocks and oozes sex right down to its battery embedded sleek stylish leather case 1 
the plot simply rumbles on like a machine desperately depending on the addition of new scenes 0 
eclectic selection 1 
judith light is one of my favorite actresses and i think she does a superb job in this film 1 
if she had not rolled the eyes we may have stayed not sure if we will go back and try it again 0 
took an hour to get our food only 4 tables in restaurant my food was luke warm our sever was running around like he was totally overwhelmed 0 
however the ear pads come off easily and after only one week i lost one 0 
the pleather case doesnt fit 0 
the worst was the salmon sashimi 0 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
i am so pleased to know such a modern day genius is out there letting is passion for art drive him and taking us as an audience with him 1 
not easy to watch 0 
as for the service i thought it was good 1 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
very disappointing 0 
i advise you to look out for it 1 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
was not happy 0 
this does not fit the palm tungsten e2 and it broke the first time i tried to plug it in 0 
now we were chosen to be tortured with this disgusting piece of blatant american propaganda 0 
this second appearance of mickey mouse following the silent plane crazy earlier that year is probably his most famous filmmostly because it was so groundbreaking 1 
great pork sandwich 1 
to those who find this movie intelligent or even masterful i can only say its your intelligence and your imagination you obviously used to try and make some sense of this pitiful attempt its in our human nature to try and make sense of things 0 
bela lugosi was totally extraneous intoning odd lines 0 
that was nice 1 
this wonderful experience made this place a muststop whenever we are in town again 1 
not what i wanted 0 
this is hands down the best phone ive ever had 1 
it has a great camera thats 2mp and the pics are nice and clear with great picture quality 1 
the voice recognition thru the handset is excellent 1 
a cheap and cheerless heist movie with poor characterisation lots of underbite style stoic emoting think chow yun fat in a better tomorrow and some cheesy clichés thrown into an abandoned factory ready for a few poorly executed flying judo rolls a la john woo 0 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
after my phone got to be about a year old its been slowly breaking despite much care on my part 0 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
the cashew cream sauce was bland and the vegetables were undercooked 0 
of course the acting is blah 0 
the concert sequences just sucked 0 
i was particularly pleased with the acting ability of dwight schultz 1 
the attempts at humor were pitiful and story is so awful it dosent bear thinking about which basically involves a vulcan stealing the enterprise to find god seriously i just didnt care about any of this film and oh not to mention uhura does a belly dance to distract male guards 0 
if you want a sandwich just go to any firehouse 1 
that company is a joke 0 
the lighting is just dark enough to set the mood 1 
nice case feels good in your hands 1 
this place is way too overpriced for mediocre food 0 
definitely worth seeing its the sort of thought provoking film that forces you to question your own threshold of loneliness 1 
their regular toasted bread was equally satisfying with the occasional pats of butter mmmm 1 
seriously flavorful delights folks 1 
down the drain because of a weak snap 0 
but this movie really got to me 1 
dont waste your time watching this rubbish nonresearched film 0 
it is the best charger i have seen on the market yet 1 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
this fixes all the problems 1 
yes its that bad 0 
its a fresh subtle and rather sublime effect 1 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
i am not a filmmaker nor am i a director but i would hide my head in the sand if id spent whatever amount of money and time on this movie 0 
i enjoyed it 1 
we had so much to say about the place before we walked in that he expected it to be amazing but was quickly disappointed 0 
for people who are first timers in film making i think they did an excellent job 1 
after trying many many handsfree gadgets this is the one that finally works well 1 
i vomited in the bathroom mid lunch 0 
great headset very impressed h500 1 
very very disappointed ordered the 35 big bay plater 0 
my side greek salad with the greek dressing was so tasty and the pita and hummus was very refreshing 1 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
this phone is pretty sturdy and ive never had any large problems with it 1 
great hands free device 1 
im surprised this is a good quality car charger and theres not much reviews about it 1 
we had so much to say about the place before we walked in that he expected it to be amazing but was quickly disappointed 0 
comfortable nice range good battery life 1 
this is a great phone 1 
works great 1 
this hole in the wall has great mexican street tacos and friendly staff 1 
overall i would recommend this phone over the new walkman 1 
this is a great little item 1 
itll be a regular stop on my trips to phoenix 1 
here in the wind and the lion we see a wonderful rendering of americas own imperial age 1 
very satisifed with that 1 
worst service to boot but that is the least of their worries 0 
tasted like dirt 0 
my salad had a bland vinegrette on the baby greens and hearts of palm 0 
cheap but hey it works was pleasantly suprised given the low cost of this item 1 
they have great dinners 1 
made very sturdy 1 
best breakfast buffet 1 
very comfortable 1 
no shifting no bubbling no peeling not even a scratch nothingi couldnt be more happier with my new one for the droid 1 
overall i wasnt very impressed with noca 0 
hes a national treasure 1 
does everything it should and more 1 
just what i wanted 1 
when it opens the battery connection is broken and the device is turned off 0 
bad reception 0 
new battery works great in phone 1 
this is essentially a communications tool that does not communicate 0 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
the tracfonewebsite is user friendly and makes it easy toactivate etc 1 
also the area where my unit broke im not too fond of the magnetic strap 0 
walked in and the place smelled like an old grease trap and only 2 others there eating 0 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
after trying many many handsfree gadgets this is the one that finally works well 1 
he came running after us when he realized my husband had left his sunglasses on the table 1 
the pancake was also really good and pretty large at that 1 
nothing short of magnificent photographycinematography in this film 1 
summary the witticisms werent witty 0 
so in a nutshell 1 the restaraunt smells like a combination of a dirty fish market and a sewer 0 
great place to eat reminds me of the little mom and pop shops in the san francisco bay area 1 
why are these sad little vegetables so overcooked 0 
i really recommend this faceplates since it looks very nice elegant and cool 1 
how can anyone in their right mind ask for anything more from a movie than this 1 
it was also the right balance of war and love 1 
i wish i could enter negative values admins 0 
as a courtroom drama its compelling as an indictment on the american justice system its frightening 1 
the crêpe was delicate and thin and moist 1 
you need at least 3 mins to get to your phone book from the time you first turn on the phonebattery life is short 0 
i have been in more than a few bars in vegas and do not ever recall being charged for tap water 0 
disappointed 0 
disapointing results 0 
comfortable fit you need your headset to be comfortable for at least an hour at a time if not for an entire day 1 
how awful she is 0 
this is infuriating 0 
meredith m was better than all right 1 
earbud piece breaks easily 0 
all in all an excellent restaurant highlighted by great service a unique menu and a beautiful setting 1 
best fish ive ever had in my life 1 
this is a very average phone with bad battery life that operates on a weak network 0 
gotta love those closeups of slimy drooling teeth 1 
the server was very negligent of our needs and made us feel very unwelcome i would not suggest this place 0 
i could eat their bruschetta all day it is devine 1 
the script is a big flawed mess 0 
muddy low quality sound and the casing around the wires insert was poorly super glued and slid off 0 
great for the jawbone 1 
they really want to make your experience a good one 1 
first off the reception sucks i have never had more than 2 bars ever 0 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
nice docking station for home or work 1 
do not buy if you want to use the holster 0 
the acting is beyond abysmal 0 
i love the camera its really pretty good quality 1 
the screen does get smudged easily because it touches your ear and face 0 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
however this didnt make up for the fact that overall this was a tremendously boring movie 0 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
you never know if you pushed it hard enough or the right number of times for the function you want or not 0 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
favorite place in town for shawarrrrrrma 1 
there is nothing privileged about workingeating there 0 
we walked away stuffed and happy about our first vegas buffet experience 1 
and finally after all that we get to an ending that wouldve been great had it been handled by competent people and not jerry falwell 0 
nice docking station for home or work 1 
the sweet potato fries were very good and seasoned well 1 
go watch it 1 
i dont know exactly what it is about this movie but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our familys memories 1 
both of them were truly unbelievably good and i am so glad we went back 1 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
defective crap 0 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
nonlinear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well 1 
as for the service i thought it was good 1 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
good item low price 1 
mobile phone tools are a must have 1 
great choice 1 
wed definitely go back here again 1 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
it is so small and you dont even realize that it is there after a while of getting used to it 1 
if there was ever a movie that needed wordofmouth to promote this is it 1 
linksys should have some way to exchange a bad phone for a refurb unit or something 0 
this place should honestly be blown up 0 
disappointing 0 
it is light has plenty of battery capacity and is very confortable to wear for somewhat extended periods of time 1 
it just blew 0 
schrader has made a resume full of lousy amateurish films 0 
trumbull on i love lucy 1 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
i probably would not go here again 0 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
all the other cases ive tried normally fall apart after a few months but this one seems to be in for the long haul 1 
the pizza tasted old super chewy in not a good way 0 
sound quality on both end is excellent i use headset to call my wife and ask my wife to use headset to call me 2 1 
there was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters 0 
the very idea of it was lame take a minor character from a mediocre pg13 film and make a complete nonsequel while changing its tone to a pgrated family movie 0 
down the drain because of a weak snap 0 
nicest chinese restaurant ive been in a while 1 
up there with the best of melville 1 
the movie is terribly boring in places 0 
its kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly its embarrassing how childlike the company is 0 
we had a group of 70 when we claimed we would only have 40 and they handled us beautifully 1 
the film gives meaning to the phrase never in the history of human conflict has so much been owed by so many to so few 1 
the plug did not work very well 0 
steamboat willie is an amazingly important film to our cinema history 1 
strike 2 who wants to be rushed 0 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
the food is not tasty at all not to say its real traditional hunan style 0 
the charger arrived within the promised timeframe but it did not work 0 
i find this inexcusable and so will probably be returning this phone and perhaps changing carriers 0 
it was either too cold not enough flavor or just bad 0 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
for a self proclaimed coffee cafe i was wildly disappointed 0 
unless youre just out to visually collect all extant films of austens work you can skip this one 0 
the macarons here are insanely good 1 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
then i had to continue pairing it periodically since it somehow kept dropping 0 
not a good item it worked for a while then started having problems in my auto reverse tape player 0 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
the battery is completely useless to me 0 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
my phone doesnt slide around my car now and the grip prevents my phone from slipping out of my hand 1 
waste your money on this game 1 
the instructions didnt explain that a microphone jack could be used 0 
i believe that pitch black was done well 1 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
mobile phone tools are a must have 1 
this movie now joins revenge of the boogeyman and zombiez as part of the hellish trinity of horror films 0 
excellent service 1 
i dont know exactly what it is about this movie but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our familys memories 1 
happy so far 1 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
it was forced like everything in this movie 0 
damian is so talented and versatile in so many ways of writing and portraying different characters on screen 1 
the best place to go for a tasty bowl of pho 1 
and there wasnt a single sour note struck actingwise either some surprisingly solid casting here 1 
comes with a strong light that you can use to light up your camera shots and even flash sos signals seriously 1 
i have been very happy with the 510 and have had no complaints from any one regarding my sound quality on their end 1 
kris kristoffersen is good in this movie and really makes a difference 1 
the interplay between martin and emilio contains the same wonderful chemistry we saw in wall street with martin and charlie 1 
the cashier had no care what so ever on what i had to say it still ended up being wayyy overpriced 0 
this is simply the best bluetooth headset for sound quality 1 
this movie is bad 0 
great movie 1 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
useless phone simply deaf 0 
waitress was sweet and funny 1 
but if you liked movies like the matrix and better yet their sequels i think youll appreciate the thought provoking mindblowing experience this film will give you 1 
doesnt work 0 
too bad you have to pay up to a month for the service 0 
it always cuts out and makes a beep beep beep sound then says signal failed 0 
the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach 0 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
speaking of the music it is unbearably predictably and kitchy 0 
the cashier was friendly and even brought the food out to me 1 
not even a hello we will be right with you 0 
you never know if you pushed it hard enough or the right number of times for the function you want or not 0 
what a mistake that was 0 
i checked out this place a couple years ago and was not impressed 0 
emily watsons character is very strong and she has only to give a quick glance and you understand everything 1 
then the film just dropped the ball 0 
watching washing machine twirling around wouldnt hurt your eyes as much as this show 0 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
it was not good 0 
its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
the fried rice was dry as well 0 
this is a good joint 1 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
it was quite comfortable in the ear 1 
the plug did not work very well 0 
this isnt a small family restaurant this is a fine dining establishment 1 
dont buy this product it fails 0 
a fly was in my apple juice a fly 0 
on the good side the staff was genuinely pleasant and enthusiastic a real treat 1 
tonight i had the elk filet specialand it sucked 0 
their frozen margaritas are way too sugary for my taste 0 
damn good steak 1 
to call this movie a drama is ridiculous 0 
not recommended 0 
the camera really likes her in this movie 1 
now this dish was quite flavourful 1 
the loudspeaker option is great the bumpers with the lights is very appealing 0 
2 thumbs up 1 
perfect for someone me who only likes beer ice cold or in this case even colder 1 
very good though 1 
theres also enough hypocrisy in this film to make me vomit 0 
her lines seem to have been written by a fifteen year old though they are trying oh so so hard to sound like how a fifteen year old would really um you know well talk 0 
very friendly staff 1 
my gyro was basically lettuce only 0 
i love it 1 
down the drain because of a weak snap 0 
cant store anything but phone numbers to sim 0 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
not even good for camp value 0 
very happy with this product 1 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
the lighting is awful 0 
this is an outstanding little restaurant with some of the best food i have ever tasted 1 
ive dropped my phone more times than i can say even on concrete and my phone is still great knock on wood 1 
the script is horrendously stupid 0 
this place is amazing 1 
well never go again 0 
unless youre just out to visually collect all extant films of austens work you can skip this one 0 
i have to mention this and it is a huge spoiler i loved the ending how all the characters of the three films were the remaining survivors of the ferry disaster with valentine and the young judge together and the old man watching it on her tv solidifying his happiness over the suffering which he dealt with for those many years 1 
spend your money and time some place else 0 
all the other cases ive tried normally fall apart after a few months but this one seems to be in for the long haul 1 
it clicks into place in a way that makes you wonder how long that mechanism would last 0 
schrader has made a resume full of lousy amateurish films 0 
i vomited in the bathroom mid lunch 0 
i would highly recommend this product 1 
very satisifed with that 1 
trumbull on i love lucy 1 
they really want to make your experience a good one 1 
so absolutley fantastic 1 
waste of money 0 
the eargels channel the sound directly into your ear and seem to increase the sound volume and clarity 1 
i really wanted the plantronics 510 to be the right one but it has too many issues for methe good 0 
this place deserves no stars 0 
i definitly recommend 1 
you wont regret it 1 
that just screams legit in my booksomethats also pretty rare here in vegas 1 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
very easy to use 1 
service stinks here 0 
nargile i think you are great 1 
i dont think i will be back for a very long time 0 
seafood was limited to boiled shrimp and crab legs but the crab legs definitely did not taste fresh 0 
an absolute must visit 1 
very disappointed 0 
cumbersome design 0 
i kept catching the cable on the seat and i had to pull the phone out to turn it on an off 0 
unreliable im giving up 0 
it was either too cold not enough flavor or just bad 0 
i was very pleased to see that i could replace my well travled swivel holster for my blackberry flip 1 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
i have eaten here multiple times and each time the food was delicious 1 
four stars for the food the guy in the blue shirt for his great vibe still letting us in to eat 1 
waitress was a little slow in service 0 
a good time 1 
comes with a strong light that you can use to light up your camera shots and even flash sos signals seriously 1 
overpriced for what you are getting 0 
i ended up sliding it on the edge of my pants or back pockets instead 1 
first off the reception sucks i have never had more than 2 bars ever 0 
this is a simple little phone to use but the breakage is unacceptible 0 
i have been to very few places to eat that under no circumstances would i ever return to and this tops the list 0 
there was so much hype over this phone that i assumed it was the best my mistake 0 
add betty white and jean smart and you have a great cast everyone played their parts really well 1 
the service was meh 0 
good case 1 
dont bother coming here 0 
their regular toasted bread was equally satisfying with the occasional pats of butter mmmm 1 
the film has an ultracheap look to it 0 
the design might be ergonomic in theory but i could not stand having these in my ear 0 
the potatoes were great and so was the biscuit 1 
great phone 1 
kind of hard to mess up a steak but they did 0 
i get absolutely horrible reception in my apartment where with other phones i have not had this problem 0 
this was my first time and i cant wait until the next 1 
i can assure you that you wont be disappointed 1 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
what did bother me was the slow service 0 
this hole in the wall has great mexican street tacos and friendly staff 1 
overall i was not impressed and would not go back 0 
the worst piece of crap ever along with the verizon customer service 0 
i own 2 of these cases and would order another 1 
for service i give them no stars 0 
i was very disappointed in the movie 0 
all in all i think it was a good investment 1 
it does everything the description said it would 1 
there still are good actors around 1 
i cant believe theres even a sequel to this 0 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
lewis blacks considerable talent is wasted here too as he is at his most incendiary when he is unrestrained which the pg13 rating certainly wont allow 0 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
i had the chicken pho and it tasted very bland 0 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
worst foodservice ive had in a while 0 
if you do watch it however there are small consolations the actresses playing annes sisters each do a wonderful job with their roles 1 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
it was a waste of my money 0 
each day of the week they have a different deal and its all so delicious 1 
great pocket pc phone combination 1 
a must study for anyone interested in the worst sins of industrial design 0 
i believe that pitch black was done well 1 
due to this happening on every call i was forced to stop using this headset 0 
piece of trash 0 
so in a nutshell 1 the restaraunt smells like a combination of a dirty fish market and a sewer 0 
to call this movie a drama is ridiculous 0 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
you wont regret it 1 
could not get strong enough signal 0 
just whatever you do avoid groove as its the antithesis of all that is good about human traffic 0 
the staff are great the ambiance is great 1 
i have had tmobile service for 2 or 3 years now and i am pretty happy with it 1 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
what a big waste of time 0 
battery has no life 0 
i was hoping for more 0 
bela lugosi was totally extraneous intoning odd lines 0 
this is the kind of money that is wasted properly 1 
bought mainly for the charger which broke soon after purchasing 0 
the story which was told so eloquently by francis ford coppola 25 years earlier really unfolds gradually and leaves room for the characters to develop 1 
both great 1 
there was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters 0 
worth every penny 1 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
nargile i think you are great 1 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
cute quaint simple honest 1 
unfortunately the ability to actually know you are receiving a call is a rather important feature and this phone is pitiful in that respect 0 
i got the car charger and not even after a week the charger was brokeni went to plug it in and it started smoking 0 
their rotating beers on tap is also a highlight of this place 1 
delicious and i will absolutely be back 1 
im so sorry but i really cant recommend it to anyone 0 
for people who are first timers in film making i think they did an excellent job 1 
go and see it 1 
my sashimi was poor quality being soggy and tasteless 0 
all i have to say is the food was amazing 1 
i would not recommend this place 0 
the construction of the headsets is poor 0 
if she had not rolled the eyes we may have stayed not sure if we will go back and try it again 0 
wow very spicy but delicious 1 
i tried talking real loud but shouting on the telephone gets old and i was still told it wasnt great 0 
i would give this television series a 10 plus if i could 1 
i guess maybe we went on an off night but it was disgraceful 0 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
i really do recommend this place you can go wrong with this donut place 1 
ive seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie 0 
as an earlier review noted plug in this charger and nothing happens 0 
if it were possible to give them zero stars theyd have it 0 
unfortunately any virtue in this films production work was lost on a regrettable script 0 
best breakfast buffet 1 
i will come back here every time im in vegas 1 
after all the rave reviews i couldnt wait to eat herewhat a disappointment 0 
the plot was the same as pretty much every other cheap horror 0 
we have gotten a lot of compliments on it 1 
the first time i ever came here i had an amazing experience i still tell people how awesome the duck was 1 
no ear loop needed its tiny and the sound is great 1 
the worst one of the series 0 
its a long time since i was so entertained by a movie 1 
this product is clearly not ready for prime time i dont care how cool it looks if you cant tell a call is coming in its worthless 0 
this was a poor remake of my best friends wedding 0 
never heard of any of them except cole who was totally unbelievable in the part 0 
ive bought 5 wired headphones that sound better than these 0 
will definitely be back 1 
the service here is fair at best 0 
does not work for listening to music with the cingular 8125 0 
no one at the table thought the food was above average or worth the wait that we had for it 0 
for sushi on the strip this is the place to go 1 
still waiting im sure this item would work well if i ever recieve it 0 
when my mom and i got home she immediately got sick and she only had a few bites of salad 0 
not a good bargain 0 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
wonderful lil tapas and the ambience made me feel all warm and fuzzy inside 1 
the soundtrack sucked 0 
great pork sandwich 1 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
great charger 1 
i would definitely recommend the jabra bt250v for those who are looking for comfort clarity and a great price 1 
i have had problems wit hit dropping signal and more 0 
it is light has plenty of battery capacity and is very confortable to wear for somewhat extended periods of time 1 
editing the editing of this film was phenomenal in my opinion 1 
the problem was the script 0 
sauce was tasteless 0 
the only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port irda 0 
i highly recommend these and encourage people to give them a try 1 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
so for our enjoyment we get to see them run around play games and be dangerous 1 
very tough and very short on flavor 0 
doesnt hold charge 0 
i had to go to a store and bought a new nokia phone which is working great 1 
this was my first and only vegas buffet and it did not disappoint 1 
hell no will i go back 0 
i love the ownerchef his one authentic japanese cool dude 1 
worst service to boot but that is the least of their worries 0 
i received my orders well within the shipping timeframe everything was in good working order and overall i am very excited to have this source 1 
it does everything the description said it would 1 
service is quick and friendly 1 
i wont be back 0 
this movie contained an allstar cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i havent seen before 1 
it didnt work people can not hear me when i talk 0 
if you are looking for a good quality motorola headset keep looking this isnt it 0 
i immediately said i wanted to talk to the manager but i did not want to talk to the guy who was doing shots of fireball behind the bar 0 
filmiing was less expansive 0 
both great 1 
the voice recognition thru the handset is excellent 1 
its just lame 0 
i have tried these cables with my computer and my ipod and it works just fine 1 
wont go back 0 
if you are razr owneryou must have this 1 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
my fella got the huevos rancheros and they didnt look too appealing 0 
disappointing 0 
the characters are fleshed out surprisingly well particularly grimes and blake and all the actors deliver their sharply scripted lines with just the right amount of deadpan tongue in cheek to make the dialogue both hilarious and realistic 1 
it looses connection to the phone even when it is within a couple feet between the two 0 
this movie totally grates on my nerves 0 
verizons bills however are difficult to understand even though their pricing plans are simple 0 
what a waste 0 
to be honest with you this is unbelievable nonsense and very foolish 0 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
my salad had a bland vinegrette on the baby greens and hearts of palm 0 
highly entertaining at all angles 1 
i keep watching it over and over 1 
obviously they have a terrible customer service so you get what you pay for 0 
so in a nutshell 1 the restaraunt smells like a combination of a dirty fish market and a sewer 0 
they do not care about the consumer one bit 0 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
wed definitely go back here again 1 
we watched our waiter pay a lot more attention to other tables and ignore us 0 
i saw mirrormask last night and it was an unsatisfactory experience 0 
del taco is pretty nasty and should be avoided if possible 0 
i could eat their bruschetta all day it is devine 1 
this totally unfunny movie is so over the top and pathetic and unrealistic that throughout the whole 90 minutes of utter torture i probably looked at my watch about 70000 times 0 
this pda rocks 1 
it was horrendous 0 
excellent 1 
the battery is unreliable as well as the service use antena 0 
he really didnt seem to want to be hosting his voiceovers were monotonous didnt get involved with the guests 0 
this was my first and only vegas buffet and it did not disappoint 1 
wow very spicy but delicious 1 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
using all earpieces left or right this thing will not stay on my ear 0 
the food is very good for your typical bar food 1 
we recently witnessed her poor quality of management towards other guests as well 0 
this battery is an excellent bargain 1 
the black eyed peas and sweet potatoes unreal 1 
another note about this phones appearance is that it really looks rather bland especially in the all black model 0 
i searched the internet and found this one to be the best value 1 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
i really recommend this faceplates since it looks very nice elegant and cool 1 
i bought this phone as a replacement for my startac and have regretted it since 0 
the poor actors 0 
delete this film from your mind 0 
really good product 1 
down the drain because of a weak snap 0 
food was really good and i got full petty fast 1 
the things that the four kids get themselves into is absolutely hilarious to watch 1 
doesnt work 0 
this short film certainly pulls no punches 0 
i received my headset in good time and was happy with it 1 
the majority of the logitech earbud headsets failed 0 
filmiing was less expansive 0 
and it was boring 0 
1 long lasting battery you dont have to recharge it as frequentyly as some of the flip phones2 0 
the phone loads super 1 
we made the drive all the way from north scottsdale and i was not one bit disappointed 1 
the reception has been generally good 1 
fantastic buy and will get again for whatever my next phone is 1 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
the screen size is big key pad lit well enough and the camera quality is excellent for a camera phone 1 
the salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop which was perfectly cooked 1 
it deserves strong love 1 
i was amazed at the quick arrival of the two original lg cell phone batteries and and at a fraction of the price 1 
the sweet potato tots were good but the onion rings were perfection or as close as i have had 1 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
i saw this short film on hbo the other day and absolutely loved it 1 
there is a brilliant twist ending 1 
today was my first taste of a buldogis gourmet hot dog and i have to tell you it was more than i ever thought possible 1 
this is an outstanding little restaurant with some of the best food i have ever tasted 1 
audio quality is poor very poor 0 
it is simple to use and i like it 1 
this is definitely a cult classic well worth viewing and sharing with others 1 
its a gloriously fun fast paced and fairly accurate portrayal of the night of a raver 1 
down the drain because of a weak snap 0 
the only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port irda 0 
when i received my pita it was huge it did have a lot of meat in it so thumbs up there 1 
yeah the movie pretty much sucked 0 
the lighting is just dark enough to set the mood 1 
the best phone in market 1 
excellent hands free tool 1 
but kevin spacey is an excellent verbal tsunami as buddy ackerman  and totally believable because he is a great actor 1 
this is my new fav vegas buffet spot 1 
the worst was the salmon sashimi 0 
victor mclaglen was even bad and brian donlevy was almost unrecognizable 0 
the live music on fridays totally blows 0 
the lead man is charismafree 0 
fans of the genre will be in heaven 1 
but this movie really got to me 1 
no one at the table thought the food was above average or worth the wait that we had for it 0 
not much dialogue not much music the whole film was shot as elaborately and aesthetically like a sculpture 1 
for that price i can think of a few place i would have much rather gone 0 
i will not return 0 
what on earth is irons doing in this film 0 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
we walked away stuffed and happy about our first vegas buffet experience 1 
graphics is far from the best part of the game 0 
portable and it works 1 
nothing new there 0 
the waitress and manager are so friendly 1 
o my gosh the best phone i have ever had 1 
i can take a little bad service but the food sucks 0 
the scenes with the ohsomature neighbourgirl are a misplace 0 
kids pizza is always a hit too with lots of great side dish options for the kiddos 1 
how awesome is that 1 
awful 0 
i came over from verizon because cingulair has nicer cell phones the first thing i noticed was the really bad service 0 
i had strawberry tea which was good 1 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
worth every penny 1 
ill be looking for a new earpiece 0 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
everything on the menu is terrific and we were also thrilled that they made amazing accommodations for our vegetarian daughter 1 
so far it has worked like a charm 1 
my side greek salad with the greek dressing was so tasty and the pita and hummus was very refreshing 1 
the steaks are all well trimmed and also perfectly cooked 1 
an italian reviewer called this a small great film and thats right 1 
as for the killer dont expect anything original or even remotely frightening 0 
performed awful muffled tinny incoming sound and severe echo for those on the other end of the call 0 
the characters are interesting even if a bit predictable 1 
we had fantastic service and were pleased by the atmosphere 1 
this is a bad film with bad writing and good actorsan ugly cartoon crafted by paul haggis for people who cant handle anything but the bold strokes in storytellinga picture painted with crayons 0 
penne vodka excellent 1 
the only downside is the service 0 
works well 1 
we made the drive all the way from north scottsdale and i was not one bit disappointed 1 
as for the killer dont expect anything original or even remotely frightening 0
