i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
there was so much hype over this phone that i assumed it was the best my mistake 0 
this is not moviemaking 0 
the tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu 0 
they are so cool 1 
to my disbelief each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods i have ever tasted 0 
dont waste your money 0 
we have gotten a lot of compliments on it 1 
so they performed 1 
very displeased 0 
avoid this one if you can 0 
save your money ive had this item for 11 months now 0 
i heart this place 1 
how stupid is that 0 
the tracfonewebsite is user friendly and makes it easy toactivate etc 1 
total waste of time 0 
i searched the internet and found this one to be the best value 1 
disappointed with battery 0 
excellent 1 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
very convenient since we were staying at the mgm 1 
bluetooth range is good a few days ago i left my phone in the trunk got a call and carried the conversation without a hitch 1 
initially the local sites in the film which was filmed here in buffalo intrigued me 1 
everything captain howdy says is either laughable or just plain stupid 0 
that movie was bad 0 
awsome device works great 1 
again lame 0 
that movie was bad 0 
voice recognition is tremendous 1 
those burgers were amazing 1 
this would not even be good as a made for tv flick 0 
the camera really likes her in this movie 1 
theres really nothing bad i can say about this headset 0 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
very slow at seating even with reservation 0 
i get absolutely horrible reception in my apartment where with other phones i have not had this problem 0 
as for the killer dont expect anything original or even remotely frightening 0 
the films dialogue is natural real to life 1 
i have been in more than a few bars in vegas and do not ever recall being charged for tap water 0 
everyone is treated equally special 1 
the acting is terrible and the writing is worse 0 
end of days is one of the worst bigbudget action movies ive ever seen 0 
this is simply the best bluetooth headset for sound quality 1 
battery chargelife is quite long 1 
i cant see how this movie can be an inspiration to anyone to come out or overcome fear and rejection 0 
great pizza and salads 1 
my gyro was basically lettuce only 0 
the chains which im no fan of beat this place easily 0 
either way it sucks 0 
i dont understand how this garbage got on the shelves of the movie store its not even a real movie 0 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
very disappointing 0 
the soundtrack sucked 0 
plus it was wellpaced and suited its relatively short run time 1 
bad script bad direction and horrible acting make this one plain bad 0 
this phone is pretty sturdy and ive never had any large problems with it 1 
so for our enjoyment we get to see them run around play games and be dangerous 1 
this device is great in several situations1 1 
used and dirty 0 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
doesnt hold charge 0 
by the time the film ended i not only disliked it i despised it 0 
i gave it 5 stars then and im giving it 5 stars now 1 
we had a group of 70 when we claimed we would only have 40 and they handled us beautifully 1 
the noise shield is incrediable 1 
bluetooth range is good a few days ago i left my phone in the trunk got a call and carried the conversation without a hitch 1 
i dont think there are any redeeming qualities in this remake 0 
waited 2 hours never got either of our pizzas as many other around us who came in later did 0 
worked very well paired with a treo 700w and as a skype headset on my pc using a usb bluetooth transceiver 1 
about half way through this film i started to dislike it 0 
steve martin delivers a really funny performance of a middleaged upper class uptight white guy 1 
some may say this buffet is pricey but i think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot 1 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
great phone 1 
made very sturdy 1 
kieslowski never ceases to amaze me 1 
the worst phone from samsungcrap this crappy samsung e715 is the worst i have ever seeen 0 
there were too many close ups 0 
everything stinks 0 
really really good rice all the time 1 
its one of the movies i need to see whenever it comes on tvnever mind the fact that i already have it memorized 1 
this place is like chipotle but better 1 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
avoid this establishment 0 
speaking of the music it is unbearably predictably and kitchy 0 
wont go back 0 
i have read others reviews here but i havent had any problem with it 1 
none of the new ones have ever quite worked properly 0 
i would have given no star if i was able 0 
i think not again 0 
2 thumbs up to this seller 1 
lange had become a great actress 1 
i wish i could enter negative values admins 0 
it is well made easy to access the phone and has a handy detachable belt clip 1 
try them in the airport to experience some tasty food and speedy friendly service 1 
the only very disappointing thing was there was no speakerphone 0 
works great 1 
the things that the four kids get themselves into is absolutely hilarious to watch 1 
nice blanket of moz over top but i feel like this was done to cover up the subpar food 1 
so flavorful and has just the perfect amount of heat 1 
all of the main players are mesmerising 1 
there was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters 0 
this place is not worth your time let alone vegas 0 
the text messaging feature is really tricky to use 0 
the 12 mega pixel camera being a part of a phone is reasonably good7 1 
updatewent back for a second time and it was still just as amazing 1 
all in all id expected a better consumer experience from motorola 0 
the food was excellent and service was very good 1 
this was such an awesome movie that i bought it off of ebay 1 
this is was due to the fact that it took 20 minutes to be acknowledged then another 35 minutes to get our foodand they kept forgetting things 0 
we ordered the duck rare and it was pink and tender on the inside with a nice char on the outside 1 
looks great and is strong 1 
generally it just lacked imagination 0 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
this early film from future goremeister lucio fulci is a very good addition to the giallo subgenre 1 
the bathroom is just next door and very nice 1 
lets start with all the problemsthe acting especially from the lead professor was very very bad 0 
they do not care about the consumer one bit 0 
the sangria was about half of a glass wine full and was 12 ridiculous 0 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
i also decided not to send it back because our waitress looked like she was on the verge of having a heart attack 0 
i wish i could return the unit and get back my money 0 
i ordered this for sony ericsson w810i but i think it only worked once thats when i first used it 0 
it felt like a very gripping intelligent stage play but without the overly theatrical feeling one actually gets from watching people on a stage which plays on everyones terror of a white lie escalating to monstrous consequences 1 
youll love it 1 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
im glad i found this product on amazon it is hard to find it wasnt high priced 1 
this phone might well be the worst ive ever had in any brand 0 
none of them are engaging or exciting 0 
i wouldnt see this movie again for free 0 
the stories were powerful explorations of the nature of man and of art 1 
well just if you keep thinking how bad it is 0 
best fish ive ever had in my life 1 
it has northern humour and positive about the community it represents 1 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
this pda rocks 1 
the roast beef sandwich tasted really good 1 
awesome device 1 
the bose noise cancelling is amazing which is very important for a nyc commuter 1 
were jerks on the phone 0 
do not buy do not buyit sucks 0 
this is some seriously good pizza and im an expertconnisseur on the topic 1 
i was so insulted 0 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
i really like this product over the motorola because it is allot clearer on the ear piece and the mic 1 
the fries were not hot and neither was my burger 0 
the live music on fridays totally blows 0 
does everything it should and more 1 
i dont think well be going back anytime soon 0 
i rate this movie 910 1 
very unreliable service from tmobile 0 
this place should honestly be blown up 0 
nice design and quality 1 
lasted one day and then blew up 0 
a good time 1 
i was hoping for more 0 
good beer drink selection and good food selection 1 
i struggle to find anything bad to say about it 1 
yes this film does require a rather significant amount of puzzlesolving but the pieces fit together to create a beautiful picture 1 
excellent dualpurpose headset 1 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
i gave it 5 stars because of the sound quality 1 
waste your money on this game 1 
still i do like this movie for its empowerment of women theres not enough movies out there like this one 1 
great phone 1 
i have tried these cables with my computer and my ipod and it works just fine 1 
we watched our waiter pay a lot more attention to other tables and ignore us 0 
crash is a depressing little nothing that provokes emotion but teaches you nothing if you already know racism and prejudice are bad things 0 
avoid avoid avoid 0 
while i managed to bend the leaf spring back in place the metal now has enough stress that it will break on the next drop 0 
steer clear of this product and go with the genuine palm replacementr pens which come in a threepack 0 
imdb ratings only go as low 1 for awful its time to get some negative numbers in there for cases such as these 0 
what possesed me to get this junk i have no idea 0 
great product fast shipping 1 
very satisifed with that 1 
it was horrendous 0 
why was this film made 0 
mediocre food 0 
everything about it is fine and reasonable for the price ie 1 
10 out of 10 for both the movie and trilogy 1 
good product incredible value 1 
tonight i had the elk filet specialand it sucked 0 
some great music and terrific scenery 1 
i asked multiple times for the wine list and after some time of being ignored i went to the hostess and got one myself 0 
everything was good and tasty 1 
this item is fantastic and works perfectly 1 
talk about useless customer service 0 
sound quality on both end is excellent i use headset to call my wife and ask my wife to use headset to call me 2 1 
its hard not to fall headoverheels in love with that girl 1 
i thought it was bad 0 
this place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver 0 
a pretty good product 1 
the battery is unreliable as well as the service use antena 0 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
then i exchanged for the same phone even that had the same problem 0 
i dont know what kind it is but they have the best iced tea 1 
it felt like a very gripping intelligent stage play but without the overly theatrical feeling one actually gets from watching people on a stage which plays on everyones terror of a white lie escalating to monstrous consequences 1 
youll love how thin it is 1 
battery chargelife is quite long 1 
ample portions and good prices 1 
very good lunch spot 1 
shes poised and amazing 1 
everything about this product is wrongfirst 0 
fantastic food 1 
the success of the film depends on the casting of sydney greenstreet as the alexander yardley character 1 
poorly contstruct hinge 0 
its a little geeky but i think thats its sex on toast and it rocks and oozes sex right down to its battery embedded sleek stylish leather case 1 
i highly recommend these and encourage people to give them a try 1 
then as if i hadnt wasted enough of my life there they poured salt in the wound by drawing out the time it took to bring the check 0 
i am sorry i made this purchase 0 
phone falls out easily 0 
dont waste your money 0 
the selection of food was not the best 0 
very good phone 1 
you can even take self portraits with the outside exterior display very cool 1 
special thanks to dylan t for the recommendation on what to order all yummy for my tummy 1 
third the cheese on my friends burger was cold 0 
muddy low quality sound and the casing around the wires insert was poorly super glued and slid off 0 
my order was not correct 0 
after my phone got to be about a year old its been slowly breaking despite much care on my part 0 
that company is a joke 0 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
dont waste your on this one 0 
appears to actually outperform the original battery from china that came with my v325i 1 
i really enjoyed eating here 1 
one of the best mexican movies ever and one of the less understood even by mexican themselves no matter how identified the should have felt with it 1 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
the instructions didnt explain that a microphone jack could be used 0 
the new characters werent all that memorable and i found myself forgetting who was who 0 
the chips that came out were dripping with grease and mostly not edible 0 
what happened next was prettyoff putting 0 
when i opened the sandwich i was impressed but not in a good way 0 
it was a riot to see hugo weaving play a sexobsessed gay real estate salesman who uses his clients houses for his trysts with the flaming darren tom hollander 1 
the cinematographyif it can be called thatsucked 0 
i dont think well be going back anytime soon 0 
i mean really how do you get so famous for your fish and chips when its so terrible 0 
i love it 1 
the holster that arrived did not match the photo in the ad 0 
it was way over fried 0 
the folks at otto always make us feel so welcome and special 1 
seriously its not worth wasting your or your kids time on 0 
maybe if they werent cold they would have been somewhat edible 0 
that being said for a phone the camera is very nice many cool effects to play with and video is decent as well 1 
it also took her forever to bring us the check when we asked for it 0 
hot dishes are not hot cold dishes are close to room tempi watched staff prepare food with bare hands no gloveseverything is deep fried in oil 0 
i mean really how do you get so famous for your fish and chips when its so terrible 0 
do not buy do not buyit sucks 0 
its very slow 0 
i got home to see the driest damn wings ever 0 
the battery is working well as a replacement for the original that came with the phone over 2 years ago 1 
lame would be the best way to describe it 0 
the place was fairly clean but the food simply wasnt worth it 0 
battery life is real good 1 
before i go in to why i gave a 1 star rating please know that this was my third time eating at bachi burger before writing a review 0 
it is not good 0 
setup went very smoothly 1 
very unreliable service from tmobile 0 
no complaints 1 
speaking of the music it is unbearably predictably and kitchy 0 
black water is a thriller that manages to completely transcend its limitations its an indie flick by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience 1 
highly entertaining at all angles 1 
light weight i hardly notice it is there 1 
the football scenes at the end were perplexing 0 
the food was great as always compliments to the chef 1 
but when someone strives for greatness and poetry but delivers a muddled and often ridiculous story a bunch of disparate scenes pretentious dialogue then you get the worst kind of a movie that some other reviewer very accurately defined as pretentious crap 0 
all in all id expected a better consumer experience from motorola 0 
car charger as well as ac charger are included to make sure you never run out of juicehighy recommended 1 
an hour and a half i wish i could bring back 0 
they made this case too small and is very difficult to install 0 
i love the camera its really pretty good quality 1 
the only suspense i was feeling was the frustration at just how retarded the girls were 0 
and dont even get me started on the jerky camerawork 0 
it didnt charge for me 0 
i guess i should have known that this place would suck because it is inside of the excalibur but i didnt use my common sense 0 
stopped by during the late may bank holiday off rick steve recommendation and loved it 1 
i felt as though her going to ireland did absolutely nothing whatsoever 0 
kieslowski never ceases to amaze me 1 
either way it sucks 0 
now i know that i made a wise decision 1 
this fixes all the problems 1 
the acting by the whole cast could be put on a scale and balanced perfectly between overacting and underacting 0 
it was equally awful 0 
it was way over fried 0 
too politically correct 0 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
i might have gotten a defect but i would not risk buying it again because of the built quality alone 0 
the script is was there a script 0 
jamie foxx absolutely is ray charles 1 
think of the film being like a dream 1 
check it out 1 
it has a very good plot it holds your complete attention the acting is superb tom wilkinson was fantastic and emily watson was also very good 1 
the restaurant is very clean and has a family restaurant feel to it 1 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
a good time 1 
but it picked up speed and got right to the point 1 
really really good rice all the time 1 
better than youd expect 1 
this film offers many delights and surprises 1 
the concert sequences just sucked 0 
the concert sequences just sucked 0 
the speaker is of low quality so as making the ring tones sound very cheap 0 
the acting is beyond abysmal 0 
waitress was a little slow in service 0 
nice case feels good in your hands 1 
worst customer service ever 0 
sauce was tasteless 0 
i used bitpim a free program you can find on the internetto transfer data to the phonethe price of the cable was excellent 1 
its a gloriously fun fast paced and fairly accurate portrayal of the night of a raver 1 
doesnt do the job 0 
from here on the widmark character turns unintentionally comical 0 
lots of holes in the script 0 
i gave it a 10 1 
ive tried several different earpieces for my cell phone and this jabra one is the first one ive found that fits my ear comfortably 1 
the service here leaves a lot to be desired 0 
bacon is hella salty 1 
wont go back 0 
im probably one of the few people to ever go to ians and not like it 0 
highly unrecommended 0 
it wasnt busy at all and now we know why 0 
again no plot at all 0 
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
anyways the food was definitely not filling at all and for the price you pay you should expect more 0 
i know this is not like the other restaurants at all something is very off here 0 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
regardless the film fails on most levels 0 
you wont be disappointed 1 
one nice thing was that they added gratuity on the bill since our party was larger than 6 or 8 and they didnt expect more tip than that 1 
babie bop is very cute 1 
all it took was one drop from about 6 inches above the kitchen counter and it was crackedi am not impressed and i am not laughing 0 
it deserves strong love 1 
i had a pretty satifying experience 1 
i particularly remember my senses being assaulted by strident cords of music that would blare out with very little warning and even less meaning 0 
the charger worked for about a week and then completely stopped charging my phone 0 
so bad 0 
the cast of veteran actors are more than just a nostalgia trip 1 
i wouldnt return 0 
hated it 0 
service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is vegas and located inside the crystals shopping mall by aria 1 
a cheap and cheerless heist movie with poor characterisation lots of underbite style stoic emoting think chow yun fat in a better tomorrow and some cheesy clichés thrown into an abandoned factory ready for a few poorly executed flying judo rolls a la john woo 0 
people who like european films and art movies will like this movie 1 
a piece of cinematic garbage captured on celluloid 0 
conclusion i loved it 1 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
this is one of peter watkins most accessible films 1 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
the lighting is just dark enough to set the mood 1 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
i have had tmobile service for 2 or 3 years now and i am pretty happy with it 1 
if there was ever a movie that needed wordofmouth to promote this is it 1 
buyer beware you could flush money right down the toilet 0 
waitress was a little slow in service 0 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
i dont have very many words to say about this place but it does everything pretty well 1 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
the instruction manual is lacking 0 
tom wilkinson broke my heart at the end and everyone elses judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike 1 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
we got sitting fairly fast but ended up waiting 40 minutes just to place our order another 30 minutes before the food arrived 0 
both of the egg rolls were fantastic 1 
it was also the right balance of war and love 1 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
the text messaging feature is really tricky to use 0 
clear skype calls long battery life long range 1 
a standout scene 1 
utterly without merit on any level this is akin to torture 0 
the block was amazing 1 
it was just too horrible 0 
a very charming film with wonderful sentiment and heart 1 
hated it 0 
i did not bother contacting the company for few dollar product but i learned the lesson that i should not have bought this form online anyway 0 
however the ear pads come off easily and after only one week i lost one 0 
it was pretty gross 0 
then theres the plot holes 0 
i had to wait over 30 minutes to get my drink and longer to get 2 arepas 0 
the sergeant pepper beef sandwich with auju sauce is an excellent sandwich as well 1 
i will never forget it now 1 
ill even say it again  this is torture 0 
horrible phone 0 
the camera although rated at an impressive 13 megapixels renders images that fall well below expectations of such a relatively high resolution 0 
very convenient since we were staying at the mgm 1 
lots of holes in the script 0 
bad choice 0 
what on earth is irons doing in this film 0 
for a product that costs as much as this one does i expect it to work far better and with greater ease than this thing does 0 
the sound quality for the device is unacceptableunless you are in a really quiet area you almost hear nothing 0 
lovely little thriller from hitchcock with lots of nice shenanigans surrounding a murdered spy a kidnapped child a nasty church a foreign plot and some random taxidermists 1 
i had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get some relief 0 
light weight i hardly notice it is there 1 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
battery is terrible 0 
eclectic selection 1 
if i take a picture the battery drops a bar and starts beeping letting me know its dieing 0 
echo problemvery unsatisfactory 0 
the worst sappiest dialogue i could go on and on 0 
seriously its not worth wasting your or your kids time on 0 
i received it quickly and it works great 1 
im pleased 1 
highly recommended 1 
enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film 1 
the least said about the acting the better 0 
the story starts too fast with absolutely no suspense or buildup in the slightest 0 
i ordered this for sony ericsson w810i but i think it only worked once thats when i first used it 0 
just really good so far probably the best bt headset i have ever had 1 
oh and i forgot to also mention the weird color effect it has on your phone 0 
it is an excellent drama an excellent thriller and an excellent film 1 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
none of them are engaging or exciting 0 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
if you look for authentic thai food go else where 0 
see both films if you can 1 
i mean this in a terrible way 0 
ambience is perfect 1 
excellent short film 1 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
it was just not a fun experience 1 
everything stinks 0 
the incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film 1 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
spend your money elsewhere 0 
this is essentially a communications tool that does not communicate 0 
great price also 1 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
there are so many problems i dont know where to start 0 
it doesnt make you look cool 0 
if this premise sound stupid thats because it is 0 
good transmit audio 1 
honeslty it didnt taste that fresh 0 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
the phone takes forever to charge like 2 to 5 hours literally 0 
its a great item 1 
the design is very odd as the ear clip is not very comfortable at all 0 
everything was perfect the night we were in 1 
the tracfonewebsite is user friendly and makes it easy toactivate etc 1 
treo and tmobile refused to replace it again and forced me to buy another phone without any kind of upgrade discount 0 
however the keypads are so tinny that i sometimes reach the wrong buttons 0 
tried to go here for lunch and it was a madhouse 0 
as a courtroom drama its compelling as an indictment on the american justice system its frightening 1 
kieslowski never ceases to amaze me 1 
the chicken dishes are ok the beef is like shoe leather 0 
i wont be back 0 
they work about 2 weeks then break 0 
both of them were truly unbelievably good and i am so glad we went back 1 
how can anyone in their right mind ask for anything more from a movie than this 1 
portable and it works 1 
i got home to see the driest damn wings ever 0 
the sweet potato tots were good but the onion rings were perfection or as close as i have had 1 
the veggitarian platter is out of this world 1 
overpriced for what you are getting 0 
2 thumbs up to this seller 1 
if youre not familiar check it out 1 
perhaps my phone is defective but people cannot hear me when i use this 0 
lewis blacks considerable talent is wasted here too as he is at his most incendiary when he is unrestrained which the pg13 rating certainly wont allow 0 
i do not know if this was emilio estevezs directorial debut but the pacing the interplay and development of the characters as well as some clever camera work surrounding the character estevez plays all suggest a natural eye 1 
we would recommend these to others 1 
adapter does not provide enough charging current 0 
bacon is hella salty 1 
the buttons for on and off are bad 0 
the best phone in market 1 
i love all the features and form factor 1 
i guess i should have known that this place would suck because it is inside of the excalibur but i didnt use my common sense 0 
very funny 1 
never been to hard rock casino before will never ever step forward in it again 0 
in particular the relationship between the bakery assistant and the waitress just didnt work for me at all 0 
this place is like chipotle but better 1 
really bad 0 
there is a totally unnecessary trainroller coaster scene 0 
best tacos in town by far 1 
great software for motorolas 1 
i would highly recommend this 1 
great product for the price 1 
i enjoyed reading this book to my children when they were little 1 
i could eat their bruschetta all day it is devine 1 
this is one of the best movies out there that shows such strong sibling bond for each other 1 
cinematography the film was shot in an interesting way 1 
unfortunately this is a bad movie that is just plain bad 0 
her lines seem to have been written by a fifteen year old though they are trying oh so so hard to sound like how a fifteen year old would really um you know well talk 0 
buttons are too small 0 
that being said for a phone the camera is very nice many cool effects to play with and video is decent as well 1 
doesnt last long 0 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in 0 
its not hard to make a decent hamburger 0 
highquality chicken on the chicken caesar salad 1 
the headsets are easy to use and everyone loves them 1 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
the script is bad very bad  it contains both cheesiness and unethical joke that you normally see in rated r or nc17 movie 0 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
i was not impressed by this product 0 
nice sound 1 
the sides are delish mixed mushrooms yukon gold puree white corn beateous 1 
this was my first and only vegas buffet and it did not disappoint 1 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
i mean really how do you get so famous for your fish and chips when its so terrible 0 
it was a great phone 1 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
not a good bargain 0 
the chips that came out were dripping with grease and mostly not edible 0 
dont go here 0 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
the acting was decidely wooden though no worse than a period universal b movie 0 
definitely will come back here again 1 
generous portions and great taste 1 
my breakfast was perpared great with a beautiful presentation of 3 giant slices of toast lightly dusted with powdered sugar 1 
it is well made easy to access the phone and has a handy detachable belt clip 1 
juano hernandez an exceptional actor who played supporting roles in many films of the era is a proud black man who is accused of murdering a white man in the south 1 
this item is fantastic and works perfectly 1 
the service was meh 0 
my friend did not like his bloody mary 0 
this product is great it makes working a lot easier i can go to the copier while waiting on hold for something 1 
that company is a joke 0 
very prompt service 1 
i bought this phone as a replacement for my startac and have regretted it since 0 
the characters are interesting even if a bit predictable 1 
i probably would not go here again 0 
not much seafood and like 5 strings of pasta at the bottom 0 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
it is not good 0 
i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
i exchanged the sony ericson z500a for this and im pretty happy with that decision 1 
poor quality and service 0 
first off the reception sucks i have never had more than 2 bars ever 0 
nothing short of magnificent photographycinematography in this film 1 
the mic there is a joke and the volume is quite low 0 
emily watsons character is very strong and she has only to give a quick glance and you understand everything 1 
the majority of the logitech earbud headsets failed 0 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
but above all the exquisite visual composition of each moment with inventive and elegant use of closeup camera angle and lighting including pointillistic faux home movie footage is a wonder and joy to behold 1 
the charger arrived within the promised timeframe but it did not work 0 
in summary this was a largely disappointing dining experience 0 
voice recognition is tremendous 1 
we made the drive all the way from north scottsdale and i was not one bit disappointed 1 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
he was very impressed when going from the original battery to the extended battery 1 
to those who find this movie intelligent or even masterful i can only say its your intelligence and your imagination you obviously used to try and make some sense of this pitiful attempt its in our human nature to try and make sense of things 0 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
the least said about the acting the better 0 
would not go back 0 
from what my dinner companions told meeverything was very fresh with nice texture and taste 1 
disappointed 0 
ive had this bluetoooth headset for some time now and still not comfortable with the way it fits on the ear 0 
instead we got a bore fest about a whiny spoiled brat babysitting 0 
it has been a winner for us 1 
every element of this story was so over the top excessively phony and contrived that it was painful to sit through 0 
he owns the film just as spacek owned coal miners daughter and quaid owned great balls of fire 1 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
things that went wrong they burned the saganaki 0 
it was a drive to get there 0 
great phone 1 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
waste your money on this game 1 
the crêpe was delicate and thin and moist 1 
my 810 score is mostly for the plot 1 
anne heche was utterly convincing 1 
i will not be eating there again 0 
his costars dont fare much better with people like morgan freeman jonah hill and ed helms just wasted 0 
it clicks into place in a way that makes you wonder how long that mechanism would last 0 
lordy the khao soi is a dish that is not to be missed for curry lovers 1 
disappointed 0 
really really good rice all the time 1 
i highly recommend these and encourage people to give them a try 1 
the kids are annoying 0 
for 40 bucks a head i really expect better food 0 
i cant use this case because the smell is disgusting 0 
the cast of veteran actors are more than just a nostalgia trip 1 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
while you dont yet hear mickey speak there are tons of sound effects and music throughout the filmsomething we take for granted now but which was a huge crowd pleaser in 1928 1 
this phone is pretty sturdy and ive never had any large problems with it 1 
camera color balance is awful 0 
it was not good 0 
i guess that nobody at the network that aired this dribble watched it before putting it on 0 
the sound is clear and the people i talk to on it are amazed at the quality too 1 
the warm beer didnt help 0 
i can assure you that you wont be disappointed 1 
excellent short film 1 
i would not recommend this place 0 
not as good as i had hoped 0 
the battery is completely useless to me 0 
i connected my wifes bluetoothmotorola hs850 to my phone and it worked like a charm whether the phone was in my pocket or the case 1 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
sending it back 0 
i would not recommend this place 0 
if you have several dozen or several hundred contacts then imagine the fun of sending each of them one by one 0 
you share general loewenhielms exquisite joy in his partaking of the cailles en sarcophage even though you are just watching a movie but you do wish for just a small sample to savor 1 
its one of the movies i need to see whenever it comes on tvnever mind the fact that i already have it memorized 1 
crust is not good 0 
i felt asleep the first time i watched it so i can recommend it for insomniacs 0 
and then tragedy struck 0 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
wow loved this place 1 
thank you for such great service 1 
great atmosphere friendly and fast service 1 
the scallop dish is quite appalling for value as well 0 
the movie had you on the edge of your seat and made you somewhat afraid to go to your car at the end of the night 1 
will not be back 0 
customer service was terrible 0 
this phone is pretty sturdy and ive never had any large problems with it 1 
the dialogue is composed of things that make little sense 0 
no plot whatsoever 0 
ray charles is legendary 1 
product is useless since it does not have enough charging current to charge the 2 cellphones i was planning to use it with 0 
works as described 1 
i got it because it was so small and adorable 1 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
the very idea of it was lame take a minor character from a mediocre pg13 film and make a complete nonsequel while changing its tone to a pgrated family movie 0 
you could drive a semi truck into these holes 0 
everything about this product is wrongfirst 0 
the best place to go for a tasty bowl of pho 1 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
cooked to perfection and the service was impeccable 1 
i wish i could enter negative values admins 0 
i love the look and feel of samsung flipphones 1 
not easy to watch 0 
its like a bad two hour tv movie 0 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
i wouldnt see this movie again for free 0 
no im going to eat the potato that i found some strangers hair in it 0 
the food was excellent and service was very good 1 
our server was very nice and even though he looked a little overwhelmed with all of our needs he stayed professional and friendly until the end 1 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
was not happy 0 
as many people complained i found this headsets microphone was very weak 0 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
very very fun chef 1 
waitress was good though 1 
thanks good a movie like this was done and released 1 
so there is no way for me to plug it in here in the us unless i go by a converter 0 
what a mistake 0 
poor quality 0 
overall i rate this movie a 10 out of a 110 scale 1 
im super pissd 0 
i would recommend purchasing the jabra jx10 series 2 which works flawlessly with my moto q go figure 1 
just really good so far probably the best bt headset i have ever had 1 
it dit not work most of the time with my nokia 5320 0 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
worked perfectly 1 
this one is simply a disappointment 0 
i have been in more than a few bars in vegas and do not ever recall being charged for tap water 0 
i was left shattered from the experience of watching this film and i took a good two hours to fully recover 0 
its aggravating 0 
dont waste your on this one 0 
you can find better movies at youtube 0 
the cinematography is simply stunning to say the least and the fx are nothing if not stateoftheart 1 
it didnt charge for me 0
