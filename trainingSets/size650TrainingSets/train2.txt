nonlinear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well 1 
what on earth is irons doing in this film 0 
this is a great restaurant at the mandalay bay 1 
excellent performance 1 
otherwise dont even waste your time on this 0 
he was very impressed when going from the original battery to the extended battery 1 
still its quite interesting and entertaining to follow 1 
actually the graphics were good at the time 1 
this place has it 1 
it just blew 0 
trumbull on i love lucy 1 
having trouble with volume 0 
one of the best mexican movies ever and one of the less understood even by mexican themselves no matter how identified the should have felt with it 1 
too bad you have to pay up to a month for the service 0 
very tough and very short on flavor 0 
restaurant is always full but never a wait 1 
ive seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie 0 
phenomenal food service and ambiance 1 
great price also 1 
this place lacked style 0 
very very disappointed ordered the 35 big bay plater 0 
this is an outstanding little restaurant with some of the best food i have ever tasted 1 
very windresistant 1 
it looses connection to the phone even when it is within a couple feet between the two 0 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
the food wasnt good 0 
it sure does beat the nachos at the movies but i would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant 0 
battery life is also great 1 
i found a six inch long piece of wire in my salsa 0 
the sound quality for the device is unacceptableunless you are in a really quiet area you almost hear nothing 0 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
the restaurant atmosphere was exquisite 1 
the scripting of the subtle comedy is unmatched by any movie in recent years 1 
very good stuff for the price 1 
overall i was not impressed and would not go back 0 
all in all i think it was a good investment 1 
gave up trying to eat any of the crust teeth still sore 0 
the attempts at humor were pitiful and story is so awful it dosent bear thinking about which basically involves a vulcan stealing the enterprise to find god seriously i just didnt care about any of this film and oh not to mention uhura does a belly dance to distract male guards 0 
it sure does beat the nachos at the movies but i would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant 0 
it is an hour and half waste of time following a bunch of very pretty high schoolers whine and cry about life 0 
i have to mention this and it is a huge spoiler i loved the ending how all the characters of the three films were the remaining survivors of the ferry disaster with valentine and the young judge together and the old man watching it on her tv solidifying his happiness over the suffering which he dealt with for those many years 1 
disappointed with battery 0 
speaking of the music it is unbearably predictably and kitchy 0 
we started with the tuna sashimi which was brownish in color and obviously wasnt fresh 0 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
in other words the content level of this film is enough to easily fill a dozen other films 1 
this hole in the wall has great mexican street tacos and friendly staff 1 
it is simple to use and i like it 1 
the eargels channel the sound directly into your ear and seem to increase the sound volume and clarity 1 
this is not moviemaking 0 
all of the tapas dishes were delicious 1 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
also the story and acting were weak 0 
this review is long overdue since i consider a tale of two sisters to be the single greatest film ever made 1 
really good product 1 
performed awful muffled tinny incoming sound and severe echo for those on the other end of the call 0 
i mean in a realistic world she would never have gotten into that ballet repertory the whole thing was quite pathetic 0 
as many people complained i found this headsets microphone was very weak 0 
its a shame to see good actors like thomerson and james make a living in a mess like this 0 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
the story is also both funny and poignant at times 1 
all in all i think it was a good investment 1 
for the price on amazon it is an excellent product which i would highly recommend 1 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
definitely worth checking out 1 
it felt like a very gripping intelligent stage play but without the overly theatrical feeling one actually gets from watching people on a stage which plays on everyones terror of a white lie escalating to monstrous consequences 1 
end of days is one of the worst bigbudget action movies ive ever seen 0 
the worst was the salmon sashimi 0 
1010 1 
motorola finally got the voice quality of a bluetooth headset right 1 
i have recommended it to friends 1 
these are fabulous 1 
an interesting premise and billy drago is always good as a dangerous nutbag side note id love to see drago stephen mchattie and lance hendrikson in a flick together talk about raging cheekbones 1 
and the beans and rice were mediocre at best 0 
hands down my favorite italian restaurant 1 
the bartender was also nice 1 
we wont be going back 0 
that one didnt work either 0 
what a waste of money and time 0 
they really want to make your experience a good one 1 
the owners are super friendly and the staff is courteous 1 
duris has a wholesome appearance and gives a fine performance 1 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
not tasty and the texture was just nasty 0 
weird vibe from owners 0 
the lighting is just dark enough to set the mood 1 
sounds good reasonably priced and effective its that simple 1 
i am so tired of clich√©s that is just lazy writing and here they come in thick and fast 0 
garbo who showed right off the bat that her talents could carry over from the silent era i wanted to see some of her silent work but netflix doesnt seem to be stocking them 1 
it felt like a very gripping intelligent stage play but without the overly theatrical feeling one actually gets from watching people on a stage which plays on everyones terror of a white lie escalating to monstrous consequences 1 
good servicecheck 1 
i didnt know pulled pork could be soooo delicious 1 
portable and it works 1 
battery is holding up well 1 
unfortunately it will not recharge my iphone 4s despite connecting it from multiple power sources imac external battery wall outlet etc 0 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
conclusion very filling meals 1 
dont waste your time watching this rubbish nonresearched film 0 
trumbull on i love lucy 1 
wont work right or atleast for me 0 
will order from them again 1 
they work about 2 weeks then break 0 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
i would definitely recommend the jabra bt250v for those who are looking for comfort clarity and a great price 1 
we would recommend these to others 1 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
i have only had it for a few weeks but so far so good 1 
so just beware 0 
excellent bluetooth headset 1 
the death row scenes were entirely unmoving 0 
full of unconvincing cardboard characters it is blandly written by edward chodorov who also produced and is surprisingly directed by jean negulesco from whom one would expect a great deal more 0 
comfortable nice range good battery life 1 
host staff were for lack of a better word bitches 0 
i do love sushi but i found kabuki to be overpriced overhip and underservices 0 
i was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar not only because the quality is great but the service is fast and the food impeccable 1 
best tater tots in the southwest 1 
i did not have any problem with this item and would order it again if needed 1 
best service and food ever maria our server was so good and friendly she made our day 1 
im not sure how long we stood there but it was long enough for me to begin to feel awkwardly out of place 0 
gets the job done 1 
im a bit disappointed 0 
disapointing results 0 
i got this phone on reccomendation from a relative and im glad i did 1 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
i checked out this place a couple years ago and was not impressed 0 
ive had this for nearly 2 years and it has worked great for me 1 
we made the drive all the way from north scottsdale and i was not one bit disappointed 1 
it was equally awful 0 
the chefs were friendly and did a good job 1 
gave up trying to eat any of the crust teeth still sore 0 
it was a pale color instead of nice and char and has no flavor 0 
i liked it 1 
we would recommend these to others 1 
he surely doesnt know how to make a coherent action movie from the screenwriter of air force one who was only obliged to write the script just for a big sum of money 0 
it dit not work most of the time with my nokia 5320 0 
the food was outstanding and the prices were very reasonable 1 
very much disappointed with this company 0 
the descriptions said yum yum sauce and another said eel sauce yet another said spicy mayowell none of the rolls had sauces on them 0 
this place receives stars for their appetizers 1 
small sleek impressive looking practical setup with ample storage in place 1 
add betty white and jean smart and you have a great cast everyone played their parts really well 1 
the aerial scenes were welldone 1 
but it is great i would really recommend it 1 
the fact is this film is a wonderful heartwarming tale about two people chasing their dreams 1 
good product incredible value 1 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
very very disappointed ordered the 35 big bay plater 0 
on the ground right next to our table was a large smeared beensteppedinandtrackedeverywhere pile of green bird poop 0 
this is an unbelievable bargain 1 
iam very pleased with my purchase 1 
awesome selection of beer 1 
the movie is full of wonderful dancing hence the title 1 
both of the egg rolls were fantastic 1 
id rather eat airline food seriously 0 
actually the graphics were good at the time 1 
not a pleasant voyage of selfdiscovery 0 
nice solid keyboard 1 
yet i enjoy watching it 1 
talk about useless customer service 0 
its like a bad two hour tv movie 0 
i used bitpim a free program you can find on the internetto transfer data to the phonethe price of the cable was excellent 1 
it also had a new problem 0 
overall i like this place a lot 1 
worth every penny 1 
it was horrible 0 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
this was a different cut than the piece the other day but still wonderful and tender s well as well flavored 1 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
ample portions and good prices 1 
the delivery was on time 1 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
we are so glad we found this place 1 
this was such an awesome movie that i bought it off of ebay 1 
the cinematography is simply stunning to say the least and the fx are nothing if not stateoftheart 1 
it is very comfortable to wear as well which is probably the most important aspect about using a case 1 
it is an hour and half waste of time following a bunch of very pretty high schoolers whine and cry about life 0 
nine out of ten for a truly lovely film 1 
i never walked out of a movie faster 0 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
im a bit disappointed 0 
theres really nothing bad i can say about this headset 0 
to call this movie a drama is ridiculous 0 
the construction of the headsets is poor 0 
the most annoying thing about cover girl is the way in which rita hayworth is put up on a pedestal 0 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
this is the phone to get for 2005 i just bought my s710a and all i can say is wow 1 
to be honest with you this is unbelievable nonsense and very foolish 0 
the movie has almost no action scenes in it and very little comedy 0 
terrible my car will not accept this cassette 0 
at any rate this film stinks its not funny and fulci should have stayed with giallo and supernatural zombie movies 0 
the worst sappiest dialogue i could go on and on 0 
is it possible for a movie to get any worse than this 0 
jabra ear gels r the best 1 
im happy about this purchase good quality and low price 1 
the visual effects were awful 0 
well packaged arrived on time and works as intended 1 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
however bt headsets are currently not good for real time games like firstperson shooters since the audio delay messes me up 0 
nonlinear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well 1 
john wayne did an incredible job for being so young in the movie industry 1 
the service was terrible though 0 
this is a bad film with bad writing and good actorsan ugly cartoon crafted by paul haggis for people who cant handle anything but the bold strokes in storytellinga picture painted with crayons 0 
i was not impressed by this product 0 
i was disgusted because i was pretty sure that was human hair 0 
this movie is bad 0 
avoid at all costs 0 
personally i think it shows that people should learn to find a compromise them self without involving other people into issue 1 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
phone is sturdy as all nokia bar phones are 1 
ray charles life provided excellent biographical material for the film which goes well beyond being just another movie about a musician 1 
again no plot at all 0 
however i recently watched the whole thing again on dvd and i was completely struck by how extremely stupid the storyline was how it contained holes inconsistencies and frankly a whole lot of crap and how horrid the dancing was 0 
five star plus plus 1 
the nano stated itmy son was dissapointed 0 
the story which was told so eloquently by francis ford coppola 25 years earlier really unfolds gradually and leaves room for the characters to develop 1 
very bad performance plays angela bennett a computer expert who is at home all the time 0 
not good when wearing a hat or sunglasses 0 
for people who are first timers in film making i think they did an excellent job 1 
there is a brilliant twist ending 1 
ample portions and good prices 1 
a piece of junk that broke after being on my phone for 2 days 0 
in fact this stinker smells like a directtovideo release 0 
magical help 1 
overall i am psyched to have a phone which has all my appointments and contacts in and gets great reception 1 
there is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again 0 
people who like european films and art movies will like this movie 1 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
i was very pleased to see that i could replace my well travled swivel holster for my blackberry flip 1 
you could only take 2 videos at a time and the quality was very poor 0 
overall i like this place a lot 1 
a standout scene 1 
ryans bar is definitely one edinburgh establishment i wont be revisiting 0 
rating 010 grade z note the show is so bad that even mother of the cast pull her daughter out of the show 0 
first time going but i think i will quickly become a regular 1 
what a piece of junk i lose more calls on this phone 0 
another thing i didnt really like is when a character got punched in the face a gallon of blood would spew forth soon after 0 
the film gives meaning to the phrase never in the history of human conflict has so much been owed by so many to so few 1 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
could not get strong enough signal 0 
lots of holes in the script 0 
first time there and might just be the last 0 
the construction of the headsets is poor 0 
they never brought a salad we asked for 0 
the cg opening sequence in space looked like it could have been created on microsoft slideshow for gods sake 0 
ive owned this phone for 7 months now and can say that its the best mobile phone ive had 1 
their steaks are 100 recommended 1 
i think this restaurant suffers from not trying hard enough 0 
i saw it as a child on tv back in 1973 when it was the stranger and i loved it 1 
i had strawberry tea which was good 1 
it was clear that she had the range and ability to pull off this part 1 
this movie is also revealing 1 
i would not recommend this place 0 
not recommended 0 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
i would not recommend this place 0 
but the service was beyond bad 0 
all it took was one drop from about 6 inches above the kitchen counter and it was crackedi am not impressed and i am not laughing 0 
waitress was a little slow in service 0 
bad purchase 0 
by this time our side of the restaurant was almost empty so there was no excuse 0 
bad fit way too big 0 
about ten minutes into this film i started having second thoughts 0 
the puppets look really cheesy not in a good way like in the puppet master 80s flicks 0 
i got the aluminum case for my new palm vx and it worked really wellit has protected my handheld perfectly so far 1 
the film succeeds despite or perhaps because of an obviously meagre budget 1 
its aggravating 0 
it has northern humour and positive about the community it represents 1 
magical help 1 
lame would be the best way to describe it 0 
its this pandering to the audience that sabotages most of his films 0 
worthless product 0 
and those baby owls were adorable 1 
a world better than 95 of the garbage in the theatres today 1 
excellent 1 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
and sometimes it was so embarrassing that i had to look away 0 
it was clear that she had the range and ability to pull off this part 1 
i had strawberry tea which was good 1 
avoid this establishment 0 
go watch it 1 
the chicken dishes are ok the beef is like shoe leather 0 
it was so boring 0 
there was a warm feeling with the service and i felt like their guest for a special treat 1 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
this place lacked style 0 
the pancake was also really good and pretty large at that 1 
soggy and not good 0 
special mention should be made of the superb music score and sound effects which are an integral element in helping to make this such a memorable and enjoyable cartoon 1 
to my disbelief each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods i have ever tasted 0 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
the camera really likes her in this movie 1 
if there is a wind it is completely useless 0 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
end of days is one of the worst bigbudget action movies ive ever seen 0 
i was very pleased to see that i could replace my well travled swivel holster for my blackberry flip 1 
it also took her forever to bring us the check when we asked for it 0 
why are these sad little vegetables so overcooked 0 
owners are really great people 1 
my order was not correct 0 
i have had mine for about a year and this christmas i bought some for the rest of the family 1 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
its fits like a glove and is strong secure and durable 1 
the most annoying thing about cover girl is the way in which rita hayworth is put up on a pedestal 0 
they have a plethora of salads and sandwiches and everything ive tried gets my seal of approval 1 
i think not again 0 
the service was terrible food was mediocre 0 
the food came out at a good pace 1 
an excellent new restaurant by an experienced frenchman 1 
this is such a fun and funny movie 1 
i love their fries and their beans 1 
this film has no redeeming features 0 
i did not bother contacting the company for few dollar product but i learned the lesson that i should not have bought this form online anyway 0 
nice design and quality 1 
battery chargelife is quite long 1 
the script is a big flawed mess 0 
i saw this film over christmas and what a great film it was 1 
the service here leaves a lot to be desired 0 
there was hardly any meat 0 
the only good thing was that it fits comfortably on small ears 1 
the refried beans that came with my meal were dried out and crusty and the food was bland 0 
i mean in a realistic world she would never have gotten into that ballet repertory the whole thing was quite pathetic 0 
the bottowm lineanother worthless cheap gimmick from sprint 0 
i ended up sliding it on the edge of my pants or back pockets instead 1 
a very very very slowmoving aimless movie about a distressed drifting young man 0 
i was totally fascinated by the music the dancing everything 1 
he is almost unbearable to watch on screen he has little to no charisma and terrible comedic timing 0 
which are small and not worth the price 0 
over rated 0 
damn good steak 1 
the chips that came out were dripping with grease and mostly not edible 0 
in addition it feels amp looks as if the phone is all lightweight cheap plastic 0 
on the good side the staff was genuinely pleasant and enthusiastic a real treat 1 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
the service was terrible though 0 
in a word it is embarrassing 0 
despite the pans of reviewers i liked this movie 1 
elias koteasjack palance play good roles angelina is hot and gets nakedbilly drago appears in this and is cool as usual a cameo by sven ole thorsen helps make this a very enjoyable movie with good acting and a decent budget 1 
1010 1 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
i found a six inch long piece of wire in my salsa 0 
gets a signal when other verizon phones wont 1 
i wouldnt see this movie again for free 0 
this place deserves no stars 0 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
its very attractive and appears to be of good quality 1 
the guys all had steaks and our steak loving son who has had steak at the best and worst places said it was the best steak hes ever eaten 1 
worst hour and a half of my lifeoh my gosh 0 
avoid this establishment 0 
its an empty hollow shell of a movie 0 
this fixes all the problems 1 
but its just not funny 0 
everyone is very attentive providing excellent customer service 1 
all in all a great disappointment 0 
wont ever go here again 0 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
be sure to order dessert even if you need to pack it togo the tiramisu and cannoli are both to die for 1 
last time buying from you 0 
the shrimp tender and moist 1 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
best fish ive ever had in my life 1 
needless to say we will never be back here again 0 
bad choice 0 
i have bought this nokia cell phone a few weeks ago and it was a nightmare 0 
it was so bad i had lost the heart to finish it 0 
a fly was in my apple juice a fly 0 
will never ever go back 0 
not nearly as good looking as the amazon picture makes it look 0 
muddy low quality sound and the casing around the wires insert was poorly super glued and slid off 0 
i got home to see the driest damn wings ever 0 
she ordered a toasted english muffin that came out untoasted 0 
there is a totally unnecessary trainroller coaster scene 0 
the results well are a shame 0 
the selection of food was not the best 0 
best ive found so far ive tried 2 other bluetooths and this one has the best quality for both me and the listener as well as ease of using 1 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
great food and great service in a clean and friendly setting 1 
my 810 score is mostly for the plot 1 
the acting helps the writing along very well maybe the idiotsavant sister could have been played better and it is a real joy to watch 1 
its extremely slow and takes forever to do anything with it 0 
that said our mouths and bellies were still quite pleased 1 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
but in terms of the writing its very fresh and bold 1 
tied to charger for conversations lasting more than 45 minutesmajor problems 0 
this was a different cut than the piece the other day but still wonderful and tender s well as well flavored 1 
nice leather 1 
i received it quickly and it works great 1 
great character actors telly savalas and peter boyle 1 
awful 0 
i love the ownerchef his one authentic japanese cool dude 1 
dessert panna cotta was amazing 1 
the waitresses are very friendly 1 
there are the usual hitchcock logic flaws 0 
think it over when you plan to own this onethis sure is the last moto phone for me 0 
worst foodservice ive had in a while 0 
it was attached to a gas station and that is rarely a good sign 0 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
both actors truly understand and become their particular character delivering a convincing sincere performance 1 
we made the drive all the way from north scottsdale and i was not one bit disappointed 1 
im a big fan of this series mostly due to anne rices style sensitivities and treatments 1 
and the sound quality is great 1 
im not really sure how joeys was voted best hot dog in the valley by readers of phoenix magazine 0 
nothing special 0 
excellent short film 1 
the guys all had steaks and our steak loving son who has had steak at the best and worst places said it was the best steak hes ever eaten 1 
so just beware 0 
best breakfast buffet 1 
has been working great 1 
it didnt charge for me 0 
great product 1 
i have been very happy with the 510 and have had no complaints from any one regarding my sound quality on their end 1 
for that its worth checking out 1 
dont buy this product it fails 0 
this is cool because most cases are just open there allowing the screen to get all scratched up 1 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
this was like the final blow 0 
in the summer you can dine in a charming outdoor patio so very delightful 1 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
i dont have to be an accountant to know im getting screwed 0 
i was very disappointed in the movie 0 
their menu is diverse and reasonably priced 1 
the new characters werent all that memorable and i found myself forgetting who was who 0 
so flavorful and has just the perfect amount of heat 1 
we started with the tuna sashimi which was brownish in color and obviously wasnt fresh 0 
the worst phone from samsungcrap this crappy samsung e715 is the worst i have ever seeen 0 
when my mom and i got home she immediately got sick and she only had a few bites of salad 0 
love the margaritas too 1 
tried to go here for lunch and it was a madhouse 0 
the scenes with the ohsomature neighbourgirl are a misplace 0 
good value great food great service 1 
i am so pleased to know such a modern day genius is out there letting is passion for art drive him and taking us as an audience with him 1 
bland and flavorless is a good way of describing the barely tepid meat 0 
bluetooth does not work phone locks up screens just flash up and now it just makes calls randomly while in my pocket locked 0 
for a product that costs as much as this one does i expect it to work far better and with greater ease than this thing does 0 
the ripped banana was not only ripped but petrified and tasteless 0 
this is some seriously good pizza and im an expertconnisseur on the topic 1 
i came over from verizon because cingulair has nicer cell phones the first thing i noticed was the really bad service 0 
highly unrecommended 0 
it is shameful 0 
plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job 1 
food is way overpriced and portions are fucking small 0 
this hole in the wall has great mexican street tacos and friendly staff 1 
there is nothing authentic about this place 0 
but its just not funny 0 
very bad performance plays angela bennett a computer expert who is at home all the time 0 
this movie suffered because of the writing it needed more suspense 0 
the attempts at humor were pitiful and story is so awful it dosent bear thinking about which basically involves a vulcan stealing the enterprise to find god seriously i just didnt care about any of this film and oh not to mention uhura does a belly dance to distract male guards 0 
it failed to convey the broad sweep of landscapes that were a great part of the original 0 
its reception is very very poor 0 
great food 1 
also difficult to put onid recommend avoiding this product 0 
a pretty good product 1 
end of days is one of the worst bigbudget action movies ive ever seen 0 
the movie has almost no action scenes in it and very little comedy 0 
the only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port irda 0 
the flat reenactments dont hold your attention because they are emotionally adrift and stagy 0 
love it great armband 1 
product is useless since it does not have enough charging current to charge the 2 cellphones i was planning to use it with 0 
food was great and so was the serivce 1 
it is an excellent drama an excellent thriller and an excellent film 1 
so i basically threw my money out the window for nothing 0 
ill definitely be in soon again 1 
trying to make a call on these is an exercise in frustration 0 
comfortable in my hand 1 
people couldnt hear me talk and i had to pull out the earphone and talk on the phone 0 
im so happy to be here 1 
alexander nevsky is a great film 1 
the interplay between martin and emilio contains the same wonderful chemistry we saw in wall street with martin and charlie 1 
ill put this gem up against any movie in terms of screenplay cinematography acting postproduction editing directing or any other aspect of filmmaking 1 
about half way through this film i started to dislike it 0 
i hate to disagree with my fellow yelpers but my husband and i were so disappointed with this place 0 
however this didnt make up for the fact that overall this was a tremendously boring movie 0 
poor product 0 
spoilers whatever else can or cant be said about it surface is superbly crafted 1 
also the phone doesnt seem to accept anything except cbr mp3s preferably ripped by windows media player 0 
linksys should have some way to exchange a bad phone for a refurb unit or something 0 
they do not care about the consumer one bit 0 
this is a good joint 1 
first the bathrooms at this location were dirty seat covers were not replenished just plain yucky 0 
the steak and the shrimp are in my opinion the best entrees at gc 1 
he owns the film just as spacek owned coal miners daughter and quaid owned great balls of fire 1 
light weight i hardly notice it is there 1

some applause should be given to the prelude however 1

his performance as awarded was stunning 1 
the acting was decidely wooden though no worse than a period universal b movie 0 
i purcashed this for the car charger and it does not work 0 
it is an insane game 1 
the waitress and manager are so friendly 1 
lewis blacks considerable talent is wasted here too as he is at his most incendiary when he is unrestrained which the pg13 rating certainly wont allow 0 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
we ordered the duck rare and it was pink and tender on the inside with a nice char on the outside 1

to those who find this movie intelligent or even masterful i can only say its your intelligence and your imagination you obviously used to try and make some sense of this pitiful attempt its in our human nature to try and make sense of things 0 
they have a really nice atmosphere 1

well im satisfied 1 
there is simply no excuse for something this poorly done 0 
we got sitting fairly fast but ended up waiting 40 minutes just to place our order another 30 minutes before the food arrived 0 
drinks took close to 30 minutes to come out at one point 0 
this is high adventure at its best 1 
the battery works great 1

we have tried 2 units and they both failed within 2 months pros 0 
i did not expect this to be so good 1 
the jabra eargels fit my ears very well 1 
the construction of the headsets is poor 0 
i was shocked because no signs indicate cash only 0 
i cant believe theres even a sequel to this 0 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
i am so tired of clich√©s that is just lazy writing and here they come in thick and fast 0 
i am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this 1 
disappointed with battery 0 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1

victor mclaglen was even bad and brian donlevy was almost unrecognizable 0

i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
i was very disappointed in the movie 0 
you need two hands to operate the screenthis software interface is decade old and cannot compete with new software designs 0 
furthermore you cant even find hours of operation on the website 0 
unfortunately it will not recharge my iphone 4s despite connecting it from multiple power sources imac external battery wall outlet etc 0 
the food wasnt good 0 
those phones are working just fine now 1 
my only complaint is the standard sound volume is a little low even when turned up to 5of 5 0 
the guys all had steaks and our steak loving son who has had steak at the best and worst places said it was the best steak hes ever eaten 1 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
awesome selection of beer 1 
it probably would have been better if the director hadnt spent most of the movie showcasing his own art work which really isnt that noteworthy 0 
it was that loudglad to say that the plantronics 510 maintains a flawless connection to my cell and with no static during normal use 1 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
the chips that came out were dripping with grease and mostly not edible 0 
the vegetables are so fresh and the sauce feels like authentic thai 1 
the ripped banana was not only ripped but petrified and tasteless 0 
this does not fit the palm tungsten e2 and it broke the first time i tried to plug it in 0 
the acting by the whole cast could be put on a scale and balanced perfectly between overacting and underacting 0 
after one bite i was hooked 1 
theres barely a boring moment in the film and there are plenty of humorous parts 1 
the vegetables are so fresh and the sauce feels like authentic thai 1

as many people complained i found this headsets microphone was very weak 0 
and i really did find them funny 1 
this is a beautiful phone 1 
good audio quality 1 
nice headset priced right 1 
it is just the sort of pap that is screened in the afternoon to punish the unemployed for not having jobs 0 
the results well are a shame 0 
eew this location needs a complete overhaul 0 
i seriously cannot believe that the owner has so many unexperienced employees that all are running around like chickens with their heads cut off 0 
the ambiance isnt much better 0 
im glad the film didnt go for the most obvious choice as a lesser film certainly would have 1 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
if you are looking for a good quality motorola headset keep looking this isnt it 0 
ive had better not only from dedicated boba tea spots but even from jenni pho 0 
punishment park is a brilliant piece of cinema 1 
made very sturdy 1 
worst martini ever 0 
same problem as others have mentioned 0 
there arent death scenes like in previous movies and the fx are terrible 0 
maybe there would be a reasonable explanation for this atrocity 0 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
while you dont yet hear mickey speak there are tons of sound effects and music throughout the filmsomething we take for granted now but which was a huge crowd pleaser in 1928 1 
this is not moviemaking 0 
not much flavor to them and very poorly constructed 0 
the pan cakes everyone are raving about taste like a sugary disaster tailored to the palate of a six year old 0 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
it is practically useless and did not add any kind of boost to my reception after i bought it 0
