the lighting is just dark enough to set the mood 1 
the acting sucked 0 
mark my words this is one of those cult films like evil dead 2 or phantasm that people will still be discovering and falling in love with 20 30 40 years down the line 1 
very much disappointed with this company 0 
any ring toneoverall good phone to buy 1 
with great sound effects and impressive special effects i cant recommend this movie enough 1 
the wind and the lion is well written and superbly acted 1 
i recently had problems where i could not stay connected for more than 10 minutes before being disconnected 0 
both of them were truly unbelievably good and i am so glad we went back 1 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
steve martin delivers a really funny performance of a middleaged upper class uptight white guy 1 
this would not even be good as a made for tv flick 0 
i ended up sliding it on the edge of my pants or back pockets instead 1 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
i hate those things as much as cheap quality black olives 0 
the fish is badly made and some of its underwater shots are repeated a thousand times in the film 0 
worst customer service ever 0 
talk about useless customer service 0 
the shower area is outside so you can only rinse not take a full shower unless you dont mind being nude for everyone to see 0 
its reception is very very poor 0 
due to this happening on every call i was forced to stop using this headset 0 
i definitly recommend 1 
i love lane but ive never seen her in a movie this lousy 0 
only had this a month but its worked flawlessly so far 1 
the macarons here are insanely good 1 
my fiancé and i came in the middle of the day and we were greeted and seated right away 1 
the servers went back and forth several times not even so much as an are you being helped 0 
great product for the price 1 
dont go here 0 
this may be the only bad film he ever made 0 
it is an excellent drama an excellent thriller and an excellent film 1 
i dont have to be an accountant to know im getting screwed 0 
excellent short film 1 
it crackles with an unpredictable youthful energy but honestly i found it hard to follow and concentrate on it meanders so badly 0 
very bad performance plays angela bennett a computer expert who is at home all the time 0 
i just cant explain this movie more than romanticcharminghilariousand adorablethe junkyard scenes are funnyall the junkyard dogs have something specialtoo funny i laughedkids will love itbuy it when it comes outit has new features 1 
that said our mouths and bellies were still quite pleased 1 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
the story starts too fast with absolutely no suspense or buildup in the slightest 0 
the update procedure is difficult and cumbersome 0 
i have recommended it to friends 1 
the loudspeaker option is great the bumpers with the lights is very appealing 0 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
blue ant is easy to use 1 
very disappointing 0 
best breakfast buffet 1 
omg the food was delicioso 1 
the update procedure is difficult and cumbersome 0 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
all in all i think it was a good investment 1 
this movie does an excellent job of revealing the complexity of the task and the incredible challenges facing south africa 1 
works as described 1 
my first visit to hiro was a delight 1 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
if you love authentic mexican food and want a whole bunch of interesting yet delicious meats to choose from you need to try this place 1 
meredith m was better than all right 1 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
worst hour and a half of my lifeoh my gosh 0 
i would recommend this 1 
i bought this to use with my kindle fire and absolutely loved it 1 
its a piece of crap 0 
often the dialogue doesnt really follow from one line to another or fit the surroundings 0 
the headsets are easy to use and everyone loves them 1 
performed awful muffled tinny incoming sound and severe echo for those on the other end of the call 0 
the entire audience applauded at the conclusion of the film 1 
his use of the colours of the french flag in the three films was nothing short of incredible every shot every scene was like a work of art 1 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
great software for motorolas 1 
the plastic breaks really easy on this clip 0 
i have had mine for about a year and this christmas i bought some for the rest of the family 1 
the building itself seems pretty neat the bathroom is pretty trippy but i wouldnt eat here again 0 
i own 2 of these cases and would order another 1 
just dont know why they were so slow 0 
the only suspense i was feeling was the frustration at just how retarded the girls were 0 
any ring toneoverall good phone to buy 1 
ill even say it again  this is torture 0 
overall i like there food and the service 1 
poor product 0 
this place is amazing 1 
the waitresses are very friendly 1 
bland and flavorless is a good way of describing the barely tepid meat 0 
i was deeply impressed with the character he played 1 
my boyfriend and i came here for the first time on a recent trip to vegas and could not have been more pleased with the quality of food and service 1 
just really good so far probably the best bt headset i have ever had 1 
fits comfortably came with three sizes of earbud tips 1 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
waitress was good though 1 
no complaints 1 
if you want a real scare rent this one 1 
muddy low quality sound and the casing around the wires insert was poorly super glued and slid off 0 
the accompanied software is almost brilliant 1 
they have a really nice atmosphere 1 
the only very disappointing thing was there was no speakerphone 0 
the selection was probably the worst ive seen in vegasthere was none 0 
great pocket pc phone combination 1 
also the fries are without a doubt the worst fries ive ever had 0 
i was totally fascinated by the music the dancing everything 1 
the movie is terribly boring in places 0 
i would recommend saving room for this 1 
could not get strong enough signal 0 
freezes frequently4 0 
this is an extraordinary film 1 
give this one a look 1 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
i just saw this film and i recommend it 1 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
its kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly its embarrassing how childlike the company is 0 
you could drive a semi truck into these holes 0 
terrible product and waste of money 0 
wont ever go here again 0 
he was very impressed when going from the original battery to the extended battery 1 
seller shipped quickly and much cheaper than the competitors 1 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
the ripped banana was not only ripped but petrified and tasteless 0 
it rocked my world and is certainly a must see for anyone with no social or physical outlets 1 
it was quite comfortable in the ear 1 
even if you love bad movies do not watch this movie 0 
this is the kind of money that is wasted properly 1 
works good 1 
the acting is beyond abysmal 0 
i got home to see the driest damn wings ever 0 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
victor mclaglen was even bad and brian donlevy was almost unrecognizable 0 
i left the theater with a lilt in my step joy in my heart and hope for the human race 1 
but the premise of the film was so ridiculous that the president of the us 0 
the instructions didnt explain that a microphone jack could be used 0 
the live music on fridays totally blows 0 
it was pretty gross 0 
just dont know why they were so slow 0 
i dressed up to be treated so rudely 0 
it is very comfortable to wear as well which is probably the most important aspect about using a case 1 
truly awful 0 
best service and food ever maria our server was so good and friendly she made our day 1 
what should have been a hilarious yummy christmas eve dinner to remember was the biggest fail of the entire trip for us 0 
nice case feels good in your hands 1 
delicious nyc bagels good selections of cream cheese real lox with capers even 1 
love it great armband 1 
the ripped banana was not only ripped but petrified and tasteless 0 
overall the film is interesting and thoughtprovoking 1 
and the red curry had so much bamboo shoots and wasnt very tasty to me 0 
overall i like there food and the service 1 
same problem as others have mentioned 0 
this place is great 1 
lucy bell is so much higher than this crap and for her to sink this low is quite depressing 0 
from here on the widmark character turns unintentionally comical 0 
great product for the price 1 
first time going but i think i will quickly become a regular 1 
the staff was very attentive 1 
unfortunately this is a bad movie that is just plain bad 0 
the telephone repair man was really funny and his reactions to the nuts and bitchy boss were truly genuine 1 
this fixes all the problems 1 
first time going but i think i will quickly become a regular 1 
but other than that the movie seemed to drag and the heroes didnt really work for their freedom 0 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
i have recommended it to friends 1 
youd have to have the iq of particularly stupid mollusk not to see that one coming 0 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
it was a good thing that the tickets only cost five dollars because i would be mad if id have paid 750 to see this crap 0 
they refuse to refund or replace 0 
however the ear pads come off easily and after only one week i lost one 0 
and generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode 0 
it was too predictable even for a chick flick 0 
w810i is just superb 1 
there was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters 0 
but in any case the best part is you can download these pictures to your laptop using ir or even send pictures from your laptop to the phone 1 
the only good thing was that it fits comfortably on small ears 1 
again no plot at all 0 
in fact im going to round up to 4 stars just because she was so awesome 1 
there still are good actors around 1 
i love the camera its really pretty good quality 1 
what i really like there is the crepe station 1 
waste your money on this game 1 
the food was terrible 0 
the price was very good and with the free shipping and all it was a good purchase 1 
seller shipped quickly and much cheaper than the competitors 1 
very comfortable 1 
for the price this was a great deal 1 
the basic premise is wasted since it is sidelined by the inexplicable focus on the documentary crew 0 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
you will leave the theater wanting to go out and dance under the stars 1 
i really liked that 1 
i left the theater with a lilt in my step joy in my heart and hope for the human race 1 
service is quick and even to go orders are just like we like it 1 
battery is holding up well 1 
i only hear garbage for audio 0 
it worked very well 1 
we also ordered the spinach and avocado salad the ingredients were sad and the dressing literally had zero taste 0 
the service was poor and thats being nice 0 
integrated seamlessly with the motorola razr phone 1 
with great sound effects and impressive special effects i cant recommend this movie enough 1 
you need at least 3 mins to get to your phone book from the time you first turn on the phonebattery life is short 0 
not even a hello we will be right with you 0 
the owner used to work at nobu so this place is really similar for half the price 1 
i know he was a contract player with little control over his scripts but the acting was as bad as the script 0 
food was below average 0 
i also decided not to send it back because our waitress looked like she was on the verge of having a heart attack 0 
the characters are fleshed out surprisingly well particularly grimes and blake and all the actors deliver their sharply scripted lines with just the right amount of deadpan tongue in cheek to make the dialogue both hilarious and realistic 1 
i checked out this place a couple years ago and was not impressed 0 
the ri style calamari was a joke 0 
it is the best charger i have seen on the market yet 1 
i was seated immediately 1 
the sides are delish mixed mushrooms yukon gold puree white corn beateous 1 
their monster chicken fried steak and eggs is my all time favorite 1 
at around 4 pm i bought it at around 8pm i started to watch at around 815pm i fast forwarded the remaining film to see if there was anything left watchable for a human being with a brain but there wasnt 0 
lordy the khao soi is a dish that is not to be missed for curry lovers 1 
so i had to take the battery out of the phone put it all back together and then restart it 0 
def coming back to bowl next time 1 
star trek v the final frontier is the worst in the series 0 
the best phone in market 1 
the owner used to work at nobu so this place is really similar for half the price 1 
woa talk about awful 0 
blue ant is easy to use 1 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
awesome service and food 1 
bad fit way too big 0 
very disappointed 0 
product is useless since it does not have enough charging current to charge the 2 cellphones i was planning to use it with 0 
went in for happy hour great list of wines 1 
worst customer service 0 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
light weight i hardly notice it is there 1 
a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it 1 
then i exchanged for the same phone even that had the same problem 0 
while you dont yet hear mickey speak there are tons of sound effects and music throughout the filmsomething we take for granted now but which was a huge crowd pleaser in 1928 1 
simply beautiful 1 
but now that it is out of warranty the same problems reoccurebottom line put your money somewhere else cingular will not support it 0 
he was extremely rude and really there are so many other restaurants i would love to dine at during a weekend in vegas 0 
putting the race card aside lets look at the major flaw in the film they destroy latifas character 0 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
i own 2 of these cases and would order another 1 
not too screamy not to masculine but just right 1 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
nice design and quality 1 
id advise anyone to go and see it 1 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
their chow mein is so good 1 
works great 1 
i highly recommend this movie for anyone interested in art poetry theater politics or japanese history 1 
i went on motorolas website and followed all directions but could not get it to pair again 0 
not good when wearing a hat or sunglasses 0 
i have purchased these for both family and friends and all enjoy their clarity and ease of use 1 
we had so much to say about the place before we walked in that he expected it to be amazing but was quickly disappointed 0 
we have tried 2 units and they both failed within 2 months pros 0 
see it with your kids if you have a chanceit will open up some amazing dialog about how far race relations have come in the last 50 years 1 
it came free with a dvd player i bought but i still turned the thing off halfway through because i was embarrassed for howell 0 
no im going to eat the potato that i found some strangers hair in it 0 
if the food isnt bad enough for you then enjoy dealing with the worlds worstannoying drunk people 0 
how can you call yourself a steakhouse if you cant properly cook a steak i dont understand 0 
service was fantastic 1 
go rent it 1 
lightweight and works well 1 
worked very well paired with a treo 700w and as a skype headset on my pc using a usb bluetooth transceiver 1 
this is one of the best italian thrillers of the early 70s 1 
ill even say it again  this is torture 0 
my brother in law who works at the mall ate here same day and guess what he was sick all night too 0 
the live music on fridays totally blows 0 
i recommend this for everyone who loves film movies anythinga work of art 1 
when i received my pita it was huge it did have a lot of meat in it so thumbs up there 1 
friends pasta also bad he barely touched it 0 
my salad had a bland vinegrette on the baby greens and hearts of palm 0 
not to mention the combination of pears almonds and bacon is a big winner 1 
lets start with all the problemsthe acting especially from the lead professor was very very bad 0 
works great 1 
ordered an appetizer and took 40 minutes and then the pizza another 10 minutes 0 
piece of junk 0 
this movie was kind of long in length but i enjoyed every minute of it 1 
fans of the genre will be in heaven 1 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
bluetooth does not work phone locks up screens just flash up and now it just makes calls randomly while in my pocket locked 0 
the staff is friendly and the joint is always clean 1 
and the sound quality is great 1 
awesome service and food 1 
it has all the features i want 1 
makes it easier to keep up with my bluetooth when im not wearing it 0 
if you stay in vegas you must get breakfast here at least once 1 
the voice recognition thru the handset is excellent 1 
i like steiners because its dark and it feels like a bar 1 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
great price too 1 
the live music on fridays totally blows 0 
however after seeing the short again after about 25 years i was amazed at how timeless the film actually is 1 
only like 3 or 4 buildings used a couple of locations maybe poor hummh 0 
very true to shakespear and a must for all shakespear fans 1 
updatewent back for a second time and it was still just as amazing 1 
disappointed 0 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
the sangria was about half of a glass wine full and was 12 ridiculous 0 
it dit not work most of the time with my nokia 5320 0 
this if the first movie ive given a 10 to in years 1 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
i was very pleased to see that i could replace my well travled swivel holster for my blackberry flip 1 
we had so much to say about the place before we walked in that he expected it to be amazing but was quickly disappointed 0 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
even the squibs look awful 0 
the accompanied software is almost brilliant 1 
i hate movies like that 0 
the films dialogue is natural real to life 1 
it doesnt work in europe or asia 0 
by the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant i was bored and didnt care what happened next and so i switched off 0 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
the success of the film depends on the casting of sydney greenstreet as the alexander yardley character 1 
alexander nevsky is a great film 1 
unreliable im giving up 0 
his costars dont fare much better with people like morgan freeman jonah hill and ed helms just wasted 0 
it doesnt work in europe or asia 0 
the ripped banana was not only ripped but petrified and tasteless 0 
excellent short film 1 
it was probably dirt 0 
after the first charge kept going dead after 12 minutes 0 
used and dirty 0 
yes its that bad 0 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
we wont be going back anytime soon 0 
the food is not tasty at all not to say its real traditional hunan style 0 
this is essentially a communications tool that does not communicate 0 
this place is amazing 1 
def coming back to bowl next time 1 
i do love sushi but i found kabuki to be overpriced overhip and underservices 0 
i was not happy with this item 0 
the plug did not work very well 0 
the bartender was also nice 1 
what makes this story different are the terrific production values faultless photography composition and editing the terrific casting the underappreciated brian keith playing a bully teddy and vivid history 1 
you cant go wrong with any of the food here 1 
very disappointed in accessoryone 0 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
my first visit to hiro was a delight 1 
even when the women finally show up there is no sign of improvement the most expected things happen and by the time the film is over you might be far asleep 0 
i great reception all the time 1 
i have read others reviews here but i havent had any problem with it 1 
buyerbe very careful 0 
your brain will attempt to shutdown as part of a primal impulse of selfpreservation 0 
what a waste 0 
utterly without merit on any level this is akin to torture 0 
the voice recognition thru the handset is excellent 1 
it is a joy to use 1 
i consider this theft 0 
overall the film is interesting and thoughtprovoking 1 
it was an inexpensive piece but i would still have expected better quality 0 
if there were zero stars i would give it zero stars 0 
honeslty it didnt taste that fresh 0 
any ring toneoverall good phone to buy 1 
the cast is good 1 
excellent phone 1 
poor sound quality 0 
however after seeing the short again after about 25 years i was amazed at how timeless the film actually is 1 
never heard of any of them except cole who was totally unbelievable in the part 0 
highly unrecommended 0 
i have never had such bland food which surprised me considering the article we read focused so much on their spices and flavor 0 
steamboat willie is an amazingly important film to our cinema history 1 
but kevin spacey is an excellent verbal tsunami as buddy ackerman  and totally believable because he is a great actor 1 
im not eating here 0 
go watch it 1 
i gave it a 10 1 
the movie was so boring that i sometimes found myself occupied peaking in the paper instead of watching never happened during a columbo movie before 0 
the construction of the headsets is poor 0 
the chips and sals a here is amazing 1 
a great touch 1 
i waited and waited 0 
the football scenes at the end were perplexing 0 
very disappointing 0 
the buttons for on and off are bad 0 
being a 90s child i truly enjoyed this show and i can proudly say that i enjoyed it big time and even more than the classical wb cartoons 1 
the chicken dishes are ok the beef is like shoe leather 0 
this is one of peter watkins most accessible films 1 
fits comfortably came with three sizes of earbud tips 1 
this is a bad film with bad writing and good actorsan ugly cartoon crafted by paul haggis for people who cant handle anything but the bold strokes in storytellinga picture painted with crayons 0 
all in all i think it was a good investment 1 
couldnt use the unit with sunglasses not good in texas 0 
the price was very good and with the free shipping and all it was a good purchase 1 
there is simply no excuse for something this poorly done 0 
very disappointing 0 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
product is useless since it does not have enough charging current to charge the 2 cellphones i was planning to use it with 0 
food arrived quickly 1 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
i dressed up to be treated so rudely 0 
i dont think ill be running back to carlys anytime soon for food 0 
just whatever you do avoid groove as its the antithesis of all that is good about human traffic 0 
omg the food was delicioso 1 
fantastic food 1 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
i had the mac salad and it was pretty bland so i will not be getting that again 0 
lordy the khao soi is a dish that is not to be missed for curry lovers 1 
avoid avoid avoid 0 
both do good jobs and are quite amusing 1 
cant get the software to work with my computer 0 
tonight i had the elk filet specialand it sucked 0 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
this is such a fun and funny movie 1 
great pocket pc phone combination 1 
plug was the wrong size 0 
i would recommend saving room for this 1 
the battery works great 1 
very clear quality sound and you dont have to mess with the sound on your ipod since you have the sound buttons on the headset 1 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
its just painful 0 
motorola finally got the voice quality of a bluetooth headset right 1 
the food was delicious our bartender was attentive and personable and we got a great deal 1 
kids pizza is always a hit too with lots of great side dish options for the kiddos 1 
ive had this for nearly 2 years and it has worked great for me 1 
the transfers are very good 1 
all in all id expected a better consumer experience from motorola 0 
the flat reenactments dont hold your attention because they are emotionally adrift and stagy 0 
nice case feels good in your hands 1 
service sucks 0 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
only had this a month but its worked flawlessly so far 1 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
my husband and i ate lunch here and were very disappointed with the food and service 0 
the concert sequences just sucked 0 
both the hot sour the egg flower soups were absolutely 5 stars 1 
but in terms of the writing its very fresh and bold 1 
each day of the week they have a different deal and its all so delicious 1 
adapter does not provide enough charging current 0 
it even has its sweet moments 1 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
very disappointed 0 
its pure brilliance 1 
just what i wanted 1 
the food is very good for your typical bar food 1 
some great music and terrific scenery 1 
im returning them 0 
the seller is very understanding and patient i would definitely buy from them again 1 
but what really made it unwatchable was the direction 0 
the food was very good 1 
ive also had problems with the phone reading the memory card in which i always turn it on and then off again 0 
good servicecheck 1 
lucy bell is so much higher than this crap and for her to sink this low is quite depressing 0 
bad purchase 0 
the mic there is a joke and the volume is quite low 0 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
it was so bad i had lost the heart to finish it 0 
how can anyone in their right mind ask for anything more from a movie than this 1 
the microphone also works well but according to people i have called it applifies everything 1 
love the margaritas too 1 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
this blueant supertooth handsfree phone speaker is awesome 1 
nothing new there 0 
first off the reception sucks i have never had more than 2 bars ever 0 
he was extremely rude and really there are so many other restaurants i would love to dine at during a weekend in vegas 0 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
the story is beyond stupid 0 
service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is vegas and located inside the crystals shopping mall by aria 1 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
not worth it 0 
there is no plot here to keep you going in the first place 0 
very good food great atmosphere1 1 
i went to bachi burger on a friends recommendation and was not disappointed 1 
great it was new packaged nice works good no problems and it came in less time then i expected 1 
this is a witty and delightful adaptation of the dr seuss book brilliantly animated by upas finest and thoroughly deserving of its academy award 1 
jamie foxx absolutely is ray charles 1 
for the price this was a great deal 1 
similarly the delivery man did not say a word of apology when our food was 45 minutes late 0 
good protection and does not make phone too bulky 1 
overall i like there food and the service 1 
join the club and get awesome offers via email 1 
bad fit way too big 0 
even worse than ticker 0 
maybe its just their vegetarian fare but ive been twice and i thought it was average at best 0 
which is precisely why i am giving it such a bad review 0 
at no point in the proceedings does it look remotely like america 0 
funny clever hip just like prays previous film hype 1 
do not waste your time 0 
im so happy to be here 1 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
gotta love those closeups of slimy drooling teeth 1 
the kids are very cool too 1 
strike 2 who wants to be rushed 0 
it is the best charger i have seen on the market yet 1 
now the burgers arent as good the pizza which used to be amazing is doughy and flavorless 0 
the price was very good and with the free shipping and all it was a good purchase 1 
the pizza selections are good 1 
phone is sturdy as all nokia bar phones are 1 
it was so bad i had lost the heart to finish it 0 
the kids are annoying 0 
this greedy corporation will never see another dime from me 0 
service is also cute 1 
in addition to having one of the most lovely songs ever written french cancan also boasts one of the cutest leading ladies ever to grace the screen 1 
cant get the software to work with my computer 0 
hard to judge whether these sides were good because we were grossed out by the melted styrofoam and didnt want to eat it for fear of getting sick 0 
the plantains were the worst ive ever tasted 0 
but storm trooper is not even bad enough to make it to the list of wonderfully terrible movies 0 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
returned 8 hours later 0 
we are sending it back 0 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
after a year the battery went completely dead on my headset 0 
stopped by during the late may bank holiday off rick steve recommendation and loved it 1 
works great 1 
it deserves strong love 1 
i had heard good things about this place but it exceeding every hope i could have dreamed of 1 
im glad i found this product on amazon it is hard to find it wasnt high priced 1 
the chains which im no fan of beat this place easily 0 
it is so small and you dont even realize that it is there after a while of getting used to it 1 
we definately enjoyed ourselves 1 
it was a long time that i didnt see a so charismatic actor on screen 1 
worse theres an incredibly weak subplot thrown in that follows a little band of latterday mansonites as they go after a reporter whos working on a story on the anniversary of the killings 0 
avoid this one if you can 0 
great pork sandwich 1 
down the drain because of a weak snap 0 
the menu is always changing food quality is going down service is extremely slow 0 
highquality chicken on the chicken caesar salad 1 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
comfortable nice range good battery life 1 
i checked out this place a couple years ago and was not impressed 0 
ample portions and good prices 1 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
the greek dressing was very creamy and flavorful 1 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
the ambiance was incredible 1 
better than new 1 
small sleek impressive looking practical setup with ample storage in place 1 
nine out of ten for a truly lovely film 1 
not good for the money 0 
i am very happy 1 
the music in the film is really nice too 1 
i will be back many times soon 1 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
only had this a month but its worked flawlessly so far 1 
overall i would recommend this phone over the new walkman 1 
in the span of an hour i had two people exclaim whoa is that the new phone on tv 1 
horrible horrible protector 0 
this is a chilly unremarkable movie about an author livingworking in a chilly abstruse culture 0 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
the only good thing was that it fits comfortably on small ears 1 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
nothing special 0 
best ive found so far ive tried 2 other bluetooths and this one has the best quality for both me and the listener as well as ease of using 1 
how can that bethe audio quality is poor 0 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
it wasnt busy either also the building was freezing cold 0 
the real killer is the volume and of course it breaking 0 
i consider this theft 0 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
painful on the ear 0 
he was very impressed when going from the original battery to the extended battery 1 
the sound quality is excellent as well 1 
aailiyah was pretty good as akasha in places compelling her first entrance and mini dance scene 1 
so i had to take the battery out of the phone put it all back together and then restart it 0 
my mother and brother had to do thiswhen i saw robert ryan portraying this type of man it was a very good imitation of this type of individual and i was impressed 1 
its very slow 0 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
also makes it easier to hold on to 1 
there is so much good food in vegas that i feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to rice and company 0 
brilliance indeed 1 
too politically correct 0 
i go to far too many places and ive never seen any restaurant that serves a 1 egg breakfast especially for 400 0 
i tried talking real loud but shouting on the telephone gets old and i was still told it wasnt great 0 
nothing special 0 
this movie is bad 0 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
there is simply no excuse for something this poorly done 0 
the art style has the appearance of crayonpencil drawings and is wonderfully colorful and fanciful 1 
it was a good thing that the tickets only cost five dollars because i would be mad if id have paid 750 to see this crap 0 
i have bought this nokia cell phone a few weeks ago and it was a nightmare 0 
good servicecheck 1 
and finally after all that we get to an ending that wouldve been great had it been handled by competent people and not jerry falwell 0 
this may be the only bad film he ever made 0 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
this may be the only bad film he ever made 0 
i was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar not only because the quality is great but the service is fast and the food impeccable 1 
my order was not correct 0 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
the scenery that the two daughters paint and photograph are beautiful 1 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
for the price on amazon it is an excellent product which i would highly recommend 1 
enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film 1 
the directing and the cinematography arent quite as good 0 
cool phone 1 
ample portions and good prices 1 
if she had not rolled the eyes we may have stayed not sure if we will go back and try it again 0 
one of the most disappointing aspects is the lack of notable gore 0 
i will never forget it now 1 
its the best headset i have used 1 
the story unfolds in 18th century jutland and the use of period music played on period instruments is just one more fine touch 1 
the good cinematography also makes her and monica bellucci look very beautiful 1 
i could not stand to even watch it for very long for fear of losing iq 0 
the fries were not hot and neither was my burger 0 
dont waste your time here 0 
any ring toneoverall good phone to buy 1 
and the sound quality is great 1 
it lasts less than 3o minutes if i actually try to use the phonemy wife has the same phone with the same problem 0 
the sangria was about half of a glass wine full and was 12 ridiculous 0 
i really loved the story line and the poler bear was kinda cutebut if anyone has a question about fort steele just ask away 1 
the best phone in market 1 
it has a very good plot it holds your complete attention the acting is superb tom wilkinson was fantastic and emily watson was also very good 1 
i saw this movie and i thought this is a stupid movie 0 
you get incredibly fresh fish prepared with care 1 
its pure brilliance 1 
the battery is unreliable as well as the service use antena 0 
it was quite comfortable in the ear 1 
my breakfast was perpared great with a beautiful presentation of 3 giant slices of toast lightly dusted with powdered sugar 1 
excellent sound battery life and inconspicuous to boot 1 
bad purchase 0 
perhaps my phone is defective but people cannot hear me when i use this 0 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
sooooo good 1 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
worst customer service ever 0 
trying to make a call on these is an exercise in frustration 0 
i have to jiggle the plug to get it to line up right to get decent volume 0 
i rather enjoyed it 1 
secondly hitchcock pretty much perfected the thriller and chase movie 1 
love this phone 1 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
the sweet potato fries were very good and seasoned well 1 
worst hour and a half of my lifeoh my gosh 0 
10 out of 10 stars 1 
i immediately said i wanted to talk to the manager but i did not want to talk to the guy who was doing shots of fireball behind the bar 0 
dont waste your money and time 0 
do not waste your time 0 
treo and tmobile refused to replace it again and forced me to buy another phone without any kind of upgrade discount 0 
my sister has one also and she loves it 1 
this is cool because most cases are just open there allowing the screen to get all scratched up 1 
the concert sequences just sucked 0 
the movie showed a lot of florida at its best made it look very appealing 1 
i probably would not go here again 0 
food was really boring 0 
but even the talented carrell cant save this 0 
it looked like a wonderful story 1 
it probably would have been better if the director hadnt spent most of the movie showcasing his own art work which really isnt that noteworthy 0 
we had 7 at our table and the service was pretty fast 1 
each day of the week they have a different deal and its all so delicious 1 
the food is very good for your typical bar food 1 
still waiting im sure this item would work well if i ever recieve it 0 
and the sound quality is great 1 
i advise everyone do not be fooled 0 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
this movie now joins revenge of the boogeyman and zombiez as part of the hellish trinity of horror films 0 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
of all the dishes the salmon was the best but all were great 1 
disappointed with battery 0 
cumbersome design 0 
you wont be disappointed 1 
dessert panna cotta was amazing 1 
the server was very negligent of our needs and made us feel very unwelcome i would not suggest this place 0 
do not waste your time 0 
give this one a look 1 
the earpiece on this is too large or too heavyit keeps falling out of my ear 0 
another note about this phones appearance is that it really looks rather bland especially in the all black model 0 
the shrimp tender and moist 1 
the cast was great 1 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
ordered a double cheeseburger got a single patty that was falling apart picture uploaded yeah still sucks 0
