perabo has a nice energy level and is obviously very comfortable in front of a camera 1 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
very dissapointing performance 0 
this is a witty and delightful adaptation of the dr seuss book brilliantly animated by upas finest and thoroughly deserving of its academy award 1 
works great 1 
ray charles is legendary 1 
it will drive you barking mad 0 
i would not recommend this place 0 
as always the evening was wonderful and the food delicious 1 
i do think tom hanks is a good actor 1 
my boyfriend and i came here for the first time on a recent trip to vegas and could not have been more pleased with the quality of food and service 1 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
not good when wearing a hat or sunglasses 0 
it never condescends all the characters have good genuine hearts and believable problems 1 
mishima is extremely uninteresting 0 
my experience was terrible this was my fourth bluetooth headset and while it was much more comfortable than my last jabra which i hated 0 
hated it 0 
i seriously cannot believe that the owner has so many unexperienced employees that all are running around like chickens with their heads cut off 0 
so anyone near you will hear part of your conversation 0 
i really hope the team behind this movie makes more movies and that they will continue to do so in their own some kinda weird style 1 
the restaurant atmosphere was exquisite 1 
great phone 1 
the movie had you on the edge of your seat and made you somewhat afraid to go to your car at the end of the night 1 
it is a really good show to watch 1 
ryans bar is definitely one edinburgh establishment i wont be revisiting 0 
its not what it says it is 0 
see it 1 
im not sure how long we stood there but it was long enough for me to begin to feel awkwardly out of place 0 
better than new 1 
dont waste your money 0 
i will be back many times soon 1 
but it does get better reception and clarity than any phone ive had before 1 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
i really dont see how anyone could enjoy this movie 0 
they dropped more than the ball 0 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
a must study for anyone interested in the worst sins of industrial design 0 
does everything it should and more 1 
being a 90s child i truly enjoyed this show and i can proudly say that i enjoyed it big time and even more than the classical wb cartoons 1 
furthermore you cant even find hours of operation on the website 0 
great food and service huge portions and they give a military discount 1 
what a waste of time 0 
both of the egg rolls were fantastic 1 
we have gotten a lot of compliments on it 1 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
now imagine that every single one of those decisions was made wrong 0 
their onscreen chemistry critical to the entire film is genuine 1 
their chow mein is so good 1 
the lighting is awful 0 
it really is impressive that the place hasnt closed down 0 
howeverthe riingtones are not the best and neither are the games 0 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
this is simply the best bluetooth headset for sound quality 1 
problem is that the ear loops are made of weak material and break easily 0 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
krussel always good 1 
their monster chicken fried steak and eggs is my all time favorite 1 
very serious spoilers this movie was a huge disappointment 0 
the grilled chicken was so tender and yellow from the saffron seasoning 1 
freezes frequently4 0 
great phone 1 
i have purchased these for both family and friends and all enjoy their clarity and ease of use 1 
damn good steak 1 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
avoid at all cost 0 
you need two hands to operate the screenthis software interface is decade old and cannot compete with new software designs 0 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
the seasonal fruit was fresh white peach puree 1 
both do good jobs and are quite amusing 1 
it has been a winner for us 1 
hot dishes are not hot cold dishes are close to room tempi watched staff prepare food with bare hands no gloveseverything is deep fried in oil 0 
and the beans and rice were mediocre at best 0 
the price was very good and with the free shipping and all it was a good purchase 1 
generally it just lacked imagination 0 
they dropped more than the ball 0 
food is way overpriced and portions are fucking small 0 
the movie lacks visual interest drama expression of feeling and celebration of the very patriotism that underlines the narrative 0 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
one of the best mexican movies ever and one of the less understood even by mexican themselves no matter how identified the should have felt with it 1 
they do not last forever but is not overly expensive to replaceeasy to operate and the sound is much better than others i have tried 1 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
and if that isnt enough of a mess of a movie for you the picture is also marred with a constant use of studio sets and indoor exteriors 0 
light weight i hardly notice it is there 1 
i dont have very many words to say about this place but it does everything pretty well 1 
great for ipods too 1 
you can even take self portraits with the outside exterior display very cool 1 
omg i felt like i had never eaten thai food until this dish 1 
nice blanket of moz over top but i feel like this was done to cover up the subpar food 1 
service is quick and friendly 1 
i am a fan of his this movie sucked really bad 0 
i love this cable it allows me to connect any miniusb device to my pc 1 
it sure does beat the nachos at the movies but i would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant 0 
it came free with a dvd player i bought but i still turned the thing off halfway through because i was embarrassed for howell 0 
the story is lame not interesting and never really explains the sinister origins of the puppets 0 
great product 1 
none of the three sizes they sent with the headset would stay in my ears 0 
he was extremely rude and really there are so many other restaurants i would love to dine at during a weekend in vegas 0 
for 40 bucks a head i really expect better food 0 
it was way over fried 0 
as for the service im a fan because its quick and youre being served by some nice folks 1 
my friend did not like his bloody mary 0 
a good film by a great director 1 
appetite instantly gone 0 
price is good too 1 
a very good film indeed about great and unconditional love 1 
i like the fact that it rests lightly against your ear rather than inside 1 
i dont think i will be back for a very long time 0 
avoid at all costs 0 
all in all id expected a better consumer experience from motorola 0 
great brunch spot 1 
his performance is simply genius 1 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
having to humour him just to get by and get through the day was so apt 1 
interesting decor 1 
really good product 1 
they have a really nice atmosphere 1 
maybe its just their vegetarian fare but ive been twice and i thought it was average at best 0 
i seriously cannot believe that the owner has so many unexperienced employees that all are running around like chickens with their heads cut off 0 
which is precisely why i am giving it such a bad review 0 
but even the talented carrell cant save this 0 
my brother in law who works at the mall ate here same day and guess what he was sick all night too 0 
im super pissd 0 
great software for motorolas 1 
her lines seem to have been written by a fifteen year old though they are trying oh so so hard to sound like how a fifteen year old would really um you know well talk 0 
waitress was a little slow in service 0 
from what my dinner companions told meeverything was very fresh with nice texture and taste 1 
this place is not worth your time let alone vegas 0 
the selection of food was not the best 0 
the plantains were the worst ive ever tasted 0 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
their steaks are 100 recommended 1 
in particular the relationship between the bakery assistant and the waitress just didnt work for me at all 0 
yeah the movie pretty much sucked 0 
the least said about the acting the better 0 
ordered an appetizer and took 40 minutes and then the pizza another 10 minutes 0 
top line dont waste your time and money on this one its as bad as it comes 0 
the only thing i did like was the prime rib and dessert section 1 
we definately enjoyed ourselves 1 
it really created a unique feeling though 1 
if it were possible to give them zero stars theyd have it 0 
editing the editing of this film was phenomenal in my opinion 1 
these are fabulous 1 
the ngage is still lacking in earbuds 0 
i am sorry i made this purchase 0 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
i only hear garbage for audio 0 
i will come back here every time im in vegas 1 
the soundtrack sucked 0 
enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film 1 
it is so small and you dont even realize that it is there after a while of getting used to it 1 
go rent it 1 
battery is terrible 0 
the best phone in market 1 
kris kristoffersen is good in this movie and really makes a difference 1 
there was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth but it didnt really work into the rest of the plot 0 
setup went very smoothly 1 
plug was the wrong size 0 
not what i wanted 0 
well just if you keep thinking how bad it is 0 
after the first charge kept going dead after 12 minutes 0 
the crêpe was delicate and thin and moist 1 
for a self proclaimed coffee cafe i was wildly disappointed 0 
the acting is like watching wooden puppets moving around and reading from a book thats how bad it is 0 
i hate writing bad reviews about films especially those in which i really like the star but this film is so bad i dont believe for one second that anyone could have been proud of it 0 
everything about it is just bad 0 
bad reception 0 
the memories are murky but i can only say that i enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show 1 
this was like the final blow 0 
the battery works great 1 
a must study for anyone interested in the worst sins of industrial design 0 
portable and it works 1 
voice recognition is tremendous 1 
first the bathrooms at this location were dirty seat covers were not replenished just plain yucky 0 
performed awful muffled tinny incoming sound and severe echo for those on the other end of the call 0 
only like 3 or 4 buildings used a couple of locations maybe poor hummh 0 
my only problem is i thought the actor playing the villain was a low rent michael ironside 0 
buyerbe very careful 0 
i give wirefly 1 stari will contact cingularatt and inform them of this practice 0 
great place to relax and have an awesome burger and beer 1 
this is definitely one of the better documentaries i have seen looking at family relationships and marriage 1 
linksys should have some way to exchange a bad phone for a refurb unit or something 0 
the shower area is outside so you can only rinse not take a full shower unless you dont mind being nude for everyone to see 0 
the attempts at humor were pitiful and story is so awful it dosent bear thinking about which basically involves a vulcan stealing the enterprise to find god seriously i just didnt care about any of this film and oh not to mention uhura does a belly dance to distract male guards 0 
it showed exactly how the government and the scientist argued for humanity and the reasons of the gadget 1 
absolutel junk 0 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
it was clear that she had the range and ability to pull off this part 1 
the telephone repair man was really funny and his reactions to the nuts and bitchy boss were truly genuine 1 
it was attached to a gas station and that is rarely a good sign 0 
my phone doesnt slide around my car now and the grip prevents my phone from slipping out of my hand 1 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach 0 
bought mainly for the charger which broke soon after purchasing 0 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
i dont think ill be running back to carlys anytime soon for food 0 
all in all id expected a better consumer experience from motorola 0 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
muddy low quality sound and the casing around the wires insert was poorly super glued and slid off 0 
another note about this phones appearance is that it really looks rather bland especially in the all black model 0 
kris kristoffersen is good in this movie and really makes a difference 1 
theres barely a boring moment in the film and there are plenty of humorous parts 1 
great pork sandwich 1 
after arguing with verizon regarding the dropped calls we returned the phones after two days 0 
if she had not rolled the eyes we may have stayed not sure if we will go back and try it again 0 
but even the talented carrell cant save this 0 
this film offers many delights and surprises 1 
it is an insane game 1 
at no point in the proceedings does it look remotely like america 0 
this was such an awesome movie that i bought it off of ebay 1 
as for the service im a fan because its quick and youre being served by some nice folks 1 
worse theres an incredibly weak subplot thrown in that follows a little band of latterday mansonites as they go after a reporter whos working on a story on the anniversary of the killings 0 
you have to hold the phone at a particular angle for the other party to hear you clearly 0 
overall i would recommend this phone over the new walkman 1 
the inside is really quite nice and very clean 1 
best of all is the rotating feature very helpful 1 
the stories were powerful explorations of the nature of man and of art 1 
they refuse to refund or replace 0 
the sound quality for the device is unacceptableunless you are in a really quiet area you almost hear nothing 0 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
there was so much hype over this phone that i assumed it was the best my mistake 0 
incredible 1 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
unfortunately it did not work 0 
the han nan chicken was also very tasty 1 
they could be used as exemplars for any set designer 1 
we wont be returning 0 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
i cannot believe that the actors agreed to do this film 0 
if you havent gone here go now 1 
performed awful muffled tinny incoming sound and severe echo for those on the other end of the call 0 
i dont think ive ever gone to a movie and disliked it as much 0 
cute quaint simple honest 1 
the volume switch rocketed out of the unit to a destination unknown 0 
comfortable in my hand 1 
rude inconsiderate management 0 
as i said abovepretty useless 0 
last time buying from you 0 
thanks good a movie like this was done and released 1 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
similarly the delivery man did not say a word of apology when our food was 45 minutes late 0 
the battery works great 1 
the best phone in market 1 
the real disappointment was our waiter 0 
i wasnt really impressed with strip steak 0 
her lines seem to have been written by a fifteen year old though they are trying oh so so hard to sound like how a fifteen year old would really um you know well talk 0 
item arrived quickly and works great with my metro pcs samsung schr450 slider phone and sony premium sound in ear plugs 1 
i love the scream movies and all horror movies and this one ranks way up there 1 
being a 90s child i truly enjoyed this show and i can proudly say that i enjoyed it big time and even more than the classical wb cartoons 1 
disappointed 0 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
worst thai ever 0 
the shower area is outside so you can only rinse not take a full shower unless you dont mind being nude for everyone to see 0 
they have a really nice atmosphere 1 
excellent sound quality 1 
i recommend igo to anyone with different brand cell phonesmp3 players in the family 1 
service was fantastic 1 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
pretty awesome place 1 
the cg opening sequence in space looked like it could have been created on microsoft slideshow for gods sake 0 
special thanks to dylan t for the recommendation on what to order all yummy for my tummy 1 
which is precisely why i am giving it such a bad review 0 
this place receives stars for their appetizers 1 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
great phone 1 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
it was a huge awkward 15lb piece of cow that was 34ths gristle and fat 0 
must have been an off night at this place 0 
the fries were not hot and neither was my burger 0 
dont waste your money 0 
oh this is such a thing of beauty this restaurant 1 
everything about it is fine and reasonable for the price ie 1 
but it does get better reception and clarity than any phone ive had before 1 
nice spicy and tender 1 
the soundtrack sucked 0 
and i just love the colors 1 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
this is simply the best bluetooth headset for sound quality 1 
it did not work in my cell phone plug i am very up set with the charger 0 
definitely a turn off for me i doubt ill be back unless someone else is buying 0 
my salad had a bland vinegrette on the baby greens and hearts of palm 0 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
it was forced like everything in this movie 0 
your brain will attempt to shutdown as part of a primal impulse of selfpreservation 0 
the tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu 0 
nothing at all to recommend 0 
because both ears are occupied background is not distracting at all 1 
oh this is such a thing of beauty this restaurant 1 
on a positive note our server was very attentive and provided great service 1 
bad purchase 0 
unfortunately it will not recharge my iphone 4s despite connecting it from multiple power sources imac external battery wall outlet etc 0 
the story is beyond stupid 0 
it also took her forever to bring us the check when we asked for it 0 
worst phone ever 0 
go to place for gyros 1 
i will come back here every time im in vegas 1 
the writer gorman bechard undoubtedly did his homework because all references are industry and characterage appropriate 1 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
battery is terrible 0 
the casting is also horrible cause all you see is a really really bad actors period 0 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
rude inconsiderate management 0 
love it great armband 1 
i dont each much pasta but i love the homemade hand made pastas and thin pizzas here 1 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
honeslty it didnt taste that fresh 0 
useless phone simply deaf 0 
never again will i be dining at this place 0 
well packaged arrived on time and works as intended 1 
plug was the wrong size 0 
ive owned this phone for 7 months now and can say that its the best mobile phone ive had 1 
i love this place 1 
this scene is very strong and unpleasant 0 
and finally after all that we get to an ending that wouldve been great had it been handled by competent people and not jerry falwell 0 
a very good film indeed about great and unconditional love 1 
the worst phone ive ever had only had it for a few months 0 
not easy to watch 0 
waiter was a jerk 0 
exactly what i wanted 1 
i kept looking at the time and it had soon become 35 minutes yet still no food 0 
easy to pair with my samsung cell 1 
great food 1 
cumbersome design 0 
too bad cause i know its family owned i really wanted to like this place 0 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
i really recommend this faceplates since it looks very nice elegant and cool 1 
top line dont waste your time and money on this one its as bad as it comes 0 
by this time our side of the restaurant was almost empty so there was no excuse 0 
their onscreen chemistry critical to the entire film is genuine 1 
its hard not to fall headoverheels in love with that girl 1 
yet i enjoy watching it 1 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
nice case feels good in your hands 1 
on the ground right next to our table was a large smeared beensteppedinandtrackedeverywhere pile of green bird poop 0 
this is a great restaurant at the mandalay bay 1 
he owns the film just as spacek owned coal miners daughter and quaid owned great balls of fire 1 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
service is quick and even to go orders are just like we like it 1 
and it was way to expensive 0 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
im in az all the time and now have my new spot 1 
john garfield ann revere lilli plmer william conrad canada leeand filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screenjames wong howe 1 
everything captain howdy says is either laughable or just plain stupid 0 
only like 3 or 4 buildings used a couple of locations maybe poor hummh 0 
it has kept up very well 1 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
so bad 0 
my sanyo has survived dozens of drops on blacktop without ill effect 1 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
whatever prompted such a documentary is beyond me 0 
the cashew cream sauce was bland and the vegetables were undercooked 0 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
a good commentary of todays love and undoubtedly a film worth seeing 1 
what did bother me was the slow service 0 
the poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying 0 
i had to wait over 30 minutes to get my drink and longer to get 2 arepas 0 
disappointed 0 
it was either too cold not enough flavor or just bad 0 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
this place is great 1 
this place is amazing 1 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
my experience was terrible this was my fourth bluetooth headset and while it was much more comfortable than my last jabra which i hated 0 
i have eaten here multiple times and each time the food was delicious 1 
spend your money and time some place else 0 
i believe that pitch black was done well 1 
waitress was sweet and funny 1 
left very frustrated 0 
a very good film indeed about great and unconditional love 1 
improper description i had to return it 0 
again lame 0 
you wont forget this movie 1 
it really is impressive that the place hasnt closed down 0 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
dont waste your time here 0 
not tasty and the texture was just nasty 0 
the chefs were friendly and did a good job 1 
earbud piece breaks easily 0 
comfort for our whole family 1 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
good case excellent value 1 
2 times very bad customer service 0 
i saw it as a child on tv back in 1973 when it was the stranger and i loved it 1 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
i rate this movie 910 1 
this place has it 1 
this was utterly confusing at first which caused me to lose a couple of very very important contacts 0 
i would definitely recommend the jabra bt250v for those who are looking for comfort clarity and a great price 1 
you share general loewenhielms exquisite joy in his partaking of the cailles en sarcophage even though you are just watching a movie but you do wish for just a small sample to savor 1 
after my phone got to be about a year old its been slowly breaking despite much care on my part 0 
i bought two of them and neither will charge 0 
kind of hard to mess up a steak but they did 0 
couldnt figure it out 0 
if you look for authentic thai food go else where 0 
id like to return it 0 
there was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters 0 
problem is that the ear loops are made of weak material and break easily 0 
lifetime does not air it enough so if anyone knows what store sells it let me know because this is a musthave 1 
the food was terrible 0 
all the characters in this film are tremendously well played 1 
poor quality 0 
there is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again 0 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
i will continue to come here on ladies night andddd date night highly recommend this place to anyone who is in the area 1 
anne heche was utterly convincing 1 
i think it was robert ryans best film because he portrayed someone like my father and he was a schizophrenic in real lifemy father although he never murdered anyone but was affected more so during the second world war which made him worse 1 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
i love this phone it is very handy and has a lot of features 1 
a good time 1 
overall i like there food and the service 1 
her lines seem to have been written by a fifteen year old though they are trying oh so so hard to sound like how a fifteen year old would really um you know well talk 0 
friends pasta also bad he barely touched it 0 
not too screamy not to masculine but just right 1 
the football scenes at the end were perplexing 0 
if this premise sound stupid thats because it is 0 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
great price too 1 
much better than the other ayce sushi place i went to in vegas 1 
if there were zero stars i would give it zero stars 0 
i give wirefly 1 stari will contact cingularatt and inform them of this practice 0 
this movie is a good and humorous comment on life in 2006 1 
the result is a powerhouse achievement made more timely now perhaps because of our cultures disturbing fascination with celebrity and its distorted interpretations of fame 1 
also the phone doesnt seem to accept anything except cbr mp3s preferably ripped by windows media player 0 
well never go again 0 
the attention given to every character and complex psychological portrayals detailing loyalty treachery love and hope are tremendous 1 
their chow mein is so good 1 
but the duet between the astronaut and his doctor at the beginning of the movie is a perfect exchange if one considers that this movie was made well into the cold war and the astronauts biggest fear is that he has crashed in the ussr 1 
it crackles with an unpredictable youthful energy but honestly i found it hard to follow and concentrate on it meanders so badly 0 
also if your phone is dropped this case is not going to save it specially when dropped face down 0 
great steak great sides great wine amazing desserts 1 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
mobile phone tools are a must have 1 
avoid at all cost 0 
this is an excellent tool especially when paired with your phones autoanswer 1 
this is essentially a communications tool that does not communicate 0 
the food wasnt good 0 
we ordered the duck rare and it was pink and tender on the inside with a nice char on the outside 1 
this place is amazing 1 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
appears to actually outperform the original battery from china that came with my v325i 1 
its like a really sexy party in your mouth where youre outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party 1 
having to humour him just to get by and get through the day was so apt 1 
the art style has the appearance of crayonpencil drawings and is wonderfully colorful and fanciful 1 
the movie lacks visual interest drama expression of feeling and celebration of the very patriotism that underlines the narrative 0 
the burrittos blah 0 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
this is essentially a communications tool that does not communicate 0 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
this second appearance of mickey mouse following the silent plane crazy earlier that year is probably his most famous filmmostly because it was so groundbreaking 1 
the selection on the menu was great and so were the prices 1 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
never been to hard rock casino before will never ever step forward in it again 0 
the fish is badly made and some of its underwater shots are repeated a thousand times in the film 0 
his performance is simply genius 1 
people who like european films and art movies will like this movie 1 
extremely tasty 1 
lots of holes in the script 0 
everything was gross 0 
these are the nicest restaurant owners ive ever come across 1 
totally different with loads of understatement and black comedy this is a film few get to see but those who do will remember it 1 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
phenomenal food service and ambiance 1 
i can say that the desserts were yummy 1 
food was so gooodd 1 
perabo has a nice energy level and is obviously very comfortable in front of a camera 1 
if the food isnt bad enough for you then enjoy dealing with the worlds worstannoying drunk people 0 
for a product that costs as much as this one does i expect it to work far better and with greater ease than this thing does 0 
is pretty funny 1 
the story is lame not interesting and never really explains the sinister origins of the puppets 0 
i wont be back 0
