avoid avoid avoid 0 
well just if you keep thinking how bad it is 0 
will be back again 1 
dont make the same mistake i did 0 
yes its that bad 0 
tom wilkinson broke my heart at the end and everyone elses judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike 1 
horrible had to switch 3 times 0 
you also cannot take pictures with it in the case because the lense is covered 0 
doesnt work 0 
great steak great sides great wine amazing desserts 1 
someone shouldve invented this sooner 1 
garbo who showed right off the bat that her talents could carry over from the silent era i wanted to see some of her silent work but netflix doesnt seem to be stocking them 1 
with the originality and freshness of the first movie now spent this remake had little else to offer 0 
my 810 score is mostly for the plot 1 
the steak was amazingrge fillet relleno was the best seafood plate i have ever had 1 
im super pissd 0 
this is one of the best movies out there that shows such strong sibling bond for each other 1 
i ordered the lemon raspberry ice cocktail which was also incredible 1 
damian is so talented and versatile in so many ways of writing and portraying different characters on screen 1 
works well 1 
the plot simply rumbles on like a machine desperately depending on the addition of new scenes 0 
also its slim enough to fit into my alarm clock docking station without removing the case 1 
i gave it a 10 1 
that was done in the second movie 0 
i guess i liked the details of his dysfunctionhe was believable 1 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
for that price i can think of a few place i would have much rather gone 0 
i hate movies like that 0 
but if you liked movies like the matrix and better yet their sequels i think youll appreciate the thought provoking mindblowing experience this film will give you 1 
total brunch fail 0 
those phones are working just fine now 1 
and i just love the colors 1 
i had a pretty satifying experience 1 
the story which was told so eloquently by francis ford coppola 25 years earlier really unfolds gradually and leaves room for the characters to develop 1 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
how can you call yourself a steakhouse if you cant properly cook a steak i dont understand 0 
mobile phone tools are a must have 1 
these were so good we ordered them twice 1 
come hungry leave happy and stuffed 1 
i rate this movie 910 1 
as i said abovepretty useless 0 
this is a good joint 1 
rude inconsiderate management 0 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
i was amazed at the quick arrival of the two original lg cell phone batteries and and at a fraction of the price 1 
it failed to convey the broad sweep of landscapes that were a great part of the original 0 
painful on the ear 0 
but when someone strives for greatness and poetry but delivers a muddled and often ridiculous story a bunch of disparate scenes pretentious dialogue then you get the worst kind of a movie that some other reviewer very accurately defined as pretentious crap 0 
service is perfect and the family atmosphere is nice to see 1 
personally i think it shows that people should learn to find a compromise them self without involving other people into issue 1 
but its just not funny 0 
however the keypads are so tinny that i sometimes reach the wrong buttons 0 
to summarize the food was incredible nay transcendant but nothing brings me joy quite like the memory of the pneumatic condiment dispenser 1 
im returning them 0 
they were excellent 1 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
this movie is excellentangel is beautiful and scamp is adorablehis little yelps when hes scaredand the funniest parts are whenscamp is caught under the curtain and when angel and scamp are singing ive never had this feeling beforei totally recommend this movieits coming out on special edition on june 20the cover has scamp on a garbage can and angel underneath the lid 1 
so flavorful and has just the perfect amount of heat 1 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
it didnt work people can not hear me when i talk 0 
great for ipods too 1 
initially the local sites in the film which was filmed here in buffalo intrigued me 1 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
we wont be going back anytime soon 0 
they know how to make them here 1 
the best place in vegas for breakfast just check out a sat or sun 1 
this review is long overdue since i consider a tale of two sisters to be the single greatest film ever made 1 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
but it is great i would really recommend it 1 
the acting as youd expect from this cast is top notch 1 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
it seems completely secure both holding on to my belt and keeping the iphone inside 1 
the writers were smack on and i think the best actors and actresses were a bonus to the showthese characters were so real 1 
the best example of how dumb the writing is when its established that you can turn the zombiestudents back into humans by removing a necklace containing a piece of the meteorite 0 
i received my headset in good time and was happy with it 1 
i will never go back to this place and will never ever recommended this place to anyone 0 
i would recommend saving room for this 1 
by this time our side of the restaurant was almost empty so there was no excuse 0 
this fixes all the problems 1 
the film deserves strong kudos for taking this stand for having exceptional acting from its mostly lesserknown cast and for the superintelligent script that doesnt insult the audience or take the easy way out when it comes to white racism 1 
trying to make a call on these is an exercise in frustration 0 
i was not happy with this item 0 
its like a bad two hour tv movie 0 
interesting decor 1 
the only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive 1 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
the owners really really need to quit being soooooo cheap let them wrap my freaking sandwich in two papers not one 0 
do not waste your money here 0 
you get what you pay for i guess 0 
nobody identifies with these characters because theyre all cardboard cutouts and stereotypes or predictably reversestereotypes 0 
on three different occasions i asked for well done or medium well and all three times i got the bloodiest piece of meat on my plate 0 
the descriptions said yum yum sauce and another said eel sauce yet another said spicy mayowell none of the rolls had sauces on them 0 
if there were zero stars i would give it zero stars 0 
things happen characters personalities change plot twists occur for no real reason other than that script calls for it 0 
the best electronics of the available fm transmitters 1 
heres where the movie really pied me off 0 
i love my 350 headset my jabra350 bluetooth headset is great the reception is very good and the ear piece is a comfortable fit 1 
waste your money on this game 1 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
this is an extraordinary film 1 
it showed exactly how the government and the scientist argued for humanity and the reasons of the gadget 1 
the food was terrible 0 
i loved their mussels cooked in this wine reduction the duck was tender and their potato dishes were delicious 1 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clich√©s to be admitted elsewhere 0 
who in their right mind is gonna buy this battery 0 
none of the new ones have ever quite worked properly 0 
the cast is always entertaining as usual 1 
we would recommend these to others 1 
i would highly recommend this 1 
always a great time at dos gringos 1 
basically the service was very bad 0 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
paolo sorrentino has written a wonderful story about loneliness and tony has built one of the most unforgettable characters seen in movies in recent years 1 
ordered burger rare came in well done 0 
even worse than ticker 0 
this is essentially a communications tool that does not communicate 0 
the use of slowmotion needlessly repeats itself throughout the movie but is well backed up by bad acting and bad is a kind word here no continuity scenes that are thrown in for no reason whatsoever vehicles that looked like they were made from a corn flakes box and a directorial style that bordered on stupidity 0 
her role was played well 1 
reversible plug works great 1 
this place is great 1 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
both films are terrible but to the credit of the 1986 version it was watchable 0 
my only complaint is the standard sound volume is a little low even when turned up to 5of 5 0 
it is well made easy to access the phone and has a handy detachable belt clip 1 
too politically correct 0 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
what a waste 0 
works for me 1 
bland and flavorless is a good way of describing the barely tepid meat 0 
great pork sandwich 1 
and i really did find them funny 1 
the pizza selections are good 1 
the service was great even the manager came and helped with our table 1 
about half way through this film i started to dislike it 0 
not what i wanted 0 
i couldnt think of a better way to end the film but a smile on my face great way to wrap up an amazing film and trilogy 1 
not easy to watch 0 
if you have several dozen or several hundred contacts then imagine the fun of sending each of them one by one 0 
the service was terrible food was mediocre 0 
i had heard good things about this place but it exceeding every hope i could have dreamed of 1 
wow what a bad film 0 
1010 1 
always a great time at dos gringos 1 
i own a jabra earset and was very happy with it but the sound quality especially outgoing on this is better 1 
the point is the journey a journey that touches every member of the family 1 
the script is a big flawed mess 0 
this is not moviemaking 0 
one more thing i can tolerate political incorrectness very well im all for artistic freedom and suspension of disbelief but the slavic female character was just too much 0 
eew this location needs a complete overhaul 0 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
waste your money on this game 1 
i was bored throughout the whole damn thing 0 
the restaurant is very clean and has a family restaurant feel to it 1 
very comfortable 1 
we wont be returning 0 
it just blew 0 
all in all ha long bay was a bit of a flop 0 
i saw this movie and i thought this is a stupid movie 0 
how awful she is 0 
the text messaging feature is really tricky to use 0 
this movie does an excellent job of revealing the complexity of the task and the incredible challenges facing south africa 1 
awesome service and food 1 
do not purchase this phone 0 
summary the witticisms werent witty 0 
sounds good reasonably priced and effective its that simple 1 
it came free with a dvd player i bought but i still turned the thing off halfway through because i was embarrassed for howell 0 
it was that year however that reminded us that huston was still at the top of his game as evinced by his faithful adaptation of james joyces acclaimed novella the dead 1 
service is quick and friendly 1 
very cheap plastic creaks like an old wooden floor 0 
kris kristoffersen is good in this movie and really makes a difference 1 
i as well wouldve given godfathers zero stars if possible 0 
some applause should be given to the prelude however 1 
this is not moviemaking 0 
comfort for our whole family 1 
voice quality signal strength dropped calls 0 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurv√•g being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
i saw mirrormask last night and it was an unsatisfactory experience 0 
save your money ive had this item for 11 months now 0 
this was a poor remake of my best friends wedding 0 
the acting is like watching wooden puppets moving around and reading from a book thats how bad it is 0 
fans of the genre will be in heaven 1 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
end of days is one of the worst bigbudget action movies ive ever seen 0 
my friend did not like his bloody mary 0 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
the cinematographyif it can be called thatsucked 0 
never heard of any of them except cole who was totally unbelievable in the part 0 
its really easy 1 
excellent hands free tool 1 
bluetooth range is good a few days ago i left my phone in the trunk got a call and carried the conversation without a hitch 1 
any ring toneoverall good phone to buy 1 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
the dining space is tiny but elegantly decorated and comfortable 1 
horrible had to switch 3 times 0 
im not sure how long we stood there but it was long enough for me to begin to feel awkwardly out of place 0 
go and see it 1 
its not hard to make a decent hamburger 0 
linksys should have some way to exchange a bad phone for a refurb unit or something 0 
i own a jabra earset and was very happy with it but the sound quality especially outgoing on this is better 1 
this is one of the best movies out there that shows such strong sibling bond for each other 1 
the earpiece on this is too large or too heavyit keeps falling out of my ear 0 
nothing at all to recommend 0 
very poor service 0 
i want my money back 0 
good transmit audio 1 
overall i rate this movie a 10 out of a 110 scale 1 
good transmit audio 1 
basically the service was very bad 0 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
when a song could explain the emotions of the subjects better such as when jay adams unfortunate life was a subject of talk the song old man by neil young was played which evokes many emotions 1 
tonight i had the elk filet specialand it sucked 0 
it is easy to turn on and off when you are in the car and the volume controls are quite accessable 1 
jabra ear gels r the best 1 
she carries the movie well 1 
meredith m was better than all right 1 
its so bad its actually worth seeing just for that reason 0 
so i bought about 10 of these and saved alot of money 1 
yes i am simplifying things here for the sake of brevity for this really is at the core of the problems with this film it has too much going on without any real fulfilling explanation 0 
best breakfast buffet 1 
but the actingeven that of such professionals as drago and debbie rochonwas terrible the directing worse perhaps contributory to the former the dialog chimplike and the camera work barely tolerable 0 
the tracfonewebsite is user friendly and makes it easy toactivate etc 1 
i love my 350 headset my jabra350 bluetooth headset is great the reception is very good and the ear piece is a comfortable fit 1 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
cant store anything but phone numbers to sim 0 
i do love sushi but i found kabuki to be overpriced overhip and underservices 0 
no shifting no bubbling no peeling not even a scratch nothingi couldnt be more happier with my new one for the droid 1 
this is high adventure at its best 1 
the best place in vegas for breakfast just check out a sat or sun 1 
the food was very good 1 
painful on the ear 0 
i seriously cannot believe that the owner has so many unexperienced employees that all are running around like chickens with their heads cut off 0 
this item is fantastic and works perfectly 1 
terrible management 0 
poor sound quality 0 
all in all an excellent restaurant highlighted by great service a unique menu and a beautiful setting 1 
i love their fries and their beans 1 
this place has it 1 
there is a lot of beautiful places 1 
i cant use this case because the smell is disgusting 0 
i like the fact that it rests lightly against your ear rather than inside 1 
i really liked that 1 
thanks again to amazon for having the things i need for a good price 1 
first time going but i think i will quickly become a regular 1 
awful service 0 
after a year the battery went completely dead on my headset 0 
i could care less the interior is just beautiful 1 
i was not impressed by this product 0 
so far so good 1 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clich√©s to be admitted elsewhere 0 
it defeats the purpose of a bluetooth headset 0 
yet plantronincs continues to use the same flawed charger design 0 
we wont be going back anytime soon 0 
does everything it should and more 1 
thanks again to amazon for having the things i need for a good price 1 
10 out of 10 for both the movie and trilogy 1 
you can even take self portraits with the outside exterior display very cool 1 
not a good bargain 0 
but when someone strives for greatness and poetry but delivers a muddled and often ridiculous story a bunch of disparate scenes pretentious dialogue then you get the worst kind of a movie that some other reviewer very accurately defined as pretentious crap 0 
very displeased 0 
paolo sorrentino has written a wonderful story about loneliness and tony has built one of the most unforgettable characters seen in movies in recent years 1 
works like a charm it work the same as the one i got with the phone 1 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
it has all the features i want 1 
love this headset 1 
2 thumbs up to this seller 1 
not good by any stretch of the imagination 0 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
it defeats the purpose of a bluetooth headset 0 
i knew when i saw the film that more great things were to come from this gifted actor 1 
i cant wait to go back 1 
i did not bother contacting the company for few dollar product but i learned the lesson that i should not have bought this form online anyway 0 
i was not happy with this item 0 
the movie seemed a little slow at first 0 
very disappointing 0 
the han nan chicken was also very tasty 1 
woa talk about awful 0 
in addition to having one of the most lovely songs ever written french cancan also boasts one of the cutest leading ladies ever to grace the screen 1 
this is truly an art movieit actually has a lot of art in it 1 
all in all i give this one a resounding 9 out of 10 1 
the incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film 1 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
hence the whole story lacks a certain energy 0 
howeverthe riingtones are not the best and neither are the games 0 
the plot is nonsense that doesnt interest in the slightest way or have any uniqueness to it 0 
all i can do is whine on the internet so here it goesthe more i use the thing the less i like it 0 
its extremely slow and takes forever to do anything with it 0 
i was sitting in my vehicle with the cradle on my belt and the headset lost signal 0 
the whole experience was underwhelming and i think well just go to ninja sushi next time 0 
yes i am simplifying things here for the sake of brevity for this really is at the core of the problems with this film it has too much going on without any real fulfilling explanation 0 
your servers suck wait correction our server heimer sucked 0 
john wayne did an incredible job for being so young in the movie industry 1 
i did not bother contacting the company for few dollar product but i learned the lesson that i should not have bought this form online anyway 0 
you cant beat that 1 
see both films if you can 1 
i would recommend saving room for this 1 
does not fit 0 
i want my money back 0 
10 out of 10 stars 1 
her role was played well 1 
the manager was the worst 0 
the steak and the shrimp are in my opinion the best entrees at gc 1 
will not be back 0 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
this was my first and only vegas buffet and it did not disappoint 1 
this is a great phone 1 
i vomited in the bathroom mid lunch 0 
this was like the final blow 0 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
i liked this movie way too much 1 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
i was very disappointed in the movie 0 
poor voice clarity 0 
the biggest complaint i have is the battery drains superfast 0 
i dont have to be an accountant to know im getting screwed 0 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
it shouldnt take 30 min for pancakes and eggs 0 
soyo technology sucks 0 
then our food came out disappointment ensued 0 
better than expected 1 
linksys should have some way to exchange a bad phone for a refurb unit or something 0 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
truly awful 0 
i was amazed at the quick arrival of the two original lg cell phone batteries and and at a fraction of the price 1 
all in all i think it was a good investment 1 
so i am here to warn youdo not rent this movie it is the dumbest thing you have never seen 0 
def coming back to bowl next time 1 
phone is sturdy as all nokia bar phones are 1 
the films dialogue is natural real to life 1 
these are the central themes of the film and they are handled ineptly stereotypically and with no depth of imagination 0 
we would recommend these to others 1 
these products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet 0 
four stars for the food the guy in the blue shirt for his great vibe still letting us in to eat 1 
i was sitting in my vehicle with the cradle on my belt and the headset lost signal 0 
each track commands sentiment actually contributing to the scenes and characters 1 
will not be back 0 
the movie is not completely perfect but titta di girolamo will stay with you for a long time after the vision of the movie 1 
this film tries to be a serious and sophisticated thrillerhorror flick and it fails miserably 0 
an extensive menu provides lots of options for breakfast 1 
crust is not good 0 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
i hate to disagree with my fellow yelpers but my husband and i were so disappointed with this place 0 
i dont know what the big deal is about this place but i wont be back yaall 0 
i wouldnt see this movie again for free 0 
the secondary plot line is incomprehensible and its relation to the primary plot line is mystifying 0 
both the hot sour the egg flower soups were absolutely 5 stars 1 
too bad cause i know its family owned i really wanted to like this place 0 
only pros large seating area nice bar area great simple drink menu the best brick oven pizza with homemade dough 1 
good transmit audio 1 
after arguing with verizon regarding the dropped calls we returned the phones after two days 0 
not even good for camp value 0 
the mic there is a joke and the volume is quite low 0 
i gave it 5 stars then and im giving it 5 stars now 1 
after the disappointing dinner we went elsewhere for dessert 0 
i will not return 0 
if only someone involved with it knew how to string together narrative 0 
for people who are first timers in film making i think they did an excellent job 1 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
couldnt figure it out 0 
im translating movies for a living and this is the first movie in my 5year working experience that i found offensive to my intelligence 0 
avoid at all cost 0 
ordered an appetizer and took 40 minutes and then the pizza another 10 minutes 0 
and if that isnt enough of a mess of a movie for you the picture is also marred with a constant use of studio sets and indoor exteriors 0 
at first i thought i was grtting a good deal at 744 until i plugged it into my phone v3c razr 0 
i literally vomited while watching this film 0 
i love this thing 1 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
it is very comfortable to wear as well which is probably the most important aspect about using a case 1 
nice headset priced right 1 
i knew when i saw the film that more great things were to come from this gifted actor 1 
the writers were smack on and i think the best actors and actresses were a bonus to the showthese characters were so real 1 
the meat was pretty dry i had the sliced brisket and pulled pork 0 
very good phone 1 
but i definitely would not eat here again 0 
bad quality 0 
the casting is also horrible cause all you see is a really really bad actors period 0 
just really good so far probably the best bt headset i have ever had 1 
it is shameful 0 
logitech bluetooth headset is a 10 1 
my phone doesnt slide around my car now and the grip prevents my phone from slipping out of my hand 1 
another thing i didnt really like is when a character got punched in the face a gallon of blood would spew forth soon after 0 
kids pizza is always a hit too with lots of great side dish options for the kiddos 1 
john garfield ann revere lilli plmer william conrad canada leeand filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screenjames wong howe 1 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
it wasnt busy either also the building was freezing cold 0 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
favorite place in town for shawarrrrrrma 1 
sound quality on both end is excellent i use headset to call my wife and ask my wife to use headset to call me 2 1 
i think i was one of the people who found this another one of roths pearls 1 
great brunch spot 1 
the film deserves strong kudos for taking this stand for having exceptional acting from its mostly lesserknown cast and for the superintelligent script that doesnt insult the audience or take the easy way out when it comes to white racism 1 
kieslowski never ceases to amaze me 1 
but in any case the best part is you can download these pictures to your laptop using ir or even send pictures from your laptop to the phone 1 
this movie has a cutting edge to it 1 
i had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get some relief 0 
i could eat their bruschetta all day it is devine 1 
it was so cool 1 
very bad experience 0 
but i dont like it 0 
its a gloriously fun fast paced and fairly accurate portrayal of the night of a raver 1 
putting the race card aside lets look at the major flaw in the film they destroy latifas character 0 
piece of junk 0 
wow very spicy but delicious 1 
go and see it 1 
it wasnt busy at all and now we know why 0 
mic doesnt work 0 
at first i thought i was grtting a good deal at 744 until i plugged it into my phone v3c razr 0 
in conclusion i will not bother with this movie because a volcano in los angeles is nothing but nonsense 0 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
the worst was the salmon sashimi 0 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
even in my bmw 3 series which is fairly quiet i have trouble hearing what the other person is saying 0 
even the squibs look awful 0 
i had heard good things about this place but it exceeding every hope i could have dreamed of 1 
i dont think it would hold it too securly on your belt 0 
great earpiece 1 
raw and sublimely moving 1 
the success of the film depends on the casting of sydney greenstreet as the alexander yardley character 1 
i would have casted her in that role after ready the script 1 
highly recommended for all ages although the younger set will probably not appreciate some of the more subtle references they will certainly appreciate one galley scene in particular 1 
i didnt want the clip going over the top of my ear causing discomfort 0 
the sides are delish mixed mushrooms yukon gold puree white corn beateous 1 
needless to say we will never be back here again 0 
these are the nicest restaurant owners ive ever come across 1 
it lasts less than 3o minutes if i actually try to use the phonemy wife has the same phone with the same problem 0 
food was great and so was the serivce 1 
i do love sushi but i found kabuki to be overpriced overhip and underservices 0 
i dont have very many words to say about this place but it does everything pretty well 1 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
nobody identifies with these characters because theyre all cardboard cutouts and stereotypes or predictably reversestereotypes 0 
i wont be back 0 
i didnt realize how wonderful the short really is until the last two scenes 1 
amazon sucks 0 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
dont bother go to the store 0 
i wont be back 0 
the sweet potato tots were good but the onion rings were perfection or as close as i have had 1 
it was that year however that reminded us that huston was still at the top of his game as evinced by his faithful adaptation of james joyces acclaimed novella the dead 1 
good protection and does not make phone too bulky 1 
i saw this film over christmas and what a great film it was 1 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
food was so gooodd 1 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
on the ground right next to our table was a large smeared beensteppedinandtrackedeverywhere pile of green bird poop 0 
a standout scene 1 
but whatever it was that cost them so much it didnt translate to quality thats for sure 0 
this is so embarassing and also my ears hurt if i try to push the ear plug into my ear 0 
the presentation of the food was awful 0 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
i especially love the long battery life 1 
i had a seriously solid breakfast here 1 
it was pretty gross 0 
the microphone also works well but according to people i have called it applifies everything 1 
the acting was decidely wooden though no worse than a period universal b movie 0 
it didnt charge for me 0 
but whatever it was that cost them so much it didnt translate to quality thats for sure 0 
it makes very strange ticking noises before it ends the call 0 
ive had better not only from dedicated boba tea spots but even from jenni pho 0 
i promise they wont disappoint 1 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
i enjoyed it 1 
sauce was tasteless 0 
our server was very nice and even though he looked a little overwhelmed with all of our needs he stayed professional and friendly until the end 1 
great food and awesome service 1 
i couldnt think of a better way to end the film but a smile on my face great way to wrap up an amazing film and trilogy 1 
i have read others reviews here but i havent had any problem with it 1 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
constantine gives everything the right intensity and seems to have a good understanding of the underlying psychological motivations 1 
i literally vomited while watching this film 0 
the cashew cream sauce was bland and the vegetables were undercooked 0 
mediocre food 0 
the design is very odd as the ear clip is not very comfortable at all 0 
the food was terrible 0 
the ambiance isnt much better 0 
10 out of 10 stars 1 
also the phone doesnt seem to accept anything except cbr mp3s preferably ripped by windows media player 0 
up there with the best of melville 1 
good product good seller 1 
mobile phone tools are a must have 1 
it is easy to turn on and off when you are in the car and the volume controls are quite accessable 1 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
in other words the content level of this film is enough to easily fill a dozen other films 1 
summary the witticisms werent witty 0 
this was like the final blow 0 
long whiny and pointless 0 
pricing is a bit of a concern at mellow mushroom 0 
how awful she is 0 
much less than the jawbone i was going to replace it with 1 
the price is reasonable and the service is great 1 
a piece of junk that broke after being on my phone for 2 days 0 
if she had not rolled the eyes we may have stayed not sure if we will go back and try it again 0 
this film highlights the fundamental flaws of the legal process that its not about discovering guilt or innocence but rather is about who presents better in court 1 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
my wife had the lobster bisque soup which was lukewarm 0 
i didnt know pulled pork could be soooo delicious 1 
ive bought 5 wired headphones that sound better than these 0 
that company is a joke 0 
the plastic breaks really easy on this clip 0 
although i very much liked the look and sound of this place the actual experience was a bit disappointing 0 
everything captain howdy says is either laughable or just plain stupid 0 
its a mediocre miserable hollow laughable and predictable piece of garbage 0 
horrible dont waste your time and money 0 
phone falls out easily 0 
there is nothing privileged about workingeating there 0 
my fella got the huevos rancheros and they didnt look too appealing 0 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
very disappointed 0 
now you know why i gave it a 10 1 
this is simply the best bluetooth headset for sound quality 1 
service was good and the company was better 1 
service was exceptional and food was a good as all the reviews 1 
excellent hands free tool 1 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
the films dialogue is natural real to life 1 
the characters are fleshed out surprisingly well particularly grimes and blake and all the actors deliver their sharply scripted lines with just the right amount of deadpan tongue in cheek to make the dialogue both hilarious and realistic 1 
dont make the same mistake i did 0 
almost all of the songs in cover girl are oldfashioned and not very tuneful 0 
the warm beer didnt help 0 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
couldnt use the unit with sunglasses not good in texas 0 
its just painful 0 
another note about this phones appearance is that it really looks rather bland especially in the all black model 0 
overall the film is interesting and thoughtprovoking 1 
incredible 1 
highly recommended 1 
unfortunately the ability to actually know you are receiving a call is a rather important feature and this phone is pitiful in that respect 0 
dont bother go to the store 0 
the price is reasonable and the service is great 1 
im surprised this is a good quality car charger and theres not much reviews about it 1 
the only downside is the service 0 
sucked most of the stuff does not work with my phone 0 
i left the theater with a lilt in my step joy in my heart and hope for the human race 1 
this is a great restaurant at the mandalay bay 1 
i bought this phone as a replacement for my startac and have regretted it since 0 
the design is very odd as the ear clip is not very comfortable at all 0 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
if you love authentic mexican food and want a whole bunch of interesting yet delicious meats to choose from you need to try this place 1 
i just cant explain this movie more than romanticcharminghilariousand adorablethe junkyard scenes are funnyall the junkyard dogs have something specialtoo funny i laughedkids will love itbuy it when it comes outit has new features 1 
bad day or not i have a very low tolerance for rude customer service people it is your job to be nice and polite wash dishes otherwise 0 
i thoroughly enjoyed it when christopher eccleston took control of the tardis and the continuation of the series 1 
cant upload ringtones from a third party 0 
the scenes with the ohsomature neighbourgirl are a misplace 0 
battery is holding up well 1 
the only consistent thread holding the series together were the amazing performances of leni parker and anita laselva as the two taelons in quiet idealogical conflict 0 
conclusion very filling meals 1 
not recommended 0 
these are fabulous 1 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
the bathrooms are clean and the place itself is well decorated 1 
helen baxendale is a very credible lady macbeth who can be very cheerfull at times and sometimes she just looks like a naughty girl but deadly in her taste for blood and evil 1 
i had a seriously solid breakfast here 1 
linksys should have some way to exchange a bad phone for a refurb unit or something 0 
every time he opened his mouth you expect to hear you see kids pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show 0 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
raw and sublimely moving 1 
and the beans and rice were mediocre at best 0 
but when someone strives for greatness and poetry but delivers a muddled and often ridiculous story a bunch of disparate scenes pretentious dialogue then you get the worst kind of a movie that some other reviewer very accurately defined as pretentious crap 0 
this scene is very strong and unpleasant 0 
black water is a thriller that manages to completely transcend its limitations its an indie flick by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience 1 
i understand that its supposed to be a cheap popcorn comedy but that doesnt mean that it has to completely insult our intelligence and have writing so incredibly hackneyed that it borders on offensive 0 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
we recently witnessed her poor quality of management towards other guests as well 0 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
not my thing 0 
all of the main players are mesmerising 1 
for readers who have already seen one of miyazakis films he is still in top form and made another worthwhile experience 1 
love it great armband 1 
improper description i had to return it 0 
pretty cool i would say 1 
totally believable 1 
not even good for camp value 0 
these are the nicest restaurant owners ive ever come across 1 
in addition to having one of the most lovely songs ever written french cancan also boasts one of the cutest leading ladies ever to grace the screen 1 
the food was outstanding and the prices were very reasonable 1 
it lasts less than 3o minutes if i actually try to use the phonemy wife has the same phone with the same problem 0 
the service was terrible food was mediocre 0 
i didnt want the clip going over the top of my ear causing discomfort 0 
not nearly as good looking as the amazon picture makes it look 0 
and there wasnt a single sour note struck actingwise either some surprisingly solid casting here 1 
this totally unfunny movie is so over the top and pathetic and unrealistic that throughout the whole 90 minutes of utter torture i probably looked at my watch about 70000 times 0 
if you simply want a small flip phone look elsewhere as the extra bells whistles are mediocre 0 
it was a great phone 1 
the fact is this film is a wonderful heartwarming tale about two people chasing their dreams 1 
i received my orders well within the shipping timeframe everything was in good working order and overall i am very excited to have this source 1 
it was so cool 1 
its quite simply the highest most superlative form of cinema imaginable 1 
and the accents are absolutely abysmal 0 
of course the acting is blah 0 
poor product 0 
we asked for the bill to leave without eating and they didnt bring that either 0 
i didnt realize how wonderful the short really is until the last two scenes 1 
the sergeant pepper beef sandwich with auju sauce is an excellent sandwich as well 1 
imdb ratings only go as low 1 for awful its time to get some negative numbers in there for cases such as these 0 
great phone 1 
then a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use 0 
not even good for camp value 0 
no ear loop needed its tiny and the sound is great 1 
i cannot make calls at certain places 0 
bought mainly for the charger which broke soon after purchasing 0 
the manager was the worst 0 
both the hot sour the egg flower soups were absolutely 5 stars 1 
the camera really likes her in this movie 1 
reception is terrible and full of static 0 
but the convoluted plot just didnt convince me and much of the film was watched with a weird questioning glance 0 
lot of holes in the plot theres nothing about how he became the emperor nothing about where he spend 20 years between his childhood and mature age 0 
for the price on amazon it is an excellent product which i would highly recommend 1 
worst customer service ever 0 
it was not good 0 
the ri style calamari was a joke 0 
in fact its hard to remember that the part of ray charles is being acted and not played by the man himself 1 
its a shame to see good actors like thomerson and james make a living in a mess like this 0 
unfortunately any virtue in this films production work was lost on a regrettable script 0 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
everyone is very attentive providing excellent customer service 1 
it is light has plenty of battery capacity and is very confortable to wear for somewhat extended periods of time 1 
the fish is badly made and some of its underwater shots are repeated a thousand times in the film 0 
the shipping time was also very quick 1 
i never come again 0 
there is really nothing for me at postinos hope your experience is better 0 
personally i think it shows that people should learn to find a compromise them self without involving other people into issue 1 
point your finger at any item on the menu order it and you wont be disappointed 1 
excellent cast story line performances 1 
i believe every one should see this movie as i think few people outside of south africa understand its past and what is being attempted in the truth and reconciliation process 1 
the ambiance isnt much better 0 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
the food is very good for your typical bar food 1 
seriously killer hot chai latte 1 
very poor service 0 
whatever prompted such a documentary is beyond me 0 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
ill even say it again ¬ñ this is torture 0 
setup couldnt have been simpler 1 
the nokia ca42 usb cable did not work with my phone 0 
poor voice clarity 0 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
but i dont like it 0 
with the originality and freshness of the first movie now spent this remake had little else to offer 0 
seriously killer hot chai latte 1 
however after seeing the short again after about 25 years i was amazed at how timeless the film actually is 1 
food quality has been horrible 0 
the food is about on par with dennys which is to say not good at all 0 
very good food great atmosphere1 1 
utter crap sound quality is terrible 0 
overall i rate this movie a 10 out of a 110 scale 1
