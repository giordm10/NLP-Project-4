because both ears are occupied background is not distracting at all 1 
50 down the drain 0 
an interesting premise and billy drago is always good as a dangerous nutbag side note id love to see drago stephen mchattie and lance hendrikson in a flick together talk about raging cheekbones 1 
waitress was a little slow in service 0 
it came free with a dvd player i bought but i still turned the thing off halfway through because i was embarrassed for howell 0 
but it wasnt anything at all just one big yawn 0 
this is probably one of the least effective and utterly unoriginal films i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
it was clear that she had the range and ability to pull off this part 1 
but kevin spacey is an excellent verbal tsunami as buddy ackerman Â– and totally believable because he is a great actor 1 
not good for the money 0 
im returning them 0 
i have had tmobile service for 2 or 3 years now and i am pretty happy with it 1 
perhaps my phone is defective but people cannot hear me when i use this 0 
the lead man is charismafree 0 
over rated 0 
the camera really likes her in this movie 1 
so i had to take the battery out of the phone put it all back together and then restart it 0 
best tacos in town by far 1 
the story unfolds in 18th century jutland and the use of period music played on period instruments is just one more fine touch 1 
it holds a charge for a long time is reasonably comfortable under longwearing conditions and the quality of sound is tremendous 1 
it is a true classic 1 
the greek dressing was very creamy and flavorful 1 
im terribly disappointed that this film would receive so many awards and accolades especially when there are far more deserving works of film out there 0 
everything is appalling 0 
adapter does not provide enough charging current 0 
nice blanket of moz over top but i feel like this was done to cover up the subpar food 1 
will not be back 0 
the mic there is a joke and the volume is quite low 0 
the only suspense i was feeling was the frustration at just how retarded the girls were 0 
i had to go to a store and bought a new nokia phone which is working great 1 
ill give this film 10 out of 10 1 
so far so good 1 
i could barely stomach the meal but didnt complain because it was a business lunch 0 
we were promptly greeted and seated 1 
i was seated immediately 1 
everything about this movie is stupid 0 
plug was the wrong size 0 
the show would begin with smart ass ed comments to each other that would be totally off the wall and uncalled for 0 
beware this is not a trashy cult movie this is trash period 0 
you get incredibly fresh fish prepared with care 1 
its not what it says it is 0 
comfort for our whole family 1 
this place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver 0 
food was great and so was the serivce 1 
would not reccommend 0 
yet plantronincs continues to use the same flawed charger design 0 
this greedy corporation will never see another dime from me 0 
service was good and the company was better 1 
check it out 1 
it has a great camera thats 2mp and the pics are nice and clear with great picture quality 1 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
brilliant 1 
i wasted my little money with this earpiece 0 
i wont say any more i dont like spoilers so i dont want to be one but i believe this film is worth your time 1 
i came over from verizon because cingulair has nicer cell phones the first thing i noticed was the really bad service 0 
the best example of how dumb the writing is when its established that you can turn the zombiestudents back into humans by removing a necklace containing a piece of the meteorite 0 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
its one of the movies i need to see whenever it comes on tvnever mind the fact that i already have it memorized 1 
fantastic food 1 
but the service was beyond bad 0 
and considering the two of us left there very full and happy for about 20 you just cant go wrong 1 
pretty piece of junk 0 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
no plot whatsoever 0 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
if you dont find it too bad as again the unit comes with one earpad onlyi would not recommend this to anyone 0 
i would definitely recommend the jabra bt250v for those who are looking for comfort clarity and a great price 1 
to summarize the food was incredible nay transcendant but nothing brings me joy quite like the memory of the pneumatic condiment dispenser 1 
heres where the movie really pied me off 0 
do not buy do not buyit sucks 0 
you will leave the theater wanting to go out and dance under the stars 1 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
when i saw it in the theater i thought i was going to be sick 0 
unfortunately inexperience of direction meant that scene after scene passed with little in the way of dramatic tension or conflict 0 
worst phone ever 0 
cant store anything but phone numbers to sim 0 
just dont know why they were so slow 0 
his use of the colours of the french flag in the three films was nothing short of incredible every shot every scene was like a work of art 1 
it was a bit too sweet not really spicy enough and lacked flavor 0 
improper description i had to return it 0 
worst ever 0 
some applause should be given to the prelude however 1 
sweetest phone 1 
i have recommended it to friends 1 
i contacted the company and they told me that although the unit was still under warranty if i couldnt produce my receipt i was out of luck 0 
i really do recommend this place you can go wrong with this donut place 1 
that said our mouths and bellies were still quite pleased 1 
ryans bar is definitely one edinburgh establishment i wont be revisiting 0 
what did bother me was the slow service 0 
its still wild stuff though and is highly recommended to fans of giallo cinema 1 
not only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic but it also managed to give away the entire movie and im not exaggerating every moment every plot point every joke is told in the trailer 0 
i can barely ever hear on it and am constantly saying what 0 
there was hardly any meat 0 
after all the rave reviews i couldnt wait to eat herewhat a disappointment 0 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
a film not easily forgotten 1 
great food 1 
all in all ha long bay was a bit of a flop 0 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
but it wasnt anything at all just one big yawn 0 
the file browser offers all the options that one needshandsfree is great 1 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
we ordered the duck rare and it was pink and tender on the inside with a nice char on the outside 1 
it makes very strange ticking noises before it ends the call 0 
oh the charger seems to work fine 1 
the awful dialogue and hopeless overacting by everyone who gets shot top off a real waste of space and time 0 
this is a good joint 1 
you wont regret it 1 
youll love it 1 
before i go in to why i gave a 1 star rating please know that this was my third time eating at bachi burger before writing a review 0 
pretty awesome place 1 
total letdown i would much rather just go to the camelback flower shop and cartel coffee 0 
i let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this bad idea we both hated it 0 
this item is fantastic and works perfectly 1 
despite how hard i rate businesses its actually rare for me to give a 1 star 0 
battery life is also great 1 
very disappointing 0 
good prices 1 
the art style has the appearance of crayonpencil drawings and is wonderfully colorful and fanciful 1 
it is not good 0 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
bought mainly for the charger which broke soon after purchasing 0 
im probably one of the few people to ever go to ians and not like it 0 
i loved it 1 
im a big fan of this series mostly due to anne rices style sensitivities and treatments 1 
on the ground right next to our table was a large smeared beensteppedinandtrackedeverywhere pile of green bird poop 0 
there was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters 0 
this fixes all the problems 1 
a fly was in my apple juice a fly 0 
it also had a new problem 0 
i love the camera its really pretty good quality 1 
it felt too light and tinny 0 
utter crap sound quality is terrible 0 
the bartender was also nice 1 
car charger as well as ac charger are included to make sure you never run out of juicehighy recommended 1 
waste of 13 bucks 0 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
i immediately said i wanted to talk to the manager but i did not want to talk to the guy who was doing shots of fireball behind the bar 0 
love this headset 1 
full of unconvincing cardboard characters it is blandly written by edward chodorov who also produced and is surprisingly directed by jean negulesco from whom one would expect a great deal more 0 
a truly truly bad film 0 
as an earlier review noted plug in this charger and nothing happens 0 
voice quality signal strength dropped calls 0 
wow what a bad film 0 
what a great double cheeseburger 1 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
i was so insulted 0 
it feels poorly constructed the menus are difficult to navigate and the buttons are so recessed that it is difficult to push them 0 
my only complaint is the standard sound volume is a little low even when turned up to 5of 5 0 
none of it works just dont buy it 0 
con spotty service 0 
great charger 1 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
i get absolutely horrible reception in my apartment where with other phones i have not had this problem 0 
but she is still a bad actress repeating her robotic face moves in each of her pictures 0 
secondly hitchcock pretty much perfected the thriller and chase movie 1 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
their chow mein is so good 1 
do not make the same mistake as me 0 
it did not work in my cell phone plug i am very up set with the charger 0 
adapter does not provide enough charging current 0 
items stated as included from the description are not included 0 
it is the best charger i have seen on the market yet 1 
disappointing 0 
problem is that the ear loops are made of weak material and break easily 0 
crash is a depressing little nothing that provokes emotion but teaches you nothing if you already know racism and prejudice are bad things 0 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
utterly without merit on any level this is akin to torture 0 
it was just too horrible 0 
the inside is really quite nice and very clean 1 
setup went very smoothly 1 
and his subtle connections between the three films are awesome 1 
eclectic selection 1 
warning do not buy 0 
if there is a wind it is completely useless 0 
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0 
sound quality on both end is excellent i use headset to call my wife and ask my wife to use headset to call me 2 1 
awesome service and food 1 
i love this bluetooth 1 
great product and price 1 
and considering the two of us left there very full and happy for about 20 you just cant go wrong 1 
i guess i should have known that this place would suck because it is inside of the excalibur but i didnt use my common sense 0 
you share general loewenhielms exquisite joy in his partaking of the cailles en sarcophage even though you are just watching a movie but you do wish for just a small sample to savor 1 
i even dropped this phone into a stream and it was submerged for 15 seconds and it still works great 1 
only like 3 or 4 buildings used a couple of locations maybe poor hummh 0 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
i paid too much 0 
this film tries to be a serious and sophisticated thrillerhorror flick and it fails miserably 0 
defective crap 0 
dont buy it 0 
verizon tech support walked my through a few procedures none of which worked and i ended up having to do a hard reset wiping out all my data 0 
it makes very strange ticking noises before it ends the call 0 
this is the kind of money that is wasted properly 1 
no actress has been worse used that june allison in this movie 0 
lastly the mozzarella sticks they were the best thing we ordered 1 
youll love it 1 
the scenery that the two daughters paint and photograph are beautiful 1 
the plot has more holes than a pair of fishnet stockings and the direction and editing is astonishingly ham fisted 0 
it wasnt busy either also the building was freezing cold 0 
the cinematographyif it can be called thatsucked 0 
works for me 1 
i put the latest os on it v115g and it now likes to slow to a crawl and lock up every once in a while 0 
he deserves 5 stars 1 
this particular model would not work with my motorola q smartphone 0 
all i can do is whine on the internet so here it goesthe more i use the thing the less i like it 0 
all of the main players are mesmerising 1 
this film tries to be a serious and sophisticated thrillerhorror flick and it fails miserably 0 
couldnt use the unit with sunglasses not good in texas 0 
the food sucked which we expected but it sucked more than we could have imagined 0 
it probably would have been better if the director hadnt spent most of the movie showcasing his own art work which really isnt that noteworthy 0 
i love this place 1 
service is quick and friendly 1 
awful service 0 
the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach 0 
doesnt hold charge 0 
the service was poor and thats being nice 0 
it was clear that she had the range and ability to pull off this part 1 
the chains which im no fan of beat this place easily 0 
2 thumbs up to this seller 1 
also great directing and photography 1 
yes this film does require a rather significant amount of puzzlesolving but the pieces fit together to create a beautiful picture 1 
not good by any stretch of the imagination 0 
in conclusion i will not bother with this movie because a volcano in los angeles is nothing but nonsense 0 
really pleased with this product so far 1 
babie bop is very cute 1 
worst service to boot but that is the least of their worries 0 
the movie is littered with overt racial slurs towards the black cast members and in return the whites are depicted as morons and boobs 0 
crisp and clear 1 
you can watch them preparing the delicious food 1 
the food wasnt good 0 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvÃ¥g being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
i hate to disagree with my fellow yelpers but my husband and i were so disappointed with this place 0 
walked in and the place smelled like an old grease trap and only 2 others there eating 0 
recommend with confidence 1 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
this is a disgrace 0 
my salad had a bland vinegrette on the baby greens and hearts of palm 0 
is pretty funny 1 
almost everyone involved must be return to school acting is utterly predictable and bad script is pile of garbage all round 0 
we ordered the duck rare and it was pink and tender on the inside with a nice char on the outside 1 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
the story unfolds in 18th century jutland and the use of period music played on period instruments is just one more fine touch 1 
i guess maybe we went on an off night but it was disgraceful 0 
as an earlier review noted plug in this charger and nothing happens 0 
i would advise to not purchase this item it never worked very well 0 
dont buy it 0 
instead we got a bore fest about a whiny spoiled brat babysitting 0 
works great 1 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
even allowing for poor production values for the time 1971 and the format some kind of miniseries this is baaaaaad 0 
excellent product 1 
he is almost unbearable to watch on screen he has little to no charisma and terrible comedic timing 0 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
i hate those things as much as cheap quality black olives 0 
bland not a liking this place for a number of reasons and i dont want to waste time on bad reviewing ill leave it at that 0 
this is cool because most cases are just open there allowing the screen to get all scratched up 1 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
the reception has been generally good 1 
this film and i use that word loosely is an insult to the moviegoing public 0 
crisp and clear 1 
the service was terrible food was mediocre 0 
it felt like a very gripping intelligent stage play but without the overly theatrical feeling one actually gets from watching people on a stage which plays on everyones terror of a white lie escalating to monstrous consequences 1 
however bt headsets are currently not good for real time games like firstperson shooters since the audio delay messes me up 0 
they were goldencrispy and delicious 1 
actually the graphics were good at the time 1 
warning do not buy 0 
but whatever it was that cost them so much it didnt translate to quality thats for sure 0 
as for the mains also uninspired 0 
the kids are very cool too 1 
the ri style calamari was a joke 0 
i wont be back 0 
it definitely was not as good as my s11 1 
how can you call yourself a steakhouse if you cant properly cook a steak i dont understand 0 
this is a great deal 1 
nice solid keyboard 1 
i particularly remember my senses being assaulted by strident cords of music that would blare out with very little warning and even less meaning 0 
i am a fan of his this movie sucked really bad 0 
total waste of time 0 
works great 1 
good works fine 1 
you also cannot take pictures with it in the case because the lense is covered 0 
i had a salad with the wings and some ice cream for dessert and left feeling quite satisfied 1 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
on the good side the staff was genuinely pleasant and enthusiastic a real treat 1 
attempting artiness with black white and clever camera angles the movie disappointed became even more ridiculous as the acting was poor and the plot and lines almost nonexistent 0 
in fact i liked it better than interview with a vampire and i liked this lestat stuart townsend better than cruises attempt 1 
i wasted my little money with this earpiece 0 
but if you liked movies like the matrix and better yet their sequels i think youll appreciate the thought provoking mindblowing experience this film will give you 1 
the movie lacks visual interest drama expression of feeling and celebration of the very patriotism that underlines the narrative 0 
my rating just 3 out of 10 0 
the screen does get smudged easily because it touches your ear and face 0 
dont waste your money and time 0 
mishima is extremely uninteresting 0 
and the red curry had so much bamboo shoots and wasnt very tasty to me 0 
very satisifed with that 1 
i love being able to use one headset for both by landline and cell 1 
down the drain because of a weak snap 0 
there is a brilliant twist ending 1 
the films sole bright spot was jonah hill who will look almost unrecognizable to fans of the recent superbad due to the amount of weight he lost in the interim 1 
each track commands sentiment actually contributing to the scenes and characters 1 
works great 1 
the only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive 1 
att is not clear sound is very distorted and you have to yell when you talk 0 
perhaps i caught them on an off night judging by the other reviews but im not inspired to go back 0 
it has everything i need and i couldnt ask for more 1 
there is really nothing for me at postinos hope your experience is better 0 
all of the main players are mesmerising 1 
i found the product to be easy to set up and use 1 
i guess maybe we went on an off night but it was disgraceful 0 
big disappointment with calendar sync 0 
comfortable fit you need your headset to be comfortable for at least an hour at a time if not for an entire day 1 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
the scallop dish is quite appalling for value as well 0 
the majority of the logitech earbud headsets failed 0 
i guess that nobody at the network that aired this dribble watched it before putting it on 0 
worked great 1 
i didnt want the clip going over the top of my ear causing discomfort 0 
both great 1 
the dialogue sucked 0 
the result is a powerhouse achievement made more timely now perhaps because of our cultures disturbing fascination with celebrity and its distorted interpretations of fame 1 
i highly recommend this modest priced cellular phone 1 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
how stupid is that 0 
everything from acting to cinematography was solid 1 
the ambiance was incredible 1 
and those baby owls were adorable 1 
terrible management 0 
makes it easier to keep up with my bluetooth when im not wearing it 0 
nothing at all to recommend 0 
but the service was beyond bad 0 
horrible horrible protector 0 
the best scene in the movie was when gerardo is trying to find a song that keeps running through his head 1 
i wish i could enter negative values admins 0 
crust is not good 0 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
cant upload ringtones from a third party 0 
the reception has been generally good 1 
perhaps my phone is defective but people cannot hear me when i use this 0 
you share general loewenhielms exquisite joy in his partaking of the cailles en sarcophage even though you are just watching a movie but you do wish for just a small sample to savor 1 
ive seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie 0 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
what a great double cheeseburger 1 
this company charge me a restocking fee and still not given me my refund back 0 
battery life is also great 1 
highly recommended 1 
there are many continuity errors one other user commented on different cars in the garage joes glassesthe one that got to me the most was the fact joes facial hair configuration seemed to change from scene to scene 0 
i found the product to be easy to set up and use 1 
the very idea of it was lame take a minor character from a mediocre pg13 film and make a complete nonsequel while changing its tone to a pgrated family movie 0 
we had so much to say about the place before we walked in that he expected it to be amazing but was quickly disappointed 0 
i can say that the desserts were yummy 1 
omg i felt like i had never eaten thai food until this dish 1 
so far it has worked like a charm 1 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
it is an insane game 1 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
the battery is completely useless to me 0 
bad characters bad story and bad acting 0 
went for lunch service was slow 0 
avoid at all cost 0 
i must say i have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again 1 
prosgood camera very nice pictures also has cool styles like black and white and more 1 
this is just a great movie 1 
i am pairing this with my iphone and i could not be happier with it so far 1 
hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in 0 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
dont go here 0 
too politically correct 0 
good servicecheck 1 
we have tried 2 units and they both failed within 2 months pros 0 
the only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port irda 0 
it was a waste of my money 0 
went in for happy hour great list of wines 1 
superb phone on a great network 1 
perfect for the ps3 1 
20th century foxs road house 1948 is not only quite a silly noir but is an implausible unmitigated bore of a movie 0 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
this place is not quality sushi it is not a quality restaurant 0 
my fella got the huevos rancheros and they didnt look too appealing 0 
very bad experience 0 
im returning them 0 
please dont waste your money 0 
you also cannot take pictures with it in the case because the lense is covered 0 
his performance is simply genius 1 
i never walked out of a movie faster 0 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
2 times very bad customer service 0 
we loved the biscuits 1 
im not impressed with the concept or the food 0 
i wasnt expecting oscar material but this 0 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
great product and price 1 
he also came back to check on us regularly excellent service 1 
its the best headset i have used 1 
it was not good 0 
overall i like there food and the service 1 
i would recommend this 1 
the portion was huge 1 
best service and food ever maria our server was so good and friendly she made our day 1 
one more thing i can tolerate political incorrectness very well im all for artistic freedom and suspension of disbelief but the slavic female character was just too much 0 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
i was particularly pleased with the acting ability of dwight schultz 1 
unreliable im giving up 0 
eew this location needs a complete overhaul 0 
we got sitting fairly fast but ended up waiting 40 minutes just to place our order another 30 minutes before the food arrived 0 
i was deeply impressed with the character he played 1 
it defeats the purpose of a bluetooth headset 0 
all things considered a job very well done 1 
good food good service 1 
excellent bluetooth headset 1 
the acting sucks the music sucks the script sucks the pacing sucks the special fx suck the directing sucks basically this movie sucks 0 
there was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters 0 
this place is way too overpriced for mediocre food 0 
aside from its terrible lead this film has loads of other debits 0 
the only consistent thread holding the series together were the amazing performances of leni parker and anita laselva as the two taelons in quiet idealogical conflict 0 
terrible phone holder 0 
its a great tool for entertainment communication and data managementoh be sure to use activesync 42 for optimal data synchronization results 1 
the range is very decent ive been able to roam around my house with the phone in the living room with no receptionsound quality issues 1 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
classywarm atmosphere fun and fresh appetizers succulent steaks baseball steak 1 
obviously they have a terrible customer service so you get what you pay for 0 
using all earpieces left or right this thing will not stay on my ear 0 
the puppets look really cheesy not in a good way like in the puppet master 80s flicks 0 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
i received my orders well within the shipping timeframe everything was in good working order and overall i am very excited to have this source 1 
really good product 1 
their monster chicken fried steak and eggs is my all time favorite 1 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
the manager was the worst 0 
a greasy unhealthy meal 0 
the plot has more holes than a pair of fishnet stockings and the direction and editing is astonishingly ham fisted 0 
my mother and brother had to do thiswhen i saw robert ryan portraying this type of man it was a very good imitation of this type of individual and i was impressed 1 
it is an hour and half waste of time following a bunch of very pretty high schoolers whine and cry about life 0 
once you get inside youll be impressed with the place 1 
its the best headset i have used 1 
krussel always good 1 
im returning them 0 
nice sound 1 
it is perfect for a sitdown family meal or get together with a few friends 1 
the calls drop the phone comes on and off at will the screen goes black and the worst of all it stops ringing intermittently 0 
terrible service 0 
a good commentary of todays love and undoubtedly a film worth seeing 1 
my breakfast was perpared great with a beautiful presentation of 3 giant slices of toast lightly dusted with powdered sugar 1 
you get incredibly fresh fish prepared with care 1 
generally it just lacked imagination 0 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
spoilers whatever else can or cant be said about it surface is superbly crafted 1 
i wouldnt return 0 
we wont be returning 0 
my girlfriends veal was very bad 0 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
when it opens the battery connection is broken and the device is turned off 0 
the cocktails are all handmade and delicious 1 
to be honest with you this is unbelievable nonsense and very foolish 0 
adapter does not provide enough charging current 0 
all of the main players are mesmerising 1 
after charging overnight these batteries work great 1 
the food was great as always compliments to the chef 1 
customer service was terrible 0 
you get what you pay for i guess 0 
the kids are very cool too 1 
this is a masterful piece of filmmaking with many themes simmering and occasionally boiling over in this warts and all study of the poets bohemian selfindulgent wartime years that span the aerial bombardments of london and the outward tranquillity of a welsh coastal retreat the borderlines between friendship lust and love dedication to art and experience versus practical concerns jealousy rivalry cowardice and egotism versus heroism and selfsacrifice and more 1 
i was totally fascinated by the music the dancing everything 1 
just spicy enough perfect actually 1 
restaurant is always full but never a wait 1 
this film has no redeeming features 0 
i really enjoyed crema cafÃ© before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
dont bother coming here 0 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
this was my first time and i cant wait until the next 1 
the film has great actors a master director a significant themeat least a wouldbe significant theme undertone of fifties existential worldweariness aerial scenes that ought to have thrilled both senses and imagination and characters about which one might deeply care 1 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
ill even say it again Â– this is torture 0 
i am far from a sushi connoisseur but i can definitely tell the difference between good food and bad food and this was certainly bad food 0 
the cast is good 1 
i promise they wont disappoint 1 
attempting artiness with black white and clever camera angles the movie disappointed became even more ridiculous as the acting was poor and the plot and lines almost nonexistent 0 
waitress was a little slow in service 0 
the cashew cream sauce was bland and the vegetables were undercooked 0 
this place deserves no stars 0 
the tracfonewebsite is user friendly and makes it easy toactivate etc 1 
went in for happy hour great list of wines 1 
the secondary plot line is incomprehensible and its relation to the primary plot line is mystifying 0 
wasted two hours 0 
the writer gorman bechard undoubtedly did his homework because all references are industry and characterage appropriate 1 
this film offers many delights and surprises 1 
your staff spends more time talking to themselves than me 0 
the service was meh 0 
this one wants to surf on the small wave of space movies in 1998 deep impact and armageddon and this one fails everywhere 0 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
i love this place 1 
and i really did find them funny 1 
unfortunately it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees 0 
avoid avoid avoid 0 
i think that it is a must see older john wayne film 1 
the movie is littered with overt racial slurs towards the black cast members and in return the whites are depicted as morons and boobs 0 
i believe the screenwriter did a good job of tying up the loose ends 1 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
go and see it 1 
i only hear garbage for audio 0 
the movie is not completely perfect but titta di girolamo will stay with you for a long time after the vision of the movie 1 
it is a true classic 1 
even allowing for poor production values for the time 1971 and the format some kind of miniseries this is baaaaaad 0 
overall i wasnt very impressed with noca 0 
his use of the colours of the french flag in the three films was nothing short of incredible every shot every scene was like a work of art 1 
helen baxendale is a very credible lady macbeth who can be very cheerfull at times and sometimes she just looks like a naughty girl but deadly in her taste for blood and evil 1 
that movie was bad 0 
there is so much good food in vegas that i feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to rice and company 0 
like the other reviewer said you couldnt pay me to eat at this place again 0 
a world better than 95 of the garbage in the theatres today 1 
secondly hitchcock pretty much perfected the thriller and chase movie 1 
the acting helps the writing along very well maybe the idiotsavant sister could have been played better and it is a real joy to watch 1 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
the film has great actors a master director a significant themeat least a wouldbe significant theme undertone of fifties existential worldweariness aerial scenes that ought to have thrilled both senses and imagination and characters about which one might deeply care 1 
food was so gooodd 1 
i agree with jessica this movie is pretty bad 0 
so flavorful and has just the perfect amount of heat 1 
from here on the widmark character turns unintentionally comical 0 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
linksys should have some way to exchange a bad phone for a refurb unit or something 0 
i believe the screenwriter did a good job of tying up the loose ends 1 
it is light has plenty of battery capacity and is very confortable to wear for somewhat extended periods of time 1 
all of the main players are mesmerising 1 
if this premise sound stupid thats because it is 0 
uncomfortable in the ear dont use with lg vx9900 env 0 
my sanyo has survived dozens of drops on blacktop without ill effect 1 
weve have gotten a much better service from the pizza place next door than the services we received from this restaurant 0 
i could eat their bruschetta all day it is devine 1 
there is however some pretty good acting at least for this type of film 1 
disappointing accessory from a good manufacturer 0 
the movie was very interesting from beginning to the end 1 
the camera really likes her in this movie 1 
summary the witticisms werent witty 0 
its a case of so bad it is laughable 0 
they have a plethora of salads and sandwiches and everything ive tried gets my seal of approval 1 
oh the charger seems to work fine 1 
i love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it 1 
best ive found so far ive tried 2 other bluetooths and this one has the best quality for both me and the listener as well as ease of using 1 
service is quick and even to go orders are just like we like it 1 
sprint charges for this service 0 
one of my favorite purchases ever 1 
i thought errol flynn was brilliant as custer and has since become my favourite actor 1 
seems like a good quick place to grab a bite of some familiar pub food but do yourself a favor and look elsewhere 0 
i do love sushi but i found kabuki to be overpriced overhip and underservices 0 
i cant see how this movie can be an inspiration to anyone to come out or overcome fear and rejection 0 
i was so insulted 0 
ill even say it again Â– this is torture 0 
also difficult to put onid recommend avoiding this product 0 
i thoroughly enjoyed it when christopher eccleston took control of the tardis and the continuation of the series 1 
for people who are first timers in film making i think they did an excellent job 1 
after the disappointing dinner we went elsewhere for dessert 0 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
first time there and might just be the last 0 
the music in the film is really nice too 1 
now the burgers arent as good the pizza which used to be amazing is doughy and flavorless 0 
terrible management 0 
awesome device 1 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
from what my dinner companions told meeverything was very fresh with nice texture and taste 1 
i waited and waited 0 
you cant relate with them hell you barely can understand them 0 
to my disbelief each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods i have ever tasted 0 
great hands free device 1 
i used bitpim a free program you can find on the internetto transfer data to the phonethe price of the cable was excellent 1 
owners are really great people 1 
actually the graphics were good at the time 1 
im really disappointed all i have now is a charger that doesnt work 0 
the atmosphere was great with a lovely duo of violinists playing songs we requested 1 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
it failed to convey the broad sweep of landscapes that were a great part of the original 0 
the story line is totally predictable 0 
the ngage is still lacking in earbuds 0 
all in all i give this one a resounding 9 out of 10 1 
i can barely ever hear on it and am constantly saying what 0 
unfortunately the ability to actually know you are receiving a call is a rather important feature and this phone is pitiful in that respect 0 
but when i check voice mail at night the keypad backlight turns off a few seconds into the first message and then im lost 0 
everything was good and tasty 1 
the first time i ever came here i had an amazing experience i still tell people how awesome the duck was 1 
ive never been more insulted or felt disrespected 0 
i would advise to not purchase this item it never worked very well 0 
its a gloriously fun fast paced and fairly accurate portrayal of the night of a raver 1 
lastly the mozzarella sticks they were the best thing we ordered 1 
i dont think it would hold it too securly on your belt 0 
it was also the right balance of war and love 1 
its just painful 0 
total waste of time 0 
using all earpieces left or right this thing will not stay on my ear 0 
big disappointment with calendar sync 0 
the food is not tasty at all not to say its real traditional hunan style 0 
both of the egg rolls were fantastic 1 
if i take a picture the battery drops a bar and starts beeping letting me know its dieing 0 
i hate to disagree with my fellow yelpers but my husband and i were so disappointed with this place 0 
well packaged arrived on time and works as intended 1 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
my breakfast was perpared great with a beautiful presentation of 3 giant slices of toast lightly dusted with powdered sugar 1 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
judith light is one of my favorite actresses and i think she does a superb job in this film 1 
i had to wait over 30 minutes to get my drink and longer to get 2 arepas 0 
fits comfortably came with three sizes of earbud tips 1 
excellent cast story line performances 1 
it didnt make me scared horrified or make me sympathetic towards the characters it was simply annoying 0 
im very disappointed with my decision 0 
but despite these few flaws this case is of exceptional quality and well worth the additional costs of owning an official oem product 1 
im so happy to be here 1 
im a big fan of this series mostly due to anne rices style sensitivities and treatments 1 
dont make the same mistake i did 0 
i am so pleased to know such a modern day genius is out there letting is passion for art drive him and taking us as an audience with him 1 
i wear glasses and it fits fine with them 1 
im terribly disappointed that this film would receive so many awards and accolades especially when there are far more deserving works of film out there 0 
you get extra minutes so that you can carry out the call and not get cut off 1 
the fried rice was dry as well 0 
his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic 1 
the majority of the logitech earbud headsets failed 0 
the bus boy on the other hand was so rude 0 
but this movie really got to me 1 
i know he was a contract player with little control over his scripts but the acting was as bad as the script 0 
not much dialogue not much music the whole film was shot as elaborately and aesthetically like a sculpture 1 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
you also cannot take pictures with it in the case because the lense is covered 0 
good product good seller 1 
in addition to having one of the most lovely songs ever written french cancan also boasts one of the cutest leading ladies ever to grace the screen 1 
food was great and so was the serivce 1 
this movie is bad 0 
on the up side their cafe serves really good food 1 
the good cinematography also makes her and monica bellucci look very beautiful 1 
very funny 1 
nothing special 0 
what a big waste of time 0 
im very disappointed with my decision 0 
what i really like there is the crepe station 1 
linksys should have some way to exchange a bad phone for a refurb unit or something 0 
good item low price 1 
the food came out at a good pace 1 
this pda rocks 1 
great service and food 1 
it was pretty gross 0 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
omit watching this 0 
my fiancÃ© and i came in the middle of the day and we were greeted and seated right away 1 
if the food isnt bad enough for you then enjoy dealing with the worlds worstannoying drunk people 0 
the acting sucks the music sucks the script sucks the pacing sucks the special fx suck the directing sucks basically this movie sucks 0 
warning stay away 0 
nice docking station for home or work 1
