the poor actors 0 
the script is horrendously stupid 0 
1 hour 54 minutes of sheer tedium melodrama and horrible acting a mess of a script and a sinking feeling of good lord what were they thinking 0 
i am also very happy with the price 1 
all the pretty pictures in the world cannot make up for a piece of work that is flawed at the core 0 
highquality chicken on the chicken caesar salad 1 
there is a brilliant twist ending 1 
think of the film being like a dream 1 
the nano stated itmy son was dissapointed 0 
i dont recommend unless your car breaks down in front of it and you are starving 0 
it looses connection to the phone even when it is within a couple feet between the two 0 
voice recognition is tremendous 1 
first time there and might just be the last 0 
would not recommend to others 0 
the movie has almost no action scenes in it and very little comedy 0 
you share general loewenhielms exquisite joy in his partaking of the cailles en sarcophage even though you are just watching a movie but you do wish for just a small sample to savor 1 
food arrived quickly 1 
we definately enjoyed ourselves 1 
really ugly 0 
reception is terrible and full of static 0 
phone falls out easily 0 
what a waste of money and time 0 
if you stay in vegas you must get breakfast here at least once 1 
this is a very average phone with bad battery life that operates on a weak network 0 
heres where the movie really pied me off 0 
happy so far 1 
i am very happy 1 
imdb ratings only go as low 1 for awful its time to get some negative numbers in there for cases such as these 0 
very true to shakespear and a must for all shakespear fans 1 
linksys should have some way to exchange a bad phone for a refurb unit or something 0 
there was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth but it didnt really work into the rest of the plot 0 
being a 90s child i truly enjoyed this show and i can proudly say that i enjoyed it big time and even more than the classical wb cartoons 1 
mishima is extremely uninteresting 0 
would not go back 0 
low quality 0 
i hate movies like that 0 
dont miss it 1 
this allows the possibility of double booking for the same date and time after the first 0 
loved itfriendly servers great food wonderful and imaginative menu 1 
the jamaican mojitos are delicious 1 
the aerial scenes were welldone 1 
i rather enjoyed it 1 
both rickman and stowe play their roles to the hilt in this tale of a childrens book writer who maybe has written a subversive tract 1 
hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in 0 
the script is a big flawed mess 0 
this pair of headphones is the worst that i have ever had soundwise 0 
overall i rate this movie a 10 out of a 110 scale 1 
go to place for gyros 1 
an italian reviewer called this a small great film and thats right 1 
the phone crashed completely and now i have to get it replaced 0 
they are so cool 1 
very disappointed in accessoryone 0 
i started this review with two stars but im editing it to give it only one 0 
what a waste of money and time 0 
good prices 1 
that being said for a phone the camera is very nice many cool effects to play with and video is decent as well 1 
we got sitting fairly fast but ended up waiting 40 minutes just to place our order another 30 minutes before the food arrived 0 
the scripting of the subtle comedy is unmatched by any movie in recent years 1 
penne vodka excellent 1 
and generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode 0 
i especially liked the noncliche choices with the parents in other movies i could predict the dialog verbatim but the writing in this movie made better selections 1 
great place to relax and have an awesome burger and beer 1 
but despite these few flaws this case is of exceptional quality and well worth the additional costs of owning an official oem product 1 
food arrived quickly 1 
the block was amazing 1 
best headset ever 1 
battery life is also great 1 
i wasnt expecting oscar material but this 0 
i left with a stomach ache and felt sick the rest of the day 0 
just as good as when i had it more than a year ago 1 
this is cool because most cases are just open there allowing the screen to get all scratched up 1 
their daily specials are always a hit with my group 1 
what happened next was prettyoff putting 0 
extremely tasty 1 
i highly recommend this case 1 
great price also 1 
i wish i could enter negative values admins 0 
the secondary plot line is incomprehensible and its relation to the primary plot line is mystifying 0 
things happen characters personalities change plot twists occur for no real reason other than that script calls for it 0 
the lines the cuts the audio everything is wrong 0 
his losing his marbles so early in the proceedings is totally implausible and unconvincing 0 
this is by far the worst purchase ive made on amazon 0 
i am very happy 1 
i immediately said i wanted to talk to the manager but i did not want to talk to the guy who was doing shots of fireball behind the bar 0 
fast service 1 
the decor is nice and the piano music soundtrack is pleasant 1 
how can anyone in their right mind ask for anything more from a movie than this 1 
by the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant i was bored and didnt care what happened next and so i switched off 0 
this was such an awesome movie that i bought it off of ebay 1 
in short dont bother with this movie 0 
ive bought 5 wired headphones that sound better than these 0 
lovely little thriller from hitchcock with lots of nice shenanigans surrounding a murdered spy a kidnapped child a nasty church a foreign plot and some random taxidermists 1 
the scenes with the ohsomature neighbourgirl are a misplace 0 
nobody identifies with these characters because theyre all cardboard cutouts and stereotypes or predictably reversestereotypes 0 
horrible 0 
the decor is nice and the piano music soundtrack is pleasant 1 
the handsfree part works fine but then the car tries to download the address book and the treo rebootsoverall i still rate this device high 1 
this movie is bad 0 
friends pasta also bad he barely touched it 0 
no im going to eat the potato that i found some strangers hair in it 0 
this is the kind of money that is wasted properly 1 
the cashew cream sauce was bland and the vegetables were undercooked 0 
worth every penny 1 
excellent bluetooth headset 1 
i wont spoil it but the ending in pretty amazing 1 
also the phone doesnt seem to accept anything except cbr mp3s preferably ripped by windows media player 0 
bt50 battery junk 0 
even if you love bad movies do not watch this movie 0 
worked great 1 
try them in the airport to experience some tasty food and speedy friendly service 1 
great place to eat reminds me of the little mom and pop shops in the san francisco bay area 1 
appetite instantly gone 0 
i love the pho and the spring rolls oh so yummy you have to try 1 
and i really did find them funny 1 
juano hernandez an exceptional actor who played supporting roles in many films of the era is a proud black man who is accused of murdering a white man in the south 1 
maybe its just their vegetarian fare but ive been twice and i thought it was average at best 0 
having to humour him just to get by and get through the day was so apt 1 
low quality 0 
but in terms of the writing its very fresh and bold 1 
truly awful 0 
as for the service i thought it was good 1 
the whole experience was underwhelming and i think well just go to ninja sushi next time 0 
they never brought a salad we asked for 0 
i would definitely recommend the jabra bt250v for those who are looking for comfort clarity and a great price 1 
perfect for the ps3 1 
bad characters bad story and bad acting 0 
disappointed 0 
is it possible for a movie to get any worse than this 0 
i ended up sliding it on the edge of my pants or back pockets instead 1 
overall i would recommend this phone over the new walkman 1 
i saw this short film on hbo the other day and absolutely loved it 1 
the ambiance was incredible 1 
good quality 1 
its one of the movies i need to see whenever it comes on tvnever mind the fact that i already have it memorized 1 
artless camerawork endlessly presents us with the ugliest setting imaginable ie 0 
that just screams legit in my booksomethats also pretty rare here in vegas 1 
i love lane but ive never seen her in a movie this lousy 0 
this fixes all the problems 1 
i highly recommend this device to everyone 1 
excellent hands free tool 1 
it was a long time that i didnt see a so charismatic actor on screen 1 
but when i check voice mail at night the keypad backlight turns off a few seconds into the first message and then im lost 0 
this convention never worked well in the past and certainly doesnt work here 0 
we ordered some old classics and some new dishes after going there a few times and were sorely disappointed with everything 0 
it is worth the drive 1 
service is perfect and the family atmosphere is nice to see 1 
there was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth but it didnt really work into the rest of the plot 0 
there is so much good food in vegas that i feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to rice and company 0 
but whatever it was that cost them so much it didnt translate to quality thats for sure 0 
each day of the week they have a different deal and its all so delicious 1 
your brain will attempt to shutdown as part of a primal impulse of selfpreservation 0 
i dont think it would hold it too securly on your belt 0 
you will leave the theater wanting to go out and dance under the stars 1 
avoid avoid avoid 0 
the only thing i wasnt too crazy about was their guacamole as i dont like it puréed 0 
secondly hitchcock pretty much perfected the thriller and chase movie 1 
the servers went back and forth several times not even so much as an are you being helped 0 
i really hope the team behind this movie makes more movies and that they will continue to do so in their own some kinda weird style 1 
but other than that the movie seemed to drag and the heroes didnt really work for their freedom 0 
the servers went back and forth several times not even so much as an are you being helped 0 
in fact this stinker smells like a directtovideo release 0 
service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is vegas and located inside the crystals shopping mall by aria 1 
the atmosphere is modern and hip while maintaining a touch of coziness 1 
definitely not worth the 3 i paid 0 
overall i was not impressed and would not go back 0 
audio quality is poor very poor 0 
excellent sound quality 1 
when i opened the sandwich i was impressed but not in a good way 0 
this place lacked style 0 
audio quality is poor very poor 0 
overall i like there food and the service 1 
comfort for our whole family 1 
this is a disgrace 0 
light weight i hardly notice it is there 1 
hands down my favorite italian restaurant 1 
the acting is fantastic the stories are seamlessly woven together and the dogs are splendid a must rent view or see 1 
yes its shiny on front side and i love it 1 
my rating just 3 out of 10 0 
it was probably dirt 0 
the phone was unusable and was not new 0 
i asked multiple times for the wine list and after some time of being ignored i went to the hostess and got one myself 0 
waiter was a jerk 0 
no complaints 1 
lewis blacks considerable talent is wasted here too as he is at his most incendiary when he is unrestrained which the pg13 rating certainly wont allow 0 
i think that it is a must see older john wayne film 1 
excellent sound quality 1 
it works 1 
unfortunately it will not recharge my iphone 4s despite connecting it from multiple power sources imac external battery wall outlet etc 0 
worked very well paired with a treo 700w and as a skype headset on my pc using a usb bluetooth transceiver 1 
i especially liked the noncliche choices with the parents in other movies i could predict the dialog verbatim but the writing in this movie made better selections 1 
and if that isnt enough of a mess of a movie for you the picture is also marred with a constant use of studio sets and indoor exteriors 0 
the film deserves strong kudos for taking this stand for having exceptional acting from its mostly lesserknown cast and for the superintelligent script that doesnt insult the audience or take the easy way out when it comes to white racism 1 
glad i didnt pay to see it 0 
for a self proclaimed coffee cafe i was wildly disappointed 0 
id say that would be the hardest decision honestly all of ms dishes taste how they are supposed to taste amazing 1 
the stories were powerful explorations of the nature of man and of art 1 
this is a great place to eat 1 
as many people complained i found this headsets microphone was very weak 0 
the sound quality for the device is unacceptableunless you are in a really quiet area you almost hear nothing 0 
i really dont see how anyone could enjoy this movie 0 
but when i check voice mail at night the keypad backlight turns off a few seconds into the first message and then im lost 0 
that company is a joke 0 
never got it 0 
the cast was great 1 
your brain will attempt to shutdown as part of a primal impulse of selfpreservation 0 
i saw this movie and i thought this is a stupid movie 0 
i wear it everyday and it holds up very well 1 
what a disappointment 0 
stay away from this store be careful 0 
by this time our side of the restaurant was almost empty so there was no excuse 0 
there are the usual hitchcock logic flaws 0 
great food and awesome service 1 
its like a bad two hour tv movie 0 
it was a great phone 1 
and the red curry had so much bamboo shoots and wasnt very tasty to me 0 
the chicken dishes are ok the beef is like shoe leather 0 
the food sucked which we expected but it sucked more than we could have imagined 0 
internet is excrutiatingly slow 0 
i was totally fascinated by the music the dancing everything 1 
1 long lasting battery you dont have to recharge it as frequentyly as some of the flip phones2 0 
so for our enjoyment we get to see them run around play games and be dangerous 1 
i really like this product over the motorola because it is allot clearer on the ear piece and the mic 1 
i highly recommend this modest priced cellular phone 1 
5 stars for the brick oven bread app 1 
cinematography noteworthy including fine views of barcelona and its famed gaudi towers 1 
obviously they have a terrible customer service so you get what you pay for 0 
just as good as when i had it more than a year ago 1 
juano hernandez an exceptional actor who played supporting roles in many films of the era is a proud black man who is accused of murdering a white man in the south 1 
at around 4 pm i bought it at around 8pm i started to watch at around 815pm i fast forwarded the remaining film to see if there was anything left watchable for a human being with a brain but there wasnt 0 
the sergeant pepper beef sandwich with auju sauce is an excellent sandwich as well 1 
it was way over fried 0 
steer clear of this product and go with the genuine palm replacementr pens which come in a threepack 0 
would recommend this item 1 
service is friendly and inviting 1 
cooked to perfection and the service was impeccable 1 
i think not again 0 
how can you call yourself a steakhouse if you cant properly cook a steak i dont understand 0 
great phone 1 
kris kristoffersen is good in this movie and really makes a difference 1 
the macarons here are insanely good 1 
then scene where they debated whether or not to sack the trumpeter who falsely was accused for the murder is pure horror really stupid 0 
i ordered this for sony ericsson w810i but i think it only worked once thats when i first used it 0 
great value 1 
lucy bell is so much higher than this crap and for her to sink this low is quite depressing 0 
in my house i was getting dropped coverage upstairs and no coverage in my basement 0 
i was shocked because no signs indicate cash only 0 
for those that havent seen it dont waste your time 0 
this review is long overdue since i consider a tale of two sisters to be the single greatest film ever made 1 
it was an inexpensive piece but i would still have expected better quality 0 
one of the most disappointing aspects is the lack of notable gore 0 
it looses connection to the phone even when it is within a couple feet between the two 0 
and the accents are absolutely abysmal 0 
we got the food and apparently they have never heard of salt and the batter on the fish was chewy 0 
its like a bad two hour tv movie 0 
all in all i think it was a good investment 1 
lucy bell is so much higher than this crap and for her to sink this low is quite depressing 0 
do not buy for d807wrongly advertised for d807 0 
the buttons for on and off are bad 0 
the camera really likes her in this movie 1 
he was extremely rude and really there are so many other restaurants i would love to dine at during a weekend in vegas 0 
all i have to say is the food was amazing 1 
i have been to very few places to eat that under no circumstances would i ever return to and this tops the list 0 
i gave it 5 stars because of the sound quality 1 
there are many continuity errors one other user commented on different cars in the garage joes glassesthe one that got to me the most was the fact joes facial hair configuration seemed to change from scene to scene 0 
the script is horrendously stupid 0 
im not sure how long we stood there but it was long enough for me to begin to feel awkwardly out of place 0 
i guess maybe we went on an off night but it was disgraceful 0 
overall the film is interesting and thoughtprovoking 1 
this was utterly confusing at first which caused me to lose a couple of very very important contacts 0 
worst thai ever 0 
works great 1 
i thought it was bad 0 
i consider this theft 0 
also if your phone is dropped this case is not going to save it specially when dropped face down 0 
all in all an excellent restaurant highlighted by great service a unique menu and a beautiful setting 1 
this is high adventure at its best 1 
none of it works just dont buy it 0 
i have to mention this and it is a huge spoiler i loved the ending how all the characters of the three films were the remaining survivors of the ferry disaster with valentine and the young judge together and the old man watching it on her tv solidifying his happiness over the suffering which he dealt with for those many years 1 
defective crap 0 
we got the food and apparently they have never heard of salt and the batter on the fish was chewy 0 
ive also had problems with the phone reading the memory card in which i always turn it on and then off again 0 
i think it was robert ryans best film because he portrayed someone like my father and he was a schizophrenic in real lifemy father although he never murdered anyone but was affected more so during the second world war which made him worse 1 
very dissapointing performance 0 
its worth driving up from tucson 1 
great for the jawbone 1 
this place is handsdown one of the best places to eat in the phoenix metro area 1 
the best phone in market 1 
these are certainly very comfortable and functionality is decent 1 
i would recommend purchasing the jabra jx10 series 2 which works flawlessly with my moto q go figure 1 
both rickman and stowe play their roles to the hilt in this tale of a childrens book writer who maybe has written a subversive tract 1 
the directing and the cinematography arent quite as good 0 
i dont think it would hold it too securly on your belt 0 
a drive thru means you do not want to wait around for half an hour for your food but somehow when we end up going here they make us wait and wait 0 
this pda rocks 1 
nargile i think you are great 1 
oh this is such a thing of beauty this restaurant 1 
this film has no redeeming features 0 
the refried beans that came with my meal were dried out and crusty and the food was bland 0 
he surely doesnt know how to make a coherent action movie from the screenwriter of air force one who was only obliged to write the script just for a big sum of money 0 
food quality has been horrible 0 
every element of this story was so over the top excessively phony and contrived that it was painful to sit through 0 
its not what it says it is 0 
they made this case too small and is very difficult to install 0 
utter crap sound quality is terrible 0 
oh yeah and the storyline was pathetic too 0 
the ripped banana was not only ripped but petrified and tasteless 0 
we got the food and apparently they have never heard of salt and the batter on the fish was chewy 0 
will never ever go back 0 
we walked away stuffed and happy about our first vegas buffet experience 1 
just spicy enough perfect actually 1 
gets a signal when other verizon phones wont 1 
this product had a strong rubberpetroleum smell that was unbearable after a while and caused me to return it 0 
their regular toasted bread was equally satisfying with the occasional pats of butter mmmm 1 
utter crap sound quality is terrible 0 
the movie is full of wonderful dancing hence the title 1 
and i really did find them funny 1 
for a self proclaimed coffee cafe i was wildly disappointed 0 
wasted two hours 0 
im not eating here 0 
i am sorry i made this purchase 0 
damn good steak 1 
jamie foxx absolutely is ray charles 1 
duris has a wholesome appearance and gives a fine performance 1 
this is the place where i first had pho and it was amazing 1 
overall i like this place a lot 1 
great price too 1 
the desserts were a bit strange 0 
it holds a charge for a long time is reasonably comfortable under longwearing conditions and the quality of sound is tremendous 1 
highly recommended for all ages although the younger set will probably not appreciate some of the more subtle references they will certainly appreciate one galley scene in particular 1 
you could only take 2 videos at a time and the quality was very poor 0 
but this movie is not funny considering the ridiculousness of it 0 
prosgood camera very nice pictures also has cool styles like black and white and more 1 
not a weekly haunt but definitely a place to come back to every once in a while 1 
i highly recommend this modest priced cellular phone 1 
this place is not quality sushi it is not a quality restaurant 0 
i love the scream movies and all horror movies and this one ranks way up there 1 
i have recommended it to friends 1 
okay i like to consider myself a fair critic so ill give credit where credits duethe creature effects were actually pretty cool 1 
seems like a good quick place to grab a bite of some familiar pub food but do yourself a favor and look elsewhere 0 
i live in the neighborhood so i am disappointed i wont be back here because it is a convenient location 0 
again lame 0 
it dit not work most of the time with my nokia 5320 0 
i have bought this nokia cell phone a few weeks ago and it was a nightmare 0 
also makes it easier to hold on to 1 
not worth it 0 
i promise they wont disappoint 1 
this mostly routine factbased tv drama gets a boost from the fine performance by cole 1 
even in my bmw 3 series which is fairly quiet i have trouble hearing what the other person is saying 0 
editing the editing of this film was phenomenal in my opinion 1 
omelets are to die for 1 
o my gosh the best phone i have ever had 1 
the camera really likes her in this movie 1 
del taco is pretty nasty and should be avoided if possible 0 
it is rare when a filmmaker takes the time to tell a worthy moral tale with care and love that doesnt fall into the trap of being overly syrupy or over indulgent 1 
very tough and very short on flavor 0 
overall i wasnt very impressed with noca 0 
the camera although rated at an impressive 13 megapixels renders images that fall well below expectations of such a relatively high resolution 0 
perhaps my phone is defective but people cannot hear me when i use this 0 
you cant relate with them hell you barely can understand them 0 
good item low price 1 
comfortable fit you need your headset to be comfortable for at least an hour at a time if not for an entire day 1 
i received my headset in good time and was happy with it 1 
it is worth the drive 1 
same evening him and i are both drastically sick 0 
i highly recommend this movie for anyone interested in art poetry theater politics or japanese history 1 
as a courtroom drama its compelling as an indictment on the american justice system its frightening 1 
it lasts less than 3o minutes if i actually try to use the phonemy wife has the same phone with the same problem 0 
this place is way too overpriced for mediocre food 0 
i have always used corded headsets and the freedom from the wireless is very helpful 1 
it had some average acting from the main person and it was a low budget as you clearly can see 0 
however bt headsets are currently not good for real time games like firstperson shooters since the audio delay messes me up 0 
what a waste 0 
its very slow 0 
pretty awesome place 1 
both rickman and stowe play their roles to the hilt in this tale of a childrens book writer who maybe has written a subversive tract 1 
great for ipods too 1 
i would recommend saving room for this 1 
you share general loewenhielms exquisite joy in his partaking of the cailles en sarcophage even though you are just watching a movie but you do wish for just a small sample to savor 1 
great headset very impressed h500 1 
great product and price 1 
the story line is just awful 0 
i have two more years left in this contract and i hate this phone 0 
a piece of junk that broke after being on my phone for 2 days 0 
bland not a liking this place for a number of reasons and i dont want to waste time on bad reviewing ill leave it at that 0 
youll love how thin it is 1 
i liked it 1 
it was delicious 1 
his performance is simply genius 1 
verizons bills however are difficult to understand even though their pricing plans are simple 0 
my boyfriend tried the mediterranean chicken salad and fell in love 1 
very good food great atmosphere1 1 
there are massive levels massive unlockable characters its just a massive game 1 
highly unrecommended 0 
im terribly disappointed that this film would receive so many awards and accolades especially when there are far more deserving works of film out there 0 
you cant go wrong with any of the food here 1 
very friendly staff 1 
cumbersome design 0 
timely shipment and quality product 1 
its extremely slow and takes forever to do anything with it 0 
waitress was good though 1 
there was a warm feeling with the service and i felt like their guest for a special treat 1 
it was a long time that i didnt see a so charismatic actor on screen 1 
this was my first and only vegas buffet and it did not disappoint 1 
i am so tired of clichés that is just lazy writing and here they come in thick and fast 0 
a great touch 1 
i ordered this for sony ericsson w810i but i think it only worked once thats when i first used it 0 
nonlinear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well 1 
this is truly an art movieit actually has a lot of art in it 1 
in fact im going to round up to 4 stars just because she was so awesome 1 
none of the three sizes they sent with the headset would stay in my ears 0 
i really do recommend this place you can go wrong with this donut place 1 
the update procedure is difficult and cumbersome 0 
by this time our side of the restaurant was almost empty so there was no excuse 0 
anyways the food was definitely not filling at all and for the price you pay you should expect more 0 
avoid this film at all costs 0 
if you have several dozen or several hundred contacts then imagine the fun of sending each of them one by one 0 
it never condescends all the characters have good genuine hearts and believable problems 1 
at least think to refill my water before i struggle to wave you over for 10 minutes 0 
but the convoluted plot just didnt convince me and much of the film was watched with a weird questioning glance 0 
but it picked up speed and got right to the point 1 
much more interesting more action more suspense and less of the unneeded controversy 1 
doesnt do the job 0 
the most annoying thing about cover girl is the way in which rita hayworth is put up on a pedestal 0 
he is almost unbearable to watch on screen he has little to no charisma and terrible comedic timing 0 
absolutely great 1 
when im on this side of town this will definitely be a spot ill hit up again 1 
unless youre just out to visually collect all extant films of austens work you can skip this one 0 
bad script bad direction and horrible acting make this one plain bad 0 
at first i thought i was grtting a good deal at 744 until i plugged it into my phone v3c razr 0 
i have recommended it to friends 1 
it was so bad i had lost the heart to finish it 0 
also great directing and photography 1 
thanks again to amazon for having the things i need for a good price 1 
very good phone 1 
i saw it as a child on tv back in 1973 when it was the stranger and i loved it 1 
definitely worth checking out 1 
i might have gotten a defect but i would not risk buying it again because of the built quality alone 0 
great choice 1 
highly recommend for any one who has a blue tooth phone 1 
do not waste your time 0 
i will never go back to this place and will never ever recommended this place to anyone 0 
very prompt service 1 
i wont spoil it but the ending in pretty amazing 1 
recommend with confidence 1 
i cant wait to go back 1 
secondly hitchcock pretty much perfected the thriller and chase movie 1 
this is a chilly unremarkable movie about an author livingworking in a chilly abstruse culture 0 
even worse than ticker 0 
hence the whole story lacks a certain energy 0 
it is an insane game 1 
i love this cable it allows me to connect any miniusb device to my pc 1 
im so happy to be here 1 
very good lunch spot 1 
nobody identifies with these characters because theyre all cardboard cutouts and stereotypes or predictably reversestereotypes 0 
very good food great atmosphere1 1 
the film gives meaning to the phrase never in the history of human conflict has so much been owed by so many to so few 1 
watching washing machine twirling around wouldnt hurt your eyes as much as this show 0 
they keep getting better and better this is my third one and ive had numerous palms too 1 
which are small and not worth the price 0 
they never brought a salad we asked for 0 
what this film lacks is a convincing script 0 
just spicy enough perfect actually 1 
now we were chosen to be tortured with this disgusting piece of blatant american propaganda 0 
the scenes with the ohsomature neighbourgirl are a misplace 0 
incredible 1 
works great 1 
the very idea of it was lame take a minor character from a mediocre pg13 film and make a complete nonsequel while changing its tone to a pgrated family movie 0 
it worked very well 1 
im a big fan of this series mostly due to anne rices style sensitivities and treatments 1 
great for ipods too 1 
however this didnt make up for the fact that overall this was a tremendously boring movie 0 
the writers were smack on and i think the best actors and actresses were a bonus to the showthese characters were so real 1 
no ear loop needed its tiny and the sound is great 1 
i really like this product over the motorola because it is allot clearer on the ear piece and the mic 1 
often the dialogue doesnt really follow from one line to another or fit the surroundings 0 
any grandmother can make a roasted chicken better than this one 0 
my sanyo has survived dozens of drops on blacktop without ill effect 1 
im big fan of rpg games too but this movie its a disgrace to any selfrespecting rpger there is 0 
lets start with all the problemsthe acting especially from the lead professor was very very bad 0 
everything on the menu is terrific and we were also thrilled that they made amazing accommodations for our vegetarian daughter 1 
camera color balance is awful 0 
itll be a regular stop on my trips to phoenix 1 
you need two hands to operate the screenthis software interface is decade old and cannot compete with new software designs 0 
they could be used as exemplars for any set designer 1 
it was attached to a gas station and that is rarely a good sign 0 
utter crap sound quality is terrible 0 
whatever the producer was going for he missed entirely 0 
regardless the film fails on most levels 0 
the screen does get smudged easily because it touches your ear and face 0 
great audio 1 
i could barely stomach the meal but didnt complain because it was a business lunch 0 
sending it back 0 
as many people complained i found this headsets microphone was very weak 0 
highly unrecommended 0 
owners are really great people 1 
over rated 0 
they will customize your order any way youd like my usual is eggplant with green bean stir fry love it 1 
used and dirty 0 
its welldesigned and very sharp the blue is a very nice color 1 
there still are good actors around 1 
the food sucked which we expected but it sucked more than we could have imagined 0 
these were so good we ordered them twice 1 
sounds good reasonably priced and effective its that simple 1 
the art style has the appearance of crayonpencil drawings and is wonderfully colorful and fanciful 1 
one of my favorite purchases ever 1 
totally different with loads of understatement and black comedy this is a film few get to see but those who do will remember it 1 
tonight i had the elk filet specialand it sucked 0 
he also came back to check on us regularly excellent service 1 
cute quaint simple honest 1 
the movie is littered with overt racial slurs towards the black cast members and in return the whites are depicted as morons and boobs 0 
its pretty surprising that this wonderful film was made in 1949 as hollywood generally had its collective heads in the sand concerning black and white issues at that time 1 
great software for motorolas 1 
ordered burger rare came in well done 0 
this product is great it makes working a lot easier i can go to the copier while waiting on hold for something 1 
its not hard to make a decent hamburger 0 
as always the evening was wonderful and the food delicious 1 
clever and a real crowdpleaserthis film still ranks among mickeys best films even after 80 wonderful years 1 
the results well are a shame 0 
buyer beware you could flush money right down the toilet 0 
as a sushi lover avoid this place by all means 0 
the story is also both funny and poignant at times 1 
the cast is always entertaining as usual 1 
we waited for forty five minutes in vain 0 
also the story and acting were weak 0 
very disappointing 0 
i promise they wont disappoint 1 
but above all the exquisite visual composition of each moment with inventive and elegant use of closeup camera angle and lighting including pointillistic faux home movie footage is a wonder and joy to behold 1 
nothing special 0 
a very charming film with wonderful sentiment and heart 1 
i would recommend saving room for this 1 
first of all there are enough racial stereotypes and racial jokes to offend everyone 0 
having to humour him just to get by and get through the day was so apt 1 
an hour and a half i wish i could bring back 0 
it makes very strange ticking noises before it ends the call 0 
it was so funny 1 
the handsfree part works fine but then the car tries to download the address book and the treo rebootsoverall i still rate this device high 1 
i ate there twice on my last visit and especially enjoyed the salmon salad 1 
despite the pans of reviewers i liked this movie 1 
it is very educational for children 1 to 8 years old 1 
that movie was bad 0 
if you plan to use this in a car forget about it 0 
i dont know exactly what it is about this movie but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our familys memories 1 
i thought errol flynn was brilliant as custer and has since become my favourite actor 1 
this pair of headphones is the worst that i have ever had soundwise 0 
excellent sound battery life and inconspicuous to boot 1 
i can barely ever hear on it and am constantly saying what 0 
my breakfast was perpared great with a beautiful presentation of 3 giant slices of toast lightly dusted with powdered sugar 1 
even when the women finally show up there is no sign of improvement the most expected things happen and by the time the film is over you might be far asleep 0 
works fine 1 
i received my headset in good time and was happy with it 1 
they could serve it with just the vinaigrette and it may make for a better overall dish but it was still very good 1 
secondly hitchcock pretty much perfected the thriller and chase movie 1 
i gave it 5 stars then and im giving it 5 stars now 1 
lightweight and works well 1 
the restaurant is very clean and has a family restaurant feel to it 1 
works great 1 
this movie is bad 0 
i like armand assante my cable companys summary sounded interesting so i watched it twice already and probably will again 1 
i hate those things as much as cheap quality black olives 0 
earbud piece breaks easily 0 
seriously its not worth wasting your or your kids time on 0 
the steak was amazingrge fillet relleno was the best seafood plate i have ever had 1 
saggy floppy piece of junk 0 
i recommend igo to anyone with different brand cell phonesmp3 players in the family 1 
great earpiece 1 
the jabra eargels fit my ears very well 1 
and it was boring 0 
110 and only because there is no setting for 010 0 
worked very well paired with a treo 700w and as a skype headset on my pc using a usb bluetooth transceiver 1 
the plot has more holes than a pair of fishnet stockings and the direction and editing is astonishingly ham fisted 0 
i really dont see how anyone could enjoy this movie 0 
as i said abovepretty useless 0 
we are so glad we found this place 1 
i thought errol flynn was brilliant as custer and has since become my favourite actor 1 
the text messaging feature is really tricky to use 0 
your brain will attempt to shutdown as part of a primal impulse of selfpreservation 0 
this game rocks 1 
thats how id describe this painfully dreary timewaster of a film 0 
and the red curry had so much bamboo shoots and wasnt very tasty to me 0 
a film not easily forgotten 1 
i did not have any problem with this item and would order it again if needed 1 
it is practically useless and did not add any kind of boost to my reception after i bought it 0 
the battery is unreliable as well as the service use antena 0 
the film is well paced understated and one of the best courtroom documentaries ive seen 1 
dont buy this product 0 
point your finger at any item on the menu order it and you wont be disappointed 1 
the awful dialogue and hopeless overacting by everyone who gets shot top off a real waste of space and time 0 
a film not easily forgotten 1 
the movie in movie situations in the beginning and through the game that is played with her by the acting coach are fascinating 1 
the seller is very understanding and patient i would definitely buy from them again 1 
the selection was probably the worst ive seen in vegasthere was none 0 
excellent product for the price 1 
simply beautiful 1 
battery is terrible 0 
it is easy to turn on and off when you are in the car and the volume controls are quite accessable 1 
excellent hands free tool 1 
you need two hands to operate the screenthis software interface is decade old and cannot compete with new software designs 0 
its kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly its embarrassing how childlike the company is 0 
very friendly staff 1 
for readers who have already seen one of miyazakis films he is still in top form and made another worthwhile experience 1 
so anyone near you will hear part of your conversation 0 
host staff were for lack of a better word bitches 0 
reception is terrible and full of static 0 
better than expected 1 
what is even more stupid is that who had thought an idea that there should be a volcano in los angeles 0 
i highly recommend this modest priced cellular phone 1 
love this phone 1 
the loudspeaker option is great the bumpers with the lights is very appealing 0 
itll be a regular stop on my trips to phoenix 1 
highly recommended a 1 
the color is even prettier than i thought it would be and the graphics are incredibly sharp 1 
i have 23 bars on my cell phone when i am home but you cant not hear anything 0 
the cow tongue and cheek tacos are amazing 1 
i mean really how do you get so famous for your fish and chips when its so terrible 0 
at no point in the proceedings does it look remotely like america 0 
headset works great was packaged nicely to avoid any damage 1 
in short dont bother with this movie 0 
very serious spoilers this movie was a huge disappointment 0 
nice leather 1 
eew this location needs a complete overhaul 0 
dont buy this product it fails 0 
someone shouldve invented this sooner 1 
the food came out at a good pace 1 
not sure who was more lost the flat characters or the audience nearly half of whom walked out 0 
i am pairing this with my iphone and i could not be happier with it so far 1 
it was a very superficial movie and it gave me the feeling that i was watching play rather than a film 0 
great price also 1 
this was like the final blow 0 
my brother in law who works at the mall ate here same day and guess what he was sick all night too 0 
but the service was beyond bad 0 
food is way overpriced and portions are fucking small 0 
this film tries to be a serious and sophisticated thrillerhorror flick and it fails miserably 0 
all it took was one drop from about 6 inches above the kitchen counter and it was crackedi am not impressed and i am not laughing 0 
the staff are also very friendly and efficient 1 
dont waste your money 0 
aailiyah was pretty good as akasha in places compelling her first entrance and mini dance scene 1 
terrible management 0 
gets a signal when other verizon phones wont 1 
i enjoyed it 1 
i would have given no star if i was able 0 
the acting helps the writing along very well maybe the idiotsavant sister could have been played better and it is a real joy to watch 1 
lame would be the best way to describe it 0 
special thanks to dylan t for the recommendation on what to order all yummy for my tummy 1 
food is way overpriced and portions are fucking small 0 
bad purchase 0 
this is the kind of money that is wasted properly 1 
some may say this buffet is pricey but i think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot 1 
it looks very nice 1 
i can assure you that you wont be disappointed 1 
what a waste 0
