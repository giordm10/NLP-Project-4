the nachos are a must have 1 
and i just love the colors 1 
i wont spoil it but the ending in pretty amazing 1 
both do good jobs and are quite amusing 1 
the story which was told so eloquently by francis ford coppola 25 years earlier really unfolds gradually and leaves room for the characters to develop 1 
using all earpieces left or right this thing will not stay on my ear 0 
verizons bills however are difficult to understand even though their pricing plans are simple 0 
people couldnt hear me talk and i had to pull out the earphone and talk on the phone 0 
was not happy 0 
food was so gooodd 1 
i had a pretty satifying experience 1 
and sometimes it was so embarrassing that i had to look away 0 
it only recognizes the phone as its storage device 0 
all i have to say is the food was amazing 1 
i kept looking at the time and it had soon become 35 minutes yet still no food 0 
the 12 mega pixel camera being a part of a phone is reasonably good7 1 
this one is simply a disappointment 0 
they could serve it with just the vinaigrette and it may make for a better overall dish but it was still very good 1 
tonight i had the elk filet specialand it sucked 0 
went in for happy hour great list of wines 1 
but even the talented carrell cant save this 0 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
this scene is very strong and unpleasant 0 
it was either too cold not enough flavor or just bad 0 
service is quick and friendly 1 
the battery runs down quickly 0 
the spaghetti is nothing special whatsoever 0 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
great price too 1 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
love this phone 1 
seller shipped quickly and much cheaper than the competitors 1 
thats how id describe this painfully dreary timewaster of a film 0 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
steamboat willie is an amazingly important film to our cinema history 1 
howeverthe riingtones are not the best and neither are the games 0 
if it were possible to give them zero stars theyd have it 0 
also the phone doesnt seem to accept anything except cbr mp3s preferably ripped by windows media player 0 
works for me 1 
for people who are first timers in film making i think they did an excellent job 1 
best tacos in town by far 1 
this if the first movie ive given a 10 to in years 1 
kind of flops around 0 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clich√©s to be admitted elsewhere 0 
lots of holes in the script 0 
in fact i liked it better than interview with a vampire and i liked this lestat stuart townsend better than cruises attempt 1 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
its like a bad two hour tv movie 0 
the holster that arrived did not match the photo in the ad 0 
doesnt work 0 
often the dialogue doesnt really follow from one line to another or fit the surroundings 0 
1010 1 
the service was extremely slow 0 
my mother and brother had to do thiswhen i saw robert ryan portraying this type of man it was a very good imitation of this type of individual and i was impressed 1 
nice ambiance 1 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
i am far from a sushi connoisseur but i can definitely tell the difference between good food and bad food and this was certainly bad food 0 
up there with the best of melville 1 
we ordered the duck rare and it was pink and tender on the inside with a nice char on the outside 1 
not good by any stretch of the imagination 0 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
muddy low quality sound and the casing around the wires insert was poorly super glued and slid off 0 
items stated as included from the description are not included 0 
this scene is very strong and unpleasant 0 
a fly was in my apple juice a fly 0 
i could care less the interior is just beautiful 1 
so anyone near you will hear part of your conversation 0 
i thought errol flynn was brilliant as custer and has since become my favourite actor 1 
not sure who was more lost the flat characters or the audience nearly half of whom walked out 0 
as an earlier review noted plug in this charger and nothing happens 0 
basically the service was very bad 0 
i am very happy 1 
what a waste 0 
which has more depth and character than the man underneath it 0 
very cheap plastic creaks like an old wooden floor 0 
i received my orders well within the shipping timeframe everything was in good working order and overall i am very excited to have this source 1 
the menu is always changing food quality is going down service is extremely slow 0 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
what a big waste of time 0 
would not go back 0 
the scripting of the subtle comedy is unmatched by any movie in recent years 1 
i give wirefly 1 stari will contact cingularatt and inform them of this practice 0 
bought mainly for the charger which broke soon after purchasing 0 
they are so cool 1 
my girlfriends veal was very bad 0 
its pretty easy 1 
this place deserves one star and 90 has to do with the food 0 
the movie is not completely perfect but titta di girolamo will stay with you for a long time after the vision of the movie 1 
fantastic food 1 
i was totally fascinated by the music the dancing everything 1 
i might have gotten a defect but i would not risk buying it again because of the built quality alone 0 
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0 
nice blanket of moz over top but i feel like this was done to cover up the subpar food 1 
if you do go see this movie bring a pillow or a girlfriendboyfriend to keep you occupied through out 0 
about ten minutes into this film i started having second thoughts 0 
the jerky camera movements were also annoying 0 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
both the hot sour the egg flower soups were absolutely 5 stars 1 
makes it easier to keep up with my bluetooth when im not wearing it 0 
the success of the film depends on the casting of sydney greenstreet as the alexander yardley character 1 
so anyone near you will hear part of your conversation 0 
the incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film 1 
they do not last forever but is not overly expensive to replaceeasy to operate and the sound is much better than others i have tried 1 
it was either too cold not enough flavor or just bad 0 
there are many continuity errors one other user commented on different cars in the garage joes glassesthe one that got to me the most was the fact joes facial hair configuration seemed to change from scene to scene 0 
pretty awesome place 1 
horrible 0 
there is a totally unnecessary trainroller coaster scene 0 
even the squibs look awful 0 
i love all the features and form factor 1 
nothing special 0 
all i can do is whine on the internet so here it goesthe more i use the thing the less i like it 0 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
i found a six inch long piece of wire in my salsa 0 
does not work 0 
he owns the film just as spacek owned coal miners daughter and quaid owned great balls of fire 1 
im very disappointed with my decision 0 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
the songs were the best and the muppets were so hilarious 1 
sweetest phone 1 
lot of holes in the plot theres nothing about how he became the emperor nothing about where he spend 20 years between his childhood and mature age 0 
saw the movie today and thought it was a good effort good messages for kids 1 
buyer beware you could flush money right down the toilet 0 
it looses connection to the phone even when it is within a couple feet between the two 0 
there was no chemistry between ben affleck and sandra bullock in this film and i couldnt understand why he would consider even leaving his wifetobe for this chick that he supposedly was knocked out by 0 
the cinematography is simply stunning to say the least and the fx are nothing if not stateoftheart 1 
i had a salad with the wings and some ice cream for dessert and left feeling quite satisfied 1 
i will come back here every time im in vegas 1 
you have to hold the phone at a particular angle for the other party to hear you clearly 0 
it felt like a very gripping intelligent stage play but without the overly theatrical feeling one actually gets from watching people on a stage which plays on everyones terror of a white lie escalating to monstrous consequences 1 
hell no will i go back 0 
i sat riveted to the tv screen 1 
it was probably dirt 0 
just dont know why they were so slow 0 
it has a great camera thats 2mp and the pics are nice and clear with great picture quality 1 
i keep watching it over and over 1 
i will never go back to this place and will never ever recommended this place to anyone 0 
we ordered the duck rare and it was pink and tender on the inside with a nice char on the outside 1 
this is definitely one of the better documentaries i have seen looking at family relationships and marriage 1 
great charger 1 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
battery has no life 0 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
we wont be returning 0 
to those who find this movie intelligent or even masterful i can only say its your intelligence and your imagination you obviously used to try and make some sense of this pitiful attempt its in our human nature to try and make sense of things 0 
i hate movies like that 0 
an excellent new restaurant by an experienced frenchman 1 
i had ordered a motorola data cable got a very well finished and working product 1 
i have had this phone for over a year now and i will tell you its not that great 0 
kind of hard to mess up a steak but they did 0 
i promise they wont disappoint 1 
the flat reenactments dont hold your attention because they are emotionally adrift and stagy 0 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
waited 2 hours never got either of our pizzas as many other around us who came in later did 0 
battery life is also great 1 
all things considered a job very well done 1 
only like 3 or 4 buildings used a couple of locations maybe poor hummh 0 
a cheap and cheerless heist movie with poor characterisation lots of underbite style stoic emoting think chow yun fat in a better tomorrow and some cheesy clich√©s thrown into an abandoned factory ready for a few poorly executed flying judo rolls a la john woo 0 
it is so small and you dont even realize that it is there after a while of getting used to it 1 
chinese forgeries abound 0 
in addition it feels amp looks as if the phone is all lightweight cheap plastic 0 
you learn a lot about the real inside emotions of people in this movie and a lot about the movie business itself 1 
i could barely stomach the meal but didnt complain because it was a business lunch 0 
w810i is just superb 1 
artless camerawork endlessly presents us with the ugliest setting imaginable ie 0 
i love this bluetooth 1 
the steak and the shrimp are in my opinion the best entrees at gc 1 
very easy to use 1 
tom wilkinson broke my heart at the end and everyone elses judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike 1 
utterly without merit on any level this is akin to torture 0 
its extremely slow and takes forever to do anything with it 0 
in a word it is embarrassing 0 
they could serve it with just the vinaigrette and it may make for a better overall dish but it was still very good 1 
i cannot make calls at certain places 0 
i totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is 1 
the buffet at bellagio was far from what i anticipated 0 
hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in 0 
but i dont like it 0 
hayao miyazakis latest and eighth film for studio ghibili gake no ue no ponyo ponyo on the cliff by the sea is a wonderfully fun and imaginative look at childhood 1 
i was disgusted because i was pretty sure that was human hair 0 
dont waste your money and time 0 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
the chains which im no fan of beat this place easily 0 
then the film just dropped the ball 0 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
i like steiners because its dark and it feels like a bar 1 
the cashier had no care what so ever on what i had to say it still ended up being wayyy overpriced 0 
a disappointment 0 
we were promptly greeted and seated 1 
the cinematographyif it can be called thatsucked 0 
if i take a picture the battery drops a bar and starts beeping letting me know its dieing 0 
this would not even be good as a made for tv flick 0 
the delivery was on time 1 
we got sitting fairly fast but ended up waiting 40 minutes just to place our order another 30 minutes before the food arrived 0 
that being said for a phone the camera is very nice many cool effects to play with and video is decent as well 1 
but she is still a bad actress repeating her robotic face moves in each of her pictures 0 
lordy the khao soi is a dish that is not to be missed for curry lovers 1 
it is light easy to use and has very clear reception and transmission 1 
during several different 2 minute calls i experienced 5 drops and it was in an area that had 5 bars 0 
avoid at all costs 0 
maybe there would be a reasonable explanation for this atrocity 0 
the spaghetti is nothing special whatsoever 0 
when i opened the sandwich i was impressed but not in a good way 0 
up there with the best of melville 1 
dont waste your money 0 
the food is not tasty at all not to say its real traditional hunan style 0 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
editing the editing of this film was phenomenal in my opinion 1 
would recommend this item 1 
but she is still a bad actress repeating her robotic face moves in each of her pictures 0 
the mic is great 1 
i left the theater with a lilt in my step joy in my heart and hope for the human race 1 
really really good rice all the time 1 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
i mean really how do you get so famous for your fish and chips when its so terrible 0 
anyways the food was definitely not filling at all and for the price you pay you should expect more 0 
the camera although rated at an impressive 13 megapixels renders images that fall well below expectations of such a relatively high resolution 0 
it quit working after id used it for about 18 months so i just purchased another one because this is the best headset ive ever owned 1 
its a shame to see good actors like thomerson and james make a living in a mess like this 0 
but despite these few flaws this case is of exceptional quality and well worth the additional costs of owning an official oem product 1 
i was bored throughout the whole damn thing 0 
the descriptions said yum yum sauce and another said eel sauce yet another said spicy mayowell none of the rolls had sauces on them 0 
both the hot sour the egg flower soups were absolutely 5 stars 1 
i dont think well be going back anytime soon 0 
the explosion of the gas tanks at the end was just as awful 0 
theres also enough hypocrisy in this film to make me vomit 0 
its the best headset i have used 1 
works well 1 
nice ambiance 1 
i had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get some relief 0 
yeah the movie pretty much sucked 0 
we recently witnessed her poor quality of management towards other guests as well 0 
ive had better not only from dedicated boba tea spots but even from jenni pho 0 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
i bought this battery with a coupon from amazon and im very happy with my purchase 1 
there was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth but it didnt really work into the rest of the plot 0 
doesnt work at all i bougth it for my l7c and its not working 0 
best of all is the rotating feature very helpful 1 
food was good service was good prices were good 1 
the movie lacks visual interest drama expression of feeling and celebration of the very patriotism that underlines the narrative 0 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
hackneyed writing certainly but made even worse by the bad directing 0 
i would advise to not purchase this item it never worked very well 0 
you wont regret it 1 
this is my new fav vegas buffet spot 1 
delicious nyc bagels good selections of cream cheese real lox with capers even 1 
long whiny and pointless 0 
great food and service huge portions and they give a military discount 1 
this isnt a small family restaurant this is a fine dining establishment 1 
love this product 1 
low quality 0 
ill definitely be in soon again 1 
definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly will return next time im in vegas 1 
i contacted the company and they told me that although the unit was still under warranty if i couldnt produce my receipt i was out of luck 0 
excellent 1 
last time buying from you 0 
still i do like this movie for its empowerment of women theres not enough movies out there like this one 1 
and if that isnt enough of a mess of a movie for you the picture is also marred with a constant use of studio sets and indoor exteriors 0 
yes this film does require a rather significant amount of puzzlesolving but the pieces fit together to create a beautiful picture 1 
i enjoyed reading this book to my children when they were little 1 
after all the rave reviews i couldnt wait to eat herewhat a disappointment 0 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
raw and sublimely moving 1 
the cocktails are all handmade and delicious 1 
as for the service im a fan because its quick and youre being served by some nice folks 1 
im so happy to be here 1 
finally after three or four times the spring of the latch broke and i could not use it any longer on the visor 0 
i dressed up to be treated so rudely 0 
price is good too 1 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
awesome selection of beer 1 
id say that would be the hardest decision honestly all of ms dishes taste how they are supposed to taste amazing 1 
overall the film is interesting and thoughtprovoking 1 
overall i rate this movie a 10 out of a 110 scale 1 
he owns the film just as spacek owned coal miners daughter and quaid owned great balls of fire 1 
id advise anyone to go and see it 1 
this game rocks 1 
the cast is good 1 
a very good film indeed about great and unconditional love 1 
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 
i will come back here every time im in vegas 1 
its fits like a glove and is strong secure and durable 1 
im glad i found this product on amazon it is hard to find it wasnt high priced 1 
the chicken i got was definitely reheated and was only ok the wedges were cold and soggy 0 
id say that would be the hardest decision honestly all of ms dishes taste how they are supposed to taste amazing 1 
the only downside is the service 0 
great phone 1 
not good for the money 0 
this item is great installed it let it charged up overnite and it has been working good every since with no problems 1 
generally it just lacked imagination 0 
gets the job done 1 
what a waste of money and time 0 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
im still trying to get over how bad it was 0 
the chips and salsa were really good the salsa was very fresh 1 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
i gave it 5 stars because of the sound quality 1 
i recently tried caballeros and i have been back every week since 1 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
highly entertaining at all angles 1 
nice spicy and tender 1 
nice solid keyboard 1 
not much seafood and like 5 strings of pasta at the bottom 0 
i couldnt think of a better way to end the film but a smile on my face great way to wrap up an amazing film and trilogy 1 
but when i check voice mail at night the keypad backlight turns off a few seconds into the first message and then im lost 0 
will never ever go back 0 
i left the theater with a lilt in my step joy in my heart and hope for the human race 1 
the movie in movie situations in the beginning and through the game that is played with her by the acting coach are fascinating 1 
does everything it should and more 1 
good servicecheck 1 
maybe its just their vegetarian fare but ive been twice and i thought it was average at best 0 
the nano stated itmy son was dissapointed 0 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
an instant classic with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits 1 
i received my headset in good time and was happy with it 1 
we walked away stuffed and happy about our first vegas buffet experience 1 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
the film has great actors a master director a significant themeat least a wouldbe significant theme undertone of fifties existential worldweariness aerial scenes that ought to have thrilled both senses and imagination and characters about which one might deeply care 1 
our server was super nice and checked on us many times 1 
this item is fantastic and works perfectly 1 
the potatoes were like rubber and you could tell they had been made up ahead of time being kept under a warmer 0 
if you look for authentic thai food go else where 0 
oh yeah and the storyline was pathetic too 0 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
i believe the screenwriter did a good job of tying up the loose ends 1 
i could barely stomach the meal but didnt complain because it was a business lunch 0 
this movie does an excellent job of revealing the complexity of the task and the incredible challenges facing south africa 1 
i was not happy with this item 0 
very bad experience 0 
spoilers whatever else can or cant be said about it surface is superbly crafted 1 
insults profound deuchebaggery and had to go outside for a smoke break while serving just to solidify it 0 
what should have been a hilarious yummy christmas eve dinner to remember was the biggest fail of the entire trip for us 0 
they have been around for years and carries the highest quality of antiglare screen protector that i have found to date 1 
the menu is always changing food quality is going down service is extremely slow 0 
this does not fit the palm tungsten e2 and it broke the first time i tried to plug it in 0 
there was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters 0 
i loved it 1 
fast service 1 
all the bread is made inhouse 1 
i checked everywhere and there is no feature for it which is really disappointing 0 
oh and i forgot to also mention the weird color effect it has on your phone 0 
he is almost unbearable to watch on screen he has little to no charisma and terrible comedic timing 0 
i have had problems wit hit dropping signal and more 0 
there is no plot or storyline 0 
i hope this place sticks around 1 
worthless product 0 
some highlights great quality nigiri here 1 
this one wants to surf on the small wave of space movies in 1998 deep impact and armageddon and this one fails everywhere 0 
i took back my money and got outta there 0 
this movie has a cutting edge to it 1 
its also great to see that renowned silent screenwriter frances marion hasnt missed a step going from silent to sound 1 
the igo chargers and tips are really great 1 
excellent hands free tool 1 
i highly recommend this movie for anyone interested in art poetry theater politics or japanese history 1 
much less than the jawbone i was going to replace it with 1 
one thing i hate is the mode set button at the side 0 
i know this is not like the other restaurants at all something is very off here 0 
the burger is good beef cooked just right 1 
easy to use 1 
excellent product for the price 1 
this fixes all the problems 1 
shes poised and amazing 1 
not even good for camp value 0 
it only recognizes the phone as its storage device 0 
i bought this to use with my kindle fire and absolutely loved it 1 
this gets a 1 out of 10 simply because theres nothing lower 0 
i have 23 bars on my cell phone when i am home but you cant not hear anything 0 
great price also 1 
the films dialogue is natural real to life 1 
will never ever go back 0 
nice blanket of moz over top but i feel like this was done to cover up the subpar food 1 
saggy floppy piece of junk 0 
this is a great place to eat 1 
it is very comfortable to wear as well which is probably the most important aspect about using a case 1 
artless camerawork endlessly presents us with the ugliest setting imaginable ie 0 
some applause should be given to the prelude however 1 
this is a great little item 1 
very good though 1 
not even good for camp value 0 
cinematography noteworthy including fine views of barcelona and its famed gaudi towers 1 
hayao miyazakis latest and eighth film for studio ghibili gake no ue no ponyo ponyo on the cliff by the sea is a wonderfully fun and imaginative look at childhood 1 
cant upload ringtones from a third party 0 
how can that bethe audio quality is poor 0 
the classic maine lobster roll was fantastic 1 
very happy with this product 1 
both great 1 
it is the best charger i have seen on the market yet 1 
its very slow 0 
good item low price 1 
it also took her forever to bring us the check when we asked for it 0 
it only recognizes the phone as its storage device 0 
this greedy corporation will never see another dime from me 0 
there were too many close ups 0 
my headset works just peachykeen 1 
nice headset priced right 1 
excellent product for the price 1 
but it picked up speed and got right to the point 1 
we arent ones to make a scene at restaurants but i just dont get itdefinitely lost the love after this one 0 
the cinematographyif it can be called thatsucked 0 
damian is so talented and versatile in so many ways of writing and portraying different characters on screen 1 
i wish i could enter negative values admins 0 
service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is vegas and located inside the crystals shopping mall by aria 1 
either way it sucks 0 
its uncomfortable and the sound quality is quite poor compared with the phone razr or with my previous wired headset that plugged into an lg 0 
also makes it easier to hold on to 1 
overall i like there food and the service 1 
over rated 0 
great pocket pc phone combination 1 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
really pleased with this product so far 1 
blue ant is easy to use 1 
setup went very smoothly 1 
makes it easier to keep up with my bluetooth when im not wearing it 0 
the very idea of it was lame take a minor character from a mediocre pg13 film and make a complete nonsequel while changing its tone to a pgrated family movie 0 
would not go back 0 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
its very slow 0 
in other words the content level of this film is enough to easily fill a dozen other films 1 
frankly after cotton club and unfaithful it was kind of embarrassing to watch lane and gere in this film because it is bad 0 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
the ambiance was incredible 1 
despite the pans of reviewers i liked this movie 1 
first of all there are enough racial stereotypes and racial jokes to offend everyone 0 
there was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters 0 
we sat another ten minutes and finally gave up and left 0 
i think not again 0 
im not really sure how joeys was voted best hot dog in the valley by readers of phoenix magazine 0 
id love to go back 1 
this is definitely a cult classic well worth viewing and sharing with others 1 
krussel always good 1 
however i recently watched the whole thing again on dvd and i was completely struck by how extremely stupid the storyline was how it contained holes inconsistencies and frankly a whole lot of crap and how horrid the dancing was 0 
i go to far too many places and ive never seen any restaurant that serves a 1 egg breakfast especially for 400 0 
the turkey and roast beef were bland 0 
it is a joy to use 1 
an interesting premise and billy drago is always good as a dangerous nutbag side note id love to see drago stephen mchattie and lance hendrikson in a flick together talk about raging cheekbones 1 
i am very impressed with the job that motorola did on the sturdiness of this phone 1 
this is a disgrace 0 
but storm trooper is not even bad enough to make it to the list of wonderfully terrible movies 0 
there is a brilliant twist ending 1 
youll love it 1 
this was one of the worst films i have ever seen 0 
the results well are a shame 0 
i hate writing bad reviews about films especially those in which i really like the star but this film is so bad i dont believe for one second that anyone could have been proud of it 0 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
the best electronics of the available fm transmitters 1 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
after a year the battery went completely dead on my headset 0 
good product good seller 1 
a truly truly bad film 0 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
level 5 spicy was perfect where spice didnt overwhelm the soup 1 
i was sitting in my vehicle with the cradle on my belt and the headset lost signal 0 
terrible my car will not accept this cassette 0 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
the film has an ultracheap look to it 0 
after the disappointing dinner we went elsewhere for dessert 0 
service is friendly and inviting 1 
we watched our waiter pay a lot more attention to other tables and ignore us 0 
this place is good 1 
the delivery was on time 1 
after the disappointing dinner we went elsewhere for dessert 0 
and i really did find them funny 1 
at around 4 pm i bought it at around 8pm i started to watch at around 815pm i fast forwarded the remaining film to see if there was anything left watchable for a human being with a brain but there wasnt 0 
the potatoes were great and so was the biscuit 1 
will definitely be back 1 
the pairing of the two devices was so easy it barely took a couple minutes before i started making calls with the voice dialing feature 1 
ive bought 5 wired headphones that sound better than these 0 
also its a real treat to see anthony quinn playing crazy horse 1 
the jabra eargels fit my ears very well 1 
only like 3 or 4 buildings used a couple of locations maybe poor hummh 0 
awsome device works great 1 
i wouldnt return 0 
good product incredible value 1 
worst foodservice ive had in a while 0 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
one of the most disappointing aspects is the lack of notable gore 0 
this is a disgrace 0 
one of the most disappointing aspects is the lack of notable gore 0 
it didnt charge for me 0 
for readers who have already seen one of miyazakis films he is still in top form and made another worthwhile experience 1 
the movie seemed a little slow at first 0 
however i recently watched the whole thing again on dvd and i was completely struck by how extremely stupid the storyline was how it contained holes inconsistencies and frankly a whole lot of crap and how horrid the dancing was 0 
the only consistent thread holding the series together were the amazing performances of leni parker and anita laselva as the two taelons in quiet idealogical conflict 0 
this mostly routine factbased tv drama gets a boost from the fine performance by cole 1 
this is my new fav vegas buffet spot 1 
i only hear garbage for audio 0 
i was able to do voice dialing in the car with no problem 1 
not even a hello we will be right with you 0 
yes its shiny on front side and i love it 1 
the range is very decent ive been able to roam around my house with the phone in the living room with no receptionsound quality issues 1 
its practically perfect in all of them ¬ñ a true masterpiece in a sea of faux masterpieces 1 
i did not bother contacting the company for few dollar product but i learned the lesson that i should not have bought this form online anyway 0 
it was a pale color instead of nice and char and has no flavor 0 
the awful dialogue and hopeless overacting by everyone who gets shot top off a real waste of space and time 0 
the mic is great 1 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
this film offers many delights and surprises 1 
clear skype calls long battery life long range 1 
it has a great camera thats 2mp and the pics are nice and clear with great picture quality 1 
also the fries are without a doubt the worst fries ive ever had 0 
last night was my second time dining here and i was so happy i decided to go back 1 
the acting is beyond abysmal 0 
they dropped more than the ball 0 
they do not last forever but is not overly expensive to replaceeasy to operate and the sound is much better than others i have tried 1 
much less than the jawbone i was going to replace it with 1 
i enjoyed it 1 
also if your phone is dropped this case is not going to save it specially when dropped face down 0 
the worst experience ever 0 
the budget was evidently very limited 0 
dont buy this product 0 
my side greek salad with the greek dressing was so tasty and the pita and hummus was very refreshing 1 
this was my first and only vegas buffet and it did not disappoint 1 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
both of the egg rolls were fantastic 1 
i think not again 0 
buttons are too small 0 
they made this case too small and is very difficult to install 0 
have been going since 2007 and every meal has been awesome 1 
waste your money on this game 1 
no additional ear gels provided and no instructions whatsoever 0 
very easy to use 1 
an interesting premise and billy drago is always good as a dangerous nutbag side note id love to see drago stephen mchattie and lance hendrikson in a flick together talk about raging cheekbones 1 
its this pandering to the audience that sabotages most of his films 0 
the food is rich so order accordingly 1 
the films dialogue is natural real to life 1 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
as an earlier review noted plug in this charger and nothing happens 0 
the story is lame not interesting and never really explains the sinister origins of the puppets 0 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
reasonably priced also 1 
the first time i ever came here i had an amazing experience i still tell people how awesome the duck was 1 
we loved the biscuits 1 
also the area where my unit broke im not too fond of the magnetic strap 0 
i dont have to be an accountant to know im getting screwed 0 
product is exactly as described 1 
ive had better not only from dedicated boba tea spots but even from jenni pho 0 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
all the characters in this film are tremendously well played 1 
i love this bluetooth 1 
i really dont see how anyone could enjoy this movie 0 
this review is long overdue since i consider a tale of two sisters to be the single greatest film ever made 1 
always a great time at dos gringos 1 
i am very happy 1 
anyways the food was definitely not filling at all and for the price you pay you should expect more 0 
o my gosh the best phone i have ever had 1 
an interesting premise and billy drago is always good as a dangerous nutbag side note id love to see drago stephen mchattie and lance hendrikson in a flick together talk about raging cheekbones 1 
great it was new packaged nice works good no problems and it came in less time then i expected 1 
it is the best charger i have seen on the market yet 1 
i would definitely recommend the jabra bt250v for those who are looking for comfort clarity and a great price 1 
the service was terrible though 0 
our server was super nice and checked on us many times 1 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
i love their fries and their beans 1 
im surprised this is a good quality car charger and theres not much reviews about it 1 
total letdown i would much rather just go to the camelback flower shop and cartel coffee 0 
if you have several dozen or several hundred contacts then imagine the fun of sending each of them one by one 0 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
it was so funny 1 
food was great and so was the serivce 1 
i live in the neighborhood so i am disappointed i wont be back here because it is a convenient location 0 
we ordered some old classics and some new dishes after going there a few times and were sorely disappointed with everything 0 
adapter does not provide enough charging current 0 
nice case feels good in your hands 1 
but what really made it unwatchable was the direction 0 
this short film certainly pulls no punches 0 
you cant relate with them hell you barely can understand them 0 
this was my first time and i cant wait until the next 1 
nice ambiance 1 
this was one of the worst films i have ever seen 0 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
sorry i will not be getting food from here anytime soon 0 
the jerky camera movements were also annoying 0 
very prompt service 1 
this particular model would not work with my motorola q smartphone 0 
dont waste your time here 0 
they have great dinners 1 
it wasnt busy either also the building was freezing cold 0 
i really hope the team behind this movie makes more movies and that they will continue to do so in their own some kinda weird style 1 
this is a masterful piece of filmmaking with many themes simmering and occasionally boiling over in this warts and all study of the poets bohemian selfindulgent wartime years that span the aerial bombardments of london and the outward tranquillity of a welsh coastal retreat the borderlines between friendship lust and love dedication to art and experience versus practical concerns jealousy rivalry cowardice and egotism versus heroism and selfsacrifice and more 1 
works great 1 
it plays louder than any other speaker of this size the price is so low that most would think the quality is lacking however its not 1 
but when someone strives for greatness and poetry but delivers a muddled and often ridiculous story a bunch of disparate scenes pretentious dialogue then you get the worst kind of a movie that some other reviewer very accurately defined as pretentious crap 0 
it was just not a fun experience 1 
it is an excellent drama an excellent thriller and an excellent film 1 
it did not work in my cell phone plug i am very up set with the charger 0 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
i did not expect this to be so good 1 
if it was to turn my good day feeling into a night of disturbing memories than i guess he succeeded 0 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
i seriously cannot believe that the owner has so many unexperienced employees that all are running around like chickens with their heads cut off 0 
my only problem is i thought the actor playing the villain was a low rent michael ironside 0 
it is not good 0 
i have 23 bars on my cell phone when i am home but you cant not hear anything 0 
dont waste your money 0 
restaurant is always full but never a wait 1 
food was great and so was the serivce 1 
stay away from this store be careful 0 
i also didnt like the on button it felt like it would crack with use 0 
bad script bad direction and horrible acting make this one plain bad 0 
you need at least 3 mins to get to your phone book from the time you first turn on the phonebattery life is short 0 
my 5year old nokia 2160 from tracfone holds the charge a lot better than this 0 
great food and great service in a clean and friendly setting 1 
the live music on fridays totally blows 0 
i own a jabra earset and was very happy with it but the sound quality especially outgoing on this is better 1 
brilliance indeed 1 
i must say i have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again 1 
terrible my car will not accept this cassette 0 
the good cinematography also makes her and monica bellucci look very beautiful 1 
and i just love the colors 1 
disappointed 0 
the acting is beyond abysmal 0 
i wont be back 0 
we were promptly greeted and seated 1 
it works fine on my motorola 325 cellphone and a lot better than the wornout battery did 1 
battery is terrible 0 
i dont think well be going back anytime soon 0 
but despite these few flaws this case is of exceptional quality and well worth the additional costs of owning an official oem product 1 
good transmit audio 1 
tonight i had the elk filet specialand it sucked 0 
not even good for camp value 0 
i guess i liked the details of his dysfunctionhe was believable 1 
this place is way too overpriced for mediocre food 0 
it fits my ear well and is comfortable on 1 
but it is great i would really recommend it 1 
its a great tool for entertainment communication and data managementoh be sure to use activesync 42 for optimal data synchronization results 1 
there is no plot here to keep you going in the first place 0 
all it took was one drop from about 6 inches above the kitchen counter and it was crackedi am not impressed and i am not laughing 0 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
the worst piece of crap ever along with the verizon customer service 0 
the film succeeds despite or perhaps because of an obviously meagre budget 1 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
its just lame 0 
great food and great service in a clean and friendly setting 1 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
we have tried 2 units and they both failed within 2 months pros 0 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
i have bought this nokia cell phone a few weeks ago and it was a nightmare 0 
highly recommend for any one who has a blue tooth phone 1 
much better than the other ayce sushi place i went to in vegas 1 
the music in the film is really nice too 1 
crust is not good 0 
perhaps i caught them on an off night judging by the other reviews but im not inspired to go back 0 
your brain will attempt to shutdown as part of a primal impulse of selfpreservation 0 
new battery works great in phone 1
