as for the service i thought it was good 1 
omelets are to die for 1 
unfortunately this is a bad movie that is just plain bad 0 
this is a great product sure beats using your fingers 1 
the presentation of the food was awful 0 
great product and price 1 
the cg opening sequence in space looked like it could have been created on microsoft slideshow for gods sake 0 
lots of holes in the script 0 
when i received my pita it was huge it did have a lot of meat in it so thumbs up there 1 
i cant see how this movie can be an inspiration to anyone to come out or overcome fear and rejection 0 
worth every penny 1 
this is a great deal 1 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
i totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is 1 
no plot whatsoever 0 
not good by any stretch of the imagination 0 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
this movie creates its own universe and is fascinating in every way 1 
i am so tired of clich√©s that is just lazy writing and here they come in thick and fast 0 
ive had no trouble accessing the internet downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions 1 
full of unconvincing cardboard characters it is blandly written by edward chodorov who also produced and is surprisingly directed by jean negulesco from whom one would expect a great deal more 0 
host staff were for lack of a better word bitches 0 
great food and great service in a clean and friendly setting 1 
the bipolarity of the ruthless thug one minute a ruthless killer the next minute a luvs diaper commercial is completely unconvincing 0 
not only did the software do a great job of this i could also make my own ringtones form my existing cds without an internet connection 1 
not too screamy not to masculine but just right 1 
1 long lasting battery you dont have to recharge it as frequentyly as some of the flip phones2 0 
good show samsung 1 
i wish i could enter negative values admins 0 
bad reception 0 
as i said abovepretty useless 0 
i bought this to use with my kindle fire and absolutely loved it 1 
the acting is beyond abysmal 0 
the battery is unreliable as well as the service use antena 0 
this isnt a small family restaurant this is a fine dining establishment 1 
if good intentions made a film great then this film might be one of the greatest films ever made 1 
lovely little thriller from hitchcock with lots of nice shenanigans surrounding a murdered spy a kidnapped child a nasty church a foreign plot and some random taxidermists 1 
great price also 1 
an excellent new restaurant by an experienced frenchman 1 
there are many continuity errors one other user commented on different cars in the garage joes glassesthe one that got to me the most was the fact joes facial hair configuration seemed to change from scene to scene 0 
the only thing that i think could improve is the sound leaks out from the headset 0 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
still its quite interesting and entertaining to follow 1 
reasonably priced also 1 
then i watched it again two sundays ago march 20th 2005 and i began to really enjoy it and this time i taped the entire thing 1 
if you want a real scare rent this one 1 
the movie is full of wonderful dancing hence the title 1 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
once you get inside youll be impressed with the place 1 
the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach 0 
small sleek impressive looking practical setup with ample storage in place 1 
i gave it 5 stars then and im giving it 5 stars now 1 
i was hoping for more 0 
nothing special 0 
i received it quickly and it works great 1 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
every element of this story was so over the top excessively phony and contrived that it was painful to sit through 0 
the food was delicious our bartender was attentive and personable and we got a great deal 1 
everything on the menu is terrific and we were also thrilled that they made amazing accommodations for our vegetarian daughter 1 
the seller is very understanding and patient i would definitely buy from them again 1 
his costars dont fare much better with people like morgan freeman jonah hill and ed helms just wasted 0 
great food 1 
i wont be back 0 
pretty cool i would say 1 
this movie totally grates on my nerves 0 
echo problemvery unsatisfactory 0 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
last time buying from you 0 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
i couldnt think of a better way to end the film but a smile on my face great way to wrap up an amazing film and trilogy 1 
love the margaritas too 1 
when i received my pita it was huge it did have a lot of meat in it so thumbs up there 1 
hell no will i go back 0 
i highly recommend this device to everyone 1 
i let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this bad idea we both hated it 0 
and if that isnt enough of a mess of a movie for you the picture is also marred with a constant use of studio sets and indoor exteriors 0 
tasted like dirt 0 
now this is a movie i really dislike 0 
battery chargelife is quite long 1 
the jamaican mojitos are delicious 1 
good beer drink selection and good food selection 1 
it has kept up very well 1 
but even the talented carrell cant save this 0 
im surprised this is a good quality car charger and theres not much reviews about it 1 
i purchased this and within 2 days it was no longer working 0 
i highly recommend this movie for anyone interested in art poetry theater politics or japanese history 1 
setup couldnt have been simpler 1 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
funny clever hip just like prays previous film hype 1 
do not buy for d807wrongly advertised for d807 0 
my friend did not like his bloody mary 0 
i swung in to give them a try but was deeply disappointed 0 
soyo technology sucks 0 
when im on this side of town this will definitely be a spot ill hit up again 1 
this is cool because most cases are just open there allowing the screen to get all scratched up 1 
so flavorful and has just the perfect amount of heat 1 
sooooo good 1 
i saw this film over christmas and what a great film it was 1 
the staff is great the food is delish and they have an incredible beer selection 1 
just whatever you do avoid groove as its the antithesis of all that is good about human traffic 0 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
a greasy unhealthy meal 0 
the chips that came out were dripping with grease and mostly not edible 0 
very very sad 0 
you cant go wrong with any of the food here 1 
i got the aluminum case for my new palm vx and it worked really wellit has protected my handheld perfectly so far 1 
this if the first movie ive given a 10 to in years 1 
about half way through this film i started to dislike it 0 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
in short dont bother with this movie 0 
fast service 1 
in fact i liked it better than interview with a vampire and i liked this lestat stuart townsend better than cruises attempt 1 
john garfield ann revere lilli plmer william conrad canada leeand filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screenjames wong howe 1 
not much seafood and like 5 strings of pasta at the bottom 0 
highly recommend for any one who has a blue tooth phone 1 
the chicken i got was definitely reheated and was only ok the wedges were cold and soggy 0 
i find wasting food to be despicable but this just wasnt food 0 
i contacted the company and they told me that although the unit was still under warranty if i couldnt produce my receipt i was out of luck 0 
not too screamy not to masculine but just right 1 
easily none other cartoon made me laugh in a tender way before getting into dark sitcoms oriented for teenagers 1 
highly recommended for all ages although the younger set will probably not appreciate some of the more subtle references they will certainly appreciate one galley scene in particular 1 
this film highlights the fundamental flaws of the legal process that its not about discovering guilt or innocence but rather is about who presents better in court 1 
i let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this bad idea we both hated it 0 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
superb phone on a great network 1 
if you plan to use this in a car forget about it 0 
it is so small and you dont even realize that it is there after a while of getting used to it 1 
and i really did find them funny 1 
magical help 1 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
it works 1 
it dit not work most of the time with my nokia 5320 0 
when i saw it in the theater i thought i was going to be sick 0 
the plot doesnt hang together at all and the acting is absolutely appalling 0 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
it was a riot to see hugo weaving play a sexobsessed gay real estate salesman who uses his clients houses for his trysts with the flaming darren tom hollander 1 
i did not expect this to be so good 1 
very disappointed 0 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
poor quality and service 0 
weird vibe from owners 0 
no ear loop needed its tiny and the sound is great 1 
its still wild stuff though and is highly recommended to fans of giallo cinema 1 
seriously its not worth wasting your or your kids time on 0 
the service was terrible though 0 
and those baby owls were adorable 1 
this place is pretty good nice little vibe in the restaurant 1 
the plastic breaks really easy on this clip 0 
prosgood camera very nice pictures also has cool styles like black and white and more 1 
please dont waste your money 0 
i great reception all the time 1 
but whatever it was that cost them so much it didnt translate to quality thats for sure 0 
the nachos are a must have 1 
the fried rice was dry as well 0 
i would have given no star if i was able 0 
steamboat willie is an amazingly important film to our cinema history 1 
i love this device 1 
also were served hot bread and butter and home made potato chips with bacon bits on topvery original and very good 1 
makes it easier to keep up with my bluetooth when im not wearing it 0 
this place should honestly be blown up 0 
better than new 1 
you get what you pay for i guess 0 
this is infuriating 0 
the only very disappointing thing was there was no speakerphone 0 
could not get strong enough signal 0 
this movie does an excellent job of revealing the complexity of the task and the incredible challenges facing south africa 1 
very happy with this product 1 
i felt as though her going to ireland did absolutely nothing whatsoever 0 
it has been a winner for us 1 
bela lugosi was totally extraneous intoning odd lines 0 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
having to humour him just to get by and get through the day was so apt 1 
the flat reenactments dont hold your attention because they are emotionally adrift and stagy 0 
but if you liked movies like the matrix and better yet their sequels i think youll appreciate the thought provoking mindblowing experience this film will give you 1 
victor mclaglen was even bad and brian donlevy was almost unrecognizable 0 
this is a bad film with bad writing and good actorsan ugly cartoon crafted by paul haggis for people who cant handle anything but the bold strokes in storytellinga picture painted with crayons 0 
i might have gotten a defect but i would not risk buying it again because of the built quality alone 0 
the battery works great 1 
it looked like a wonderful story 1 
it is well made easy to access the phone and has a handy detachable belt clip 1 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
good prices 1 
the only thing i did like was the prime rib and dessert section 1 
the bottowm lineanother worthless cheap gimmick from sprint 0 
it works fine on my motorola 325 cellphone and a lot better than the wornout battery did 1 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
the ngage is still lacking in earbuds 0 
great product for the price 1 
so far it has worked like a charm 1 
the lead man is charismafree 0 
i asked multiple times for the wine list and after some time of being ignored i went to the hostess and got one myself 0 
also its a real treat to see anthony quinn playing crazy horse 1 
lot of holes in the plot theres nothing about how he became the emperor nothing about where he spend 20 years between his childhood and mature age 0 
i put the latest os on it v115g and it now likes to slow to a crawl and lock up every once in a while 0 
im in az all the time and now have my new spot 1 
if she had not rolled the eyes we may have stayed not sure if we will go back and try it again 0 
does not fit 0 
those burgers were amazing 1 
i am very impressed with the job that motorola did on the sturdiness of this phone 1 
i wouldnt return 0 
really awful 0 
gotta love those closeups of slimy drooling teeth 1 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
waitress was sweet and funny 1 
my drink was never empty and he made some really great menu suggestions 1 
it looses connection to the phone even when it is within a couple feet between the two 0 
this movie is bad 0 
bad fit way too big 0 
i had the chicken pho and it tasted very bland 0 
the grilled chicken was so tender and yellow from the saffron seasoning 1 
this is a bad film with bad writing and good actorsan ugly cartoon crafted by paul haggis for people who cant handle anything but the bold strokes in storytellinga picture painted with crayons 0 
so dont go there if you are looking for good food 0 
he also came back to check on us regularly excellent service 1 
the food is very good for your typical bar food 1 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
excellent dualpurpose headset 1 
weve have gotten a much better service from the pizza place next door than the services we received from this restaurant 0 
star trek v the final frontier is the worst in the series 0 
the volume switch rocketed out of the unit to a destination unknown 0 
customer service was terrible 0 
they work about 2 weeks then break 0 
the telephone repair man was really funny and his reactions to the nuts and bitchy boss were truly genuine 1 
overall a great experience 1 
but this movie is definitely a below average rent 0 
it was a pale color instead of nice and char and has no flavor 0 
any ring toneoverall good phone to buy 1 
also the phone doesnt seem to accept anything except cbr mp3s preferably ripped by windows media player 0 
how can that bethe audio quality is poor 0 
i heart this place 1 
like the other reviewer said you couldnt pay me to eat at this place again 0 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
its a sad movie but very good 1 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
this one wants to surf on the small wave of space movies in 1998 deep impact and armageddon and this one fails everywhere 0 
however the keypads are so tinny that i sometimes reach the wrong buttons 0 
i saw this short film on hbo the other day and absolutely loved it 1 
worked very well paired with a treo 700w and as a skype headset on my pc using a usb bluetooth transceiver 1 
their daily specials are always a hit with my group 1 
i have been to very few places to eat that under no circumstances would i ever return to and this tops the list 0 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
50 down the drain 0 
everyone is very attentive providing excellent customer service 1 
it works 1 
very pleased with this headset 1 
lucy bell is so much higher than this crap and for her to sink this low is quite depressing 0 
youd have to have the iq of particularly stupid mollusk not to see that one coming 0 
what makes this story different are the terrific production values faultless photography composition and editing the terrific casting the underappreciated brian keith playing a bully teddy and vivid history 1 
i have read others reviews here but i havent had any problem with it 1 
you also cannot take pictures with it in the case because the lense is covered 0 
i just dont know how this place managed to served the blandest food i have ever eaten when they are preparing indian cuisine 0 
im still trying to get over how bad it was 0 
brilliance indeed 1 
what a waste 0 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
verizons bills however are difficult to understand even though their pricing plans are simple 0 
you get incredibly fresh fish prepared with care 1 
by this time our side of the restaurant was almost empty so there was no excuse 0 
just really good so far probably the best bt headset i have ever had 1 
a film not easily forgotten 1 
overall a great experience 1 
the selection of food was not the best 0 
1010 1 
the food amazing 1 
regrettably the film fails 0 
i enjoyed it 1 
her lines seem to have been written by a fifteen year old though they are trying oh so so hard to sound like how a fifteen year old would really um you know well talk 0 
glad i didnt pay to see it 0 
but despite these few flaws this case is of exceptional quality and well worth the additional costs of owning an official oem product 1 
in the summer you can dine in a charming outdoor patio so very delightful 1 
my salad had a bland vinegrette on the baby greens and hearts of palm 0 
after arguing with verizon regarding the dropped calls we returned the phones after two days 0 
it has a great camera thats 2mp and the pics are nice and clear with great picture quality 1 
if there was ever a movie that needed wordofmouth to promote this is it 1 
be sure to order dessert even if you need to pack it togo the tiramisu and cannoli are both to die for 1 
overall a great experience 1 
but this movie is not funny considering the ridiculousness of it 0 
nargile i think you are great 1 
doesnt do the job 0 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
this blueant supertooth handsfree phone speaker is awesome 1 
both of the egg rolls were fantastic 1 
main thing i didnt enjoy is that the crowd is of older crowd around mid 30s and up 0 
highly recommended a 1 
gets a signal when other verizon phones wont 1 
the sound is clear and the people i talk to on it are amazed at the quality too 1 
youd have to have the iq of particularly stupid mollusk not to see that one coming 0 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
terrible phone holder 0 
i also decided not to send it back because our waitress looked like she was on the verge of having a heart attack 0 
i have tried these cables with my computer and my ipod and it works just fine 1 
pretty piece of junk 0 
honeslty it didnt taste that fresh 0 
this is a disgrace 0 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
overall i would recommend this phone over the new walkman 1 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
almost all of the songs in cover girl are oldfashioned and not very tuneful 0 
the shrimp tender and moist 1 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
pretty awesome place 1 
better than expected 1 
yes its shiny on front side and i love it 1 
the phone takes forever to charge like 2 to 5 hours literally 0 
the flat reenactments dont hold your attention because they are emotionally adrift and stagy 0 
love it great armband 1 
who in their right mind is gonna buy this battery 0 
the movie seemed a little slow at first 0 
i totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is 1 
maybe if they werent cold they would have been somewhat edible 0 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
the presentation of the food was awful 0 
theres really nothing bad i can say about this headset 0 
the scenes with the ohsomature neighbourgirl are a misplace 0 
not only did the software do a great job of this i could also make my own ringtones form my existing cds without an internet connection 1 
is pretty funny 1 
muddy low quality sound and the casing around the wires insert was poorly super glued and slid off 0 
the handsfree part works fine but then the car tries to download the address book and the treo rebootsoverall i still rate this device high 1 
exceptionally bad 0 
mediocre food 0 
as for the service im a fan because its quick and youre being served by some nice folks 1 
battery is holding up well 1 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
the staff is friendly and the joint is always clean 1 
this is was due to the fact that it took 20 minutes to be acknowledged then another 35 minutes to get our foodand they kept forgetting things 0 
how this piece of trash was ever released is beyond me the acting the story the characters the supposedly special effects etcits all wrong 0 
she carries the movie well 1 
i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
i had the chicken pho and it tasted very bland 0 
all this movie does is make you sick watching all these slackers make excuses for their stupid actions for 90 minutes 0 
im probably one of the few people to ever go to ians and not like it 0 
an instant classic with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits 1 
this was a different cut than the piece the other day but still wonderful and tender s well as well flavored 1 
not sure who was more lost the flat characters or the audience nearly half of whom walked out 0 
krussel always good 1 
i mean really how do you get so famous for your fish and chips when its so terrible 0 
i had the chicken pho and it tasted very bland 0 
putting the race card aside lets look at the major flaw in the film they destroy latifas character 0 
full of unconvincing cardboard characters it is blandly written by edward chodorov who also produced and is surprisingly directed by jean negulesco from whom one would expect a great deal more 0 
no actress has been worse used that june allison in this movie 0 
i love this place 1 
does everything it should and more 1 
happy so far 1 
i wouldnt return 0 
this movie is bad 0 
not impressed 0 
everything about this movie is stupid 0 
could not get strong enough signal 0 
the acting is like watching wooden puppets moving around and reading from a book thats how bad it is 0 
very friendly staff 1 
the malta settings are as dry and as barren as the dialogue 0 
there is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again 0 
having trouble with volume 0 
the fried rice was dry as well 0 
the phone was unusable and was not new 0 
this place is amazing 1 
utterly without merit on any level this is akin to torture 0 
this place is great 1 
the chips that came out were dripping with grease and mostly not edible 0 
on three different occasions i asked for well done or medium well and all three times i got the bloodiest piece of meat on my plate 0 
in particular the relationship between the bakery assistant and the waitress just didnt work for me at all 0 
i had heard good things about this place but it exceeding every hope i could have dreamed of 1 
truly awful 0 
how stupid is that 0 
they could serve it with just the vinaigrette and it may make for a better overall dish but it was still very good 1 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
i have tried these cables with my computer and my ipod and it works just fine 1 
it is an insane game 1 
also makes it easier to hold on to 1 
i dont think it would hold it too securly on your belt 0 
it was horrendous 0 
i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
almost all of the songs in cover girl are oldfashioned and not very tuneful 0 
well im satisfied 1 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
for readers who have already seen one of miyazakis films he is still in top form and made another worthwhile experience 1 
i as well wouldve given godfathers zero stars if possible 0 
i have bought this nokia cell phone a few weeks ago and it was a nightmare 0 
trying to make a call on these is an exercise in frustration 0 
their daily specials are always a hit with my group 1 
when i saw it in the theater i thought i was going to be sick 0 
horrible had to switch 3 times 0 
however after finally watching this film i realized that not only had i had a closed mind to the brilliance it depicts i also found myself watching it over and over again 1 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
the waitress and manager are so friendly 1 
as many people complained i found this headsets microphone was very weak 0 
so i am here to warn youdo not rent this movie it is the dumbest thing you have never seen 0 
they do not last forever but is not overly expensive to replaceeasy to operate and the sound is much better than others i have tried 1 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
not sure who was more lost the flat characters or the audience nearly half of whom walked out 0 
food was good service was good prices were good 1 
its not hard to make a decent hamburger 0 
ill give this film 10 out of 10 1 
there are the usual hitchcock logic flaws 0 
this is the kind of money that is wasted properly 1 
avoid at all cost 0 
their chow mein is so good 1 
nice spicy and tender 1 
lastly the mozzarella sticks they were the best thing we ordered 1 
now this dish was quite flavourful 1 
reasonably priced also 1 
and finally after all that we get to an ending that wouldve been great had it been handled by competent people and not jerry falwell 0 
it was pretty gross 0 
so bad 0 
it dit not work most of the time with my nokia 5320 0 
poor voice clarity 0 
i bought this to use with my kindle fire and absolutely loved it 1 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
that was done in the second movie 0 
secondly hitchcock pretty much perfected the thriller and chase movie 1 
not good when wearing a hat or sunglasses 0 
tried to go here for lunch and it was a madhouse 0 
utter crap sound quality is terrible 0 
i recently had problems where i could not stay connected for more than 10 minutes before being disconnected 0 
dont waste your time watching this rubbish nonresearched film 0 
my side greek salad with the greek dressing was so tasty and the pita and hummus was very refreshing 1 
wasted two hours 0 
it is cheap and it feel and look just as cheap 0 
however i recently watched the whole thing again on dvd and i was completely struck by how extremely stupid the storyline was how it contained holes inconsistencies and frankly a whole lot of crap and how horrid the dancing was 0 
i hate movies like that 0 
the acting helps the writing along very well maybe the idiotsavant sister could have been played better and it is a real joy to watch 1 
i would highly recommend this 1 
aside from its terrible lead this film has loads of other debits 0 
nice spicy and tender 1 
this was a poor remake of my best friends wedding 0 
ive had better not only from dedicated boba tea spots but even from jenni pho 0 
what should have been a hilarious yummy christmas eve dinner to remember was the biggest fail of the entire trip for us 0 
an hour seriously 0 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
coming here is like experiencing an underwhelming relationship where both parties cant wait for the other person to ask to break up 0 
they could serve it with just the vinaigrette and it may make for a better overall dish but it was still very good 1 
it is practically useless and did not add any kind of boost to my reception after i bought it 0 
a great film by a great director 1 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
but when i check voice mail at night the keypad backlight turns off a few seconds into the first message and then im lost 0 
even when the women finally show up there is no sign of improvement the most expected things happen and by the time the film is over you might be far asleep 0 
go watch it 1 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
comfortable in my hand 1 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
rip off over charge shipping 0 
please dont waste your money 0 
better than youd expect 1 
i enjoyed reading this book to my children when they were little 1 
i really recommend this faceplates since it looks very nice elegant and cool 1 
i love the ringtones because they are so upbeat 1 
is it possible for a movie to get any worse than this 0 
classywarm atmosphere fun and fresh appetizers succulent steaks baseball steak 1 
it was way over fried 0 
whatever prompted such a documentary is beyond me 0 
i felt asleep the first time i watched it so i can recommend it for insomniacs 0 
it deserves strong love 1 
i recommend this for everyone who loves film movies anythinga work of art 1 
i love this thing 1 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
over rated 0 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
soggy and not good 0 
what should have been a hilarious yummy christmas eve dinner to remember was the biggest fail of the entire trip for us 0 
truly awful 0 
if you do watch it however there are small consolations the actresses playing annes sisters each do a wonderful job with their roles 1 
putting the race card aside lets look at the major flaw in the film they destroy latifas character 0 
i have to mention this and it is a huge spoiler i loved the ending how all the characters of the three films were the remaining survivors of the ferry disaster with valentine and the young judge together and the old man watching it on her tv solidifying his happiness over the suffering which he dealt with for those many years 1 
con spotty service 0 
it has northern humour and positive about the community it represents 1 
talk about great customer service of course we will be back 1 
if only someone involved with it knew how to string together narrative 0 
his costars dont fare much better with people like morgan freeman jonah hill and ed helms just wasted 0 
i know that sounds funny but to me it seemed like sketchy technology that wouldnt work wellwell this one works great 1 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
the menu is always changing food quality is going down service is extremely slow 0 
great audio 1 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
avoid avoid avoid 0 
the script is a big flawed mess 0 
shrimp when i unwrapped it i live only 12 a mile from brushfire it was literally ice cold 0 
what happened next was prettyoff putting 0 
i recently had problems where i could not stay connected for more than 10 minutes before being disconnected 0 
the poor actors 0 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
also if your phone is dropped this case is not going to save it specially when dropped face down 0 
my wife had the lobster bisque soup which was lukewarm 0 
nothing new there 0 
it plays louder than any other speaker of this size the price is so low that most would think the quality is lacking however its not 1 
all this movie does is make you sick watching all these slackers make excuses for their stupid actions for 90 minutes 0 
total brunch fail 0 
how awful she is 0 
you have to hold the phone at a particular angle for the other party to hear you clearly 0 
voice recognition is tremendous 1 
this case seems well made 1 
im returning them 0 
and dont even get me started on the jerky camerawork 0 
linksys should have some way to exchange a bad phone for a refurb unit or something 0 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
i dont think it would hold it too securly on your belt 0 
the story is lame not interesting and never really explains the sinister origins of the puppets 0 
a very charming film with wonderful sentiment and heart 1 
this phone is very fast with sending any kind of messages and web browsing is significantly faster than previous phones i have used 1 
it is a very well acted and done tv movie 1 
if you love death and decay and shakespears lyrics this is the one 1 
an excellent new restaurant by an experienced frenchman 1 
and the chef was generous with his time even came around twice so we can take pictures with him 1 
they are so easy to love but even more easy to identify with 1 
that being said for a phone the camera is very nice many cool effects to play with and video is decent as well 1 
the salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop which was perfectly cooked 1 
i can say that the desserts were yummy 1 
i also didnt like the on button it felt like it would crack with use 0 
but the actingeven that of such professionals as drago and debbie rochonwas terrible the directing worse perhaps contributory to the former the dialog chimplike and the camera work barely tolerable 0 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
good value works fine power via usb car or wall outlet 1 
all this movie does is make you sick watching all these slackers make excuses for their stupid actions for 90 minutes 0 
this is the kind of money that is wasted properly 1 
very bad experience 0 
id rather eat airline food seriously 0 
exactly what i wanted 1 
this movie creates its own universe and is fascinating in every way 1 
dont buy this product 0 
doesnt do the job 0 
i give wirefly 1 stari will contact cingularatt and inform them of this practice 0 
very good though 1 
plus its only 8 bucks 1 
this place lacked style 0 
it is the best charger i have seen on the market yet 1 
they could serve it with just the vinaigrette and it may make for a better overall dish but it was still very good 1 
the croutons also taste homemade which is an extra plus 1 
i cannot make calls at certain places 0 
see it 1 
the delivery was on time 1 
the pairing of the two devices was so easy it barely took a couple minutes before i started making calls with the voice dialing feature 1 
youll love it 1 
what makes this story different are the terrific production values faultless photography composition and editing the terrific casting the underappreciated brian keith playing a bully teddy and vivid history 1 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
why was this film made 0 
the food was very good 1 
my wife had the lobster bisque soup which was lukewarm 0 
good case 1 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
this was my first and only vegas buffet and it did not disappoint 1 
top line dont waste your time and money on this one its as bad as it comes 0 
i wouldnt return 0 
iam very pleased with my purchase 1 
it was so funny 1 
penne vodka excellent 1 
better than new 1 
we loved the biscuits 1 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
now we were chosen to be tortured with this disgusting piece of blatant american propaganda 0 
both films are terrible but to the credit of the 1986 version it was watchable 0 
i live in the neighborhood so i am disappointed i wont be back here because it is a convenient location 0 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
i love the camera its really pretty good quality 1 
if there is a wind it is completely useless 0 
the scenes with the ohsomature neighbourgirl are a misplace 0 
what the hell kind of crap is that 0 
very nice and relaxing late night viewing 1 
they have horrible attitudes towards customers and talk down to each one when customers dont enjoy their food 0 
i had the chicken pho and it tasted very bland 0 
it was so funny 1 
my drink was never empty and he made some really great menu suggestions 1 
not as good as i had hoped 0 
when i placed my treo into the case not only was it not snug but there was a lot of extra room on the sides 0 
doesnt last long 0 
i love it 1 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
it seems completely secure both holding on to my belt and keeping the iphone inside 1 
doesnt work 0 
speaking of the music it is unbearably predictably and kitchy 0 
this frog phone charm is adorable and very eye catching 1 
i highly recommend these and encourage people to give them a try 1 
poor talk time performance 0 
i was totally fascinated by the music the dancing everything 1 
it crackles with an unpredictable youthful energy but honestly i found it hard to follow and concentrate on it meanders so badly 0 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
my salad had a bland vinegrette on the baby greens and hearts of palm 0 
disappointment i hate anything that goes in my ear 0 
i had the chicken pho and it tasted very bland 0 
i love this phone 1 
saw the movie today and thought it was a good effort good messages for kids 1 
service was good and the company was better 1 
the film has an ultracheap look to it 0 
just reading on the specs alone makes you say wow 1 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
how awesome is that 1 
also the phone doesnt seem to accept anything except cbr mp3s preferably ripped by windows media player 0 
this is an excellent film 1 
i wasnt expecting oscar material but this 0 
so dont go there if you are looking for good food 0 
so anyone near you will hear part of your conversation 0 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
they are so easy to love but even more easy to identify with 1 
penne vodka excellent 1 
by the time the film ended i not only disliked it i despised it 0 
cute quaint simple honest 1 
will never ever go back and have told many people what had happened 0 
disappointing accessory from a good manufacturer 0 
i must say i have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again 1 
excellent phone 1 
awesome selection of beer 1 
it is an excellent drama an excellent thriller and an excellent film 1 
pretty cool i would say 1 
i have had this phone for over a year now and i will tell you its not that great 0 
heres where the movie really pied me off 0 
all the bread is made inhouse 1 
this movie contained an allstar cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i havent seen before 1 
i recommend this for everyone who loves film movies anythinga work of art 1 
secondly hitchcock pretty much perfected the thriller and chase movie 1 
its not hard to make a decent hamburger 0 
it dit not work most of the time with my nokia 5320 0 
performed awful muffled tinny incoming sound and severe echo for those on the other end of the call 0 
its practically perfect in all of them ¬ñ a true masterpiece in a sea of faux masterpieces 1 
the story unfolds in 18th century jutland and the use of period music played on period instruments is just one more fine touch 1 
nargile i think you are great 1 
back to good bbq lighter fare reasonable pricing and tell the public they are back to the old ways 1 
you can find better movies at youtube 0 
glad i didnt pay to see it 0 
a fly was in my apple juice a fly 0 
not worth it 0 
the ambiance isnt much better 0 
and his subtle connections between the three films are awesome 1 
an extensive menu provides lots of options for breakfast 1 
everything was fresh and delicious 1 
the bipolarity of the ruthless thug one minute a ruthless killer the next minute a luvs diaper commercial is completely unconvincing 0 
the two main characters may be two of the most believable children i ever saw put on screen 1 
the ri style calamari was a joke 0 
at first glance it is a lovely bakery cafe nice ambiance clean friendly staff 1 
i would highly recommend this product 1 
but it wasnt until i watched this film that i realised how great he actually was 1 
this was one of the worst films i have ever seen 0 
dont waste your on this one 0 
i do think tom hanks is a good actor 1 
i had a pretty satifying experience 1 
awesome device 1 
its hard not to fall headoverheels in love with that girl 1 
barney is definitely super de duper 1 
the design is very odd as the ear clip is not very comfortable at all 0 
similarly the delivery man did not say a word of apology when our food was 45 minutes late 0 
as an earlier review noted plug in this charger and nothing happens 0 
i can barely ever hear on it and am constantly saying what 0 
overall i would recommend this phone over the new walkman 1 
what should have been a hilarious yummy christmas eve dinner to remember was the biggest fail of the entire trip for us 0 
it feels poorly constructed the menus are difficult to navigate and the buttons are so recessed that it is difficult to push them 0 
steamboat willie is an amazingly important film to our cinema history 1 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
new battery works great in phone 1 
fantastic earphones 1 
however this didnt make up for the fact that overall this was a tremendously boring movie 0 
highly unprofessional and rude to a loyal patron 0 
bluetooth does not work phone locks up screens just flash up and now it just makes calls randomly while in my pocket locked 0
