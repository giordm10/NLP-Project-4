they refuse to refund or replace 0 
perabo has a nice energy level and is obviously very comfortable in front of a camera 1 
i came over from verizon because cingulair has nicer cell phones the first thing i noticed was the really bad service 0 
everything about it is just bad 0 
yet i enjoy watching it 1 
conclusion i loved it 1 
this is probably one of the least effective and utterly unoriginal films i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
this review is long overdue since i consider a tale of two sisters to be the single greatest film ever made 1 
shes poised and amazing 1 
the films sole bright spot was jonah hill who will look almost unrecognizable to fans of the recent superbad due to the amount of weight he lost in the interim 1 
im pleased 1 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
when a song could explain the emotions of the subjects better such as when jay adams unfortunate life was a subject of talk the song old man by neil young was played which evokes many emotions 1 
cute quaint simple honest 1 
great phone 1 
it is rare when a filmmaker takes the time to tell a worthy moral tale with care and love that doesnt fall into the trap of being overly syrupy or over indulgent 1 
i saw it as a child on tv back in 1973 when it was the stranger and i loved it 1 
good case excellent value 1 
it was so boring 0 
not easy to watch 0 
nevertheless yet another wonderful film from the great masters stable 1 
the film deserves strong kudos for taking this stand for having exceptional acting from its mostly lesserknown cast and for the superintelligent script that doesnt insult the audience or take the easy way out when it comes to white racism 1 
dont buy it 0 
dont do it 0 
very comfortable 1 
defective crap 0 
its just adorable seeing mickey playing turkey in the straw in a highly imaginative if occasionally cruel way 1 
as a courtroom drama its compelling as an indictment on the american justice system its frightening 1 
great phone 1 
this review is long overdue since i consider a tale of two sisters to be the single greatest film ever made 1 
drinks took close to 30 minutes to come out at one point 0 
the real disappointment was our waiter 0 
the movie is not completely perfect but titta di girolamo will stay with you for a long time after the vision of the movie 1 
the least said about the acting the better 0 
paolo sorrentino has written a wonderful story about loneliness and tony has built one of the most unforgettable characters seen in movies in recent years 1 
however i needed some better instructions 0 
its not hard to make a decent hamburger 0 
but the duet between the astronaut and his doctor at the beginning of the movie is a perfect exchange if one considers that this movie was made well into the cold war and the astronauts biggest fear is that he has crashed in the ussr 1 
worthless product 0 
i was very excited to get this headset because i thought it was really cute 1 
just as good as when i had it more than a year ago 1 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
i can take a little bad service but the food sucks 0 
the company shipped my product very promptly and it works well 1 
this would not even be good as a made for tv flick 0 
a very charming film with wonderful sentiment and heart 1 
it is easy to turn on and off when you are in the car and the volume controls are quite accessable 1 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
hated it 0 
it probably would have been better if the director hadnt spent most of the movie showcasing his own art work which really isnt that noteworthy 0 
and finally after all that we get to an ending that wouldve been great had it been handled by competent people and not jerry falwell 0 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
this is one of peter watkins most accessible films 1 
you cant go wrong with any of the food here 1 
it does everything the description said it would 1 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
i love the pho and the spring rolls oh so yummy you have to try 1 
stay away from this store be careful 0 
the classic maine lobster roll was fantastic 1 
there is a lot of beautiful places 1 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
if you want healthy authentic or ethic food try this place 1 
great value 1 
i cant use this case because the smell is disgusting 0 
this one is simply a disappointment 0 
excellent sound quality 1 
the movie was so boring that i sometimes found myself occupied peaking in the paper instead of watching never happened during a columbo movie before 0 
there was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth but it didnt really work into the rest of the plot 0 
con spotty service 0 
couldnt figure it out 0 
the place was fairly clean but the food simply wasnt worth it 0 
the only good thing was our waiter he was very helpful and kept the bloddy marys coming 1 
the plastic breaks really easy on this clip 0 
he owns the film just as spacek owned coal miners daughter and quaid owned great balls of fire 1 
it was also the right balance of war and love 1 
the owners are super friendly and the staff is courteous 1 
the service was terrible food was mediocre 0 
these products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet 0 
too politically correct 0 
the meat was pretty dry i had the sliced brisket and pulled pork 0 
the design is very odd as the ear clip is not very comfortable at all 0 
not my thing 0 
this is a great restaurant at the mandalay bay 1 
linksys should have some way to exchange a bad phone for a refurb unit or something 0 
this short film certainly pulls no punches 0 
fits comfortably came with three sizes of earbud tips 1 
dont waste your time watching this rubbish nonresearched film 0 
went for lunch service was slow 0 
after my phone got to be about a year old its been slowly breaking despite much care on my part 0 
both great 1 
the staff are great the ambiance is great 1 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
the turkey and roast beef were bland 0 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
went for lunch service was slow 0 
the chefs were friendly and did a good job 1 
the yellowtail carpaccio was melt in your mouth fresh 1 
i have purchased these for both family and friends and all enjoy their clarity and ease of use 1 
omelets are to die for 1 
the selection of food was not the best 0 
everything about this film is simply incredible 1 
before i go in to why i gave a 1 star rating please know that this was my third time eating at bachi burger before writing a review 0 
tonight i had the elk filet specialand it sucked 0 
took an hour to get our food only 4 tables in restaurant my food was luke warm our sever was running around like he was totally overwhelmed 0 
everything captain howdy says is either laughable or just plain stupid 0 
we wont be going back 0 
the wind and the lion is well written and superbly acted 1 
the film has an ultracheap look to it 0 
the loudspeaker option is great the bumpers with the lights is very appealing 0 
plus it was wellpaced and suited its relatively short run time 1 
my sister has one also and she loves it 1 
you can even take self portraits with the outside exterior display very cool 1 
bought mainly for the charger which broke soon after purchasing 0 
its very slow 0 
the crÃªpe was delicate and thin and moist 1 
while i managed to bend the leaf spring back in place the metal now has enough stress that it will break on the next drop 0 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
he deserves 5 stars 1 
i bought this battery with a coupon from amazon and im very happy with my purchase 1 
have been going since 2007 and every meal has been awesome 1 
i might have gotten a defect but i would not risk buying it again because of the built quality alone 0 
i own 2 of these cases and would order another 1 
i did not have any problem with this item and would order it again if needed 1 
the acting sucks the music sucks the script sucks the pacing sucks the special fx suck the directing sucks basically this movie sucks 0 
but it is great i would really recommend it 1 
if you have not seen this movie i definitely recommend it 1 
razr battery good buy 1 
then scene where they debated whether or not to sack the trumpeter who falsely was accused for the murder is pure horror really stupid 0 
brilliance indeed 1 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
con spotty service 0 
waited 2 hours never got either of our pizzas as many other around us who came in later did 0 
i searched the internet and found this one to be the best value 1 
very friendly staff 1 
used and dirty 0 
do not waste your money here 0 
portable and it works 1 
it is unusable in a moving car at freeway speed 0 
the jabra eargels fit my ears very well 1 
both films are terrible but to the credit of the 1986 version it was watchable 0 
this greedy corporation will never see another dime from me 0 
i love their fries and their beans 1 
spoilers whatever else can or cant be said about it surface is superbly crafted 1 
the success of the film depends on the casting of sydney greenstreet as the alexander yardley character 1 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
the mic is great 1 
i am pairing this with my iphone and i could not be happier with it so far 1 
this movie totally grates on my nerves 0 
reception is terrible and full of static 0 
the buttons for on and off are bad 0 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
total waste of time 0 
i mean really how do you get so famous for your fish and chips when its so terrible 0 
i ordered the lemon raspberry ice cocktail which was also incredible 1 
the movie showed a lot of florida at its best made it look very appealing 1 
fantastic buy and will get again for whatever my next phone is 1 
this place is awesome if you want something light and healthy during the summer 1 
they keep getting better and better this is my third one and ive had numerous palms too 1 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
coming here is like experiencing an underwhelming relationship where both parties cant wait for the other person to ask to break up 0 
regrettably the film fails 0 
a cheap and cheerless heist movie with poor characterisation lots of underbite style stoic emoting think chow yun fat in a better tomorrow and some cheesy clichÃ©s thrown into an abandoned factory ready for a few poorly executed flying judo rolls a la john woo 0 
i use this product in a motor control center where there is a lot of high voltage humming from the equipment and it works great 1 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
macbeth jason connery moved me to tears with his final monolog out brief candle outhe gave the sphere of moral decay and dark forces a human face which makes it the more interesting 1 
10 out of 10 for both the movie and trilogy 1 
the food amazing 1 
reversible plug works great 1 
it deserves strong love 1 
the eargels channel the sound directly into your ear and seem to increase the sound volume and clarity 1 
i tried talking real loud but shouting on the telephone gets old and i was still told it wasnt great 0 
this is one of the better buffets that i have been to 1 
the scenes with the ohsomature neighbourgirl are a misplace 0 
i saw this short film on hbo the other day and absolutely loved it 1 
of course the acting is blah 0 
even the squibs look awful 0 
this is a great restaurant at the mandalay bay 1 
unfortunately it did not work 0 
arrived quickly and much less expensive than others being sold 1 
the acting was bad the dialogs were extremely shallow and insincere 0 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
delicious and i will absolutely be back 1 
its like a really sexy party in your mouth where youre outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party 1 
the calls drop the phone comes on and off at will the screen goes black and the worst of all it stops ringing intermittently 0 
appetite instantly gone 0 
dont waste your time here 0 
very poor service 0 
if you do watch it however there are small consolations the actresses playing annes sisters each do a wonderful job with their roles 1 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
too bad cause i know its family owned i really wanted to like this place 0 
owners are really great people 1 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
it didnt work people can not hear me when i talk 0 
mobile phone tools are a must have 1 
not much seafood and like 5 strings of pasta at the bottom 0 
the film is well paced understated and one of the best courtroom documentaries ive seen 1 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
if that bug never showed up i would have given a 4 for sure but on the other side of the wall where this bug was climbing was the kitchen 0 
ray charles life provided excellent biographical material for the film which goes well beyond being just another movie about a musician 1 
a bit predictable 0 
regrettably the film fails 0 
my gyro was basically lettuce only 0 
one of the worst shows of all time 0 
i had the chicken pho and it tasted very bland 0 
perhaps i caught them on an off night judging by the other reviews but im not inspired to go back 0 
from here on the widmark character turns unintentionally comical 0 
portable and it works 1 
and his subtle connections between the three films are awesome 1 
i could eat their bruschetta all day it is devine 1 
the portion was huge 1 
good product incredible value 1 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
not a good item it worked for a while then started having problems in my auto reverse tape player 0 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
really good product 1 
service is also cute 1 
maybe if they werent cold they would have been somewhat edible 0 
clear skype calls long battery life long range 1 
this is a chilly unremarkable movie about an author livingworking in a chilly abstruse culture 0 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
the phone takes forever to charge like 2 to 5 hours literally 0 
john wayne did an incredible job for being so young in the movie industry 1 
this phone is very fast with sending any kind of messages and web browsing is significantly faster than previous phones i have used 1 
howeverthe riingtones are not the best and neither are the games 0 
it was also the right balance of war and love 1 
def coming back to bowl next time 1 
oh and i forgot to also mention the weird color effect it has on your phone 0 
everything is appalling 0 
this is a masterful piece of filmmaking with many themes simmering and occasionally boiling over in this warts and all study of the poets bohemian selfindulgent wartime years that span the aerial bombardments of london and the outward tranquillity of a welsh coastal retreat the borderlines between friendship lust and love dedication to art and experience versus practical concerns jealousy rivalry cowardice and egotism versus heroism and selfsacrifice and more 1 
up there with the best of melville 1 
even if you love bad movies do not watch this movie 0 
but it does get better reception and clarity than any phone ive had before 1 
nice spicy and tender 1 
so bad 0 
ive had no trouble accessing the internet downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions 1 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
oh yeah and the storyline was pathetic too 0 
we would recommend these to others 1 
razr battery good buy 1 
great price too 1 
they have horrible attitudes towards customers and talk down to each one when customers dont enjoy their food 0 
the sound is clear and the people i talk to on it are amazed at the quality too 1 
too politically correct 0 
i ordered albondigas soup which was just warm and tasted like tomato soup with frozen meatballs 0 
also the fries are without a doubt the worst fries ive ever had 0 
much less than the jawbone i was going to replace it with 1 
the food amazing 1 
it is wonderful and inspiring to watch and i hope that it gets released again on to video or dvd 1 
love this headset 1 
not what i wanted 0 
the lighting is awful 0 
this place is way too overpriced for mediocre food 0 
tonight i had the elk filet specialand it sucked 0 
tied to charger for conversations lasting more than 45 minutesmajor problems 0 
service sucks 0 
never going back 0 
cant say enough good things about this place 1 
hitchcock is a great director 1 
im very disappointed with my decision 0 
definitely a turn off for me i doubt ill be back unless someone else is buying 0 
this frog phone charm is adorable and very eye catching 1 
this item worked great but it broke after 6 months of use 0 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
the performances are real and gripping the crocdodile is extremely well done indeed if the black water website is to be believed thats because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous 1 
dont do it 0 
her role was played well 1 
every time he opened his mouth you expect to hear you see kids pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show 0 
it was so bad i had lost the heart to finish it 0 
probably never coming back and wouldnt recommend it 0 
even the squibs look awful 0 
there was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters 0 
if you want a sandwich just go to any firehouse 1 
everything was good and tasty 1 
an awesome new look for fall 2000 1 
food was good service was good prices were good 1 
verizons bills however are difficult to understand even though their pricing plans are simple 0 
putting the race card aside lets look at the major flaw in the film they destroy latifas character 0 
it is an insane game 1 
this film offers many delights and surprises 1 
rating 1 out of 10 0 
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0 
i promise they wont disappoint 1 
of course the acting is blah 0 
yes its shiny on front side and i love it 1 
you can even take self portraits with the outside exterior display very cool 1 
after i pulled up my car i waited for another 15 minutes before being acknowledged 0 
the server was very negligent of our needs and made us feel very unwelcome i would not suggest this place 0 
seriously killer hot chai latte 1 
editing the editing of this film was phenomenal in my opinion 1 
i gave it a 10 1 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
bacon is hella salty 1 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
everything was good and tasty 1 
the staff is great the food is delish and they have an incredible beer selection 1 
my wife had the lobster bisque soup which was lukewarm 0 
those burgers were amazing 1 
i would highly recommend this 1 
i could care less the interior is just beautiful 1 
great phone 1 
i believe every one should see this movie as i think few people outside of south africa understand its past and what is being attempted in the truth and reconciliation process 1 
this movie is greatespecially if you enjoy visual arts 1 
no actress has been worse used that june allison in this movie 0 
im trying to return it for a refund 0 
she carries the movie well 1 
truly awful 0 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
not to mention the combination of pears almonds and bacon is a big winner 1 
the sweet potato tots were good but the onion rings were perfection or as close as i have had 1 
the best scene in the movie was when gerardo is trying to find a song that keeps running through his head 1 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
horrible horrible protector 0 
not sure who was more lost the flat characters or the audience nearly half of whom walked out 0 
this is not moviemaking 0 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
the sangria was about half of a glass wine full and was 12 ridiculous 0 
the staff are great the ambiance is great 1 
we will not be coming back 0 
the worst experience ever 0 
the headsets are easy to use and everyone loves them 1 
i rate this movie 910 1 
the only consistent thread holding the series together were the amazing performances of leni parker and anita laselva as the two taelons in quiet idealogical conflict 0 
i gave it a 10 1 
cant get the software to work with my computer 0 
the place was fairly clean but the food simply wasnt worth it 0 
i paid the bill but did not tip because i felt the server did a terrible job 0 
the cashier was friendly and even brought the food out to me 1 
so just beware 0 
went in for happy hour great list of wines 1 
the first thing that happened was that the tracking was off 0 
each day of the week they have a different deal and its all so delicious 1 
everything was fresh and delicious 1 
i thought errol flynn was brilliant as custer and has since become my favourite actor 1 
i went to bachi burger on a friends recommendation and was not disappointed 1 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
first the bathrooms at this location were dirty seat covers were not replenished just plain yucky 0 
still its quite interesting and entertaining to follow 1 
the best electronics of the available fm transmitters 1 
their research and development division obviously knows what theyre doing 1 
overall i wasnt very impressed with noca 0 
the warmth it generates is in contrast to its austere backdrop 1 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
overall i rate this movie a 10 out of a 110 scale 1 
for that its worth checking out 1 
the fact is this film is a wonderful heartwarming tale about two people chasing their dreams 1 
if you look for authentic thai food go else where 0 
very good food great atmosphere1 1 
worst hour and a half of my lifeoh my gosh 0 
for that its worth checking out 1 
definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly will return next time im in vegas 1 
does not fit 0 
i will never forget it now 1 
service stinks here 0 
the service was a bit lacking 0 
the folks at otto always make us feel so welcome and special 1 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
the best place to go for a tasty bowl of pho 1 
macbeth jason connery moved me to tears with his final monolog out brief candle outhe gave the sphere of moral decay and dark forces a human face which makes it the more interesting 1 
everything about this film is simply incredible 1 
not loud enough and doesnt turn on like it should 0 
dont make the same mistake that i did and please dont buy this phone 0 
do not buy if you want to use the holster 0 
today was my first taste of a buldogis gourmet hot dog and i have to tell you it was more than i ever thought possible 1 
great character actors telly savalas and peter boyle 1 
i dont think there are any redeeming qualities in this remake 0 
the only thing really worth watching was the scenery and the house because it is beautiful 1 
does not fit 0 
for those that havent seen it dont waste your time 0 
the building itself seems pretty neat the bathroom is pretty trippy but i wouldnt eat here again 0 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
after a year the battery went completely dead on my headset 0 
they brought a fresh batch of fries and i was thinking yay something warm but no 0 
the block was amazing 1 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
everything about this film is simply incredible 1 
battery has no life 0 
its hard not to fall headoverheels in love with that girl 1 
best of luck to the rude and noncustomer service focused new management 0 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
an amazing finale to possibly the best trilogy of all time 1 
very disappointed 0 
nice leather 1 
at first i thought i was grtting a good deal at 744 until i plugged it into my phone v3c razr 0 
very disappointed and wondered how it could be in the oscar shortlist 0 
here in the wind and the lion we see a wonderful rendering of americas own imperial age 1 
this place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver 0 
this is the place where i first had pho and it was amazing 1 
i dont think ill be running back to carlys anytime soon for food 0 
join the club and get awesome offers via email 1 
we wont be returning 0 
i am so pleased to know such a modern day genius is out there letting is passion for art drive him and taking us as an audience with him 1 
ive never been more insulted or felt disrespected 0 
it is a really good show to watch 1 
i couldnt think of a better way to end the film but a smile on my face great way to wrap up an amazing film and trilogy 1 
all in all i can assure you ill be back 1 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
the movie showed a lot of florida at its best made it look very appealing 1 
but it is great i would really recommend it 1 
this product is clearly not ready for prime time i dont care how cool it looks if you cant tell a call is coming in its worthless 0 
there still are good actors around 1 
this was like the final blow 0 
gets the job done 1 
i want my money back 0 
this place has it 1 
im terribly disappointed that this film would receive so many awards and accolades especially when there are far more deserving works of film out there 0 
if you havent gone here go now 1 
the bt headset was such a disapoinment 0 
not worth it 0 
an hour and a half i wish i could bring back 0 
great food and service huge portions and they give a military discount 1 
wont work right or atleast for me 0 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
ive missed numerous calls because of this reason 0 
i especially liked the noncliche choices with the parents in other movies i could predict the dialog verbatim but the writing in this movie made better selections 1 
this is actually a very smart movie 1 
the servers went back and forth several times not even so much as an are you being helped 0 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
the holster that arrived did not match the photo in the ad 0 
another note about this phones appearance is that it really looks rather bland especially in the all black model 0 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
the sound quality is good and functionality is awesome 1 
omit watching this 0 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
its just adorable seeing mickey playing turkey in the straw in a highly imaginative if occasionally cruel way 1 
the battery is unreliable as well as the service use antena 0 
but then they came back cold 0 
that being said for a phone the camera is very nice many cool effects to play with and video is decent as well 1 
i immediately said i wanted to talk to the manager but i did not want to talk to the guy who was doing shots of fireball behind the bar 0 
i struggle to find anything bad to say about it 1 
my brother in law who works at the mall ate here same day and guess what he was sick all night too 0 
dont make the same mistake that i did and please dont buy this phone 0 
it is an excellent drama an excellent thriller and an excellent film 1 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
the worst experience ever 0 
dont make the same mistake i did 0 
you have to hold the phone at a particular angle for the other party to hear you clearly 0 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
the story line is just awful 0 
ample portions and good prices 1 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
the service was not up to par either 0 
the plantains were the worst ive ever tasted 0 
total letdown i would much rather just go to the camelback flower shop and cartel coffee 0 
he is an amazing film artist one of the most important whoever lived 1 
the staff are great the ambiance is great 1 
in an interesting part of town this place is amazing 1 
my husband said she was very rude did not even apologize for the bad food or anything 0 
it wasnt busy at all and now we know why 0 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
brilliance indeed 1 
it defeats the purpose of a bluetooth headset 0 
the accompanied software is almost brilliant 1 
this is a simple little phone to use but the breakage is unacceptible 0 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
all the bread is made inhouse 1 
the calls drop the phone comes on and off at will the screen goes black and the worst of all it stops ringing intermittently 0 
this product had a strong rubberpetroleum smell that was unbearable after a while and caused me to return it 0 
horrible phone 0 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
it is unusable in a moving car at freeway speed 0 
freezes frequently4 0 
in my house i was getting dropped coverage upstairs and no coverage in my basement 0 
join the club and get awesome offers via email 1 
however my girl was complain that some time the phone doesnt wake up like normal phone does 0 
for the price on amazon it is an excellent product which i would highly recommend 1 
steve martin delivers a really funny performance of a middleaged upper class uptight white guy 1 
but even the talented carrell cant save this 0 
dont do it 0 
good case 1 
crostini that came with the salad was stale 0 
very good stuff for the price 1 
my wife had the lobster bisque soup which was lukewarm 0 
i felt as though her going to ireland did absolutely nothing whatsoever 0 
i love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it 1 
weve tried to like this place but after 10 times i think were done with them 0 
you get extra minutes so that you can carry out the call and not get cut off 1 
i give it 2 thumbs down 0 
it fits so securely that the ear hook does not even need to be used and the sound is better directed through your ear canal 1 
i tried talking real loud but shouting on the telephone gets old and i was still told it wasnt great 0 
you cant beat that 1 
i found this place by accident and i could not be happier 1 
what a waste 0 
the characters are interesting even if a bit predictable 1 
the last 15 minutes of movie are also not bad as well 1 
avoid this film at all costs 0 
i bought this phone as a replacement for my startac and have regretted it since 0 
it does everything the description said it would 1 
the management is rude 0 
so i bought about 10 of these and saved alot of money 1 
everything about this film is simply incredible 1 
and it was boring 0 
waste of money 0 
this is cool because most cases are just open there allowing the screen to get all scratched up 1 
while i managed to bend the leaf spring back in place the metal now has enough stress that it will break on the next drop 0 
excellent sound quality 1 
gotta love those closeups of slimy drooling teeth 1 
her role was played well 1 
i cant wait to go back 1 
this is a great phone 1 
it was probably dirt 0 
cute quaint simple honest 1 
unfortunately cover girl is an example of how hollywood used to exploit women for financial gain 0 
the potato chip order was sad i could probably count how many chips were in that box and it was probably around 12 0 
i bought two of them and neither will charge 0 
the menu is always changing food quality is going down service is extremely slow 0 
he deserves 5 stars 1 
some may say this buffet is pricey but i think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot 1 
linksys should have some way to exchange a bad phone for a refurb unit or something 0 
earbud piece breaks easily 0 
this phone is very fast with sending any kind of messages and web browsing is significantly faster than previous phones i have used 1 
i only hear garbage for audio 0 
unfortunately any virtue in this films production work was lost on a regrettable script 0 
it was absolutely amazing 1 
i would recommend purchasing the jabra jx10 series 2 which works flawlessly with my moto q go figure 1 
i rate this movie 910 1 
the worst one of the series 0 
the descriptions said yum yum sauce and another said eel sauce yet another said spicy mayowell none of the rolls had sauces on them 0 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
in a word it is embarrassing 0 
highly recommended 1 
it clicks into place in a way that makes you wonder how long that mechanism would last 0 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
my order was not correct 0 
their research and development division obviously knows what theyre doing 1 
definitely worth seeing its the sort of thought provoking film that forces you to question your own threshold of loneliness 1 
i particularly remember my senses being assaulted by strident cords of music that would blare out with very little warning and even less meaning 0 
you share general loewenhielms exquisite joy in his partaking of the cailles en sarcophage even though you are just watching a movie but you do wish for just a small sample to savor 1 
easily none other cartoon made me laugh in a tender way before getting into dark sitcoms oriented for teenagers 1 
initially the local sites in the film which was filmed here in buffalo intrigued me 1 
i think the most wonderful parts literally full of wonder are the excerpts from his works 1 
the dining space is tiny but elegantly decorated and comfortable 1 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
the worst phone ive ever had only had it for a few months 0 
the film has an ultracheap look to it 0 
seems like a good quick place to grab a bite of some familiar pub food but do yourself a favor and look elsewhere 0 
go rent it 1 
the movie is terribly boring in places 0 
the best electronics of the available fm transmitters 1 
nothing short of magnificent photographycinematography in this film 1 
this place is not worth your time let alone vegas 0 
the sweet potato fries were very good and seasoned well 1 
this would not even be good as a made for tv flick 0 
this if the first movie ive given a 10 to in years 1 
there still are good actors around 1 
it is an insane game 1 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
at no point in the proceedings does it look remotely like america 0 
best service and food ever maria our server was so good and friendly she made our day 1 
i believe the screenwriter did a good job of tying up the loose ends 1 
freezes frequently4 0 
helen baxendale is a very credible lady macbeth who can be very cheerfull at times and sometimes she just looks like a naughty girl but deadly in her taste for blood and evil 1 
great charger 1 
good product good seller 1 
her role was played well 1 
this gets a 1 out of 10 simply because theres nothing lower 0 
this company charge me a restocking fee and still not given me my refund back 0 
battery has no life 0 
very friendly staff 1 
the film has an ultracheap look to it 0 
initially the local sites in the film which was filmed here in buffalo intrigued me 1 
a great touch 1 
things that went wrong they burned the saganaki 0 
awesome service and food 1 
first the bathrooms at this location were dirty seat covers were not replenished just plain yucky 0 
waste of money 0 
always a great time at dos gringos 1 
the pizza selections are good 1 
what possesed me to get this junk i have no idea 0 
does not fit 0 
poor construction 0 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
highly unprofessional and rude to a loyal patron 0 
finally after three or four times the spring of the latch broke and i could not use it any longer on the visor 0 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
it did not work in my cell phone plug i am very up set with the charger 0 
from here on the widmark character turns unintentionally comical 0 
setup couldnt have been simpler 1 
and i really did find them funny 1 
the ri style calamari was a joke 0 
this fixes all the problems 1 
but when someone strives for greatness and poetry but delivers a muddled and often ridiculous story a bunch of disparate scenes pretentious dialogue then you get the worst kind of a movie that some other reviewer very accurately defined as pretentious crap 0 
no one at the table thought the food was above average or worth the wait that we had for it 0 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
it kept getting worse and worse so now im officially done 0 
also were served hot bread and butter and home made potato chips with bacon bits on topvery original and very good 1 
the pancake was also really good and pretty large at that 1 
the worst was the salmon sashimi 0 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
the battery is unreliable as well as the service use antena 0 
alexander nevsky is a great film 1 
i dont understand how this garbage got on the shelves of the movie store its not even a real movie 0 
howeverthe riingtones are not the best and neither are the games 0 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
theres barely a boring moment in the film and there are plenty of humorous parts 1 
the performances are real and gripping the crocdodile is extremely well done indeed if the black water website is to be believed thats because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous 1 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
her lines seem to have been written by a fifteen year old though they are trying oh so so hard to sound like how a fifteen year old would really um you know well talk 0 
youll love it 1 
its just lame 0 
unfortunately any virtue in this films production work was lost on a regrettable script 0 
i totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is 1 
not much flavor to them and very poorly constructed 0 
the waitress and manager are so friendly 1 
i great reception all the time 1 
i gave it a 10 1 
nice ambiance 1 
ill put this gem up against any movie in terms of screenplay cinematography acting postproduction editing directing or any other aspect of filmmaking 1 
i have two more years left in this contract and i hate this phone 0 
i dont think you will be disappointed 1 
first time going but i think i will quickly become a regular 1 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
on the up side their cafe serves really good food 1 
but the actingeven that of such professionals as drago and debbie rochonwas terrible the directing worse perhaps contributory to the former the dialog chimplike and the camera work barely tolerable 0 
arrived quickly and much less expensive than others being sold 1 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
just really good so far probably the best bt headset i have ever had 1 
would not recommend to others 0 
i left with a stomach ache and felt sick the rest of the day 0 
great choice 1 
i will come back here every time im in vegas 1 
linksys should have some way to exchange a bad phone for a refurb unit or something 0 
an interesting premise and billy drago is always good as a dangerous nutbag side note id love to see drago stephen mchattie and lance hendrikson in a flick together talk about raging cheekbones 1 
happy so far 1 
seriously killer hot chai latte 1 
in summary this was a largely disappointing dining experience 0 
not only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic but it also managed to give away the entire movie and im not exaggerating every moment every plot point every joke is told in the trailer 0 
it has kept up very well 1 
it is just the sort of pap that is screened in the afternoon to punish the unemployed for not having jobs 0 
the owner used to work at nobu so this place is really similar for half the price 1 
they were excellent 1 
dont waste your on this one 0 
the sound quality is excellent as well 1 
id advise anyone to go and see it 1 
similarly the delivery man did not say a word of apology when our food was 45 minutes late 0 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
this frog phone charm is adorable and very eye catching 1 
the transfers are very good 1 
mic doesnt work 0 
its kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly its embarrassing how childlike the company is 0 
great software for motorolas 1 
it is unusable in a moving car at freeway speed 0 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
dont do it 0 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
i have tried these cables with my computer and my ipod and it works just fine 1 
excellent sound quality 1 
the owners are super friendly and the staff is courteous 1
