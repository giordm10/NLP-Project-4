at a time when it seems that film animation has been dominated by disneypixars cgi masterpieces it is both refreshing and comforting to know that miyazaki is still relying on traditional handdrawn animation to tell his charming and enchanting stories 1 
good value works fine power via usb car or wall outlet 1 
very clear quality sound and you dont have to mess with the sound on your ipod since you have the sound buttons on the headset 1 
the opening sequence of this gem is a classic and the cat n mouse games that follow are a delight to watch 1 
seriously killer hot chai latte 1 
this was my first time and i cant wait until the next 1 
you need at least 3 mins to get to your phone book from the time you first turn on the phonebattery life is short 0 
the owners are super friendly and the staff is courteous 1 
terrible product and waste of money 0 
i give wirefly 1 stari will contact cingularatt and inform them of this practice 0 
while i managed to bend the leaf spring back in place the metal now has enough stress that it will break on the next drop 0 
so dont go there if you are looking for good food 0 
this place is not worth your time let alone vegas 0 
ray charles life provided excellent biographical material for the film which goes well beyond being just another movie about a musician 1 
will never ever go back and have told many people what had happened 0 
looks great and is strong 1 
often the dialogue doesnt really follow from one line to another or fit the surroundings 0 
the construction of the headsets is poor 0 
leopard print is wonderfully wild 1 
does everything it should and more 1 
a great film by a great director 1 
these are certainly very comfortable and functionality is decent 1 
i love the pho and the spring rolls oh so yummy you have to try 1 
the cocktails are all handmade and delicious 1 
we thought youd have to venture further away to get good sushi but this place really hit the spot that night 1 
so badwellits just bad 0 
were jerks on the phone 0 
i cannot make calls at certain places 0 
i would recommend saving room for this 1 
youll love it 1 
the headset fulfills my requirements so i am happy with my purchase 1 
with the originality and freshness of the first movie now spent this remake had little else to offer 0 
2 times very bad customer service 0 
i have bought this nokia cell phone a few weeks ago and it was a nightmare 0 
if you havent choked in your own vomit by the end by all the cheap drama and worthless dialogue youve must have bored yourself to death with this waste of time 0 
ive seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie 0 
think of the film being like a dream 1 
another thing i didnt really like is when a character got punched in the face a gallon of blood would spew forth soon after 0 
stay away from this store be careful 0 
my brother in law who works at the mall ate here same day and guess what he was sick all night too 0 
this is an outstanding little restaurant with some of the best food i have ever tasted 1 
waste your money on this game 1 
i got home to see the driest damn wings ever 0 
if you look for authentic thai food go else where 0 
i dont understand how this garbage got on the shelves of the movie store its not even a real movie 0 
this is one of peter watkins most accessible films 1 
low quality 0 
the acting was bad the dialogs were extremely shallow and insincere 0 
everything on the menu is terrific and we were also thrilled that they made amazing accommodations for our vegetarian daughter 1 
this is a really fantastic thai restaurant which is definitely worth a visit 1 
weird vibe from owners 0 
we got sitting fairly fast but ended up waiting 40 minutes just to place our order another 30 minutes before the food arrived 0 
it was equally awful 0 
integrated seamlessly with the motorola razr phone 1 
gets the job done 1 
a piece of junk that broke after being on my phone for 2 days 0 
when i opened the sandwich i was impressed but not in a good way 0 
the volume switch rocketed out of the unit to a destination unknown 0 
my only problem is i thought the actor playing the villain was a low rent michael ironside 0 
the show would begin with smart ass ed comments to each other that would be totally off the wall and uncalled for 0 
what a waste 0 
the steak was amazingrge fillet relleno was the best seafood plate i have ever had 1 
the staff is friendly and the joint is always clean 1 
easily none other cartoon made me laugh in a tender way before getting into dark sitcoms oriented for teenagers 1 
rating 010 grade z note the show is so bad that even mother of the cast pull her daughter out of the show 0 
the pizza selections are good 1 
the sangria was about half of a glass wine full and was 12 ridiculous 0 
the plot such as it is is so derivative and predictable that the ending is like a mercy killing 0 
our server was very nice and even though he looked a little overwhelmed with all of our needs he stayed professional and friendly until the end 1 
easily none other cartoon made me laugh in a tender way before getting into dark sitcoms oriented for teenagers 1 
their monster chicken fried steak and eggs is my all time favorite 1 
this movie is greatespecially if you enjoy visual arts 1 
in other words the content level of this film is enough to easily fill a dozen other films 1 
it was probably dirt 0 
interesting decor 1 
you cant beat that 1 
this is by far the worst purchase ive made on amazon 0 
saw the movie today and thought it was a good effort good messages for kids 1 
an instant classic with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits 1 
the food was terrible 0 
doesnt work 0 
my mother and brother had to do thiswhen i saw robert ryan portraying this type of man it was a very good imitation of this type of individual and i was impressed 1 
great phone 1 
i put the latest os on it v115g and it now likes to slow to a crawl and lock up every once in a while 0 
he surely doesnt know how to make a coherent action movie from the screenwriter of air force one who was only obliged to write the script just for a big sum of money 0 
overall a delight 1 
i could not understand what kind of idiot would produce this mess in the first place not to mention several season 0 
the battery is working well as a replacement for the original that came with the phone over 2 years ago 1 
keep up the good work amazon 1 
the service was great even the manager came and helped with our table 1 
as for the killer dont expect anything original or even remotely frightening 0 
they have a really nice atmosphere 1 
this movie is also revealing 1 
bad reception 0 
this early film from future goremeister lucio fulci is a very good addition to the giallo subgenre 1 
on the good side the staff was genuinely pleasant and enthusiastic a real treat 1 
this was a poor remake of my best friends wedding 0 
im returning them 0 
that just screams legit in my booksomethats also pretty rare here in vegas 1 
the basic premise is wasted since it is sidelined by the inexplicable focus on the documentary crew 0 
i will never go back to this place and will never ever recommended this place to anyone 0 
say bye bye to your tip lady 0 
its practically perfect in all of them Â– a true masterpiece in a sea of faux masterpieces 1 
lightweight and works well 1 
anyway the plot flowed smoothly and the malebonding scenes were a hoot 1 
however after about a year the fliptop started to get loose and wobbly and eventually my screen went black and i couldnt receive and place calls 0 
for service i give them no stars 0 
i understand that its supposed to be a cheap popcorn comedy but that doesnt mean that it has to completely insult our intelligence and have writing so incredibly hackneyed that it borders on offensive 0 
the cinematographyif it can be called thatsucked 0 
it is perfect for a sitdown family meal or get together with a few friends 1 
the staff are great the ambiance is great 1 
i literally vomited while watching this film 0 
i searched the internet and found this one to be the best value 1 
theres also enough hypocrisy in this film to make me vomit 0 
the secondary plot line is incomprehensible and its relation to the primary plot line is mystifying 0 
the staff is great the food is delish and they have an incredible beer selection 1 
we asked for the bill to leave without eating and they didnt bring that either 0 
i cant tell you how disappointed i was 0 
try them in the airport to experience some tasty food and speedy friendly service 1 
trouble is the writing and directing make it impossible to establish those things that make a movie watchable like character story theme and so on 0 
hes a national treasure 1 
restaurant is always full but never a wait 1 
all in all im quite satisfied with this purchase 1 
low quality 0 
now this dish was quite flavourful 1 
i had verizon 2 years ago and really liked their service 1 
pricing is a bit of a concern at mellow mushroom 0 
the fried rice was dry as well 0 
it is indescribably the most annoying and idiotic show i have ever seen 0 
excellent performance 1 
i am pairing this with my iphone and i could not be happier with it so far 1 
the lighting is just dark enough to set the mood 1 
it seems completely secure both holding on to my belt and keeping the iphone inside 1 
the earpiece on this is too large or too heavyit keeps falling out of my ear 0 
owners are really great people 1 
the ambiance isnt much better 0 
worst foodservice ive had in a while 0 
the voice recognition thru the handset is excellent 1 
again no plot at all 0 
food was delicious 1 
it is an hour and half waste of time following a bunch of very pretty high schoolers whine and cry about life 0 
great choice 1 
the folks at otto always make us feel so welcome and special 1 
i was so insulted 0 
the refried beans that came with my meal were dried out and crusty and the food was bland 0 
muddy low quality sound and the casing around the wires insert was poorly super glued and slid off 0 
the movie seemed a little slow at first 0 
superb phone on a great network 1 
easily none other cartoon made me laugh in a tender way before getting into dark sitcoms oriented for teenagers 1 
the spaghetti is nothing special whatsoever 0 
waitress was sweet and funny 1 
i dont think it would hold it too securly on your belt 0 
this is such a fun and funny movie 1 
the color is even prettier than i thought it would be and the graphics are incredibly sharp 1 
would not recommend to others 0 
another note about this phones appearance is that it really looks rather bland especially in the all black model 0 
yes this film does require a rather significant amount of puzzlesolving but the pieces fit together to create a beautiful picture 1 
with great sound effects and impressive special effects i cant recommend this movie enough 1 
this is was due to the fact that it took 20 minutes to be acknowledged then another 35 minutes to get our foodand they kept forgetting things 0 
hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in 0 
it has everything i need and i couldnt ask for more 1 
the waitress was friendly and happy to accomodate for veganveggie options 1 
i bought this to use with my kindle fire and absolutely loved it 1 
good price 1 
the design is very odd as the ear clip is not very comfortable at all 0 
perhaps my phone is defective but people cannot hear me when i use this 0 
this is infuriating 0 
i have never had such bland food which surprised me considering the article we read focused so much on their spices and flavor 0 
the jabra eargels fit my ears very well 1 
the death row scenes were entirely unmoving 0 
constantine gives everything the right intensity and seems to have a good understanding of the underlying psychological motivations 1 
thank you for wasting my money 0 
poor voice clarity 0 
first time there and might just be the last 0 
bland and flavorless is a good way of describing the barely tepid meat 0 
the phone gets extremely hot 0 
the stories were as unbelievable as the actors 0 
bluetooth range is good a few days ago i left my phone in the trunk got a call and carried the conversation without a hitch 1 
we are so glad we found this place 1 
its a gloriously fun fast paced and fairly accurate portrayal of the night of a raver 1 
their frozen margaritas are way too sugary for my taste 0 
im very disappointed with my decision 0 
doesnt last long 0 
what a waste of time 0 
food was great and so was the serivce 1 
my sashimi was poor quality being soggy and tasteless 0 
everything about this film is simply incredible 1 
they could be used as exemplars for any set designer 1 
my order was not correct 0 
feelings thoughtsgabriels discomfort during the danceall these intangibles leap to life and come within the viewers grasp in hustons portrayal 1 
10 out of 10 stars 1 
all things considered a job very well done 1 
there is no plot or storyline 0 
i always order from the vegetarian menu during dinner which has a wide array of options to choose from 1 
best ive found so far ive tried 2 other bluetooths and this one has the best quality for both me and the listener as well as ease of using 1 
shes poised and amazing 1 
crust is not good 0 
its like a really sexy party in your mouth where youre outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party 1 
by this time our side of the restaurant was almost empty so there was no excuse 0 
still waiting im sure this item would work well if i ever recieve it 0 
i hate movies like that 0 
i was so insulted 0 
ive bought 5 wired headphones that sound better than these 0 
does everything it should and more 1 
good value works fine power via usb car or wall outlet 1 
a world better than 95 of the garbage in the theatres today 1 
maybe there would be a reasonable explanation for this atrocity 0 
couldnt ask for a more satisfying meal 1 
very windresistant 1 
check it out 1 
i like armand assante my cable companys summary sounded interesting so i watched it twice already and probably will again 1 
thats how id describe this painfully dreary timewaster of a film 0 
not tasty and the texture was just nasty 0 
and his subtle connections between the three films are awesome 1 
the food wasnt good 0 
god and i can never get that 90 minutes back 0 
but this movie is not funny considering the ridiculousness of it 0 
almost everyone involved must be return to school acting is utterly predictable and bad script is pile of garbage all round 0 
i know this is not like the other restaurants at all something is very off here 0 
horrible dont waste your time and money 0 
i dont each much pasta but i love the homemade hand made pastas and thin pizzas here 1 
tied to charger for conversations lasting more than 45 minutesmajor problems 0 
if only someone involved with it knew how to string together narrative 0 
lasted one day and then blew up 0 
the movie in movie situations in the beginning and through the game that is played with her by the acting coach are fascinating 1 
the attractive set used throughout most of the film is an eyepleasing gem 1 
you could drive a semi truck into these holes 0 
very very fun chef 1 
it was forced like everything in this movie 0 
the things that the four kids get themselves into is absolutely hilarious to watch 1 
the bathrooms are clean and the place itself is well decorated 1 
this place is horrible and way overpriced 0 
our server was super nice and checked on us many times 1 
i give it 2 thumbs down 0 
i just wanted to leave 0 
ordered a double cheeseburger got a single patty that was falling apart picture uploaded yeah still sucks 0 
voice quality signal strength dropped calls 0 
wed definitely go back here again 1 
maybe its just their vegetarian fare but ive been twice and i thought it was average at best 0 
not much dialogue not much music the whole film was shot as elaborately and aesthetically like a sculpture 1 
coming here is like experiencing an underwhelming relationship where both parties cant wait for the other person to ask to break up 0 
a cheap and cheerless heist movie with poor characterisation lots of underbite style stoic emoting think chow yun fat in a better tomorrow and some cheesy clichÃ©s thrown into an abandoned factory ready for a few poorly executed flying judo rolls a la john woo 0 
we got the food and apparently they have never heard of salt and the batter on the fish was chewy 0 
also the story and acting were weak 0 
love this phone 1 
the feel of the dining room was more college cooking course than high class dining and the service was slow at best 0 
the plot such as it is is so derivative and predictable that the ending is like a mercy killing 0 
i believe every one should see this movie as i think few people outside of south africa understand its past and what is being attempted in the truth and reconciliation process 1 
the story is beyond stupid 0 
does everything it should and more 1 
its very slow 0 
very good lunch spot 1 
from what my dinner companions told meeverything was very fresh with nice texture and taste 1 
its the one movie that never ceases to interest me simply because it keeps me alert as i try to attempt to decipher its meanings 1 
will never ever go back and have told many people what had happened 0 
seriously its not worth wasting your or your kids time on 0 
this is a great product sure beats using your fingers 1 
four stars for the food the guy in the blue shirt for his great vibe still letting us in to eat 1 
still its quite interesting and entertaining to follow 1 
the chicken i got was definitely reheated and was only ok the wedges were cold and soggy 0 
when my order arrived one of the gyros was missing 0 
they could serve it with just the vinaigrette and it may make for a better overall dish but it was still very good 1 
try them in the airport to experience some tasty food and speedy friendly service 1 
strike 2 who wants to be rushed 0 
the burger had absolutely no flavor the meat itself was totally bland the burger was overcooked and there was no charcoal flavor 0 
yes this film does require a rather significant amount of puzzlesolving but the pieces fit together to create a beautiful picture 1 
one of the most disappointing aspects is the lack of notable gore 0 
first of all there are enough racial stereotypes and racial jokes to offend everyone 0 
bland not a liking this place for a number of reasons and i dont want to waste time on bad reviewing ill leave it at that 0 
about half way through this film i started to dislike it 0 
crust is not good 0 
this scene is very strong and unpleasant 0 
i would have casted her in that role after ready the script 1 
the fries were great too 1 
dont miss it 1 
his losing his marbles so early in the proceedings is totally implausible and unconvincing 0 
worthless product 0 
overall i am psyched to have a phone which has all my appointments and contacts in and gets great reception 1 
great time family dinner on a sunday night 1 
it will drive you barking mad 0 
i am also very happy with the price 1 
cinematography the film was shot in an interesting way 1 
and it was boring 0 
worthless product 0 
50 down the drain 0 
exceptionally bad 0 
and i just love the colors 1 
it was a bit too sweet not really spicy enough and lacked flavor 0 
kind of flops around 0 
i have yet to run this new battery below two bars and thats three days without charging 1 
he surely doesnt know how to make a coherent action movie from the screenwriter of air force one who was only obliged to write the script just for a big sum of money 0 
it was absolutely amazing 1 
saggy floppy piece of junk 0 
the nano stated itmy son was dissapointed 0 
the plot was the same as pretty much every other cheap horror 0 
my 810 score is mostly for the plot 1 
the lines the cuts the audio everything is wrong 0 
and finally after all that we get to an ending that wouldve been great had it been handled by competent people and not jerry falwell 0 
his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic 1 
how can that bethe audio quality is poor 0 
i thought it was bad 0 
the potato chip order was sad i could probably count how many chips were in that box and it was probably around 12 0 
every time he opened his mouth you expect to hear you see kids pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show 0 
i dont know what the big deal is about this place but i wont be back yaall 0 
i went to bachi burger on a friends recommendation and was not disappointed 1 
there was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth but it didnt really work into the rest of the plot 0 
i hate to disagree with my fellow yelpers but my husband and i were so disappointed with this place 0 
how can you call yourself a steakhouse if you cant properly cook a steak i dont understand 0 
earbud piece breaks easily 0 
unfortunately we must have hit the bakery on leftover day because everything we ordered was stale 0 
oh the charger seems to work fine 1 
and the chef was generous with his time even came around twice so we can take pictures with him 1 
the film is way too long 0 
classywarm atmosphere fun and fresh appetizers succulent steaks baseball steak 1 
every element of this story was so over the top excessively phony and contrived that it was painful to sit through 0 
im so happy to be here 1 
simple lightweight and great fit 1 
my boyfriend and i sat at the bar and had a completely delightful experience 1 
crostini that came with the salad was stale 0 
best of luck to the rude and noncustomer service focused new management 0 
in fact this stinker smells like a directtovideo release 0 
however this didnt make up for the fact that overall this was a tremendously boring movie 0 
the film is way too long 0 
cute quaint simple honest 1 
this item is great installed it let it charged up overnite and it has been working good every since with no problems 1 
works great 1 
the waiter wasnt helpful or friendly and rarely checked on us 0 
it was horrendous 0 
yes this film does require a rather significant amount of puzzlesolving but the pieces fit together to create a beautiful picture 1 
very tough and very short on flavor 0 
the grilled chicken was so tender and yellow from the saffron seasoning 1 
this item is fantastic and works perfectly 1 
and finally after all that we get to an ending that wouldve been great had it been handled by competent people and not jerry falwell 0 
i would not recommend this place 0 
logitech bluetooth headset is a 10 1 
very cheap plastic creaks like an old wooden floor 0 
the stories were powerful explorations of the nature of man and of art 1 
great atmosphere friendly and fast service 1 
this phone is very fast with sending any kind of messages and web browsing is significantly faster than previous phones i have used 1 
this wonderful experience made this place a muststop whenever we are in town again 1 
food was great and so was the serivce 1 
its too bad the food is so damn generic 0 
even in my bmw 3 series which is fairly quiet i have trouble hearing what the other person is saying 0 
i will be back many times soon 1 
but it wasnt anything at all just one big yawn 0 
but the premise of the film was so ridiculous that the president of the us 0 
piece of trash 0 
i bought this to use with my kindle fire and absolutely loved it 1 
sorry i will not be getting food from here anytime soon 0 
much less than the jawbone i was going to replace it with 1 
i am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this 1 
join the club and get awesome offers via email 1 
which has more depth and character than the man underneath it 0 
i knew when i saw the film that more great things were to come from this gifted actor 1 
as for the service im a fan because its quick and youre being served by some nice folks 1 
secondly hitchcock pretty much perfected the thriller and chase movie 1 
every thing on phone work perfectly she like it 1 
poor quality 0 
the explosion of the gas tanks at the end was just as awful 0 
the memories are murky but i can only say that i enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show 1 
i wont say any more i dont like spoilers so i dont want to be one but i believe this film is worth your time 1 
i really recommend this faceplates since it looks very nice elegant and cool 1 
very windresistant 1 
things that went wrong they burned the saganaki 0 
does everything it should and more 1 
i wasnt the least bit interested 0 
good beer drink selection and good food selection 1 
if you do go see this movie bring a pillow or a girlfriendboyfriend to keep you occupied through out 0 
i liked it 1 
it is light has plenty of battery capacity and is very confortable to wear for somewhat extended periods of time 1 
it is light easy to use and has very clear reception and transmission 1 
unfortunately it did not work 0 
the entire audience applauded at the conclusion of the film 1 
food was average at best 0 
we got the food and apparently they have never heard of salt and the batter on the fish was chewy 0 
battery lasts only a few hours 0 
item does not match picture 0 
the story line is totally predictable 0 
the portion was huge 1 
the acting from all involved and that includes those like shatner and nimoy is bad and washed out and making them seem as old as they look in real life the special effects are tacky like when spock has to rescue kirk on a jet pack when he falls down from a mountain 0 
the dining space is tiny but elegantly decorated and comfortable 1 
theres really nothing bad i can say about this headset 0 
i have only had it for a few weeks but so far so good 1 
and the red curry had so much bamboo shoots and wasnt very tasty to me 0 
will never ever go back and have told many people what had happened 0 
if you have several dozen or several hundred contacts then imagine the fun of sending each of them one by one 0 
as always the evening was wonderful and the food delicious 1 
dont waste your time 0 
the headset fulfills my requirements so i am happy with my purchase 1 
really awful 0 
earbud piece breaks easily 0 
delete this film from your mind 0 
the explosion of the gas tanks at the end was just as awful 0 
i received my orders well within the shipping timeframe everything was in good working order and overall i am very excited to have this source 1 
the bottowm lineanother worthless cheap gimmick from sprint 0 
my fella got the huevos rancheros and they didnt look too appealing 0 
this is my new fav vegas buffet spot 1 
does not work for listening to music with the cingular 8125 0 
it showed exactly how the government and the scientist argued for humanity and the reasons of the gadget 1 
fantastic food 1 
if you love authentic mexican food and want a whole bunch of interesting yet delicious meats to choose from you need to try this place 1 
im a big fan of this series mostly due to anne rices style sensitivities and treatments 1 
trumbull on i love lucy 1 
there was so much hype over this phone that i assumed it was the best my mistake 0 
this movie is terrible 0 
great price too 1 
battery has no life 0 
that was funny 1 
the movie in movie situations in the beginning and through the game that is played with her by the acting coach are fascinating 1 
gave up trying to eat any of the crust teeth still sore 0 
dont buy it 0 
it really is impressive that the place hasnt closed down 0 
worthless product 0 
i could eat their bruschetta all day it is devine 1 
what did bother me was the slow service 0 
its uncomfortable and the sound quality is quite poor compared with the phone razr or with my previous wired headset that plugged into an lg 0 
very very disappointed ordered the 35 big bay plater 0 
even if you love bad movies do not watch this movie 0 
the puppets look really cheesy not in a good way like in the puppet master 80s flicks 0 
i connected my wifes bluetoothmotorola hs850 to my phone and it worked like a charm whether the phone was in my pocket or the case 1 
it quit working after id used it for about 18 months so i just purchased another one because this is the best headset ive ever owned 1 
this one is simply a disappointment 0 
its not what it says it is 0 
this results in the phone being either stuck at max volume or mute 0 
better than youd expect 1 
leopard print is wonderfully wild 1 
it was also the right balance of war and love 1 
if you are razr owneryou must have this 1 
it wasnt busy either also the building was freezing cold 0 
both of the egg rolls were fantastic 1 
i am far from a sushi connoisseur but i can definitely tell the difference between good food and bad food and this was certainly bad food 0 
at first glance it is a lovely bakery cafe nice ambiance clean friendly staff 1 
love this phone 1 
im glad i found this product on amazon it is hard to find it wasnt high priced 1 
i bought this to use with my kindle fire and absolutely loved it 1 
unless youre just out to visually collect all extant films of austens work you can skip this one 0 
this film has no redeeming features 0 
would not go back 0 
krussel always good 1 
the concert sequences just sucked 0 
i know he was a contract player with little control over his scripts but the acting was as bad as the script 0 
the service was terrible food was mediocre 0 
i mean really how do you get so famous for your fish and chips when its so terrible 0 
its aggravating 0 
recommend with confidence 1 
not even a hello we will be right with you 0 
for a product that costs as much as this one does i expect it to work far better and with greater ease than this thing does 0 
it is just the sort of pap that is screened in the afternoon to punish the unemployed for not having jobs 0 
this movie totally grates on my nerves 0 
however paul schrader has indeed made a film about mishima that is both superb complex 1 
does not work for listening to music with the cingular 8125 0 
what possesed me to get this junk i have no idea 0 
if good intentions made a film great then this film might be one of the greatest films ever made 1 
i was seated immediately 1 
its a long time since i was so entertained by a movie 1 
returned 8 hours later 0 
thus far have only visited twice and the food was absolutely delicious each time 1 
the seller is very understanding and patient i would definitely buy from them again 1 
glad i didnt pay to see it 0 
the plastic breaks really easy on this clip 0 
another thing i didnt really like is when a character got punched in the face a gallon of blood would spew forth soon after 0 
both do good jobs and are quite amusing 1 
att is not clear sound is very distorted and you have to yell when you talk 0 
crash is a depressing little nothing that provokes emotion but teaches you nothing if you already know racism and prejudice are bad things 0 
i never come again 0 
all of the main players are mesmerising 1 
i ordered the voodoo pasta and it was the first time id had really excellent pasta since going gluten free several years ago 1 
one of my favorite purchases ever 1 
its aggravating 0 
its a total package 1 
this is essentially a communications tool that does not communicate 0 
juano hernandez an exceptional actor who played supporting roles in many films of the era is a proud black man who is accused of murdering a white man in the south 1 
pricing is a bit of a concern at mellow mushroom 0 
the crÃªpe was delicate and thin and moist 1 
you could drive a semi truck into these holes 0 
this fixes all the problems 1 
i purchased this and within 2 days it was no longer working 0 
the characters are interesting and you want to find out more about them the longer the movie goes on and i think people will be surprised by who does and doesnt make it 1 
battery has no life 0 
her lines seem to have been written by a fifteen year old though they are trying oh so so hard to sound like how a fifteen year old would really um you know well talk 0 
delicious 1 
does everything it should and more 1 
the movie was so boring that i sometimes found myself occupied peaking in the paper instead of watching never happened during a columbo movie before 0 
highly recommended 1 
its pretty surprising that this wonderful film was made in 1949 as hollywood generally had its collective heads in the sand concerning black and white issues at that time 1 
seller shipped quickly and much cheaper than the competitors 1 
my husband and i ate lunch here and were very disappointed with the food and service 0 
what a waste 0 
he also came back to check on us regularly excellent service 1 
great product fast shipping 1 
her role was played well 1 
great case and price 1 
however paul schrader has indeed made a film about mishima that is both superb complex 1 
worked very well paired with a treo 700w and as a skype headset on my pc using a usb bluetooth transceiver 1 
the chains which im no fan of beat this place easily 0 
during several different 2 minute calls i experienced 5 drops and it was in an area that had 5 bars 0 
it was a pale color instead of nice and char and has no flavor 0 
the characters are interesting and you want to find out more about them the longer the movie goes on and i think people will be surprised by who does and doesnt make it 1 
i gave it 5 stars then and im giving it 5 stars now 1 
good food good service 1 
the reception is excellent 1 
but it wasnt anything at all just one big yawn 0 
similarly the delivery man did not say a word of apology when our food was 45 minutes late 0 
this was utterly confusing at first which caused me to lose a couple of very very important contacts 0 
i also didnt like the on button it felt like it would crack with use 0 
the film deserves strong kudos for taking this stand for having exceptional acting from its mostly lesserknown cast and for the superintelligent script that doesnt insult the audience or take the easy way out when it comes to white racism 1 
worst thai ever 0 
this is essentially a communications tool that does not communicate 0 
my only problem is i thought the actor playing the villain was a low rent michael ironside 0 
dont waste your time watching this rubbish nonresearched film 0 
the battery is working well as a replacement for the original that came with the phone over 2 years ago 1 
great product and price 1 
there is no plot here to keep you going in the first place 0 
the story itself is just predictable and lazy 0 
the portion was huge 1 
love this product 1 
we arent ones to make a scene at restaurants but i just dont get itdefinitely lost the love after this one 0 
i am pairing this with my iphone and i could not be happier with it so far 1 
so dont go there if you are looking for good food 0 
schrader has made a resume full of lousy amateurish films 0 
definitely will come back here again 1 
everything about this film is simply incredible 1 
it was just not a fun experience 1 
my sister has one also and she loves it 1 
so just beware 0 
she carries the movie well 1 
if you are reading this please dont go there 0 
cant upload ringtones from a third party 0 
but this movie is definitely a below average rent 0 
the veggitarian platter is out of this world 1 
this gets a 1 out of 10 simply because theres nothing lower 0 
there is nothing privileged about workingeating there 0 
worth every penny 1 
both do good jobs and are quite amusing 1 
i really recommend this faceplates since it looks very nice elegant and cool 1 
at any rate this film stinks its not funny and fulci should have stayed with giallo and supernatural zombie movies 0 
all the pretty pictures in the world cannot make up for a piece of work that is flawed at the core 0 
it is zillion times away from reality 0 
this is by far the worst purchase ive made on amazon 0 
the seasonal fruit was fresh white peach puree 1 
really pleased with this product so far 1 
highly recommend for any one who has a blue tooth phone 1 
what a disappointment 0 
it is not good 0 
after 20 minutes wait i got a table 0 
dee snider just plain sucks 0 
they have a plethora of salads and sandwiches and everything ive tried gets my seal of approval 1 
to my disbelief each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods i have ever tasted 0 
the food is very good for your typical bar food 1 
the script is a big flawed mess 0 
good prices 1 
there are so many problems i dont know where to start 0 
i didnt want the clip going over the top of my ear causing discomfort 0 
reasonably priced also 1 
both films are terrible but to the credit of the 1986 version it was watchable 0 
the best scene in the movie was when gerardo is trying to find a song that keeps running through his head 1 
the block was amazing 1 
my friend loved the salmon tartar 1 
black water is a thriller that manages to completely transcend its limitations its an indie flick by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience 1 
this is an unbelievable bargain 1 
i was totally fascinated by the music the dancing everything 1 
the manager was the worst 0 
fans of the genre will be in heaven 1 
the bathrooms are clean and the place itself is well decorated 1 
its so bad its actually worth seeing just for that reason 0 
the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach 0 
the croutons also taste homemade which is an extra plus 1 
phenomenal food service and ambiance 1 
the instruction manual is lacking 0 
a good commentary of todays love and undoubtedly a film worth seeing 1 
the flat reenactments dont hold your attention because they are emotionally adrift and stagy 0 
the inside is really quite nice and very clean 1 
best tacos in town by far 1 
integrated seamlessly with the motorola razr phone 1 
its just adorable seeing mickey playing turkey in the straw in a highly imaginative if occasionally cruel way 1 
i use this product in a motor control center where there is a lot of high voltage humming from the equipment and it works great 1 
unreliable im giving up 0 
headset works great was packaged nicely to avoid any damage 1 
this is one of the best movies out there that shows such strong sibling bond for each other 1 
just reading on the specs alone makes you say wow 1 
the music in the film is really nice too 1 
it failed to convey the broad sweep of landscapes that were a great part of the original 0 
it finds my cell phone right away when i enter the car 1 
the macarons here are insanely good 1 
the phone gets extremely hot 0 
the story is also both funny and poignant at times 1 
to be honest with you this is unbelievable nonsense and very foolish 0 
this convention never worked well in the past and certainly doesnt work here 0 
there are massive levels massive unlockable characters its just a massive game 1 
the acting as youd expect from this cast is top notch 1 
after the first charge kept going dead after 12 minutes 0 
the crÃªpe was delicate and thin and moist 1 
the script is was there a script 0 
service stinks here 0 
if she had not rolled the eyes we may have stayed not sure if we will go back and try it again 0 
linked to my phone without effort 1 
this gets a 1 out of 10 simply because theres nothing lower 0 
the service was not up to par either 0 
macbeth jason connery moved me to tears with his final monolog out brief candle outhe gave the sphere of moral decay and dark forces a human face which makes it the more interesting 1 
good service very clean and inexpensive to boot 1 
waitress was a little slow in service 0 
not much dialogue not much music the whole film was shot as elaborately and aesthetically like a sculpture 1 
would not reccommend 0 
service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is vegas and located inside the crystals shopping mall by aria 1 
it holds a charge for a long time is reasonably comfortable under longwearing conditions and the quality of sound is tremendous 1 
my drink was never empty and he made some really great menu suggestions 1 
things happen characters personalities change plot twists occur for no real reason other than that script calls for it 0 
not even good for camp value 0 
aside from its terrible lead this film has loads of other debits 0 
what did bother me was the slow service 0 
definitely worth checking out 1 
razr battery good buy 1 
wed definitely go back here again 1 
i literally vomited while watching this film 0 
ill give this film 10 out of 10 1 
im super pissd 0 
the phone loads super 1 
they dropped more than the ball 0 
we sat another ten minutes and finally gave up and left 0 
really awful 0 
started watching this but didnt believe in any of the characters 0 
they have a plethora of salads and sandwiches and everything ive tried gets my seal of approval 1 
its too bad the food is so damn generic 0 
very serious spoilers this movie was a huge disappointment 0 
yet plantronincs continues to use the same flawed charger design 0 
at any rate this film stinks its not funny and fulci should have stayed with giallo and supernatural zombie movies 0 
very disappointed and wondered how it could be in the oscar shortlist 0 
ive tried several different earpieces for my cell phone and this jabra one is the first one ive found that fits my ear comfortably 1 
if you plan to use this in a car forget about it 0 
avoid this establishment 0 
the directing seems too pretentious 0 
much less than the jawbone i was going to replace it with 1 
there were several moments in the movie that just didnt need to be there and were excruciatingly slow moving 0 
very easy to use 1 
this pair of headphones is the worst that i have ever had soundwise 0 
didnt laugh or even smile once 0 
reversible plug works great 1 
there is simply no excuse for something this poorly done 0 
i would definitely recommend the jabra bt250v for those who are looking for comfort clarity and a great price 1 
i have only had it for a few weeks but so far so good 1 
very bad performance plays angela bennett a computer expert who is at home all the time 0 
great phone 1 
as for the mains also uninspired 0 
the service was a little slow considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace 0 
another thing i didnt really like is when a character got punched in the face a gallon of blood would spew forth soon after 0 
nothing at all to recommend 0 
linksys should have some way to exchange a bad phone for a refurb unit or something 0 
food was delicious 1 
fast service 1 
the earpiece on this is too large or too heavyit keeps falling out of my ear 0
