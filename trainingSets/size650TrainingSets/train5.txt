the story is also both funny and poignant at times 1 
very comfortable 1 
on three different occasions i asked for well done or medium well and all three times i got the bloodiest piece of meat on my plate 0 
dee snider just plain sucks 0 
its a little geeky but i think thats its sex on toast and it rocks and oozes sex right down to its battery embedded sleek stylish leather case 1 
i was able to do voice dialing in the car with no problem 1 
i dont think ive ever gone to a movie and disliked it as much 0 
everyone is very attentive providing excellent customer service 1 
leopard print is wonderfully wild 1 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
better than youd expect 1 
this place is disgusting 0 
it was that loudglad to say that the plantronics 510 maintains a flawless connection to my cell and with no static during normal use 1 
i dont think well be going back anytime soon 0 
very comfortable 1 
save your money ive had this item for 11 months now 0 
as for the service im a fan because its quick and youre being served by some nice folks 1 
great food and great service in a clean and friendly setting 1 
useless phone simply deaf 0 
this is one of the best movies out there that shows such strong sibling bond for each other 1 
superb phone on a great network 1 
also great directing and photography 1 
these are the central themes of the film and they are handled ineptly stereotypically and with no depth of imagination 0 
what a piece of junk i lose more calls on this phone 0 
i started this review with two stars but im editing it to give it only one 0 
the very idea of it was lame take a minor character from a mediocre pg13 film and make a complete nonsequel while changing its tone to a pgrated family movie 0 
it also took her forever to bring us the check when we asked for it 0 
it feels poorly constructed the menus are difficult to navigate and the buttons are so recessed that it is difficult to push them 0 
what a mistake that was 0 
the macarons here are insanely good 1 
unfortunately it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees 0 
very disappointing 0 
the charger arrived within the promised timeframe but it did not work 0 
they brought a fresh batch of fries and i was thinking yay something warm but no 0 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
soggy and not good 0 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
my headset works just peachykeen 1 
level 5 spicy was perfect where spice didnt overwhelm the soup 1 
great place fo take out or eat in 1 
good value works fine power via usb car or wall outlet 1 
we made the drive all the way from north scottsdale and i was not one bit disappointed 1 
sorry i will not be getting food from here anytime soon 0 
the budget was evidently very limited 0 
i probably would not go here again 0 
lately they have been extremely nice and helpful on the phone 1 
the design is very good4 1 
total waste of time 0 
the plastic breaks really easy on this clip 0 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
overall i like there food and the service 1 
great time family dinner on a sunday night 1 
as for the mains also uninspired 0 
the mic is great 1 
a disappointment 0 
i might have gotten a defect but i would not risk buying it again because of the built quality alone 0 
brilliance indeed 1 
def coming back to bowl next time 1 
if you are looking for a good quality motorola headset keep looking this isnt it 0 
black water is a thriller that manages to completely transcend its limitations its an indie flick by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience 1 
i love being able to use one headset for both by landline and cell 1 
cant upload ringtones from a third party 0 
then the film just dropped the ball 0 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
when i received my pita it was huge it did have a lot of meat in it so thumbs up there 1 
he was very impressed when going from the original battery to the extended battery 1 
simple lightweight and great fit 1 
the only consistent thread holding the series together were the amazing performances of leni parker and anita laselva as the two taelons in quiet idealogical conflict 0 
drinks took close to 30 minutes to come out at one point 0 
he was terrible 0 
avoid this one if you can 0 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
the acting is fantastic the stories are seamlessly woven together and the dogs are splendid a must rent view or see 1 
a lot of websites have been rating this a very good phone and so do i 1 
enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film 1 
ive had no trouble accessing the internet downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions 1 
bad fit way too big 0 
i go to far too many places and ive never seen any restaurant that serves a 1 egg breakfast especially for 400 0 
i have only had it for a few weeks but so far so good 1 
this is a witty and delightful adaptation of the dr seuss book brilliantly animated by upas finest and thoroughly deserving of its academy award 1 
as a courtroom drama its compelling as an indictment on the american justice system its frightening 1 
needless to say we will never be back here again 0 
i would not recommend this place 0 
the camera really likes her in this movie 1 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
good servicecheck 1 
my sashimi was poor quality being soggy and tasteless 0 
it holds a charge for a long time is reasonably comfortable under longwearing conditions and the quality of sound is tremendous 1 
the charger worked for about a week and then completely stopped charging my phone 0 
i bought this phone as a replacement for my startac and have regretted it since 0 
worst customer service 0 
crust is not good 0 
i am pairing this with my iphone and i could not be happier with it so far 1 
earbud piece breaks easily 0 
the best electronics of the available fm transmitters 1 
if this premise sound stupid thats because it is 0 
my rating just 3 out of 10 0 
i could not understand what kind of idiot would produce this mess in the first place not to mention several season 0 
i dont understand how this garbage got on the shelves of the movie store its not even a real movie 0 
the acting by the whole cast could be put on a scale and balanced perfectly between overacting and underacting 0 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
the only very disappointing thing was there was no speakerphone 0 
i struggle to find anything bad to say about it 1 
i will come back here every time im in vegas 1 
i definitly recommend 1 
i gave it 5 stars because of the sound quality 1 
greatno problems at all 1 
were jerks on the phone 0 
plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job 1 
food arrived quickly 1 
i like steiners because its dark and it feels like a bar 1 
this fixes all the problems 1 
great pocket pc phone combination 1 
it was horrendous 0 
just reading on the specs alone makes you say wow 1 
worst phone ever 0 
we thought youd have to venture further away to get good sushi but this place really hit the spot that night 1 
after charging overnight these batteries work great 1 
we have gotten a lot of compliments on it 1 
very good product well made 1 
it presents a idyllic yet serious portrayal of the ups and downs of the characters lives 1 
i love this thing 1 
we received a white colored battery that goes dead after a couple hoursthe original used to last a week but still lasts longer than thereplacement 0 
much better than the other ayce sushi place i went to in vegas 1 
i probably would not go here again 0 
i ordered the voodoo pasta and it was the first time id had really excellent pasta since going gluten free several years ago 1 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
the battery is unreliable as well as the service use antena 0 
not a good bargain 0 
dee snider just plain sucks 0 
even when the women finally show up there is no sign of improvement the most expected things happen and by the time the film is over you might be far asleep 0 
the performances are not improved by improvisation because the actors now have twice as much to worry about not only whether theyre delivering the line well but whether the line itself is any good 0 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
the real disappointment was our waiter 0 
everything stinks 0 
its a piece of crap 0 
i had ordered a motorola data cable got a very well finished and working product 1 
its too bad the food is so damn generic 0 
the price was very good and with the free shipping and all it was a good purchase 1 
its too bad that everyone else involved didnt share crowes level of dedication to quality for if they did wed have a far better film on our hands than this subpar mess 0 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
gets a signal when other verizon phones wont 1 
i think not again 0 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
so flavorful and has just the perfect amount of heat 1 
sucked most of the stuff does not work with my phone 0 
the price was very good and with the free shipping and all it was a good purchase 1 
i highly recommend this movie for anyone interested in art poetry theater politics or japanese history 1 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
needless to say we will never be back here again 0 
this place was such a nice surprise 1 
soyo technology sucks 0 
very comfortable 1 
service was fantastic 1 
you need two hands to operate the screenthis software interface is decade old and cannot compete with new software designs 0 
i ordered the lemon raspberry ice cocktail which was also incredible 1 
as for the mains also uninspired 0 
it felt like a very gripping intelligent stage play but without the overly theatrical feeling one actually gets from watching people on a stage which plays on everyones terror of a white lie escalating to monstrous consequences 1 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
yes this film does require a rather significant amount of puzzlesolving but the pieces fit together to create a beautiful picture 1 
food is way overpriced and portions are fucking small 0 
conclusion i loved it 1 
it also took her forever to bring us the check when we asked for it 0 
seller shipped quickly and much cheaper than the competitors 1 
walked in and the place smelled like an old grease trap and only 2 others there eating 0 
highly entertaining at all angles 1 
the writer gorman bechard undoubtedly did his homework because all references are industry and characterage appropriate 1 
the bartender was also nice 1 
definitely a turn off for me i doubt ill be back unless someone else is buying 0 
i am so pleased to know such a modern day genius is out there letting is passion for art drive him and taking us as an audience with him 1 
i get absolutely horrible reception in my apartment where with other phones i have not had this problem 0 
this is an unbelievable bargain 1 
i loved their mussels cooked in this wine reduction the duck was tender and their potato dishes were delicious 1 
so far so good 1 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
and it was way to expensive 0 
it was equally awful 0 
their chow mein is so good 1 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
problem is that the ear loops are made of weak material and break easily 0 
i work in the hospitality industry in paradise valley and have refrained from recommending cibo any longer 0 
the scenes are often funny and occasionally touching as the characters evaluate their lives and where they are going 1 
my ribeye steak was cooked perfectly and had great mesquite flavor 1 
product is useless since it does not have enough charging current to charge the 2 cellphones i was planning to use it with 0 
battery has no life 0 
the sweet potato tots were good but the onion rings were perfection or as close as i have had 1 
not as good as i had hoped 0 
yeah the movie pretty much sucked 0 
this is a beautiful phone 1 
its practically perfect in all of them  a true masterpiece in a sea of faux masterpieces 1 
never going back 0 
i cant use this case because the smell is disgusting 0 
it is an hour and half waste of time following a bunch of very pretty high schoolers whine and cry about life 0 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
i mean in a realistic world she would never have gotten into that ballet repertory the whole thing was quite pathetic 0 
this movie is greatespecially if you enjoy visual arts 1 
excellent cast story line performances 1 
great earpiece 1 
the two main characters may be two of the most believable children i ever saw put on screen 1 
does not fit 0 
the interplay between martin and emilio contains the same wonderful chemistry we saw in wall street with martin and charlie 1 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
i saw mirrormask last night and it was an unsatisfactory experience 0 
so they performed 1 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
waitress was good though 1 
and the rest of it just sits there being awful with soldiers singing songs about the masculinity they pledge themselves to hairsplitting about purity the admiration of swords etc 0 
crisp and clear 1 
no im going to eat the potato that i found some strangers hair in it 0 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
plus it was wellpaced and suited its relatively short run time 1 
the spaghetti is nothing special whatsoever 0 
thats how id describe this painfully dreary timewaster of a film 0 
dont go here 0 
my experience was terrible this was my fourth bluetooth headset and while it was much more comfortable than my last jabra which i hated 0 
the spaghetti is nothing special whatsoever 0 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
i literally vomited while watching this film 0 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
food was great and so was the serivce 1 
im not sure what he was trying to do with this film 0 
the malta settings are as dry and as barren as the dialogue 0 
i dont think well be going back anytime soon 0 
john garfield ann revere lilli plmer william conrad canada leeand filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screenjames wong howe 1 
maybe there would be a reasonable explanation for this atrocity 0 
i would avoid this place if you are staying in the mirage 0 
in the span of an hour i had two people exclaim whoa is that the new phone on tv 1 
if you want a sandwich just go to any firehouse 1 
if it was to turn my good day feeling into a night of disturbing memories than i guess he succeeded 0 
this movie was kind of long in length but i enjoyed every minute of it 1 
so anyone near you will hear part of your conversation 0 
i guess i should have known that this place would suck because it is inside of the excalibur but i didnt use my common sense 0 
i am a fan of his this movie sucked really bad 0 
its this pandering to the audience that sabotages most of his films 0 
the burger i got the gold standard a 17 burger and was kind of disappointed 0 
service is also cute 1 
good prices 1 
i love the look and feel of samsung flipphones 1 
appetite instantly gone 0 
great movie 1 
do not buy if you want to use the holster 0 
by far the best cheesecurds we have ever had 1 
crisp and clear 1 
my husband said she was very rude did not even apologize for the bad food or anything 0 
worst phone ever 0 
so i basically threw my money out the window for nothing 0 
the food is good 1 
id say that would be the hardest decision honestly all of ms dishes taste how they are supposed to taste amazing 1 
both of the egg rolls were fantastic 1 
this does not fit the palm tungsten e2 and it broke the first time i tried to plug it in 0 
an italian reviewer called this a small great film and thats right 1 
i dont think there are any redeeming qualities in this remake 0 
none of it works just dont buy it 0 
after 20 minutes wait i got a table 0 
otherwise easy to install and use clear sound 1 
the only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port irda 0 
when my order arrived one of the gyros was missing 0 
an awesome new look for fall 2000 1 
he is one of my favourite directors and one of the most talented directors in the history of cinema 1 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
predictable but not a bad watch 1 
good servicecheck 1 
once you get inside youll be impressed with the place 1 
i recommend igo to anyone with different brand cell phonesmp3 players in the family 1 
it is super charged up for use as a small hybrid palmtopcameracellphone and excels in those roles 1 
dont waste your time watching this rubbish nonresearched film 0 
this one is simply a disappointment 0 
the presentation of the food was awful 0 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
great time family dinner on a sunday night 1 
the memories are murky but i can only say that i enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show 1 
youll love it 1 
the burrittos blah 0 
poor reliability 0 
their research and development division obviously knows what theyre doing 1 
the casting is also horrible cause all you see is a really really bad actors period 0 
my friend loved the salmon tartar 1 
id like to return it 0 
one of the most disappointing aspects is the lack of notable gore 0 
the food was terrible 0 
very serious spoilers this movie was a huge disappointment 0 
check it out 1 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
director paul matthews who also wrotedirected the weak 1995 monster movie grim clearly doesnt know how to pace his films 0 
the point is the journey a journey that touches every member of the family 1 
this second appearance of mickey mouse following the silent plane crazy earlier that year is probably his most famous filmmostly because it was so groundbreaking 1 
those burgers were amazing 1 
its reception is very very poor 0 
not only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic but it also managed to give away the entire movie and im not exaggerating every moment every plot point every joke is told in the trailer 0 
i have tried these cables with my computer and my ipod and it works just fine 1 
avoid at all costs 0 
the accompanied software is almost brilliant 1 
its very slow 0 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
they are so cool 1 
the service was terrible food was mediocre 0 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
but other than that the movie seemed to drag and the heroes didnt really work for their freedom 0 
does not work for listening to music with the cingular 8125 0 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
the cast is good 1 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
comfortable nice range good battery life 1 
works as described 1 
we loved the biscuits 1 
i bought two of them and neither will charge 0 
not impressed 0 
i did not bother contacting the company for few dollar product but i learned the lesson that i should not have bought this form online anyway 0 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
the story is beyond stupid 0 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
i checked everywhere and there is no feature for it which is really disappointing 0 
unreliable im giving up 0 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
avoid this one if you can 0 
yes this film does require a rather significant amount of puzzlesolving but the pieces fit together to create a beautiful picture 1 
i hate those things as much as cheap quality black olives 0 
the block was amazing 1 
we recently witnessed her poor quality of management towards other guests as well 0 
he is almost unbearable to watch on screen he has little to no charisma and terrible comedic timing 0 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
once your food arrives its meh 0 
definitely not worth the 3 i paid 0 
well never go again 0 
its a campy sort of film thats a joy to watch 1 
there is no plot or storyline 0 
the only possible way this movie could be redeemed would be as mst3k fodder 0 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
not even a hello we will be right with you 0 
well packaged arrived on time and works as intended 1 
the sound quality for the device is unacceptableunless you are in a really quiet area you almost hear nothing 0 
verizon tech support walked my through a few procedures none of which worked and i ended up having to do a hard reset wiping out all my data 0 
nothing special 0 
how can you call yourself a steakhouse if you cant properly cook a steak i dont understand 0 
this company charge me a restocking fee and still not given me my refund back 0 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
finally after three or four times the spring of the latch broke and i could not use it any longer on the visor 0 
its fits like a glove and is strong secure and durable 1 
the nano stated itmy son was dissapointed 0 
for that its worth checking out 1 
food arrived quickly 1 
this product is clearly not ready for prime time i dont care how cool it looks if you cant tell a call is coming in its worthless 0 
i would advise to not purchase this item it never worked very well 0 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
director paul matthews who also wrotedirected the weak 1995 monster movie grim clearly doesnt know how to pace his films 0 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
what a disappointment 0 
hell no will i go back 0 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
i highly recommend this movie for anyone interested in art poetry theater politics or japanese history 1 
total letdown i would much rather just go to the camelback flower shop and cartel coffee 0 
exactly what i wanted 1 
some highlights great quality nigiri here 1 
maybe its just their vegetarian fare but ive been twice and i thought it was average at best 0 
these products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet 0 
very unreliable service from tmobile 0 
the two main characters may be two of the most believable children i ever saw put on screen 1 
after one bite i was hooked 1 
the biggest complaint i have is the battery drains superfast 0 
avoid at any and all costs 0 
worst hour and a half of my lifeoh my gosh 0 
i have bought this nokia cell phone a few weeks ago and it was a nightmare 0 
considering the relations off screen between taylor and stanwyck it was surprising how little chemistry there was on screen between the two of them 0 
but the convoluted plot just didnt convince me and much of the film was watched with a weird questioning glance 0 
go to place for gyros 1 
but storm trooper is not even bad enough to make it to the list of wonderfully terrible movies 0 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
would not go back 0 
the shrimp tender and moist 1 
does not fit 0 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
love this phone 1 
this is a good joint 1 
this place is not worth your time let alone vegas 0 
the black eyed peas and sweet potatoes unreal 1 
i have had mine for about a year and this christmas i bought some for the rest of the family 1 
perhaps my phone is defective but people cannot hear me when i use this 0 
the acting sucked 0 
very nice and relaxing late night viewing 1 
reversible plug works great 1 
a lot of websites have been rating this a very good phone and so do i 1 
disappointing accessory from a good manufacturer 0 
they have horrible attitudes towards customers and talk down to each one when customers dont enjoy their food 0 
the black eyed peas and sweet potatoes unreal 1 
i had a pretty satifying experience 1 
it has everything i need and i couldnt ask for more 1 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
it has a great camera thats 2mp and the pics are nice and clear with great picture quality 1 
im in az all the time and now have my new spot 1 
the server was very negligent of our needs and made us feel very unwelcome i would not suggest this place 0 
its kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly its embarrassing how childlike the company is 0 
great place to eat reminds me of the little mom and pop shops in the san francisco bay area 1 
i dont think it would hold it too securly on your belt 0 
unless youre just out to visually collect all extant films of austens work you can skip this one 0 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
on the negative its insipid enough to cause regret for another 2 hours of life wasted in front of the screen 0 
i just wanted to leave 0 
worse theres an incredibly weak subplot thrown in that follows a little band of latterday mansonites as they go after a reporter whos working on a story on the anniversary of the killings 0 
over rated 0 
and sometimes it was so embarrassing that i had to look away 0 
every time he opened his mouth you expect to hear you see kids pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show 0 
it looked like a wonderful story 1 
feelings thoughtsgabriels discomfort during the danceall these intangibles leap to life and come within the viewers grasp in hustons portrayal 1 
good works fine 1 
there is really nothing for me at postinos hope your experience is better 0 
im not impressed with the concept or the food 0 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
i cant use this case because the smell is disgusting 0 
by the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant i was bored and didnt care what happened next and so i switched off 0 
while i managed to bend the leaf spring back in place the metal now has enough stress that it will break on the next drop 0 
there was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters 0 
everything about this film is simply incredible 1 
this is an unbelievable bargain 1 
this phone is slim and light and the display is beautiful 1 
my phone doesnt slide around my car now and the grip prevents my phone from slipping out of my hand 1 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
judith light is one of my favorite actresses and i think she does a superb job in this film 1 
i struggle to find anything bad to say about it 1 
there are many continuity errors one other user commented on different cars in the garage joes glassesthe one that got to me the most was the fact joes facial hair configuration seemed to change from scene to scene 0 
disapointing results 0 
no additional ear gels provided and no instructions whatsoever 0 
highly recommend for any one who has a blue tooth phone 1 
you need two hands to operate the screenthis software interface is decade old and cannot compete with new software designs 0 
waited and waited and waited 0 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
this is the kind of money that is wasted properly 1 
other than that the leather is nice and soft the fit is very tight the cut out for the face is a good shape 1 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
the movie lacks visual interest drama expression of feeling and celebration of the very patriotism that underlines the narrative 0 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
i had a salad with the wings and some ice cream for dessert and left feeling quite satisfied 1 
dont buy it 0 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
the range is very decent ive been able to roam around my house with the phone in the living room with no receptionsound quality issues 1 
but in terms of the writing its very fresh and bold 1 
a greasy unhealthy meal 0 
waste of 13 bucks 0 
people who like european films and art movies will like this movie 1 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
these are the nicest restaurant owners ive ever come across 1 
its kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly its embarrassing how childlike the company is 0 
the characters are interesting and you really care for them 1 
the salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop which was perfectly cooked 1 
the 12 mega pixel camera being a part of a phone is reasonably good7 1 
everything captain howdy says is either laughable or just plain stupid 0 
sorry i will not be getting food from here anytime soon 0 
both the hot sour the egg flower soups were absolutely 5 stars 1 
very well made and fits my surefire gx2 perfectly 1 
awesome service and food 1 
did not like at all 0 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in 0 
the battery is completely useless to me 0 
not good for the money 0 
their chow mein is so good 1 
great it was new packaged nice works good no problems and it came in less time then i expected 1 
it is a joy to use 1 
so i bought about 10 of these and saved alot of money 1 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
not enough volume 0 
summary the witticisms werent witty 0 
none of it works just dont buy it 0 
nothing special 0 
bad day or not i have a very low tolerance for rude customer service people it is your job to be nice and polite wash dishes otherwise 0 
check it out 1 
dont miss it 1 
my girlfriends veal was very bad 0 
this movie totally grates on my nerves 0 
food was below average 0 
freezes frequently4 0 
i have purchased these for both family and friends and all enjoy their clarity and ease of use 1 
i couldnt think of a better way to end the film but a smile on my face great way to wrap up an amazing film and trilogy 1 
this is a great restaurant at the mandalay bay 1 
id advise anyone to go and see it 1 
very well made and fits my surefire gx2 perfectly 1 
if you hate earbugs avoid this phone by all means 0 
the basic premise is wasted since it is sidelined by the inexplicable focus on the documentary crew 0 
my girlfriends veal was very bad 0 
see it 1 
everything about this product is wrongfirst 0 
drinks took close to 30 minutes to come out at one point 0 
i like steiners because its dark and it feels like a bar 1 
i really like this product over the motorola because it is allot clearer on the ear piece and the mic 1 
i would not recommend this place 0 
first of all there are enough racial stereotypes and racial jokes to offend everyone 0 
if you want healthy authentic or ethic food try this place 1 
i did not expect this to be so good 1 
setup went very smoothly 1 
none of the new ones have ever quite worked properly 0 
this is definitely one of the better documentaries i have seen looking at family relationships and marriage 1 
this was reflected not only in the cast but also in the belowpar script which borrowed much from the earlier classic 0 
that said our mouths and bellies were still quite pleased 1 
mark my words this is one of those cult films like evil dead 2 or phantasm that people will still be discovering and falling in love with 20 30 40 years down the line 1 
everything was perfect the night we were in 1 
the real disappointment was our waiter 0 
good quality 1 
lets start with all the problemsthe acting especially from the lead professor was very very bad 0 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
not worth it 0 
all the pretty pictures in the world cannot make up for a piece of work that is flawed at the core 0 
reversible plug works great 1 
what a mistake that was 0 
the casting is also horrible cause all you see is a really really bad actors period 0 
the cinematographyif it can be called thatsucked 0 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
the story which was told so eloquently by francis ford coppola 25 years earlier really unfolds gradually and leaves room for the characters to develop 1 
i never come again 0 
and those baby owls were adorable 1 
items stated as included from the description are not included 0 
does everything it should and more 1 
well packaged arrived on time and works as intended 1 
total brunch fail 0 
because both ears are occupied background is not distracting at all 1 
excellent product 1 
i dont know what kind it is but they have the best iced tea 1 
the acting helps the writing along very well maybe the idiotsavant sister could have been played better and it is a real joy to watch 1 
the majority of the logitech earbud headsets failed 0 
not a weekly haunt but definitely a place to come back to every once in a while 1 
last time buying from you 0 
this film offers many delights and surprises 1 
the real disappointment was our waiter 0 
the macarons here are insanely good 1 
i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
hayao miyazakis latest and eighth film for studio ghibili gake no ue no ponyo ponyo on the cliff by the sea is a wonderfully fun and imaginative look at childhood 1 
what on earth is irons doing in this film 0 
i understand that its supposed to be a cheap popcorn comedy but that doesnt mean that it has to completely insult our intelligence and have writing so incredibly hackneyed that it borders on offensive 0 
all in all im quite satisfied with this purchase 1 
bad script bad direction and horrible acting make this one plain bad 0 
the vanilla ice cream was creamy and smooth while the profiterole choux pastry was fresh enough 1 
any ring toneoverall good phone to buy 1 
for service i give them no stars 0 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
this movie was kind of long in length but i enjoyed every minute of it 1 
my sanyo has survived dozens of drops on blacktop without ill effect 1 
great value 1 
the only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port irda 0 
couldnt figure it out 0 
the sound quality for the device is unacceptableunless you are in a really quiet area you almost hear nothing 0 
last time buying from you 0 
im glad i found this product on amazon it is hard to find it wasnt high priced 1 
not only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic but it also managed to give away the entire movie and im not exaggerating every moment every plot point every joke is told in the trailer 0 
this is a disgrace 0 
generous portions and great taste 1 
it even has its sweet moments 1 
no im going to eat the potato that i found some strangers hair in it 0 
every element of this story was so over the top excessively phony and contrived that it was painful to sit through 0 
jawbone era is awesome too 1 
mediocre food 0 
i hate writing bad reviews about films especially those in which i really like the star but this film is so bad i dont believe for one second that anyone could have been proud of it 0 
the ending is so so perfect youll shed a tear 1 
the chicken i got was definitely reheated and was only ok the wedges were cold and soggy 0 
poor voice clarity 0 
i just saw this film and i recommend it 1 
the food was excellent and service was very good 1 
this game rocks 1 
so badwellits just bad 0 
this product is clearly not ready for prime time i dont care how cool it looks if you cant tell a call is coming in its worthless 0 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
i love the look and feel of samsung flipphones 1 
i purchased this and within 2 days it was no longer working 0 
as for the mains also uninspired 0 
the design might be ergonomic in theory but i could not stand having these in my ear 0 
the dining space is tiny but elegantly decorated and comfortable 1 
dont waste your time here 0 
probably never coming back and wouldnt recommend it 0 
these are certainly very comfortable and functionality is decent 1 
total waste of time 0 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
special mention should be made of the superb music score and sound effects which are an integral element in helping to make this such a memorable and enjoyable cartoon 1 
one of the most disappointing aspects is the lack of notable gore 0 
the turkey and roast beef were bland 0 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
the cashew cream sauce was bland and the vegetables were undercooked 0 
okay i like to consider myself a fair critic so ill give credit where credits duethe creature effects were actually pretty cool 1 
the worst one of the series 0 
i am so pleased to know such a modern day genius is out there letting is passion for art drive him and taking us as an audience with him 1 
i was very disappointed in the movie 0 
i can assure you that you wont be disappointed 1 
obviously they have a terrible customer service so you get what you pay for 0 
this is a great restaurant at the mandalay bay 1 
its very attractive and appears to be of good quality 1 
in short dont bother with this movie 0 
so far it has worked like a charm 1 
this is was due to the fact that it took 20 minutes to be acknowledged then another 35 minutes to get our foodand they kept forgetting things 0 
piece of trash 0 
yes its that bad 0 
and then tragedy struck 0 
its not hard to make a decent hamburger 0 
it wasnt busy either also the building was freezing cold 0 
i dont think ill be running back to carlys anytime soon for food 0 
i own a jabra earset and was very happy with it but the sound quality especially outgoing on this is better 1 
works well 1 
there was hardly any meat 0 
if you hate earbugs avoid this phone by all means 0 
star trek v the final frontier is the worst in the series 0 
definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly will return next time im in vegas 1 
classywarm atmosphere fun and fresh appetizers succulent steaks baseball steak 1 
best fish ive ever had in my life 1 
great time family dinner on a sunday night 1 
2 thumbs up to this seller 1 
what on earth is irons doing in this film 0 
there is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again 0 
cant store anything but phone numbers to sim 0 
these products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet 0 
i believe every one should see this movie as i think few people outside of south africa understand its past and what is being attempted in the truth and reconciliation process 1 
we waited for thirty minutes to be seated although there were 8 vacant tables and we were the only folks waiting 0 
for the price on amazon it is an excellent product which i would highly recommend 1 
bt50 battery junk 0 
it wasnt busy either also the building was freezing cold 0 
similarly the delivery man did not say a word of apology when our food was 45 minutes late 0 
not loud enough and doesnt turn on like it should 0 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
if you do go see this movie bring a pillow or a girlfriendboyfriend to keep you occupied through out 0 
owners are really great people 1 
great bluetooth 1 
this movie is so awesome 1 
schrader has made a resume full of lousy amateurish films 0 
great food and great service in a clean and friendly setting 1 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
i thought errol flynn was brilliant as custer and has since become my favourite actor 1 
i was seated immediately 1 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
this game rocks 1 
if i take a picture the battery drops a bar and starts beeping letting me know its dieing 0 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
its been my choice headset for yearsgreat sound good volume good noise cancellation 1 
it is unusable in a moving car at freeway speed 0 
if it was to turn my good day feeling into a night of disturbing memories than i guess he succeeded 0 
could not get strong enough signal 0 
i think not again 0 
enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film 1 
it is rare when a filmmaker takes the time to tell a worthy moral tale with care and love that doesnt fall into the trap of being overly syrupy or over indulgent 1 
they do not last forever but is not overly expensive to replaceeasy to operate and the sound is much better than others i have tried 1 
yes i am simplifying things here for the sake of brevity for this really is at the core of the problems with this film it has too much going on without any real fulfilling explanation 0 
ordered an appetizer and took 40 minutes and then the pizza another 10 minutes 0 
a very very very slowmoving aimless movie about a distressed drifting young man 0
