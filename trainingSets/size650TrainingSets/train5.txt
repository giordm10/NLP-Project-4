authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
you also cannot take pictures with it in the case because the lense is covered 0 
the whole experience was underwhelming and i think well just go to ninja sushi next time 0 
the stories were as unbelievable as the actors 0 
this is some seriously good pizza and im an expertconnisseur on the topic 1 
excellent service 1 
this allows the possibility of double booking for the same date and time after the first 0 
does not work 0 
there are so many problems i dont know where to start 0 
it was so boring 0 
it clicks into place in a way that makes you wonder how long that mechanism would last 0 
looks great and is strong 1 
the food was very good 1 
hes a national treasure 1 
i work in the hospitality industry in paradise valley and have refrained from recommending cibo any longer 0 
i love this place 1 
i am so tired of clich√©s that is just lazy writing and here they come in thick and fast 0 
the scenes are often funny and occasionally touching as the characters evaluate their lives and where they are going 1 
hard to judge whether these sides were good because we were grossed out by the melted styrofoam and didnt want to eat it for fear of getting sick 0 
judith light is one of my favorite actresses and i think she does a superb job in this film 1 
hitchcock is a great director 1 
terrible my car will not accept this cassette 0 
they were goldencrispy and delicious 1 
punishment park is a brilliant piece of cinema 1 
not tasty and the texture was just nasty 0 
id love to go back 1 
the secondary plot line is incomprehensible and its relation to the primary plot line is mystifying 0 
the acting is beyond abysmal 0 
all this movie does is make you sick watching all these slackers make excuses for their stupid actions for 90 minutes 0 
the phone gets extremely hot 0 
yet i enjoy watching it 1 
this was reflected not only in the cast but also in the belowpar script which borrowed much from the earlier classic 0 
we sat another ten minutes and finally gave up and left 0 
it fits my ear well and is comfortable on 1 
i had to go to a store and bought a new nokia phone which is working great 1 
its a feelgood film and thats how i felt when i came out of the cinema 1 
if only someone involved with it knew how to string together narrative 0 
omg the food was delicioso 1 
well just if you keep thinking how bad it is 0 
case was more or less an extra that i originally put on but later discarded because it scratched my ear 0 
unfortunately it did not work 0 
the only suspense i was feeling was the frustration at just how retarded the girls were 0 
it clicks into place in a way that makes you wonder how long that mechanism would last 0 
it is an hour and half waste of time following a bunch of very pretty high schoolers whine and cry about life 0 
there are the usual hitchcock logic flaws 0 
for a self proclaimed coffee cafe i was wildly disappointed 0 
too bad cause i know its family owned i really wanted to like this place 0 
his costars dont fare much better with people like morgan freeman jonah hill and ed helms just wasted 0 
it looses connection to the phone even when it is within a couple feet between the two 0 
great phone 1 
at any rate this film stinks its not funny and fulci should have stayed with giallo and supernatural zombie movies 0 
do not make the same mistake as me 0 
go to place for gyros 1 
returned 8 hours later 0 
they made this case too small and is very difficult to install 0 
you get incredibly fresh fish prepared with care 1 
unfortunately it will not recharge my iphone 4s despite connecting it from multiple power sources imac external battery wall outlet etc 0 
the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach 0 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
lots of holes in the script 0 
i wont be back 0 
this film offers many delights and surprises 1 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
the sweet potato tots were good but the onion rings were perfection or as close as i have had 1 
and considering the two of us left there very full and happy for about 20 you just cant go wrong 1 
this is a masterful piece of filmmaking with many themes simmering and occasionally boiling over in this warts and all study of the poets bohemian selfindulgent wartime years that span the aerial bombardments of london and the outward tranquillity of a welsh coastal retreat the borderlines between friendship lust and love dedication to art and experience versus practical concerns jealousy rivalry cowardice and egotism versus heroism and selfsacrifice and more 1 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
if you check the directors filmography on this site you will see why this film didnt have a chance 0 
but even the talented carrell cant save this 0 
you can find better movies at youtube 0 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1 
i think this restaurant suffers from not trying hard enough 0 
its very slow 0 
lange had become a great actress 1 
it lasts less than 3o minutes if i actually try to use the phonemy wife has the same phone with the same problem 0 
i have been to very few places to eat that under no circumstances would i ever return to and this tops the list 0 
truly awful 0 
excellent product 1 
do not buy do not buyit sucks 0 
which is precisely why i am giving it such a bad review 0 
i never come again 0 
not too screamy not to masculine but just right 1 
he is an amazing film artist one of the most important whoever lived 1 
what a disappointment 0 
so flavorful and has just the perfect amount of heat 1 
drinks took close to 30 minutes to come out at one point 0 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
it will drive you barking mad 0 
both the hot sour the egg flower soups were absolutely 5 stars 1 
timely shipment and quality product 1 
that company is a joke 0 
so good i am going to have to review this place twice once hereas a tribute to the place and once as a tribute to an event held here last night 1 
my 810 score is mostly for the plot 1 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
a great way to finish a great 1 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
its a sad movie but very good 1 
i go to far too many places and ive never seen any restaurant that serves a 1 egg breakfast especially for 400 0 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
he came running after us when he realized my husband had left his sunglasses on the table 1 
i would avoid this place if you are staying in the mirage 0 
im so happy to be here 1 
what possesed me to get this junk i have no idea 0 
the best scene in the movie was when gerardo is trying to find a song that keeps running through his head 1 
i do not know if this was emilio estevezs directorial debut but the pacing the interplay and development of the characters as well as some clever camera work surrounding the character estevez plays all suggest a natural eye 1 
ordered a double cheeseburger got a single patty that was falling apart picture uploaded yeah still sucks 0 
if you are reading this please dont go there 0 
but when i check voice mail at night the keypad backlight turns off a few seconds into the first message and then im lost 0 
plus its only 8 bucks 1 
i had a salad with the wings and some ice cream for dessert and left feeling quite satisfied 1 
it dit not work most of the time with my nokia 5320 0 
it is just the sort of pap that is screened in the afternoon to punish the unemployed for not having jobs 0 
it kept getting worse and worse so now im officially done 0 
the real killer is the volume and of course it breaking 0 
the real disappointment was our waiter 0 
i checked everywhere and there is no feature for it which is really disappointing 0 
customer service was terrible 0 
do not buy if you want to use the holster 0 
there is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again 0 
call me a nut but i think this is one of the best movies ever 1 
our server was very nice and even though he looked a little overwhelmed with all of our needs he stayed professional and friendly until the end 1 
thanks good a movie like this was done and released 1 
once your food arrives its meh 0 
didnt laugh or even smile once 0 
a very good film indeed about great and unconditional love 1 
the sets especially designed to work with the camera are amazingstylized beautiful and effective 1 
if you love death and decay and shakespears lyrics this is the one 1 
love this phone 1 
i do not know if this was emilio estevezs directorial debut but the pacing the interplay and development of the characters as well as some clever camera work surrounding the character estevez plays all suggest a natural eye 1 
i would definitely recommend the jabra bt250v for those who are looking for comfort clarity and a great price 1 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
this does not fit the palm tungsten e2 and it broke the first time i tried to plug it in 0 
also if your phone is dropped this case is not going to save it specially when dropped face down 0 
i mean this in a terrible way 0 
its pretty easy 1 
the inside is really quite nice and very clean 1 
his losing his marbles so early in the proceedings is totally implausible and unconvincing 0 
i dont think it would hold it too securly on your belt 0 
i especially love the long battery life 1 
very unreliable service from tmobile 0 
come hungry leave happy and stuffed 1 
this is by far the worst purchase ive made on amazon 0 
not worth it 0 
our server was very nice and even though he looked a little overwhelmed with all of our needs he stayed professional and friendly until the end 1 
the design is very odd as the ear clip is not very comfortable at all 0 
this pda rocks 1 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
case was more or less an extra that i originally put on but later discarded because it scratched my ear 0 
if you check the directors filmography on this site you will see why this film didnt have a chance 0 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
sam shepards portrayal of a gung ho marine was sobering 1 
the two main characters may be two of the most believable children i ever saw put on screen 1 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
i want my money back 0 
it only recognizes the phone as its storage device 0 
excellent starter wireless headset 0 
excellent dualpurpose headset 1 
customer service was terrible 0 
audio quality is poor very poor 0 
i dont know exactly what it is about this movie but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our familys memories 1 
there was no chemistry between ben affleck and sandra bullock in this film and i couldnt understand why he would consider even leaving his wifetobe for this chick that he supposedly was knocked out by 0 
i mean this in a terrible way 0 
the writers were smack on and i think the best actors and actresses were a bonus to the showthese characters were so real 1 
a piece of junk that broke after being on my phone for 2 days 0 
then i exchanged for the same phone even that had the same problem 0 
then the film just dropped the ball 0 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
the manager was the worst 0 
i mean this in a terrible way 0 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
dont waste your time watching this rubbish nonresearched film 0 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
it was quite comfortable in the ear 1 
there was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters 0 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
its been my choice headset for yearsgreat sound good volume good noise cancellation 1 
if you see it you should probably just leave it on the shelf 0 
i had the mac salad and it was pretty bland so i will not be getting that again 0 
it was a waste of my money 0 
this is an unbelievable bargain 1 
very disappointing 0 
you cant relate with them hell you barely can understand them 0 
echo problemvery unsatisfactory 0 
nice spicy and tender 1 
its not what it says it is 0 
great pork sandwich 1 
add betty white and jean smart and you have a great cast everyone played their parts really well 1 
everything is appalling 0 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
best ive found so far ive tried 2 other bluetooths and this one has the best quality for both me and the listener as well as ease of using 1 
in addition it feels amp looks as if the phone is all lightweight cheap plastic 0 
the potatoes were great and so was the biscuit 1 
great for ipods too 1 
its pretty surprising that this wonderful film was made in 1949 as hollywood generally had its collective heads in the sand concerning black and white issues at that time 1 
it definitely was not as good as my s11 1 
fantastic earphones 1 
whatever prompted such a documentary is beyond me 0 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
oh and i forgot to also mention the weird color effect it has on your phone 0 
good audio quality 1 
the characters are interesting and you really care for them 1 
four stars for the food the guy in the blue shirt for his great vibe still letting us in to eat 1 
i had to wait over 30 minutes to get my drink and longer to get 2 arepas 0 
if there were zero stars i would give it zero stars 0 
doesnt hold charge 0 
all the bread is made inhouse 1 
i love this device 1 
waste your money on this game 1 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
i believe that this place is a great stop for those with a huge belly and hankering for sushi 1 
this movie contained an allstar cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i havent seen before 1 
very bad performance plays angela bennett a computer expert who is at home all the time 0 
helen baxendale is a very credible lady macbeth who can be very cheerfull at times and sometimes she just looks like a naughty girl but deadly in her taste for blood and evil 1 
great food and service huge portions and they give a military discount 1 
waste your money on this game 1 
their monster chicken fried steak and eggs is my all time favorite 1 
i have been to very few places to eat that under no circumstances would i ever return to and this tops the list 0 
pricing is a bit of a concern at mellow mushroom 0 
linked to my phone without effort 1 
this greedy corporation will never see another dime from me 0 
but it wasnt anything at all just one big yawn 0 
this is one of peter watkins most accessible films 1 
we ordered the duck rare and it was pink and tender on the inside with a nice char on the outside 1 
this film has no redeeming features 0 
unfortunately it did not work 0 
my only complaint is the standard sound volume is a little low even when turned up to 5of 5 0 
this does not fit the palm tungsten e2 and it broke the first time i tried to plug it in 0 
the seller is very understanding and patient i would definitely buy from them again 1 
a very good film indeed about great and unconditional love 1 
when i saw it in the theater i thought i was going to be sick 0 
once you get inside youll be impressed with the place 1 
the poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying 0 
i think i was one of the people who found this another one of roths pearls 1 
the cr√™pe was delicate and thin and moist 1 
good item low price 1 
buttons are too small 0 
great time family dinner on a sunday night 1 
perhaps i caught them on an off night judging by the other reviews but im not inspired to go back 0 
obviously they have a terrible customer service so you get what you pay for 0 
the warmth it generates is in contrast to its austere backdrop 1 
very well made and fits my surefire gx2 perfectly 1 
after the disappointing dinner we went elsewhere for dessert 0 
very very disappointed ordered the 35 big bay plater 0 
this movie is greatespecially if you enjoy visual arts 1 
both great 1 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
a piece of cinematic garbage captured on celluloid 0 
i find this inexcusable and so will probably be returning this phone and perhaps changing carriers 0 
this case has passed the one year mark and while it shows signs of wear it is 100 functional 1 
this was a different cut than the piece the other day but still wonderful and tender s well as well flavored 1 
good product incredible value 1 
overall i was not impressed and would not go back 0 
the nachos are a must have 1 
i sat riveted to the tv screen 1 
i have had problems wit hit dropping signal and more 0 
the sides are delish mixed mushrooms yukon gold puree white corn beateous 1 
do not buy do not buyit sucks 0 
they brought a fresh batch of fries and i was thinking yay something warm but no 0 
very tough and very short on flavor 0 
my ribeye steak was cooked perfectly and had great mesquite flavor 1 
i gave it 5 stars then and im giving it 5 stars now 1 
both do good jobs and are quite amusing 1 
dont go here 0 
i love this cable it allows me to connect any miniusb device to my pc 1 
they could be used as exemplars for any set designer 1 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
this place is handsdown one of the best places to eat in the phoenix metro area 1 
all in all its an insult to ones intelligence and a huge waste of money 0 
lucy bell is so much higher than this crap and for her to sink this low is quite depressing 0 
im glad i found this product on amazon it is hard to find it wasnt high priced 1 
people couldnt hear me talk and i had to pull out the earphone and talk on the phone 0 
i had a salad with the wings and some ice cream for dessert and left feeling quite satisfied 1 
the foreigner is not worth one second of your time 0 
mishima is extremely uninteresting 0 
what a mistake 0 
very good quality though 1 
host staff were for lack of a better word bitches 0 
it lasts less than 3o minutes if i actually try to use the phonemy wife has the same phone with the same problem 0 
hard to judge whether these sides were good because we were grossed out by the melted styrofoam and didnt want to eat it for fear of getting sick 0 
you truly take this journey through the eyes and soul of a child 1 
we asked for the bill to leave without eating and they didnt bring that either 0 
just what i wanted 1 
her lines seem to have been written by a fifteen year old though they are trying oh so so hard to sound like how a fifteen year old would really um you know well talk 0 
but i definitely would not eat here again 0 
o my gosh the best phone i have ever had 1 
the salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop which was perfectly cooked 1 
i wear glasses and it fits fine with them 1 
worst customer service 0 
this totally unfunny movie is so over the top and pathetic and unrealistic that throughout the whole 90 minutes of utter torture i probably looked at my watch about 70000 times 0 
the movie had you on the edge of your seat and made you somewhat afraid to go to your car at the end of the night 1 
bought mainly for the charger which broke soon after purchasing 0 
john wayne did an incredible job for being so young in the movie industry 1 
the cast of veteran actors are more than just a nostalgia trip 1 
so anyone near you will hear part of your conversation 0 
just as good as when i had it more than a year ago 1 
this gets a 1 out of 10 simply because theres nothing lower 0 
the scenes with the ohsomature neighbourgirl are a misplace 0 
things that went wrong they burned the saganaki 0 
go and see it 1 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
the descriptions said yum yum sauce and another said eel sauce yet another said spicy mayowell none of the rolls had sauces on them 0 
my first visit to hiro was a delight 1 
id say that would be the hardest decision honestly all of ms dishes taste how they are supposed to taste amazing 1 
that being said for a phone the camera is very nice many cool effects to play with and video is decent as well 1 
very poor service 0 
it has been a winner for us 1 
i believe that pitch black was done well 1 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
a standout scene 1 
then our food came out disappointment ensued 0 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
it is super charged up for use as a small hybrid palmtopcameracellphone and excels in those roles 1 
in the span of an hour i had two people exclaim whoa is that the new phone on tv 1 
both of the egg rolls were fantastic 1 
what this film lacks is a convincing script 0 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
avoid at any and all costs 0 
they refuse to refund or replace 0 
this is a great product sure beats using your fingers 1 
by the time the film ended i not only disliked it i despised it 0 
service is quick and friendly 1 
truly awful 0 
everything about it is just bad 0 
i think the most wonderful parts literally full of wonder are the excerpts from his works 1 
aside from its terrible lead this film has loads of other debits 0 
in fact i liked it better than interview with a vampire and i liked this lestat stuart townsend better than cruises attempt 1 
things happen characters personalities change plot twists occur for no real reason other than that script calls for it 0 
the volume for the ringer is real good you have choices how loud 1 
its a feelgood film and thats how i felt when i came out of the cinema 1 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
its pure brilliance 1 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
sauce was tasteless 0 
useless phone simply deaf 0 
the result is a powerhouse achievement made more timely now perhaps because of our cultures disturbing fascination with celebrity and its distorted interpretations of fame 1 
better than youd expect 1 
first time going but i think i will quickly become a regular 1 
ample portions and good prices 1 
the han nan chicken was also very tasty 1 
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
items stated as included from the description are not included 0 
ive owned this phone for 7 months now and can say that its the best mobile phone ive had 1 
the death row scenes were entirely unmoving 0 
my phone doesnt slide around my car now and the grip prevents my phone from slipping out of my hand 1 
if there were zero stars i would give it zero stars 0 
the good cinematography also makes her and monica bellucci look very beautiful 1 
setup couldnt have been simpler 1 
i love this place 1 
dont waste your money 0 
thats how id describe this painfully dreary timewaster of a film 0 
i liked it 1 
my sanyo has survived dozens of drops on blacktop without ill effect 1 
to my disbelief each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods i have ever tasted 0 
the only place good for this film is in the garbage 0 
we had so much to say about the place before we walked in that he expected it to be amazing but was quickly disappointed 0 
good food good service 1 
we have tried 2 units and they both failed within 2 months pros 0 
it definitely was not as good as my s11 1 
a very very very slowmoving aimless movie about a distressed drifting young man 0 
sprint charges for this service 0 
bacon is hella salty 1 
integrated seamlessly with the motorola razr phone 1 
the plot well i said id let that one go 0 
will never ever go back and have told many people what had happened 0 
the atmosphere is modern and hip while maintaining a touch of coziness 1 
will not be back 0 
not sure who was more lost the flat characters or the audience nearly half of whom walked out 0 
this wonderful experience made this place a muststop whenever we are in town again 1 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
i will never forget it now 1 
it deserves strong love 1 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
at any rate this film stinks its not funny and fulci should have stayed with giallo and supernatural zombie movies 0 
very funny 1 
service is also cute 1 
whatever prompted such a documentary is beyond me 0 
they are so cool 1 
stay away from this store be careful 0 
from here on the widmark character turns unintentionally comical 0 
awesome service and food 1 
then the film just dropped the ball 0 
today was my first taste of a buldogis gourmet hot dog and i have to tell you it was more than i ever thought possible 1 
now imagine that every single one of those decisions was made wrong 0 
lame would be the best way to describe it 0 
this is a great product sure beats using your fingers 1 
i love this bluetooth 1 
it only recognizes the phone as its storage device 0 
prosgood camera very nice pictures also has cool styles like black and white and more 1 
for that price i can think of a few place i would have much rather gone 0 
the new characters werent all that memorable and i found myself forgetting who was who 0 
its a piece of crap 0 
instead we got a bore fest about a whiny spoiled brat babysitting 0 
krussel always good 1 
but storm trooper is not even bad enough to make it to the list of wonderfully terrible movies 0 
and finally after all that we get to an ending that wouldve been great had it been handled by competent people and not jerry falwell 0 
all this movie does is make you sick watching all these slackers make excuses for their stupid actions for 90 minutes 0 
the aerial scenes were welldone 1 
ive seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie 0 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
we recently witnessed her poor quality of management towards other guests as well 0 
doesnt do the job 0 
you could drive a semi truck into these holes 0 
go to place for gyros 1 
yeah the movie pretty much sucked 0 
i recently tried caballeros and i have been back every week since 1 
some may say this buffet is pricey but i think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot 1 
definitely not worth the 3 i paid 0 
the portion was huge 1 
this totally unfunny movie is so over the top and pathetic and unrealistic that throughout the whole 90 minutes of utter torture i probably looked at my watch about 70000 times 0 
i am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this 1 
the staff was very attentive 1 
the story itself is just predictable and lazy 0 
i heart this place 1 
the script is bad very bad ¬ñ it contains both cheesiness and unethical joke that you normally see in rated r or nc17 movie 0 
i dont think well be going back anytime soon 0 
here in the wind and the lion we see a wonderful rendering of americas own imperial age 1 
cant store anything but phone numbers to sim 0 
much less than the jawbone i was going to replace it with 1 
i also decided not to send it back because our waitress looked like she was on the verge of having a heart attack 0 
an awesome new look for fall 2000 1 
another thing i didnt really like is when a character got punched in the face a gallon of blood would spew forth soon after 0 
it was quite comfortable in the ear 1 
raw and sublimely moving 1 
the ri style calamari was a joke 0 
that said our mouths and bellies were still quite pleased 1 
if you want a sandwich just go to any firehouse 1 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
with great sound effects and impressive special effects i cant recommend this movie enough 1 
these headphones were a great find and i think they are perhaps the best purchase ive made in the last several years seriously 1 
camerawork again bad 0 
cinematography noteworthy including fine views of barcelona and its famed gaudi towers 1 
reasonably priced also 1 
its like a really sexy party in your mouth where youre outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party 1 
first of all it doesnt wear well 0 
it is super charged up for use as a small hybrid palmtopcameracellphone and excels in those roles 1 
it was not good 0 
love this headset 1 
seriously killer hot chai latte 1 
they have great dinners 1 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
the battery is completely useless to me 0 
its a fresh subtle and rather sublime effect 1 
del taco is pretty nasty and should be avoided if possible 0 
seller shipped quickly and much cheaper than the competitors 1 
the attractive set used throughout most of the film is an eyepleasing gem 1 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
it has all the features i want 1 
the acting was bad 0 
seriously killer hot chai latte 1 
its a great tool for entertainment communication and data managementoh be sure to use activesync 42 for optimal data synchronization results 1 
i wish i could return the unit and get back my money 0 
mobile phone tools are a must have 1 
works great when my cat attacked the phone he scratched the protective strip instead of destroying the screen 1 
speaking of the music it is unbearably predictably and kitchy 0 
in fact its hard to remember that the part of ray charles is being acted and not played by the man himself 1 
avoid at any and all costs 0 
excellent performance 1 
his costars dont fare much better with people like morgan freeman jonah hill and ed helms just wasted 0 
save your money ive had this item for 11 months now 0 
case was more or less an extra that i originally put on but later discarded because it scratched my ear 0 
nothing at all to recommend 0 
after 20 minutes wait i got a table 0 
i just saw this film and i recommend it 1 
from what my dinner companions told meeverything was very fresh with nice texture and taste 1 
the service was extremely slow 0 
service was fantastic 1 
best of all is the rotating feature very helpful 1 
service was good and the company was better 1 
later i found myself lost in the power of the film 1 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
due to this happening on every call i was forced to stop using this headset 0 
the kids are very cool too 1 
i own 2 of these cases and would order another 1 
heres where the movie really pied me off 0 
total letdown i would much rather just go to the camelback flower shop and cartel coffee 0 
for the price this was a great deal 1 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
this place is disgusting 0 
after arguing with verizon regarding the dropped calls we returned the phones after two days 0 
sending it back 0 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
sam shepards portrayal of a gung ho marine was sobering 1 
tonight i had the elk filet specialand it sucked 0 
does not work for listening to music with the cingular 8125 0 
my boyfriend and i came here for the first time on a recent trip to vegas and could not have been more pleased with the quality of food and service 1 
i just cant explain this movie more than romanticcharminghilariousand adorablethe junkyard scenes are funnyall the junkyard dogs have something specialtoo funny i laughedkids will love itbuy it when it comes outit has new features 1 
the flair bartenders are absolutely amazing 1 
works great 1 
the cr√™pe was delicate and thin and moist 1 
kieslowski never ceases to amaze me 1 
eclectic selection 1 
very good lunch spot 1 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
worst martini ever 0 
every thing on phone work perfectly she like it 1 
5 stars for the brick oven bread app 1 
sucked most of the stuff does not work with my phone 0 
the malta settings are as dry and as barren as the dialogue 0 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
the cast was great 1 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
i still maintain that monkeys shouldnt make headphones we just obviously dont share enough dna to copy the design over to humans 0 
i would highly recommend this 1 
we asked for the bill to leave without eating and they didnt bring that either 0 
this product is clearly not ready for prime time i dont care how cool it looks if you cant tell a call is coming in its worthless 0 
i have had this phone for over a year now and i will tell you its not that great 0 
i got this phone on reccomendation from a relative and im glad i did 1 
that was done in the second movie 0 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
as for the service i thought it was good 1 
comfortable in my hand 1 
victor mclaglen was even bad and brian donlevy was almost unrecognizable 0 
i have had mine for about a year and this christmas i bought some for the rest of the family 1 
plus its only 8 bucks 1 
the descriptions said yum yum sauce and another said eel sauce yet another said spicy mayowell none of the rolls had sauces on them 0 
disappointing 0 
both the hot sour the egg flower soups were absolutely 5 stars 1 
i loved it it was really scary 1 
and those baby owls were adorable 1 
it was awesome 1 
my ribeye steak was cooked perfectly and had great mesquite flavor 1 
the camera on the phone may be used as a dustpan when indoors id rather be using a disposable then this 0 
then our food came out disappointment ensued 0 
i checked everywhere and there is no feature for it which is really disappointing 0 
i dont think there are any redeeming qualities in this remake 0 
what is even more stupid is that who had thought an idea that there should be a volcano in los angeles 0 
initially the local sites in the film which was filmed here in buffalo intrigued me 1 
items stated as included from the description are not included 0 
the steak and the shrimp are in my opinion the best entrees at gc 1 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
best fish ive ever had in my life 1 
this movie is possibly one of the most creative works of horror ever 1 
the best phone in market 1 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
regrettably the film fails 0 
its a gloriously fun fast paced and fairly accurate portrayal of the night of a raver 1 
i was sitting in my vehicle with the cradle on my belt and the headset lost signal 0 
so they performed 1 
i have been very happy with the 510 and have had no complaints from any one regarding my sound quality on their end 1 
it was a huge awkward 15lb piece of cow that was 34ths gristle and fat 0 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
soggy and not good 0 
on the up side their cafe serves really good food 1 
putting the race card aside lets look at the major flaw in the film they destroy latifas character 0 
the only place good for this film is in the garbage 0 
the camera really likes her in this movie 1 
hard to judge whether these sides were good because we were grossed out by the melted styrofoam and didnt want to eat it for fear of getting sick 0 
trumbull on i love lucy 1 
then the film just dropped the ball 0 
it has kept up very well 1 
both great 1 
if you havent choked in your own vomit by the end by all the cheap drama and worthless dialogue youve must have bored yourself to death with this waste of time 0 
this little device has transformed my organizational capability and made my life a whole lot easier 1 
happy so far 1 
its a mediocre miserable hollow laughable and predictable piece of garbage 0 
i really loved the story line and the poler bear was kinda cutebut if anyone has a question about fort steele just ask away 1 
mobile phone tools are a must have 1 
great product for the price 1 
nice spicy and tender 1 
i got the aluminum case for my new palm vx and it worked really wellit has protected my handheld perfectly so far 1 
highly unrecommended 0 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
this is a great little item 1 
all this movie does is make you sick watching all these slackers make excuses for their stupid actions for 90 minutes 0 
it even has its sweet moments 1 
we wont be going back 0 
its worth driving up from tucson 1 
very much disappointed with this company 0 
i wasnt expecting oscar material but this 0 
otherwise dont even waste your time on this 0 
well im satisfied 1 
great case and price 1 
good product good seller 1 
it fits so securely that the ear hook does not even need to be used and the sound is better directed through your ear canal 1 
great steak great sides great wine amazing desserts 1 
i was able to do voice dialing in the car with no problem 1 
youll love it 1 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
i really liked that 1 
the food is rich so order accordingly 1 
great case and price 1 
both do good jobs and are quite amusing 1 
really ugly 0 
as for the killer dont expect anything original or even remotely frightening 0 
food was good service was good prices were good 1 
about ten minutes into this film i started having second thoughts 0 
delicious nyc bagels good selections of cream cheese real lox with capers even 1 
i saw mirrormask last night and it was an unsatisfactory experience 0 
the bartender was also nice 1 
this is a very average phone with bad battery life that operates on a weak network 0 
the bus boy on the other hand was so rude 0 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
all the bread is made inhouse 1 
portable and it works 1 
they brought a fresh batch of fries and i was thinking yay something warm but no 0 
i find wasting food to be despicable but this just wasnt food 0 
very funny 1 
absolutel junk 0 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
the puppets look really cheesy not in a good way like in the puppet master 80s flicks 0 
i love the ownerchef his one authentic japanese cool dude 1 
how can anyone in their right mind ask for anything more from a movie than this 1 
its reception is very very poor 0 
the bus boy on the other hand was so rude 0 
but when someone strives for greatness and poetry but delivers a muddled and often ridiculous story a bunch of disparate scenes pretentious dialogue then you get the worst kind of a movie that some other reviewer very accurately defined as pretentious crap 0 
if you havent gone here go now 1 
i came over from verizon because cingulair has nicer cell phones the first thing i noticed was the really bad service 0 
as for the mains also uninspired 0 
just what i wanted 1 
i have eaten here multiple times and each time the food was delicious 1 
i loved it it was really scary 1 
also if your phone is dropped this case is not going to save it specially when dropped face down 0 
i give wirefly 1 stari will contact cingularatt and inform them of this practice 0 
the story unfolds in 18th century jutland and the use of period music played on period instruments is just one more fine touch 1 
love this headset 1 
crash is a depressing little nothing that provokes emotion but teaches you nothing if you already know racism and prejudice are bad things 0 
i think not again 0 
my 5year old nokia 2160 from tracfone holds the charge a lot better than this 0 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
the scenes with the ohsomature neighbourgirl are a misplace 0 
unless youre just out to visually collect all extant films of austens work you can skip this one 0 
the movie is not completely perfect but titta di girolamo will stay with you for a long time after the vision of the movie 1 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
piece of junk 0 
good case 1 
the acting sucked 0 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
they have a really nice atmosphere 1 
avoid at all cost 0 
if there were zero stars i would give it zero stars 0 
special mention should be made of the superb music score and sound effects which are an integral element in helping to make this such a memorable and enjoyable cartoon 1 
the food is good 1 
it is easy to turn on and off when you are in the car and the volume controls are quite accessable 1 
the use of slowmotion needlessly repeats itself throughout the movie but is well backed up by bad acting and bad is a kind word here no continuity scenes that are thrown in for no reason whatsoever vehicles that looked like they were made from a corn flakes box and a directorial style that bordered on stupidity 0 
this really is how vegas fine dining used to be right down to the menus handed to the ladies that have no prices listed 1 
you will leave the theater wanting to go out and dance under the stars 1 
ive dropped my phone more times than i can say even on concrete and my phone is still great knock on wood 1 
all the characters in this film are tremendously well played 1 
level 5 spicy was perfect where spice didnt overwhelm the soup 1 
i get absolutely horrible reception in my apartment where with other phones i have not had this problem 0 
why was this film made 0 
service stinks here 0 
this really is how vegas fine dining used to be right down to the menus handed to the ladies that have no prices listed 1 
i was totally fascinated by the music the dancing everything 1 
our server was super nice and checked on us many times 1 
but above all the exquisite visual composition of each moment with inventive and elegant use of closeup camera angle and lighting including pointillistic faux home movie footage is a wonder and joy to behold 1
