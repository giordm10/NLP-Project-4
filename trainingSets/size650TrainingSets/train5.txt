one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
def coming back to bowl next time 1 
i was very disappointed 0 
these are the central themes of the film and they are handled ineptly stereotypically and with no depth of imagination 0 
will order from them again 1 
it wasnt busy at all and now we know why 0 
service is quick and friendly 1 
poor construction 0 
this place is horrible and way overpriced 0 
however this didnt make up for the fact that overall this was a tremendously boring movie 0 
so in a nutshell 1 the restaraunt smells like a combination of a dirty fish market and a sewer 0 
the writers were smack on and i think the best actors and actresses were a bonus to the showthese characters were so real 1 
nice design and quality 1 
youll love how thin it is 1 
overall a delight 1 
just does not work 0 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
i really wanted the plantronics 510 to be the right one but it has too many issues for methe good 0 
you learn a lot about the real inside emotions of people in this movie and a lot about the movie business itself 1 
the live music on fridays totally blows 0 
i will not return 0 
the cast is good 1 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
i had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get some relief 0 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
you get extra minutes so that you can carry out the call and not get cut off 1 
i promise they wont disappoint 1 
this is a disgrace 0 
which are small and not worth the price 0 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
they could be used as exemplars for any set designer 1 
very displeased 0 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
punishment park is a brilliant piece of cinema 1 
this is a good battery and it got here really fast 1 
paolo sorrentino has written a wonderful story about loneliness and tony has built one of the most unforgettable characters seen in movies in recent years 1 
after 3 months screen just went black all of a sudden 0 
and service was super friendly 1 
great product fast shipping 1 
i loved it it was really scary 1 
great place fo take out or eat in 1 
my breakfast was perpared great with a beautiful presentation of 3 giant slices of toast lightly dusted with powdered sugar 1 
i swung in to give them a try but was deeply disappointed 0 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
full of unconvincing cardboard characters it is blandly written by edward chodorov who also produced and is surprisingly directed by jean negulesco from whom one would expect a great deal more 0 
it has a very good plot it holds your complete attention the acting is superb tom wilkinson was fantastic and emily watson was also very good 1 
i kept looking at the time and it had soon become 35 minutes yet still no food 0 
finally after three or four times the spring of the latch broke and i could not use it any longer on the visor 0 
nothing special 0 
so badwellits just bad 0 
i hate movies like that 0 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
fans of the genre will be in heaven 1 
great bluetooth 1 
ray charles is legendary 1 
im returning them 0 
warning stay away 0 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
also were served hot bread and butter and home made potato chips with bacon bits on topvery original and very good 1 
camerawork again bad 0 
superb phone on a great network 1 
the only thing really worth watching was the scenery and the house because it is beautiful 1 
never been to hard rock casino before will never ever step forward in it again 0 
once you get inside youll be impressed with the place 1 
we waited an hour for what was a breakfast i could have done 100 times better at home 0 
the desserts were a bit strange 0 
personally i think it shows that people should learn to find a compromise them self without involving other people into issue 1 
perfect for someone me who only likes beer ice cold or in this case even colder 1 
amazon sucks 0 
buyer beware you could flush money right down the toilet 0 
2 thumbs up to this seller 1 
i hate movies like that 0 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
but i thought his acting was skilled 1 
good food good service 1 
it was packed 0 
an amazing finale to possibly the best trilogy of all time 1 
secondly hitchcock pretty much perfected the thriller and chase movie 1 
there was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters 0 
always a great time at dos gringos 1 
i felt as though her going to ireland did absolutely nothing whatsoever 0 
but it wasnt anything at all just one big yawn 0 
phenomenal food service and ambiance 1 
the battery works great 1 
this place is handsdown one of the best places to eat in the phoenix metro area 1 
excellent sound battery life and inconspicuous to boot 1 
and the beans and rice were mediocre at best 0 
this is just a great movie 1 
what did bother me was the slow service 0 
i was very disappointed in the movie 0 
the performances are real and gripping the crocdodile is extremely well done indeed if the black water website is to be believed thats because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous 1 
i mean in a realistic world she would never have gotten into that ballet repertory the whole thing was quite pathetic 0 
it fits so securely that the ear hook does not even need to be used and the sound is better directed through your ear canal 1 
nargile i think you are great 1 
so in a nutshell 1 the restaraunt smells like a combination of a dirty fish market and a sewer 0 
this is simply the best bluetooth headset for sound quality 1 
treo and tmobile refused to replace it again and forced me to buy another phone without any kind of upgrade discount 0 
its practically perfect in all of them  a true masterpiece in a sea of faux masterpieces 1 
if you stay in vegas you must get breakfast here at least once 1 
the secondary plot line is incomprehensible and its relation to the primary plot line is mystifying 0 
tom wilkinson broke my heart at the end and everyone elses judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike 1 
tonight i had the elk filet specialand it sucked 0 
which is precisely why i am giving it such a bad review 0 
his losing his marbles so early in the proceedings is totally implausible and unconvincing 0 
we had 7 at our table and the service was pretty fast 1 
would not recommend to others 0 
the shower area is outside so you can only rinse not take a full shower unless you dont mind being nude for everyone to see 0 
i was seated immediately 1 
this movie contained an allstar cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i havent seen before 1 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
first time going but i think i will quickly become a regular 1 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
i searched the internet and found this one to be the best value 1 
i cannot make calls at certain places 0 
at any rate this film stinks its not funny and fulci should have stayed with giallo and supernatural zombie movies 0 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
on the good side the staff was genuinely pleasant and enthusiastic a real treat 1 
the food is rich so order accordingly 1 
really awful 0 
i promise they wont disappoint 1 
i could barely stomach the meal but didnt complain because it was a business lunch 0 
it only recognizes the phone as its storage device 0 
the price was very good and with the free shipping and all it was a good purchase 1 
works great when my cat attacked the phone he scratched the protective strip instead of destroying the screen 1 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
the films dialogue is natural real to life 1 
i never walked out of a movie faster 0 
then a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use 0 
everyone is very attentive providing excellent customer service 1 
new battery works great in phone 1 
theres also enough hypocrisy in this film to make me vomit 0 
food arrived quickly 1 
the sweet potato tots were good but the onion rings were perfection or as close as i have had 1 
so far so good 1 
great character actors telly savalas and peter boyle 1 
almost everyone involved must be return to school acting is utterly predictable and bad script is pile of garbage all round 0 
the selection of food was not the best 0 
now the pizza itself was good the peanut sauce was very tasty 1 
but its just not funny 0 
i saw this short film on hbo the other day and absolutely loved it 1 
if it was to turn my good day feeling into a night of disturbing memories than i guess he succeeded 0 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
i guess i should have known that this place would suck because it is inside of the excalibur but i didnt use my common sense 0 
it was delicious 1 
a good quality bargain i bought this after i bought a cheapy from big lots that sounded awful and people on the other end couldnt hear me 1 
after a year the battery went completely dead on my headset 0 
a piece of junk that broke after being on my phone for 2 days 0 
price is good too 1 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
i wont spoil it but the ending in pretty amazing 1 
not good when wearing a hat or sunglasses 0 
and there wasnt a single sour note struck actingwise either some surprisingly solid casting here 1 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
theres also enough hypocrisy in this film to make me vomit 0 
definitely worth seeing its the sort of thought provoking film that forces you to question your own threshold of loneliness 1 
this is a great product sure beats using your fingers 1 
the structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema 1 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 
the cast was great 1 
reaching for the bottom row is uncomfortable and the send and end keys are not where i expect them to be3 0 
i was shocked because no signs indicate cash only 0 
this is definitely a cult classic well worth viewing and sharing with others 1 
i liked it 1 
we arent ones to make a scene at restaurants but i just dont get itdefinitely lost the love after this one 0 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
overall i was not impressed and would not go back 0 
arrived quickly and much less expensive than others being sold 1 
avoid avoid avoid 0 
great price also 1 
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1 
i love lane but ive never seen her in a movie this lousy 0 
you can even take self portraits with the outside exterior display very cool 1 
the food was outstanding and the prices were very reasonable 1 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
very happy with this product 1 
not much seafood and like 5 strings of pasta at the bottom 0 
im probably one of the few people to ever go to ians and not like it 0 
instead we got a bore fest about a whiny spoiled brat babysitting 0 
so there is no way for me to plug it in here in the us unless i go by a converter 0 
an instant classic with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits 1 
i had a seriously solid breakfast here 1 
i had a seriously solid breakfast here 1 
my sashimi was poor quality being soggy and tasteless 0 
piece of junk 0 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
great software for motorolas 1 
its so stupid to have to keep buying new chargers car chargers cradles headphones and car kits every time a new phone comes out 0 
about ten minutes into this film i started having second thoughts 0 
my wife had the lobster bisque soup which was lukewarm 0 
easy to pair with my samsung cell 1 
this movie does an excellent job of revealing the complexity of the task and the incredible challenges facing south africa 1 
dont make the same mistake that i did and please dont buy this phone 0 
people couldnt hear me talk and i had to pull out the earphone and talk on the phone 0 
the vegetables are so fresh and the sauce feels like authentic thai 1 
avoid this establishment 0 
this movie is excellentangel is beautiful and scamp is adorablehis little yelps when hes scaredand the funniest parts are whenscamp is caught under the curtain and when angel and scamp are singing ive never had this feeling beforei totally recommend this movieits coming out on special edition on june 20the cover has scamp on a garbage can and angel underneath the lid 1 
there is no plot or storyline 0 
so anyone near you will hear part of your conversation 0 
would not recommend to others 0 
a fantastic neighborhood gem 1 
phone falls out easily 0 
i was left shattered from the experience of watching this film and i took a good two hours to fully recover 0 
excellent bluetooth headset 1 
that being said for a phone the camera is very nice many cool effects to play with and video is decent as well 1 
for 40 bucks a head i really expect better food 0 
this place is overpriced not consistent with their boba and it really is overpriced 0 
i got to enjoy the seafood salad with a fabulous vinegrette 1 
they were goldencrispy and delicious 1 
the plot has more holes than a pair of fishnet stockings and the direction and editing is astonishingly ham fisted 0 
perhaps i caught them on an off night judging by the other reviews but im not inspired to go back 0 
when i opened the sandwich i was impressed but not in a good way 0 
the camera although rated at an impressive 13 megapixels renders images that fall well below expectations of such a relatively high resolution 0 
the battery works great 1 
this is the first phone ive had that has been so cheaply made 0 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
its not hard to make a decent hamburger 0 
the food was outstanding and the prices were very reasonable 1 
that said our mouths and bellies were still quite pleased 1 
if you do go see this movie bring a pillow or a girlfriendboyfriend to keep you occupied through out 0 
the goat taco didnt skimp on the meat and wow what flavor 1 
mark my words this is one of those cult films like evil dead 2 or phantasm that people will still be discovering and falling in love with 20 30 40 years down the line 1 
plus its only 8 bucks 1 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
meredith m was better than all right 1 
on three different occasions i asked for well done or medium well and all three times i got the bloodiest piece of meat on my plate 0 
terrible management 0 
i waited and waited 0 
highly unrecommended 0 
thanks good a movie like this was done and released 1 
drinks took close to 30 minutes to come out at one point 0 
good quality 1 
the nano stated itmy son was dissapointed 0 
plantronics bluetooth excelent buy 1 
the writers were smack on and i think the best actors and actresses were a bonus to the showthese characters were so real 1 
audio quality is poor very poor 0 
hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in 0 
i wont be back 0 
its practically perfect in all of them  a true masterpiece in a sea of faux masterpieces 1 
i dont think i will be back for a very long time 0 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
the point is the journey a journey that touches every member of the family 1 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
the accompanied software is almost brilliant 1 
the characters are interesting and you want to find out more about them the longer the movie goes on and i think people will be surprised by who does and doesnt make it 1 
i dont like this nokia either 0 
i also decided not to send it back because our waitress looked like she was on the verge of having a heart attack 0 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
other than that the leather is nice and soft the fit is very tight the cut out for the face is a good shape 1 
their onscreen chemistry critical to the entire film is genuine 1 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
there are massive levels massive unlockable characters its just a massive game 1 
also difficult to put onid recommend avoiding this product 0 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
the story itself is just predictable and lazy 0 
it is zillion times away from reality 0 
what possesed me to get this junk i have no idea 0 
i wont be back 0 
the battery is completely useless to me 0 
once you get inside youll be impressed with the place 1 
but the premise of the film was so ridiculous that the president of the us 0 
im really disappointed all i have now is a charger that doesnt work 0 
good product good seller 1 
the movie has almost no action scenes in it and very little comedy 0 
the sweet potato tots were good but the onion rings were perfection or as close as i have had 1 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
i can assure you that you wont be disappointed 1 
their research and development division obviously knows what theyre doing 1 
their rotating beers on tap is also a highlight of this place 1 
all in all i give this one a resounding 9 out of 10 1 
whatever the producer was going for he missed entirely 0 
good servicecheck 1 
host staff were for lack of a better word bitches 0 
definitely will come back here again 1 
it was so boring 0 
you share general loewenhielms exquisite joy in his partaking of the cailles en sarcophage even though you are just watching a movie but you do wish for just a small sample to savor 1 
wow what a bad film 0 
i never walked out of a movie faster 0 
if only someone involved with it knew how to string together narrative 0 
very disappointed and wondered how it could be in the oscar shortlist 0 
i do think tom hanks is a good actor 1 
i was shocked because no signs indicate cash only 0 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
the service was outshining i definitely recommend the halibut 1 
its a great item 1 
we are so glad we found this place 1 
was not happy 0 
ive owned this phone for 7 months now and can say that its the best mobile phone ive had 1 
food was really good and i got full petty fast 1 
nice design and quality 1 
i have two more years left in this contract and i hate this phone 0 
it also had a new problem 0 
i saw this film over christmas and what a great film it was 1 
voice quality signal strength dropped calls 0 
it was pretty gross 0 
this movie is bad 0 
motorola finally got the voice quality of a bluetooth headset right 1 
not a good item it worked for a while then started having problems in my auto reverse tape player 0 
we also ordered the spinach and avocado salad the ingredients were sad and the dressing literally had zero taste 0 
the sergeant pepper beef sandwich with auju sauce is an excellent sandwich as well 1 
not too screamy not to masculine but just right 1 
not impressed 0 
he was extremely rude and really there are so many other restaurants i would love to dine at during a weekend in vegas 0 
its too bad the food is so damn generic 0 
this is one of the best movies out there that shows such strong sibling bond for each other 1 
and the rest of it just sits there being awful with soldiers singing songs about the masculinity they pledge themselves to hairsplitting about purity the admiration of swords etc 0 
the acting is fantastic the stories are seamlessly woven together and the dogs are splendid a must rent view or see 1 
the construction of the headsets is poor 0 
the charger worked for about a week and then completely stopped charging my phone 0 
i highly recommend this device to everyone 1 
owners are really great people 1 
first time going but i think i will quickly become a regular 1 
i let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this bad idea we both hated it 0 
also its a real treat to see anthony quinn playing crazy horse 1 
just does not work 0 
i really do recommend this place you can go wrong with this donut place 1 
the best place in vegas for breakfast just check out a sat or sun 1 
the dialogue sucked 0 
im translating movies for a living and this is the first movie in my 5year working experience that i found offensive to my intelligence 0 
verizon tech support walked my through a few procedures none of which worked and i ended up having to do a hard reset wiping out all my data 0 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
the food was delicious our bartender was attentive and personable and we got a great deal 1 
on a positive note our server was very attentive and provided great service 1 
it will drive you barking mad 0 
in fact im going to round up to 4 stars just because she was so awesome 1 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
meredith m was better than all right 1 
if you hate earbugs avoid this phone by all means 0 
my ribeye steak was cooked perfectly and had great mesquite flavor 1 
nevertheless yet another wonderful film from the great masters stable 1 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
it really created a unique feeling though 1 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
if you do watch it however there are small consolations the actresses playing annes sisters each do a wonderful job with their roles 1 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
the screen size is big key pad lit well enough and the camera quality is excellent for a camera phone 1 
i highly recommend this case 1 
worst customer service ever 0 
we recently witnessed her poor quality of management towards other guests as well 0 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
so flavorful and has just the perfect amount of heat 1 
i have bought this nokia cell phone a few weeks ago and it was a nightmare 0 
call me a nut but i think this is one of the best movies ever 1 
when im on this side of town this will definitely be a spot ill hit up again 1 
i really do recommend this place you can go wrong with this donut place 1 
youll love it 1 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
unfortunately the ability to actually know you are receiving a call is a rather important feature and this phone is pitiful in that respect 0 
it is unusable in a moving car at freeway speed 0 
appetite instantly gone 0 
so i am here to warn youdo not rent this movie it is the dumbest thing you have never seen 0 
its like a bad two hour tv movie 0 
i swung in to give them a try but was deeply disappointed 0 
at no point in the proceedings does it look remotely like america 0 
i have always used corded headsets and the freedom from the wireless is very helpful 1 
it was packed 0 
i had a seriously solid breakfast here 1 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
the dining space is tiny but elegantly decorated and comfortable 1 
his performance is simply genius 1 
bad purchase 0 
food was great and so was the serivce 1 
i heart this place 1 
but the duet between the astronaut and his doctor at the beginning of the movie is a perfect exchange if one considers that this movie was made well into the cold war and the astronauts biggest fear is that he has crashed in the ussr 1 
this phone might well be the worst ive ever had in any brand 0 
but it wasnt until i watched this film that i realised how great he actually was 1 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
everything was perfect the night we were in 1 
this is simply the best bluetooth headset for sound quality 1 
their daily specials are always a hit with my group 1 
he was very impressed when going from the original battery to the extended battery 1 
punishment park is a brilliant piece of cinema 1 
sauce was tasteless 0 
would not go back 0 
you share general loewenhielms exquisite joy in his partaking of the cailles en sarcophage even though you are just watching a movie but you do wish for just a small sample to savor 1 
to sum the film up breeders is a terrible cheaply made horror movie that should be avoided like the ebola virus 0 
stopped by during the late may bank holiday off rick steve recommendation and loved it 1 
very much disappointed with this company 0 
their rotating beers on tap is also a highlight of this place 1 
there are so many problems i dont know where to start 0 
maybe there would be a reasonable explanation for this atrocity 0 
performed awful muffled tinny incoming sound and severe echo for those on the other end of the call 0 
the best part about nurse betty is its unpredictability 1 
the food is rich so order accordingly 1 
terrible service 0 
w810i is just superb 1 
i dont think ive ever gone to a movie and disliked it as much 0 
the interplay between martin and emilio contains the same wonderful chemistry we saw in wall street with martin and charlie 1 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
all the other cases ive tried normally fall apart after a few months but this one seems to be in for the long haul 1 
buyerbe very careful 0 
he is one of my favourite directors and one of the most talented directors in the history of cinema 1 
of course the acting is blah 0 
im so sorry but i really cant recommend it to anyone 0 
dont waste your money and time 0 
disapointing results 0 
interesting decor 1 
it is an hour and half waste of time following a bunch of very pretty high schoolers whine and cry about life 0 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
but in terms of the writing its very fresh and bold 1 
it has all the features i want 1 
if there were zero stars i would give it zero stars 0 
the phone was unusable and was not new 0 
treo and tmobile refused to replace it again and forced me to buy another phone without any kind of upgrade discount 0 
i really recommend this faceplates since it looks very nice elegant and cool 1 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
the acting is fantastic the stories are seamlessly woven together and the dogs are splendid a must rent view or see 1 
all in all an excellent restaurant highlighted by great service a unique menu and a beautiful setting 1 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
the shipping time was also very quick 1 
the food was excellent and service was very good 1 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
talk about great customer service of course we will be back 1 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
made very sturdy 1 
watching washing machine twirling around wouldnt hurt your eyes as much as this show 0 
the service was meh 0 
really bad 0 
i had to go to a store and bought a new nokia phone which is working great 1 
disappointing accessory from a good manufacturer 0 
i thoroughly enjoyed it when christopher eccleston took control of the tardis and the continuation of the series 1 
its not user friendly 0 
works great when my cat attacked the phone he scratched the protective strip instead of destroying the screen 1 
worst customer service ever 0 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
aside from its terrible lead this film has loads of other debits 0 
ive had this for nearly 2 years and it has worked great for me 1 
this place is like chipotle but better 1 
the story line is just awful 0 
after 3 months screen just went black all of a sudden 0 
before i go in to why i gave a 1 star rating please know that this was my third time eating at bachi burger before writing a review 0 
there is really nothing for me at postinos hope your experience is better 0 
this place deserves one star and 90 has to do with the food 0 
i believe the screenwriter did a good job of tying up the loose ends 1 
finally after three or four times the spring of the latch broke and i could not use it any longer on the visor 0 
sending it back 0 
an excellent new restaurant by an experienced frenchman 1 
this place receives stars for their appetizers 1 
its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
seafood was limited to boiled shrimp and crab legs but the crab legs definitely did not taste fresh 0 
the acting sucks the music sucks the script sucks the pacing sucks the special fx suck the directing sucks basically this movie sucks 0 
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0 
i ordered the lemon raspberry ice cocktail which was also incredible 1 
this is truly an art movieit actually has a lot of art in it 1 
frozen pucks of disgust with some of the worst people behind the register 0 
but in terms of the writing its very fresh and bold 1 
i might have gotten a defect but i would not risk buying it again because of the built quality alone 0 
the loudspeaker option is great the bumpers with the lights is very appealing 0 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
then the film just dropped the ball 0 
one nice thing was that they added gratuity on the bill since our party was larger than 6 or 8 and they didnt expect more tip than that 1 
none of them are engaging or exciting 0 
we ordered some old classics and some new dishes after going there a few times and were sorely disappointed with everything 0 
see it 1 
tom wilkinson broke my heart at the end and everyone elses judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike 1 
we have tried 2 units and they both failed within 2 months pros 0 
definitely will come back here again 1 
this company charge me a restocking fee and still not given me my refund back 0 
works as described 1 
go and see it 1 
before i go in to why i gave a 1 star rating please know that this was my third time eating at bachi burger before writing a review 0 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
great time family dinner on a sunday night 1 
i went to bachi burger on a friends recommendation and was not disappointed 1 
i just wanted to leave 0 
the buffet at bellagio was far from what i anticipated 0 
we started with the tuna sashimi which was brownish in color and obviously wasnt fresh 0 
we have gotten a lot of compliments on it 1 
voice quality signal strength dropped calls 0 
it finds my cell phone right away when i enter the car 1 
i will be back many times soon 1 
the ear buds only play music in one ear 0 
it showed exactly how the government and the scientist argued for humanity and the reasons of the gadget 1 
the best place in vegas for breakfast just check out a sat or sun 1 
the design is very good4 1 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
in other words the content level of this film is enough to easily fill a dozen other films 1 
happy so far 1 
this place is handsdown one of the best places to eat in the phoenix metro area 1 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
the nano stated itmy son was dissapointed 0 
after arguing with verizon regarding the dropped calls we returned the phones after two days 0 
i love the ringtones because they are so upbeat 1 
this gets a 1 out of 10 simply because theres nothing lower 0 
unfortunately it did not work 0 
audio quality is poor very poor 0 
not what i wanted 0 
i put the latest os on it v115g and it now likes to slow to a crawl and lock up every once in a while 0 
i do think tom hanks is a good actor 1 
talk about great customer service of course we will be back 1 
we arent ones to make a scene at restaurants but i just dont get itdefinitely lost the love after this one 0 
iam very pleased with my purchase 1 
you truly take this journey through the eyes and soul of a child 1 
i got home to see the driest damn wings ever 0 
i dont have to be an accountant to know im getting screwed 0 
could not get strong enough signal 0 
how this piece of trash was ever released is beyond me the acting the story the characters the supposedly special effects etcits all wrong 0 
my order was not correct 0 
i came over from verizon because cingulair has nicer cell phones the first thing i noticed was the really bad service 0 
headset works great was packaged nicely to avoid any damage 1 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
the only suspense i was feeling was the frustration at just how retarded the girls were 0 
i also didnt like the on button it felt like it would crack with use 0 
service is quick and friendly 1 
pretty piece of junk 0 
unfortunately we must have hit the bakery on leftover day because everything we ordered was stale 0 
putting the race card aside lets look at the major flaw in the film they destroy latifas character 0 
i love this phone 1 
the grilled chicken was so tender and yellow from the saffron seasoning 1 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
bad day or not i have a very low tolerance for rude customer service people it is your job to be nice and polite wash dishes otherwise 0 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
i am so tired of clichés that is just lazy writing and here they come in thick and fast 0 
well just if you keep thinking how bad it is 0 
service was good and the company was better 1 
the ambiance was incredible 1 
at first i thought i was grtting a good deal at 744 until i plugged it into my phone v3c razr 0 
the sweet potato fries were very good and seasoned well 1 
and then tragedy struck 0 
either way it sucks 0 
too politically correct 0 
it is so small and you dont even realize that it is there after a while of getting used to it 1 
you never know if you pushed it hard enough or the right number of times for the function you want or not 0 
and the sound quality is great 1 
this place is way too overpriced for mediocre food 0 
what a great double cheeseburger 1 
for a product that costs as much as this one does i expect it to work far better and with greater ease than this thing does 0 
youll love how thin it is 1 
often the dialogue doesnt really follow from one line to another or fit the surroundings 0 
each day of the week they have a different deal and its all so delicious 1 
not what i wanted 0 
clear skype calls long battery life long range 1 
the reception is excellent 1 
the scallop dish is quite appalling for value as well 0 
coming here is like experiencing an underwhelming relationship where both parties cant wait for the other person to ask to break up 0 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
because both ears are occupied background is not distracting at all 1 
the best phone in market 1 
his costars dont fare much better with people like morgan freeman jonah hill and ed helms just wasted 0 
this movie creates its own universe and is fascinating in every way 1 
waitress was sweet and funny 1 
the chefs were friendly and did a good job 1 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
my boyfriend and i sat at the bar and had a completely delightful experience 1 
nothing new there 0 
but if you liked movies like the matrix and better yet their sequels i think youll appreciate the thought provoking mindblowing experience this film will give you 1 
seriously its not worth wasting your or your kids time on 0 
well im satisfied 1 
service was very prompt 1 
linksys should have some way to exchange a bad phone for a refurb unit or something 0 
then i had to continue pairing it periodically since it somehow kept dropping 0 
voice quality signal strength dropped calls 0 
if there was ever a movie that needed wordofmouth to promote this is it 1 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
it has northern humour and positive about the community it represents 1 
none of the new ones have ever quite worked properly 0 
one nice thing was that they added gratuity on the bill since our party was larger than 6 or 8 and they didnt expect more tip than that 1 
bad purchase 0 
i ordered the voodoo pasta and it was the first time id had really excellent pasta since going gluten free several years ago 1 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
worst hour and a half of my lifeoh my gosh 0 
the file browser offers all the options that one needshandsfree is great 1 
check it out 1 
considering the relations off screen between taylor and stanwyck it was surprising how little chemistry there was on screen between the two of them 0 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
fantastic earphones 1 
i rather enjoyed it 1 
it has been a winner for us 1 
i dont know what the big deal is about this place but i wont be back yaall 0 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
product was excellent and works better than the verizon one and boy was it cheaper 1 
sam shepards portrayal of a gung ho marine was sobering 1 
the sergeant pepper beef sandwich with auju sauce is an excellent sandwich as well 1 
it always cuts out and makes a beep beep beep sound then says signal failed 0 
service is also cute 1 
damian is so talented and versatile in so many ways of writing and portraying different characters on screen 1 
these products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet 0 
if you look for authentic thai food go else where 0 
im happy about this purchase good quality and low price 1 
every time he opened his mouth you expect to hear you see kids pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show 0 
a good film by a great director 1 
battery life is real good 1 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
crisp and clear 1 
and his subtle connections between the three films are awesome 1 
cute quaint simple honest 1 
i will be back many times soon 1 
the handsfree part works fine but then the car tries to download the address book and the treo rebootsoverall i still rate this device high 1 
the only good thing was that it fits comfortably on small ears 1 
it presents a idyllic yet serious portrayal of the ups and downs of the characters lives 1 
its too bad the food is so damn generic 0 
i have to jiggle the plug to get it to line up right to get decent volume 0 
oh and i forgot to also mention the weird color effect it has on your phone 0 
she carries the movie well 1 
rating 1 out of 10 0 
2 thumbs up to this seller 1 
the directing seems too pretentious 0 
it ranks highly as a great noircrimedrama incredible performances by belmondo and lino ventura 1 
but i thought his acting was skilled 1 
ray charles life provided excellent biographical material for the film which goes well beyond being just another movie about a musician 1 
ill put this gem up against any movie in terms of screenplay cinematography acting postproduction editing directing or any other aspect of filmmaking 1 
they have a plethora of salads and sandwiches and everything ive tried gets my seal of approval 1 
their steaks are 100 recommended 1 
ive had no trouble accessing the internet downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions 1 
do not make the same mistake as me 0 
why was this film made 0 
these are fabulous 1 
overall a great experience 1 
server did a great job handling our large rowdy table 1 
the songs were the best and the muppets were so hilarious 1 
the service was a bit lacking 0 
we waited an hour for what was a breakfast i could have done 100 times better at home 0 
the battery is working well as a replacement for the original that came with the phone over 2 years ago 1 
i hate to disagree with my fellow yelpers but my husband and i were so disappointed with this place 0 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
its a gloriously fun fast paced and fairly accurate portrayal of the night of a raver 1 
delete this film from your mind 0 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
the accompanied software is almost brilliant 1 
i ordered albondigas soup which was just warm and tasted like tomato soup with frozen meatballs 0 
in conclusion i will not bother with this movie because a volcano in los angeles is nothing but nonsense 0 
worst thai ever 0 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
often the dialogue doesnt really follow from one line to another or fit the surroundings 0 
very easy to use 1 
it was a bit too sweet not really spicy enough and lacked flavor 0 
is pretty funny 1 
great product 1 
the characters are interesting and you really care for them 1 
lots of holes in the script 0 
they have a plethora of salads and sandwiches and everything ive tried gets my seal of approval 1 
i love this place 1 
great place fo take out or eat in 1 
we got sitting fairly fast but ended up waiting 40 minutes just to place our order another 30 minutes before the food arrived 0 
the script is was there a script 0 
what a great double cheeseburger 1 
doesnt work 0 
this place is overpriced not consistent with their boba and it really is overpriced 0 
i mean in a realistic world she would never have gotten into that ballet repertory the whole thing was quite pathetic 0 
the phone gets extremely hot 0 
his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic 1 
five star plus plus 1 
but i thought his acting was skilled 1 
summary the witticisms werent witty 0
