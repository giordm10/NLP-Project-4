we started with the tuna sashimi which was brownish in color and obviously wasnt fresh 0 
a good commentary of todays love and undoubtedly a film worth seeing 1 
brilliant 1 
youll love how thin it is 1 
i was shocked because no signs indicate cash only 0 
this convention never worked well in the past and certainly doesnt work here 0 
after arguing with verizon regarding the dropped calls we returned the phones after two days 0 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
every element of this story was so over the top excessively phony and contrived that it was painful to sit through 0 
it is practically useless and did not add any kind of boost to my reception after i bought it 0 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
did not like at all 0 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
if you stay in vegas you must get breakfast here at least once 1 
very very disappointed ordered the 35 big bay plater 0 
i know this is not like the other restaurants at all something is very off here 0 
i dont know what the big deal is about this place but i wont be back yaall 0 
for sushi on the strip this is the place to go 1 
there was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth but it didnt really work into the rest of the plot 0 
i wasnt really impressed with strip steak 0 
i had absolutely no problem with this headset linking to my 8530 blackberry curve 1 
very disappointing 0 
lots of holes in the script 0 
editing the editing of this film was phenomenal in my opinion 1 
i probably wont be coming back here 0 
from what my dinner companions told meeverything was very fresh with nice texture and taste 1 
the staff was very attentive 1 
the stories were as unbelievable as the actors 0 
summary the witticisms werent witty 0 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
he came running after us when he realized my husband had left his sunglasses on the table 1 
her role was played well 1 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
it is worth the drive 1 
nobody identifies with these characters because theyre all cardboard cutouts and stereotypes or predictably reversestereotypes 0 
his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic 1 
it is the best charger i have seen on the market yet 1 
it looks very nice 1 
i got the aluminum case for my new palm vx and it worked really wellit has protected my handheld perfectly so far 1 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
yes its that bad 0 
i love this cable it allows me to connect any miniusb device to my pc 1 
i am glad i purchased it 1 
that company is a joke 0 
thank you for wasting my money 0 
i really wanted the plantronics 510 to be the right one but it has too many issues for methe good 0 
it sure does beat the nachos at the movies but i would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant 0 
best breakfast buffet 1 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
works great 1 
it shouldnt take 30 min for pancakes and eggs 0 
if you havent choked in your own vomit by the end by all the cheap drama and worthless dialogue youve must have bored yourself to death with this waste of time 0 
well just if you keep thinking how bad it is 0 
magical help 1 
you can watch them preparing the delicious food 1 
you learn a lot about the real inside emotions of people in this movie and a lot about the movie business itself 1 
the film is way too long 0 
they work about 2 weeks then break 0 
this battery is an excellent bargain 1 
not loud enough and doesnt turn on like it should 0 
i am far from a sushi connoisseur but i can definitely tell the difference between good food and bad food and this was certainly bad food 0 
lange had become a great actress 1 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
this one works and was priced right 1 
the staff was very attentive 1 
the ending is so so perfect youll shed a tear 1 
how can anyone in their right mind ask for anything more from a movie than this 1 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
it looses connection to the phone even when it is within a couple feet between the two 0 
this case seems well made 1 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
my only complaint is the standard sound volume is a little low even when turned up to 5of 5 0 
i can think of no other film where something vitally important occurs every other minute 1 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
one of the most disappointing aspects is the lack of notable gore 0 
i love this place 1 
great for ipods too 1 
never got it 0 
i wasted my little money with this earpiece 0 
pretty awesome place 1 
we definately enjoyed ourselves 1 
the lighting is awful 0 
absolutel junk 0 
its a fresh subtle and rather sublime effect 1 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
really ugly 0 
they could serve it with just the vinaigrette and it may make for a better overall dish but it was still very good 1 
often the dialogue doesnt really follow from one line to another or fit the surroundings 0 
dont bother coming here 0 
my breakfast was perpared great with a beautiful presentation of 3 giant slices of toast lightly dusted with powdered sugar 1 
for a product that costs as much as this one does i expect it to work far better and with greater ease than this thing does 0 
dont waste your time here 0 
will definitely be back 1 
service is also cute 1 
this phone might well be the worst ive ever had in any brand 0 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
as a courtroom drama its compelling as an indictment on the american justice system its frightening 1 
cant get the software to work with my computer 0 
i own a jabra earset and was very happy with it but the sound quality especially outgoing on this is better 1 
personally i think it shows that people should learn to find a compromise them self without involving other people into issue 1 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
im glad the film didnt go for the most obvious choice as a lesser film certainly would have 1 
absolutel junk 0 
who in their right mind is gonna buy this battery 0 
a truly truly bad film 0 
the phone crashed completely and now i have to get it replaced 0 
cheap but hey it works was pleasantly suprised given the low cost of this item 1 
reaching for the bottom row is uncomfortable and the send and end keys are not where i expect them to be3 0 
the directing seems too pretentious 0 
the warm beer didnt help 0 
big disappointment with calendar sync 0 
hayao miyazakis latest and eighth film for studio ghibili gake no ue no ponyo ponyo on the cliff by the sea is a wonderfully fun and imaginative look at childhood 1 
do not purchase this phone 0 
if you want a real scare rent this one 1 
i took back my money and got outta there 0 
it is a joy to use 1 
this movie does an excellent job of revealing the complexity of the task and the incredible challenges facing south africa 1 
the goat taco didnt skimp on the meat and wow what flavor 1 
loved the casting of jimmy buffet as the science teacher 1 
great service and food 1 
very comfortable 1 
i wasnt the least bit interested 0 
this movie is so awesome 1 
i hate to disagree with my fellow yelpers but my husband and i were so disappointed with this place 0 
wonderful lil tapas and the ambience made me feel all warm and fuzzy inside 1 
we waited an hour for what was a breakfast i could have done 100 times better at home 0 
ill give this film 10 out of 10 1 
poor voice clarity 0 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
i dont know what the big deal is about this place but i wont be back yaall 0 
i never walked out of a movie faster 0 
the interplay between martin and emilio contains the same wonderful chemistry we saw in wall street with martin and charlie 1 
i got it because it was so small and adorable 1 
the staff are also very friendly and efficient 1 
it does everything the description said it would 1 
black water is a thriller that manages to completely transcend its limitations its an indie flick by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience 1 
the script is bad very bad Â– it contains both cheesiness and unethical joke that you normally see in rated r or nc17 movie 0 
the vegetables are so fresh and the sauce feels like authentic thai 1 
their daily specials are always a hit with my group 1 
hes a national treasure 1 
we arent ones to make a scene at restaurants but i just dont get itdefinitely lost the love after this one 0 
highly unrecommended 0 
doesnt do the job 0 
the foreigner is not worth one second of your time 0 
if you check the directors filmography on this site you will see why this film didnt have a chance 0 
anyways the food was definitely not filling at all and for the price you pay you should expect more 0 
pricing is a bit of a concern at mellow mushroom 0 
i will never go back to this place and will never ever recommended this place to anyone 0 
and his subtle connections between the three films are awesome 1 
it shouldnt take 30 min for pancakes and eggs 0 
a usable keyboard actually turns a pda into a realworld useful machine instead of just a neat gadget 1 
well never go again 0 
i love this thing 1 
took an hour to get our food only 4 tables in restaurant my food was luke warm our sever was running around like he was totally overwhelmed 0 
i recently had problems where i could not stay connected for more than 10 minutes before being disconnected 0 
the text messaging feature is really tricky to use 0 
if you havent choked in your own vomit by the end by all the cheap drama and worthless dialogue youve must have bored yourself to death with this waste of time 0 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
i had a salad with the wings and some ice cream for dessert and left feeling quite satisfied 1 
10 out of 10 stars 1 
kieslowski never ceases to amaze me 1 
i had absolutely no problem with this headset linking to my 8530 blackberry curve 1 
but it wasnt until i watched this film that i realised how great he actually was 1 
this is a very average phone with bad battery life that operates on a weak network 0 
it presents a idyllic yet serious portrayal of the ups and downs of the characters lives 1 
great food and great service in a clean and friendly setting 1 
avoid this one if you can 0 
went for lunch service was slow 0 
it has a great camera thats 2mp and the pics are nice and clear with great picture quality 1 
plus its only 8 bucks 1 
my fella got the huevos rancheros and they didnt look too appealing 0 
an amazing finale to possibly the best trilogy of all time 1 
the chicken dishes are ok the beef is like shoe leather 0 
you need at least 3 mins to get to your phone book from the time you first turn on the phonebattery life is short 0 
im glad i found this product on amazon it is hard to find it wasnt high priced 1 
that just screams legit in my booksomethats also pretty rare here in vegas 1 
i mean in a realistic world she would never have gotten into that ballet repertory the whole thing was quite pathetic 0 
again lame 0 
the success of the film depends on the casting of sydney greenstreet as the alexander yardley character 1 
i do love sushi but i found kabuki to be overpriced overhip and underservices 0 
overall i am psyched to have a phone which has all my appointments and contacts in and gets great reception 1 
a film not easily forgotten 1 
yes its that bad 0 
i purchased this and within 2 days it was no longer working 0 
his losing his marbles so early in the proceedings is totally implausible and unconvincing 0 
filmiing was less expansive 0 
after 3 months screen just went black all of a sudden 0 
how awesome is that 1 
it shouldnt take 30 min for pancakes and eggs 0 
went in for happy hour great list of wines 1 
they brought a fresh batch of fries and i was thinking yay something warm but no 0 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
it defeats the purpose of a bluetooth headset 0 
well just if you keep thinking how bad it is 0 
we definately enjoyed ourselves 1 
the battery runs down quickly 0 
the majority of the logitech earbud headsets failed 0 
the buttons for on and off are bad 0 
they work about 2 weeks then break 0 
of course the footage from the 70s was grainy but that only enhanced the film 1 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
i have to mention this and it is a huge spoiler i loved the ending how all the characters of the three films were the remaining survivors of the ferry disaster with valentine and the young judge together and the old man watching it on her tv solidifying his happiness over the suffering which he dealt with for those many years 1 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
battery life is also great 1 
very much disappointed with this company 0 
i just dont know how this place managed to served the blandest food i have ever eaten when they are preparing indian cuisine 0 
very prompt service 1 
its worth driving up from tucson 1 
so far so good 1 
crisp and clear 1 
i didnt know pulled pork could be soooo delicious 1 
you can even take self portraits with the outside exterior display very cool 1 
everything about this film is simply incredible 1 
the service here is fair at best 0 
an extensive menu provides lots of options for breakfast 1 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
id rather eat airline food seriously 0 
i dont have very many words to say about this place but it does everything pretty well 1 
go watch it 1 
i struggle to find anything bad to say about it 1 
it was a riot to see hugo weaving play a sexobsessed gay real estate salesman who uses his clients houses for his trysts with the flaming darren tom hollander 1 
delicious 1 
lately they have been extremely nice and helpful on the phone 1 
but even the talented carrell cant save this 0 
food was really boring 0 
warning do not buy 0 
walked in and the place smelled like an old grease trap and only 2 others there eating 0 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
it was clear that she had the range and ability to pull off this part 1 
in addition to having one of the most lovely songs ever written french cancan also boasts one of the cutest leading ladies ever to grace the screen 1 
i have always used corded headsets and the freedom from the wireless is very helpful 1 
their regular toasted bread was equally satisfying with the occasional pats of butter mmmm 1 
the first thing that happened was that the tracking was off 0 
i am so tired of clichÃ©s that is just lazy writing and here they come in thick and fast 0 
very tough and very short on flavor 0 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
excellent phone 1 
everything stinks 0 
wow what a bad film 0 
this wonderful experience made this place a muststop whenever we are in town again 1 
phone is sturdy as all nokia bar phones are 1 
recommend with confidence 1 
avoid at all costs 0 
this isnt a small family restaurant this is a fine dining establishment 1 
only like 3 or 4 buildings used a couple of locations maybe poor hummh 0 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
helen baxendale is a very credible lady macbeth who can be very cheerfull at times and sometimes she just looks like a naughty girl but deadly in her taste for blood and evil 1 
thanks good a movie like this was done and released 1 
add betty white and jean smart and you have a great cast everyone played their parts really well 1 
heres where the movie really pied me off 0 
both films are terrible but to the credit of the 1986 version it was watchable 0 
i want my money back 0 
she carries the movie well 1 
i started this review with two stars but im editing it to give it only one 0 
ordered burger rare came in well done 0 
case was more or less an extra that i originally put on but later discarded because it scratched my ear 0 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
this is a stunning movie 1 
the worst sappiest dialogue i could go on and on 0 
my mother and brother had to do thiswhen i saw robert ryan portraying this type of man it was a very good imitation of this type of individual and i was impressed 1 
but it wasnt until i watched this film that i realised how great he actually was 1 
the acting by the whole cast could be put on a scale and balanced perfectly between overacting and underacting 0 
in addition to having one of the most lovely songs ever written french cancan also boasts one of the cutest leading ladies ever to grace the screen 1 
bacon is hella salty 1 
2 thumbs up to this seller 1 
we got the food and apparently they have never heard of salt and the batter on the fish was chewy 0 
i received my supposedly new motorola 375 and apparently there was not a match between the phone and the charger 0 
it was a riot to see hugo weaving play a sexobsessed gay real estate salesman who uses his clients houses for his trysts with the flaming darren tom hollander 1 
ive tried several different earpieces for my cell phone and this jabra one is the first one ive found that fits my ear comfortably 1 
i have seen many movies starring jaclyn smith but my god this was one of her best though it came out 12 years ago 1 
but it picked up speed and got right to the point 1 
this place is pretty good nice little vibe in the restaurant 1 
very funny 1 
bad purchase 0 
i only hear garbage for audio 0 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
the battery is working well as a replacement for the original that came with the phone over 2 years ago 1 
by the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant i was bored and didnt care what happened next and so i switched off 0 
this blueant supertooth handsfree phone speaker is awesome 1 
the roast beef sandwich tasted really good 1 
disappointing accessory from a good manufacturer 0 
excellent 1 
its welldesigned and very sharp the blue is a very nice color 1 
the service was outshining i definitely recommend the halibut 1 
i would recommend purchasing the jabra jx10 series 2 which works flawlessly with my moto q go figure 1 
a must study for anyone interested in the worst sins of industrial design 0 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
i have 23 bars on my cell phone when i am home but you cant not hear anything 0 
light weight i hardly notice it is there 1 
hard to judge whether these sides were good because we were grossed out by the melted styrofoam and didnt want to eat it for fear of getting sick 0 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
bad reception 0 
i had the chicken pho and it tasted very bland 0 
ill be looking for a new earpiece 0 
waaaaaayyyyyyyyyy over rated is all i am saying 0 
good product incredible value 1 
oh the charger seems to work fine 1 
the worst piece of crap ever along with the verizon customer service 0 
we started with the tuna sashimi which was brownish in color and obviously wasnt fresh 0 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
bela lugosi was totally extraneous intoning odd lines 0 
the atmosphere was great with a lovely duo of violinists playing songs we requested 1 
i love the scream movies and all horror movies and this one ranks way up there 1 
awesome service and food 1 
definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly will return next time im in vegas 1 
very cheap plastic creaks like an old wooden floor 0 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
the acting was decidely wooden though no worse than a period universal b movie 0 
hayao miyazakis latest and eighth film for studio ghibili gake no ue no ponyo ponyo on the cliff by the sea is a wonderfully fun and imaginative look at childhood 1 
the selection on the menu was great and so were the prices 1 
will not be back 0 
damian is so talented and versatile in so many ways of writing and portraying different characters on screen 1 
frankly after cotton club and unfaithful it was kind of embarrassing to watch lane and gere in this film because it is bad 0 
i ordered albondigas soup which was just warm and tasted like tomato soup with frozen meatballs 0 
i know that sounds funny but to me it seemed like sketchy technology that wouldnt work wellwell this one works great 1 
chinese forgeries abound 0 
but now that it is out of warranty the same problems reoccurebottom line put your money somewhere else cingular will not support it 0 
overall a delight 1 
the story is also both funny and poignant at times 1 
cant say enough good things about this place 1 
i literally vomited while watching this film 0 
in fact its hard to remember that the part of ray charles is being acted and not played by the man himself 1 
aside from its terrible lead this film has loads of other debits 0 
the selection was probably the worst ive seen in vegasthere was none 0 
say bye bye to your tip lady 0 
the battery runs down quickly 0 
perfect for someone me who only likes beer ice cold or in this case even colder 1 
overall the film is interesting and thoughtprovoking 1 
it was delicious 1 
and the accents are absolutely abysmal 0 
for 40 bucks a head i really expect better food 0 
i would not recommend this place 0 
the food is about on par with dennys which is to say not good at all 0 
food was really boring 0 
she carries the movie well 1 
there are massive levels massive unlockable characters its just a massive game 1 
i recommend igo to anyone with different brand cell phonesmp3 players in the family 1 
verizon tech support walked my through a few procedures none of which worked and i ended up having to do a hard reset wiping out all my data 0 
none of the three sizes they sent with the headset would stay in my ears 0 
it is cheap and it feel and look just as cheap 0 
it looks very nice 1 
its also great to see that renowned silent screenwriter frances marion hasnt missed a step going from silent to sound 1 
terrible service 0 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
you have to hold the phone at a particular angle for the other party to hear you clearly 0 
dont waste your money 0 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
considering the relations off screen between taylor and stanwyck it was surprising how little chemistry there was on screen between the two of them 0 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
the staff was very attentive 1 
the text messaging feature is really tricky to use 0 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
also the fries are without a doubt the worst fries ive ever had 0 
call me a nut but i think this is one of the best movies ever 1 
i received my headset in good time and was happy with it 1 
the only thing worse than taylors acting was stanwycks singing 0 
i enjoyed reading this book to my children when they were little 1 
we are so glad we found this place 1 
the story unfolds in 18th century jutland and the use of period music played on period instruments is just one more fine touch 1 
but the actingeven that of such professionals as drago and debbie rochonwas terrible the directing worse perhaps contributory to the former the dialog chimplike and the camera work barely tolerable 0 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
i wear it everyday and it holds up very well 1 
ordered a double cheeseburger got a single patty that was falling apart picture uploaded yeah still sucks 0 
if there were zero stars i would give it zero stars 0 
enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film 1 
the lead man is charismafree 0 
no shifting no bubbling no peeling not even a scratch nothingi couldnt be more happier with my new one for the droid 1 
now the pizza itself was good the peanut sauce was very tasty 1 
would recommend this item 1 
it also took her forever to bring us the check when we asked for it 0 
needless to say we will never be back here again 0 
1 hour 54 minutes of sheer tedium melodrama and horrible acting a mess of a script and a sinking feeling of good lord what were they thinking 0 
whatever the producer was going for he missed entirely 0 
my mother and brother had to do thiswhen i saw robert ryan portraying this type of man it was a very good imitation of this type of individual and i was impressed 1 
the story is also both funny and poignant at times 1 
dont make the same mistake that i did and please dont buy this phone 0 
an hour and a half i wish i could bring back 0 
the phone crashed completely and now i have to get it replaced 0 
the only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port irda 0 
he is one of my favourite directors and one of the most talented directors in the history of cinema 1 
but whatever it was that cost them so much it didnt translate to quality thats for sure 0 
id rather eat airline food seriously 0 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
youd have to have the iq of particularly stupid mollusk not to see that one coming 0 
for a self proclaimed coffee cafe i was wildly disappointed 0 
not good enough for the price 0 
this is a chilly unremarkable movie about an author livingworking in a chilly abstruse culture 0 
best tacos in town by far 1 
this place is way too overpriced for mediocre food 0 
that being said for a phone the camera is very nice many cool effects to play with and video is decent as well 1 
5 stars for the brick oven bread app 1 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
its quite simply the highest most superlative form of cinema imaginable 1 
garbo who showed right off the bat that her talents could carry over from the silent era i wanted to see some of her silent work but netflix doesnt seem to be stocking them 1 
its a campy sort of film thats a joy to watch 1 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
best tater tots in the southwest 1 
waiter was a jerk 0 
the jamaican mojitos are delicious 1 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
the flat reenactments dont hold your attention because they are emotionally adrift and stagy 0 
nice leather 1 
very comfortable 1 
the food is good 1 
on three different occasions i asked for well done or medium well and all three times i got the bloodiest piece of meat on my plate 0 
does not fit 0 
filmiing was less expansive 0 
this phone is pretty sturdy and ive never had any large problems with it 1 
plus it was wellpaced and suited its relatively short run time 1 
i couldnt think of a better way to end the film but a smile on my face great way to wrap up an amazing film and trilogy 1 
always a great time at dos gringos 1 
the acting is terrible and the writing is worse 0 
it is light has plenty of battery capacity and is very confortable to wear for somewhat extended periods of time 1 
excellent sound battery life and inconspicuous to boot 1 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
loved itfriendly servers great food wonderful and imaginative menu 1 
i found a six inch long piece of wire in my salsa 0 
ill give this film 10 out of 10 1 
my phone doesnt slide around my car now and the grip prevents my phone from slipping out of my hand 1 
very very disappointed ordered the 35 big bay plater 0 
this is one of the worst sandra bullock movie since speed 2 but not quite that bad 0 
its a sad movie but very good 1 
sprint charges for this service 0 
an extensive menu provides lots of options for breakfast 1 
it has a very good plot it holds your complete attention the acting is superb tom wilkinson was fantastic and emily watson was also very good 1 
so there is no way for me to plug it in here in the us unless i go by a converter 0 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
this movie is possibly one of the most creative works of horror ever 1 
really bad 0 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
easy to use 1 
the only very disappointing thing was there was no speakerphone 0 
and i just love the colors 1 
dont waste your money 0 
the foreigner is not worth one second of your time 0 
bluetooth does not work phone locks up screens just flash up and now it just makes calls randomly while in my pocket locked 0 
the plot was the same as pretty much every other cheap horror 0 
all in all a great disappointment 0 
fast service 1 
i dont know exactly what it is about this movie but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our familys memories 1 
a piece of cinematic garbage captured on celluloid 0 
however after seeing the short again after about 25 years i was amazed at how timeless the film actually is 1 
nice solid keyboard 1 
perhaps my phone is defective but people cannot hear me when i use this 0 
constantine gives everything the right intensity and seems to have a good understanding of the underlying psychological motivations 1 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
waste of 13 bucks 0 
great time family dinner on a sunday night 1 
useless phone simply deaf 0 
dont miss it 1 
this place was such a nice surprise 1 
its too bad the food is so damn generic 0 
best of all is the rotating feature very helpful 1 
best tater tots in the southwest 1 
in fact this stinker smells like a directtovideo release 0 
third the cheese on my friends burger was cold 0 
regardless the film fails on most levels 0 
very bad performance plays angela bennett a computer expert who is at home all the time 0 
the structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema 1 
i wouldnt see this movie again for free 0 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
this fixes all the problems 1 
i would have given no star if i was able 0 
it is worth the drive 1 
waste your money on this game 1 
and finally after all that we get to an ending that wouldve been great had it been handled by competent people and not jerry falwell 0 
fantastic food 1 
the staff are great the ambiance is great 1 
wed definitely go back here again 1 
it also took her forever to bring us the check when we asked for it 0 
every thing on phone work perfectly she like it 1 
the whole experience was underwhelming and i think well just go to ninja sushi next time 0 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
this product is great it makes working a lot easier i can go to the copier while waiting on hold for something 1 
but what really made it unwatchable was the direction 0 
this is by far the worst purchase ive made on amazon 0 
this was a different cut than the piece the other day but still wonderful and tender s well as well flavored 1 
so there is no way for me to plug it in here in the us unless i go by a converter 0 
try them in the airport to experience some tasty food and speedy friendly service 1 
not only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic but it also managed to give away the entire movie and im not exaggerating every moment every plot point every joke is told in the trailer 0 
the staff are great the ambiance is great 1 
the buffet at bellagio was far from what i anticipated 0 
with the originality and freshness of the first movie now spent this remake had little else to offer 0 
i always order from the vegetarian menu during dinner which has a wide array of options to choose from 1 
if you plan to use this in a car forget about it 0 
the soundtrack wasnt terrible either 1 
omg i felt like i had never eaten thai food until this dish 1 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
linked to my phone without effort 1 
talk about useless customer service 0 
if you dont find it too bad as again the unit comes with one earpad onlyi would not recommend this to anyone 0 
everything about this film is simply incredible 1 
but if you liked movies like the matrix and better yet their sequels i think youll appreciate the thought provoking mindblowing experience this film will give you 1 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
on the ground right next to our table was a large smeared beensteppedinandtrackedeverywhere pile of green bird poop 0 
it did not work in my cell phone plug i am very up set with the charger 0 
arrived quickly and much less expensive than others being sold 1 
would come back again if i had a sushi craving while in vegas 1 
bluetooth does not work phone locks up screens just flash up and now it just makes calls randomly while in my pocket locked 0 
service sucks 0 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
for those that havent seen it dont waste your time 0 
the camera although rated at an impressive 13 megapixels renders images that fall well below expectations of such a relatively high resolution 0 
nice case feels good in your hands 1 
yet plantronincs continues to use the same flawed charger design 0 
i find this inexcusable and so will probably be returning this phone and perhaps changing carriers 0 
the characters are interesting even if a bit predictable 1 
ive missed numerous calls because of this reason 0 
i probably would not go here again 0 
some great music and terrific scenery 1 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
its just lame 0 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
seller shipped quickly and much cheaper than the competitors 1 
just dont know why they were so slow 0 
it is a true classic 1 
all in all i can assure you ill be back 1 
i had heard good things about this place but it exceeding every hope i could have dreamed of 1 
bad quality 0 
this is was due to the fact that it took 20 minutes to be acknowledged then another 35 minutes to get our foodand they kept forgetting things 0 
but the service was beyond bad 0 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
comfortable fit you need your headset to be comfortable for at least an hour at a time if not for an entire day 1 
on three different occasions i asked for well done or medium well and all three times i got the bloodiest piece of meat on my plate 0 
the cashier was friendly and even brought the food out to me 1 
i dont think ill be running back to carlys anytime soon for food 0 
there were too many close ups 0 
the aerial scenes were welldone 1 
not enough volume 0 
fantastic food 1 
i was particularly pleased with the acting ability of dwight schultz 1 
im not sure how long we stood there but it was long enough for me to begin to feel awkwardly out of place 0 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
i am also very happy with the price 1 
absolutely great 1 
this one wants to surf on the small wave of space movies in 1998 deep impact and armageddon and this one fails everywhere 0 
a world better than 95 of the garbage in the theatres today 1 
a fly was in my apple juice a fly 0 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
maybe there would be a reasonable explanation for this atrocity 0 
so far so good 1 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
this little device has transformed my organizational capability and made my life a whole lot easier 1 
this device is great in several situations1 1 
the acting was bad 0 
the nokia ca42 usb cable did not work with my phone 0 
his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic 1 
there is no plot here to keep you going in the first place 0 
is it possible for a movie to get any worse than this 0 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
its extremely slow and takes forever to do anything with it 0 
product was excellent and works better than the verizon one and boy was it cheaper 1 
the owner used to work at nobu so this place is really similar for half the price 1 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
really awful 0 
we have tried 2 units and they both failed within 2 months pros 0 
highly recommend for any one who has a blue tooth phone 1 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
also difficult to put onid recommend avoiding this product 0 
back to good bbq lighter fare reasonable pricing and tell the public they are back to the old ways 1 
one of my favorite purchases ever 1 
imdb ratings only go as low 1 for awful its time to get some negative numbers in there for cases such as these 0 
the movie was so boring that i sometimes found myself occupied peaking in the paper instead of watching never happened during a columbo movie before 0 
yes this film does require a rather significant amount of puzzlesolving but the pieces fit together to create a beautiful picture 1 
this phone works great 1 
ray charles is legendary 1 
my husband and i ate lunch here and were very disappointed with the food and service 0 
it was quite comfortable in the ear 1 
it looked like a wonderful story 1 
probably never coming back and wouldnt recommend it 0 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
i wont spoil it but the ending in pretty amazing 1 
the pleather case doesnt fit 0 
the battery works great 1 
10 out of 10 stars 1 
ive had better not only from dedicated boba tea spots but even from jenni pho 0 
its a sad movie but very good 1 
the building itself seems pretty neat the bathroom is pretty trippy but i wouldnt eat here again 0 
about 30 minutes of footage is wasted to show mediocre elderly actors awkwardly babbling overwrought pseudosatanic gibberish corny enough to make a teen goth blush almost always in olde english and sometimes in latin that may or may not be made up words 0 
for that its worth checking out 1 
a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it 1 
damian is so talented and versatile in so many ways of writing and portraying different characters on screen 1 
this is one of the best italian thrillers of the early 70s 1 
great phone 1 
this place is amazing 1 
the worst one of the series 0 
the servers went back and forth several times not even so much as an are you being helped 0 
the service was terrible food was mediocre 0 
i love it 1 
in addition to having one of the most lovely songs ever written french cancan also boasts one of the cutest leading ladies ever to grace the screen 1 
overall i rate this movie a 10 out of a 110 scale 1 
its so stupid to have to keep buying new chargers car chargers cradles headphones and car kits every time a new phone comes out 0 
owners are really great people 1 
another note about this phones appearance is that it really looks rather bland especially in the all black model 0 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
over rated 0 
the writers were smack on and i think the best actors and actresses were a bonus to the showthese characters were so real 1 
works great 1 
its practically perfect in all of them Â– a true masterpiece in a sea of faux masterpieces 1 
then i exchanged for the same phone even that had the same problem 0 
i have bought this nokia cell phone a few weeks ago and it was a nightmare 0 
it did not work in my cell phone plug i am very up set with the charger 0 
a cheap and cheerless heist movie with poor characterisation lots of underbite style stoic emoting think chow yun fat in a better tomorrow and some cheesy clichÃ©s thrown into an abandoned factory ready for a few poorly executed flying judo rolls a la john woo 0 
bad choice 0 
really awful 0 
i give it 2 thumbs down 0 
my first visit to hiro was a delight 1 
there is no real plot 0 
poor product 0 
no ear loop needed its tiny and the sound is great 1 
i have been very happy with the 510 and have had no complaints from any one regarding my sound quality on their end 1 
this is definitely one of the better documentaries i have seen looking at family relationships and marriage 1 
i asked multiple times for the wine list and after some time of being ignored i went to the hostess and got one myself 0 
i found a six inch long piece of wire in my salsa 0 
love this product 1 
kieslowski never ceases to amaze me 1 
there is nothing privileged about workingeating there 0 
again no plot at all 0 
the cashier was friendly and even brought the food out to me 1 
total waste of time 0 
actually the graphics were good at the time 1 
i have yet to run this new battery below two bars and thats three days without charging 1 
i found the product to be easy to set up and use 1 
these are certainly very comfortable and functionality is decent 1 
even the squibs look awful 0 
their menu is diverse and reasonably priced 1 
there is no plot here to keep you going in the first place 0 
i dont have to be an accountant to know im getting screwed 0 
i was not happy with this item 0 
we got sitting fairly fast but ended up waiting 40 minutes just to place our order another 30 minutes before the food arrived 0 
i recommend this for everyone who loves film movies anythinga work of art 1 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
how stupid is that 0 
it is a very well acted and done tv movie 1 
the interplay between martin and emilio contains the same wonderful chemistry we saw in wall street with martin and charlie 1 
obviously they have a terrible customer service so you get what you pay for 0 
the sergeant pepper beef sandwich with auju sauce is an excellent sandwich as well 1 
att is not clear sound is very distorted and you have to yell when you talk 0 
i like armand assante my cable companys summary sounded interesting so i watched it twice already and probably will again 1 
this place is pretty good nice little vibe in the restaurant 1 
this movie is a good and humorous comment on life in 2006 1
