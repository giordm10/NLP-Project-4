the color is even prettier than i thought it would be and the graphics are incredibly sharp 1 
all in all a great disappointment 0 
when it opens the battery connection is broken and the device is turned off 0 
for service i give them no stars 0 
i wont spoil it but the ending in pretty amazing 1 
the film is well paced understated and one of the best courtroom documentaries ive seen 1 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
what a big waste of time 0 
it did not work in my cell phone plug i am very up set with the charger 0 
pretty awesome place 1 
its pretty surprising that this wonderful film was made in 1949 as hollywood generally had its collective heads in the sand concerning black and white issues at that time 1 
and considering the two of us left there very full and happy for about 20 you just cant go wrong 1 
clear skype calls long battery life long range 1 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
now this is a movie i really dislike 0 
saw the movie today and thought it was a good effort good messages for kids 1 
greatno problems at all 1 
with great sound effects and impressive special effects i cant recommend this movie enough 1 
keep up the good work amazon 1 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
he was extremely rude and really there are so many other restaurants i would love to dine at during a weekend in vegas 0 
one of the worst shows of all time 0 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
this is so embarassing and also my ears hurt if i try to push the ear plug into my ear 0 
the only consistent thread holding the series together were the amazing performances of leni parker and anita laselva as the two taelons in quiet idealogical conflict 0 
but above all the exquisite visual composition of each moment with inventive and elegant use of closeup camera angle and lighting including pointillistic faux home movie footage is a wonder and joy to behold 1 
i mean this in a terrible way 0 
they have a really nice atmosphere 1 
overall i wasnt very impressed with noca 0 
damian is so talented and versatile in so many ways of writing and portraying different characters on screen 1 
you could only take 2 videos at a time and the quality was very poor 0 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
the fries were not hot and neither was my burger 0 
good protection and does not make phone too bulky 1 
unfortunately this is a bad movie that is just plain bad 0 
beware this is not a trashy cult movie this is trash period 0 
but in any case the best part is you can download these pictures to your laptop using ir or even send pictures from your laptop to the phone 1 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
people couldnt hear me talk and i had to pull out the earphone and talk on the phone 0 
i want to first say our server was great and we had perfect service 1 
this is some seriously good pizza and im an expertconnisseur on the topic 1 
love this product 1 
generous portions and great taste 1 
i immediately said i wanted to talk to the manager but i did not want to talk to the guy who was doing shots of fireball behind the bar 0 
the greek dressing was very creamy and flavorful 1 
its a gloriously fun fast paced and fairly accurate portrayal of the night of a raver 1 
very happy with this product 1 
i gave it 5 stars because of the sound quality 1 
this movie is so awesome 1 
the reception is excellent 1 
not good when wearing a hat or sunglasses 0 
if you want healthy authentic or ethic food try this place 1 
this game rocks 1 
its just adorable seeing mickey playing turkey in the straw in a highly imaginative if occasionally cruel way 1 
its one of the movies i need to see whenever it comes on tvnever mind the fact that i already have it memorized 1 
i do not know if this was emilio estevezs directorial debut but the pacing the interplay and development of the characters as well as some clever camera work surrounding the character estevez plays all suggest a natural eye 1 
i dont think ill be running back to carlys anytime soon for food 0 
weve tried to like this place but after 10 times i think were done with them 0 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
fantastic buy and will get again for whatever my next phone is 1 
everything was gross 0 
kids pizza is always a hit too with lots of great side dish options for the kiddos 1 
the cashier was friendly and even brought the food out to me 1 
anyways the food was definitely not filling at all and for the price you pay you should expect more 0 
a very charming film with wonderful sentiment and heart 1 
went in for happy hour great list of wines 1 
a cheap and cheerless heist movie with poor characterisation lots of underbite style stoic emoting think chow yun fat in a better tomorrow and some cheesy clich√©s thrown into an abandoned factory ready for a few poorly executed flying judo rolls a la john woo 0 
definitely worth checking out 1 
warning do not buy 0 
they work about 2 weeks then break 0 
this convention never worked well in the past and certainly doesnt work here 0 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
lasted one day and then blew up 0 
avoid this establishment 0 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
the ripped banana was not only ripped but petrified and tasteless 0 
logitech bluetooth headset is a 10 1 
i have always used corded headsets and the freedom from the wireless is very helpful 1 
i cant wait to go back 1 
the worst sappiest dialogue i could go on and on 0 
the bathrooms are clean and the place itself is well decorated 1 
very good product well made 1 
a usable keyboard actually turns a pda into a realworld useful machine instead of just a neat gadget 1 
it was not good 0 
the cinematography is simply stunning to say the least and the fx are nothing if not stateoftheart 1 
both actors truly understand and become their particular character delivering a convincing sincere performance 1 
otherwise easy to install and use clear sound 1 
and dont even get me started on the jerky camerawork 0 
dont buy this product it fails 0 
when it opens the battery connection is broken and the device is turned off 0 
the plot doesnt hang together at all and the acting is absolutely appalling 0 
i love the pho and the spring rolls oh so yummy you have to try 1 
this greedy corporation will never see another dime from me 0 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
not only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic but it also managed to give away the entire movie and im not exaggerating every moment every plot point every joke is told in the trailer 0 
i tried the cape cod ravoli chickenwith cranberrymmmm 1 
110 and only because there is no setting for 010 0 
this review is long overdue since i consider a tale of two sisters to be the single greatest film ever made 1 
i am so pleased to know such a modern day genius is out there letting is passion for art drive him and taking us as an audience with him 1 
the show would begin with smart ass ed comments to each other that would be totally off the wall and uncalled for 0 
the food is good 1 
that company is a joke 0 
the design is very good4 1 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
pretty awesome place 1 
recommend with confidence 1 
love this headset 1 
everything about this film is simply incredible 1 
the ending is so so perfect youll shed a tear 1 
one of the best mexican movies ever and one of the less understood even by mexican themselves no matter how identified the should have felt with it 1 
really ugly 0 
tonight i had the elk filet specialand it sucked 0 
looks great and is strong 1 
i was sitting in my vehicle with the cradle on my belt and the headset lost signal 0 
i had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get some relief 0 
im not sure what he was trying to do with this film 0 
hard to judge whether these sides were good because we were grossed out by the melted styrofoam and didnt want to eat it for fear of getting sick 0 
loved itfriendly servers great food wonderful and imaginative menu 1 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
theres really nothing bad i can say about this headset 0 
i hate to disagree with my fellow yelpers but my husband and i were so disappointed with this place 0 
couldnt use the unit with sunglasses not good in texas 0 
the battery is working well as a replacement for the original that came with the phone over 2 years ago 1 
good service very clean and inexpensive to boot 1 
the script is horrendously stupid 0 
i loved it 1 
the screen size is big key pad lit well enough and the camera quality is excellent for a camera phone 1 
great product fast shipping 1 
what this film lacks is a convincing script 0 
weird vibe from owners 0 
it is so small and you dont even realize that it is there after a while of getting used to it 1 
the food was delicious our bartender was attentive and personable and we got a great deal 1 
bad characters bad story and bad acting 0 
excellent short film 1 
to be honest with you this is unbelievable nonsense and very foolish 0 
emily watsons character is very strong and she has only to give a quick glance and you understand everything 1 
this place is good 1 
i dont think there are any redeeming qualities in this remake 0 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
also great directing and photography 1 
i might have gotten a defect but i would not risk buying it again because of the built quality alone 0 
worst customer service ever 0 
there are so many problems i dont know where to start 0 
not even good for camp value 0 
this was utterly confusing at first which caused me to lose a couple of very very important contacts 0 
definitely worth checking out 1 
the story itself is just predictable and lazy 0 
terrible service 0 
i was so insulted 0 
the file browser offers all the options that one needshandsfree is great 1 
110 and only because there is no setting for 010 0 
very nice and relaxing late night viewing 1 
i would have casted her in that role after ready the script 1 
i really do recommend this place you can go wrong with this donut place 1 
sending it back 0 
wont ever go here again 0 
the wind and the lion is well written and superbly acted 1 
this place is not worth your time let alone vegas 0 
so flavorful and has just the perfect amount of heat 1 
if you are reading this please dont go there 0 
ray charles is legendary 1 
a must study for anyone interested in the worst sins of industrial design 0 
if you check the directors filmography on this site you will see why this film didnt have a chance 0 
my sister has one also and she loves it 1 
this is a chilly unremarkable movie about an author livingworking in a chilly abstruse culture 0 
i have had this phone for over a year now and i will tell you its not that great 0 
the opening sequence of this gem is a classic and the cat n mouse games that follow are a delight to watch 1 
i love being able to use one headset for both by landline and cell 1 
not loud enough and doesnt turn on like it should 0 
not good by any stretch of the imagination 0 
this is a great product sure beats using your fingers 1 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
this is an unbelievable bargain 1 
krussel always good 1 
the acting by the whole cast could be put on a scale and balanced perfectly between overacting and underacting 0 
the accompanied software is almost brilliant 1 
i even fully charged it before i went to bed and turned off blue tooth and wifi and noticed that it only had 20 left in the morning 0 
the film is way too long 0 
razr battery good buy 1 
this was utterly confusing at first which caused me to lose a couple of very very important contacts 0 
but even the talented carrell cant save this 0 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
i would have casted her in that role after ready the script 1 
i even fully charged it before i went to bed and turned off blue tooth and wifi and noticed that it only had 20 left in the morning 0 
sweetest phone 1 
i dont know exactly what it is about this movie but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our familys memories 1 
but whatever it was that cost them so much it didnt translate to quality thats for sure 0 
so far so good 1 
internet is excrutiatingly slow 0 
i probably would not go here again 0 
has been working great 1 
i connected my wifes bluetoothmotorola hs850 to my phone and it worked like a charm whether the phone was in my pocket or the case 1 
overall i like this place a lot 1 
very easy to use 1 
of course the footage from the 70s was grainy but that only enhanced the film 1 
i dont think ive ever gone to a movie and disliked it as much 0 
i am so tired of clich√©s that is just lazy writing and here they come in thick and fast 0 
i recommend igo to anyone with different brand cell phonesmp3 players in the family 1 
i seriously cannot believe that the owner has so many unexperienced employees that all are running around like chickens with their heads cut off 0 
clever and a real crowdpleaserthis film still ranks among mickeys best films even after 80 wonderful years 1 
really really good rice all the time 1 
love this headset 1 
very tough and very short on flavor 0 
great phone 1 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
i will continue to come here on ladies night andddd date night highly recommend this place to anyone who is in the area 1 
there was no chemistry between ben affleck and sandra bullock in this film and i couldnt understand why he would consider even leaving his wifetobe for this chick that he supposedly was knocked out by 0 
too politically correct 0 
same problem as others have mentioned 0 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
and then tragedy struck 0 
battery lasts only a few hours 0 
i dont think ill be running back to carlys anytime soon for food 0 
great food and service huge portions and they give a military discount 1 
excellent short film 1 
but whatever it was that cost them so much it didnt translate to quality thats for sure 0 
im trying to return it for a refund 0 
after all the rave reviews i couldnt wait to eat herewhat a disappointment 0 
and the sound quality is great 1 
cant store anything but phone numbers to sim 0 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
not much flavor to them and very poorly constructed 0 
so far so good 1 
its fits like a glove and is strong secure and durable 1 
the cr√™pe was delicate and thin and moist 1 
but i thought his acting was skilled 1 
great phone 1 
the characters are interesting and you want to find out more about them the longer the movie goes on and i think people will be surprised by who does and doesnt make it 1 
it was that loudglad to say that the plantronics 510 maintains a flawless connection to my cell and with no static during normal use 1 
the acting is beyond abysmal 0 
the opening sequence of this gem is a classic and the cat n mouse games that follow are a delight to watch 1 
very good lunch spot 1 
camerawork again bad 0 
im in az all the time and now have my new spot 1 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
great steak great sides great wine amazing desserts 1 
what happened next was prettyoff putting 0 
not good by any stretch of the imagination 0 
i got it because it was so small and adorable 1 
my brother in law who works at the mall ate here same day and guess what he was sick all night too 0 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
worst customer service 0 
i love it 1 
very cheap plastic creaks like an old wooden floor 0 
it was that loudglad to say that the plantronics 510 maintains a flawless connection to my cell and with no static during normal use 1 
meredith m was better than all right 1 
unfortunately it will not recharge my iphone 4s despite connecting it from multiple power sources imac external battery wall outlet etc 0 
their daily specials are always a hit with my group 1 
the cocktails are all handmade and delicious 1 
this film offers many delights and surprises 1 
the kids are annoying 0 
unfortunately it was not good 0 
i also didnt like the on button it felt like it would crack with use 0 
not impressed 0 
which are small and not worth the price 0 
filmiing was less expansive 0 
o my gosh the best phone i have ever had 1 
there are the usual hitchcock logic flaws 0 
love this product 1 
seller shipped quickly and much cheaper than the competitors 1 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
i gave it 5 stars because of the sound quality 1 
the salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop which was perfectly cooked 1 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
great food and awesome service 1 
a greasy unhealthy meal 0 
i recommend igo to anyone with different brand cell phonesmp3 players in the family 1 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
we are sending it back 0 
nothing short of magnificent photographycinematography in this film 1 
cooked to perfection and the service was impeccable 1 
it is wonderful and inspiring to watch and i hope that it gets released again on to video or dvd 1 
i consider this theft 0 
not as good as i had hoped 0 
brilliance indeed 1 
the reception is excellent 1 
i really do recommend this place you can go wrong with this donut place 1 
food was delicious 1 
the design might be ergonomic in theory but i could not stand having these in my ear 0 
i am a fan of his this movie sucked really bad 0 
very well made and fits my surefire gx2 perfectly 1 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
unfortunately it was not good 0 
the movie in movie situations in the beginning and through the game that is played with her by the acting coach are fascinating 1 
i used bitpim a free program you can find on the internetto transfer data to the phonethe price of the cable was excellent 1 
uncomfortable in the ear dont use with lg vx9900 env 0 
excellent product 1 
but now that it is out of warranty the same problems reoccurebottom line put your money somewhere else cingular will not support it 0 
i ordered the voodoo pasta and it was the first time id had really excellent pasta since going gluten free several years ago 1 
its pure brilliance 1 
the characters are interesting even if a bit predictable 1 
i highly recommend this case 1 
the only place good for this film is in the garbage 0 
i would recommend saving room for this 1 
it is an excellent drama an excellent thriller and an excellent film 1 
they have a plethora of salads and sandwiches and everything ive tried gets my seal of approval 1 
for the price this was a great deal 1 
overall i wasnt very impressed with noca 0 
he was terrible 0 
the service here is fair at best 0 
hell no will i go back 0 
it lasts less than 3o minutes if i actually try to use the phonemy wife has the same phone with the same problem 0 
these are the nicest restaurant owners ive ever come across 1 
i will not return 0 
victor mclaglen was even bad and brian donlevy was almost unrecognizable 0 
one of the most disappointing aspects is the lack of notable gore 0 
the text messaging feature is really tricky to use 0 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
amazon sucks 0 
it shouldnt take 30 min for pancakes and eggs 0 
to summarize the food was incredible nay transcendant but nothing brings me joy quite like the memory of the pneumatic condiment dispenser 1 
secondly hitchcock pretty much perfected the thriller and chase movie 1 
what makes this story different are the terrific production values faultless photography composition and editing the terrific casting the underappreciated brian keith playing a bully teddy and vivid history 1 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
on the negative its insipid enough to cause regret for another 2 hours of life wasted in front of the screen 0 
in short dont bother with this movie 0 
i cant see how this movie can be an inspiration to anyone to come out or overcome fear and rejection 0 
very prompt service 1 
every time he opened his mouth you expect to hear you see kids pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show 0 
im not really sure how joeys was voted best hot dog in the valley by readers of phoenix magazine 0 
disappointment i hate anything that goes in my ear 0 
i am sorry i made this purchase 0 
the management is rude 0 
very disappointing 0 
lately they have been extremely nice and helpful on the phone 1 
magical help 1 
judith light is one of my favorite actresses and i think she does a superb job in this film 1 
cant say enough good things about this place 1 
rip off over charge shipping 0 
the potatoes were great and so was the biscuit 1 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
it has everything i need and i couldnt ask for more 1 
in an interesting part of town this place is amazing 1 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
when my mom and i got home she immediately got sick and she only had a few bites of salad 0 
each day of the week they have a different deal and its all so delicious 1 
dont waste your time watching this rubbish nonresearched film 0 
avoid at all costs 0 
generally it just lacked imagination 0 
this was my first and only vegas buffet and it did not disappoint 1 
this item is fantastic and works perfectly 1 
the script is a big flawed mess 0 
mic doesnt work 0 
i would highly recommend this 1 
the films sole bright spot was jonah hill who will look almost unrecognizable to fans of the recent superbad due to the amount of weight he lost in the interim 1 
the chains which im no fan of beat this place easily 0 
the service was terrible food was mediocre 0 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
do not waste your money here 0 
while you dont yet hear mickey speak there are tons of sound effects and music throughout the filmsomething we take for granted now but which was a huge crowd pleaser in 1928 1 
battery has no life 0 
the best place in vegas for breakfast just check out a sat or sun 1 
owners are really great people 1 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
he also came back to check on us regularly excellent service 1 
his losing his marbles so early in the proceedings is totally implausible and unconvincing 0 
the chips that came out were dripping with grease and mostly not edible 0 
summary the witticisms werent witty 0 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
better than new 1 
i particularly remember my senses being assaulted by strident cords of music that would blare out with very little warning and even less meaning 0 
its a sad movie but very good 1 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
the story which was told so eloquently by francis ford coppola 25 years earlier really unfolds gradually and leaves room for the characters to develop 1 
the structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema 1 
the jabra eargels fit my ears very well 1 
10 out of 10 stars 1 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
i have had mine for about a year and this christmas i bought some for the rest of the family 1 
what possesed me to get this junk i have no idea 0 
yes its that bad 0 
my boyfriend and i came here for the first time on a recent trip to vegas and could not have been more pleased with the quality of food and service 1 
trumbull on i love lucy 1 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
oh this is such a thing of beauty this restaurant 1 
i even fully charged it before i went to bed and turned off blue tooth and wifi and noticed that it only had 20 left in the morning 0 
i loved it it was really scary 1 
im translating movies for a living and this is the first movie in my 5year working experience that i found offensive to my intelligence 0 
it even has its sweet moments 1 
the staff is great the food is delish and they have an incredible beer selection 1 
item arrived quickly and works great with my metro pcs samsung schr450 slider phone and sony premium sound in ear plugs 1 
the story is also both funny and poignant at times 1 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
i own a jabra earset and was very happy with it but the sound quality especially outgoing on this is better 1 
the best place to go for a tasty bowl of pho 1 
the food came out at a good pace 1 
simply beautiful 1 
punishment park is a brilliant piece of cinema 1 
their onscreen chemistry critical to the entire film is genuine 1 
i am so tired of clich√©s that is just lazy writing and here they come in thick and fast 0 
i recommend igo to anyone with different brand cell phonesmp3 players in the family 1 
in summary this was a largely disappointing dining experience 0 
the last 15 minutes of movie are also not bad as well 1 
im not sure what he was trying to do with this film 0 
other than that the leather is nice and soft the fit is very tight the cut out for the face is a good shape 1 
i wouldnt return 0 
for 40 bucks a head i really expect better food 0 
the earpiece on this is too large or too heavyit keeps falling out of my ear 0 
the cast of veteran actors are more than just a nostalgia trip 1 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
on the up side their cafe serves really good food 1 
the fries were not hot and neither was my burger 0 
i have had this phone for over a year now and i will tell you its not that great 0 
the poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying 0 
good works fine 1 
we waited for thirty minutes to be seated although there were 8 vacant tables and we were the only folks waiting 0 
great for the jawbone 1 
the voice recognition thru the handset is excellent 1 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
the only thing really worth watching was the scenery and the house because it is beautiful 1 
to be honest with you this is unbelievable nonsense and very foolish 0 
i paid the bill but did not tip because i felt the server did a terrible job 0 
one of the most disappointing aspects is the lack of notable gore 0 
the update procedure is difficult and cumbersome 0 
ill even say it again ¬ñ this is torture 0 
nargile i think you are great 1 
i use this product in a motor control center where there is a lot of high voltage humming from the equipment and it works great 1 
its like a bad two hour tv movie 0 
i did not bother contacting the company for few dollar product but i learned the lesson that i should not have bought this form online anyway 0 
what i really like there is the crepe station 1 
soggy and not good 0 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
and the red curry had so much bamboo shoots and wasnt very tasty to me 0 
i love this device 1 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of qu√©bec 0 
by far the best cheesecurds we have ever had 1 
the show would begin with smart ass ed comments to each other that would be totally off the wall and uncalled for 0 
every element of this story was so over the top excessively phony and contrived that it was painful to sit through 0 
its pretty surprising that this wonderful film was made in 1949 as hollywood generally had its collective heads in the sand concerning black and white issues at that time 1 
i work in the hospitality industry in paradise valley and have refrained from recommending cibo any longer 0 
the pan cakes everyone are raving about taste like a sugary disaster tailored to the palate of a six year old 0 
not impressed 0 
it isnt even an achievement as a sobaditsgood or sobaditsmemorable movie 0 
we made the drive all the way from north scottsdale and i was not one bit disappointed 1 
the movie lacks visual interest drama expression of feeling and celebration of the very patriotism that underlines the narrative 0 
that was done in the second movie 0 
sam shepards portrayal of a gung ho marine was sobering 1 
all in all i can assure you ill be back 1 
what a piece of junk i lose more calls on this phone 0 
also great directing and photography 1 
clear skype calls long battery life long range 1 
as i said abovepretty useless 0 
the budget was evidently very limited 0 
once you get inside youll be impressed with the place 1 
the football scenes at the end were perplexing 0 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
simple lightweight and great fit 1 
well just if you keep thinking how bad it is 0 
great place to relax and have an awesome burger and beer 1 
this scene is very strong and unpleasant 0 
worst service to boot but that is the least of their worries 0 
i love the scream movies and all horror movies and this one ranks way up there 1 
i started this review with two stars but im editing it to give it only one 0 
will never ever go back 0 
i dont know what kind it is but they have the best iced tea 1 
everything captain howdy says is either laughable or just plain stupid 0 
it is the best charger i have seen on the market yet 1 
there is a lot of beautiful places 1 
it wasnt busy at all and now we know why 0 
the scallop dish is quite appalling for value as well 0
