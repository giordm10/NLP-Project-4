definitely will come back here again 1 
rip off over charge shipping 0 
it defeats the purpose of a bluetooth headset 0 
i ended up sliding it on the edge of my pants or back pockets instead 1 
everything about it is just bad 0 
the story is beyond stupid 0 
its an empty hollow shell of a movie 0 
very well made and fits my surefire gx2 perfectly 1 
hes a national treasure 1 
the film deserves strong kudos for taking this stand for having exceptional acting from its mostly lesserknown cast and for the superintelligent script that doesnt insult the audience or take the easy way out when it comes to white racism 1 
it is simple to use and i like it 1 
good servicecheck 1 
before i go in to why i gave a 1 star rating please know that this was my third time eating at bachi burger before writing a review 0 
in addition to having one of the most lovely songs ever written french cancan also boasts one of the cutest leading ladies ever to grace the screen 1 
i was very pleased to see that i could replace my well travled swivel holster for my blackberry flip 1 
there was so much hype over this phone that i assumed it was the best my mistake 0 
that one didnt work either 0 
the battery is working well as a replacement for the original that came with the phone over 2 years ago 1 
overall i would recommend this phone over the new walkman 1 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
end of days is one of the worst bigbudget action movies ive ever seen 0 
the transfers are very good 1 
the sergeant pepper beef sandwich with auju sauce is an excellent sandwich as well 1 
worst thai ever 0 
i would recommend this 1 
definitely worth checking out 1 
the first thing that happened was that the tracking was off 0 
plus it was wellpaced and suited its relatively short run time 1 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
at first i thought i was grtting a good deal at 744 until i plugged it into my phone v3c razr 0 
nice sound 1 
its pretty easy 1 
this is a simple little phone to use but the breakage is unacceptible 0 
must have been an off night at this place 0 
bacon is hella salty 1 
the owners are super friendly and the staff is courteous 1 
i advise everyone do not be fooled 0 
to those who find this movie intelligent or even masterful i can only say its your intelligence and your imagination you obviously used to try and make some sense of this pitiful attempt its in our human nature to try and make sense of things 0 
i guess it was supposed to be clever twist then shed some light on the situation but it was just stupid 0 
everything stinks 0 
the grilled chicken was so tender and yellow from the saffron seasoning 1 
i believe that pitch black was done well 1 
so i bought about 10 of these and saved alot of money 1 
the ambiance was incredible 1 
so for our enjoyment we get to see them run around play games and be dangerous 1 
i checked out this place a couple years ago and was not impressed 0 
this was utterly confusing at first which caused me to lose a couple of very very important contacts 0 
but it is great i would really recommend it 1 
waitress was sweet and funny 1 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
the jabra eargels fit my ears very well 1 
the instructions didnt explain that a microphone jack could be used 0 
i am a fan of his this movie sucked really bad 0 
if there were zero stars i would give it zero stars 0 
reversible plug works great 1 
otherwise dont even waste your time on this 0 
after my phone got to be about a year old its been slowly breaking despite much care on my part 0 
watching washing machine twirling around wouldnt hurt your eyes as much as this show 0 
i have seen many movies starring jaclyn smith but my god this was one of her best though it came out 12 years ago 1 
my brother in law who works at the mall ate here same day and guess what he was sick all night too 0 
on the up side their cafe serves really good food 1 
the death row scenes were entirely unmoving 0 
he is an amazing film artist one of the most important whoever lived 1 
not to mention the combination of pears almonds and bacon is a big winner 1 
it was way over fried 0 
fast service 1 
the characters are interesting and you want to find out more about them the longer the movie goes on and i think people will be surprised by who does and doesnt make it 1 
lets start with all the problemsÂ—the acting especially from the lead professor was very very bad 0 
delete this film from your mind 0 
we have gotten a lot of compliments on it 1 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
the servers are not pleasant to deal with and they dont always honor pizza hut coupons 0 
the only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port irda 0 
the things that the four kids get themselves into is absolutely hilarious to watch 1 
i ordered the lemon raspberry ice cocktail which was also incredible 1 
his losing his marbles so early in the proceedings is totally implausible and unconvincing 0 
good prices 1 
i love the look and feel of samsung flipphones 1 
i am sorry i made this purchase 0 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
another thing i didnt really like is when a character got punched in the face a gallon of blood would spew forth soon after 0 
avoid at all costs 0 
as a courtroom drama its compelling as an indictment on the american justice system its frightening 1 
the art style has the appearance of crayonpencil drawings and is wonderfully colorful and fanciful 1 
this is definitely one of the better documentaries i have seen looking at family relationships and marriage 1 
its a great item 1 
nothing at all to recommend 0 
loved itfriendly servers great food wonderful and imaginative menu 1 
food was great and so was the serivce 1 
i even dropped this phone into a stream and it was submerged for 15 seconds and it still works great 1 
in summary this was a largely disappointing dining experience 0 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
but the service was beyond bad 0 
i agree with jessica this movie is pretty bad 0 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
glad i didnt pay to see it 0 
give this one a look 1 
thus far have only visited twice and the food was absolutely delicious each time 1 
i wish i could return the unit and get back my money 0 
one character is totally annoying with a voice that gives me the feeling of fingernails on a chalkboard 0 
the black eyed peas and sweet potatoes unreal 1 
i wont be back 0 
this film offers many delights and surprises 1 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
the fries were great too 1 
i might have gotten a defect but i would not risk buying it again because of the built quality alone 0 
and the rest of it just sits there being awful with soldiers singing songs about the masculinity they pledge themselves to hairsplitting about purity the admiration of swords etc 0 
macbeth jason connery moved me to tears with his final monolog out brief candle outhe gave the sphere of moral decay and dark forces a human face which makes it the more interesting 1 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
for that price i can think of a few place i would have much rather gone 0 
it dit not work most of the time with my nokia 5320 0 
this movie was kind of long in length but i enjoyed every minute of it 1 
this gets a 1 out of 10 simply because theres nothing lower 0 
this is an excellent film 1 
phone is sturdy as all nokia bar phones are 1 
will definitely be back 1 
i definitly recommend 1 
it is a true classic 1 
fantastic service here 1 
good show samsung 1 
i will not be eating there again 0 
awesome service and food 1 
a greasy unhealthy meal 0 
truly awful 0 
i highly recommend this modest priced cellular phone 1 
i also decided not to send it back because our waitress looked like she was on the verge of having a heart attack 0 
none of it works just dont buy it 0 
im not impressed with the concept or the food 0 
add betty white and jean smart and you have a great cast everyone played their parts really well 1 
i probably wont be coming back here 0 
i loved it 1 
it is worth the drive 1 
i know that sounds funny but to me it seemed like sketchy technology that wouldnt work wellwell this one works great 1 
not a good item it worked for a while then started having problems in my auto reverse tape player 0 
a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it 1 
thus far have only visited twice and the food was absolutely delicious each time 1 
at any rate this film stinks its not funny and fulci should have stayed with giallo and supernatural zombie movies 0 
this is cool because most cases are just open there allowing the screen to get all scratched up 1 
phenomenal food service and ambiance 1 
this phone tries very hard to do everything but fails at its very ability to be a phone 0 
totally different with loads of understatement and black comedy this is a film few get to see but those who do will remember it 1 
same evening him and i are both drastically sick 0 
i do love sushi but i found kabuki to be overpriced overhip and underservices 0 
there are the usual hitchcock logic flaws 0 
youll love how thin it is 1 
one of the best mexican movies ever and one of the less understood even by mexican themselves no matter how identified the should have felt with it 1 
i never walked out of a movie faster 0 
my rating just 3 out of 10 0 
watching washing machine twirling around wouldnt hurt your eyes as much as this show 0 
the plot such as it is is so derivative and predictable that the ending is like a mercy killing 0 
the delivery was on time 1 
it felt like a very gripping intelligent stage play but without the overly theatrical feeling one actually gets from watching people on a stage which plays on everyones terror of a white lie escalating to monstrous consequences 1 
i had about two bites and refused to eat anymore 0 
still i do like this movie for its empowerment of women theres not enough movies out there like this one 1 
its a long time since i was so entertained by a movie 1 
hot dishes are not hot cold dishes are close to room tempi watched staff prepare food with bare hands no gloveseverything is deep fried in oil 0 
also difficult to put onid recommend avoiding this product 0 
his performance is simply genius 1 
saw the movie today and thought it was a good effort good messages for kids 1 
i love the look and feel of samsung flipphones 1 
went for lunch service was slow 0 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
their frozen margaritas are way too sugary for my taste 0 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
cumbersome design 0 
lots of holes in the script 0 
you could only take 2 videos at a time and the quality was very poor 0 
would recommend this item 1 
a fantastic neighborhood gem 1 
plus its only 8 bucks 1 
constantine gives everything the right intensity and seems to have a good understanding of the underlying psychological motivations 1 
this is a chilly unremarkable movie about an author livingworking in a chilly abstruse culture 0 
and it was way to expensive 0 
i gave it 5 stars because of the sound quality 1 
only pros large seating area nice bar area great simple drink menu the best brick oven pizza with homemade dough 1 
the flat reenactments dont hold your attention because they are emotionally adrift and stagy 0 
instead we got a bore fest about a whiny spoiled brat babysitting 0 
the movie is not completely perfect but titta di girolamo will stay with you for a long time after the vision of the movie 1 
muddy low quality sound and the casing around the wires insert was poorly super glued and slid off 0 
took an hour to get our food only 4 tables in restaurant my food was luke warm our sever was running around like he was totally overwhelmed 0 
they refuse to refund or replace 0 
i advise you to look out for it 1 
waited and waited and waited 0 
the service was a little slow considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace 0 
you have to hold the phone at a particular angle for the other party to hear you clearly 0 
the worst was the salmon sashimi 0 
i have two more years left in this contract and i hate this phone 0 
this item is great installed it let it charged up overnite and it has been working good every since with no problems 1 
i hate to disagree with my fellow yelpers but my husband and i were so disappointed with this place 0 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
it was an inexpensive piece but i would still have expected better quality 0 
i gave it a 10 1 
if there was ever a movie that needed wordofmouth to promote this is it 1 
waitress was a little slow in service 0 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
conclusion i loved it 1 
recommend with confidence 1 
good price 1 
emily watsons character is very strong and she has only to give a quick glance and you understand everything 1 
i still maintain that monkeys shouldnt make headphones we just obviously dont share enough dna to copy the design over to humans 0 
this place is not quality sushi it is not a quality restaurant 0 
both great 1 
this battery is an excellent bargain 1 
the food was terrible 0 
it has a great camera thats 2mp and the pics are nice and clear with great picture quality 1 
this place is horrible and way overpriced 0 
their research and development division obviously knows what theyre doing 1 
poor reliability 0 
very good lunch spot 1 
the things that the four kids get themselves into is absolutely hilarious to watch 1 
howeverthe riingtones are not the best and neither are the games 0 
if there were zero stars i would give it zero stars 0 
this movie does an excellent job of revealing the complexity of the task and the incredible challenges facing south africa 1 
this would not even be good as a made for tv flick 0 
also the fries are without a doubt the worst fries ive ever had 0 
very bad performance plays angela bennett a computer expert who is at home all the time 0 
warning stay away 0 
hands down my favorite italian restaurant 1 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
the script is was there a script 0 
the acting sucks the music sucks the script sucks the pacing sucks the special fx suck the directing sucks basically this movie sucks 0 
we got sitting fairly fast but ended up waiting 40 minutes just to place our order another 30 minutes before the food arrived 0 
top line dont waste your time and money on this one its as bad as it comes 0 
bad purchase 0 
improper description i had to return it 0 
bad script bad direction and horrible acting make this one plain bad 0 
it was too predictable even for a chick flick 0 
sounds good reasonably priced and effective its that simple 1 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
as always the evening was wonderful and the food delicious 1 
will go back next trip out 1 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
it came free with a dvd player i bought but i still turned the thing off halfway through because i was embarrassed for howell 0 
i believe that this place is a great stop for those with a huge belly and hankering for sushi 1 
sprint charges for this service 0 
the meat was pretty dry i had the sliced brisket and pulled pork 0 
i give it 2 thumbs down 0 
i recommend igo to anyone with different brand cell phonesmp3 players in the family 1 
a truly truly bad film 0 
muddy low quality sound and the casing around the wires insert was poorly super glued and slid off 0 
this movie creates its own universe and is fascinating in every way 1 
good product incredible value 1 
battery is terrible 0 
i have had mine for about a year and this christmas i bought some for the rest of the family 1 
if you see it you should probably just leave it on the shelf 0 
5 stars for the brick oven bread app 1 
i had high hopes for this place since the burgers are cooked over a charcoal grill but unfortunately the taste fell flat way flat 0 
the food wasnt good 0 
but the duet between the astronaut and his doctor at the beginning of the movie is a perfect exchange if one considers that this movie was made well into the cold war and the astronauts biggest fear is that he has crashed in the ussr 1 
the macarons here are insanely good 1 
item arrived quickly and works great with my metro pcs samsung schr450 slider phone and sony premium sound in ear plugs 1 
my friend did not like his bloody mary 0 
we waited for forty five minutes in vain 0 
top line dont waste your time and money on this one its as bad as it comes 0 
i love that they put their food in nice plastic containers as opposed to cramming it in little paper takeout boxes 1 
i own a jabra earset and was very happy with it but the sound quality especially outgoing on this is better 1 
a fantastic neighborhood gem 1 
the service was terrible though 0 
yet plantronincs continues to use the same flawed charger design 0 
i hate to disagree with my fellow yelpers but my husband and i were so disappointed with this place 0 
i was particularly pleased with the acting ability of dwight schultz 1 
i was totally fascinated by the music the dancing everything 1 
the yellowtail carpaccio was melt in your mouth fresh 1 
the only thing i did like was the prime rib and dessert section 1 
i guess i liked the details of his dysfunctionhe was believable 1 
i got this phone on reccomendation from a relative and im glad i did 1 
personally i think it shows that people should learn to find a compromise them self without involving other people into issue 1 
its just adorable seeing mickey playing turkey in the straw in a highly imaginative if occasionally cruel way 1 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
i guess i liked the details of his dysfunctionhe was believable 1 
the story line is just awful 0 
it was equally awful 0 
this fixes all the problems 1 
there is however some pretty good acting at least for this type of film 1 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
the story starts too fast with absolutely no suspense or buildup in the slightest 0 
i got the car charger and not even after a week the charger was brokeni went to plug it in and it started smoking 0 
this movie is a good and humorous comment on life in 2006 1 
very windresistant 1 
this was reflected not only in the cast but also in the belowpar script which borrowed much from the earlier classic 0 
the service was poor and thats being nice 0 
the story line is totally predictable 0 
horrible 0 
i especially love the long battery life 1 
the phone gets extremely hot 0 
bought mainly for the charger which broke soon after purchasing 0 
on the negative its insipid enough to cause regret for another 2 hours of life wasted in front of the screen 0 
we wont be returning 0 
i could eat their bruschetta all day it is devine 1 
in my house i was getting dropped coverage upstairs and no coverage in my basement 0 
the problem i have is that they charge 1199 for a sandwich that is no bigger than a subway sub which offers better and more amount of vegetables 0 
it is indescribably the most annoying and idiotic show i have ever seen 0 
painful on the ear 0 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
it was so bad i had lost the heart to finish it 0 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
not recommended 0 
the foreigner is not worth one second of your time 0 
the food is very good for your typical bar food 1 
waaaaaayyyyyyyyyy over rated is all i am saying 0 
however after finally watching this film i realized that not only had i had a closed mind to the brilliance it depicts i also found myself watching it over and over again 1 
the ambience is wonderful and there is music playing 1 
long whiny and pointless 0 
the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach 0 
coming here is like experiencing an underwhelming relationship where both parties cant wait for the other person to ask to break up 0 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
definitely worth checking out 1 
the roast beef sandwich tasted really good 1 
too bad cause i know its family owned i really wanted to like this place 0 
makes it easier to keep up with my bluetooth when im not wearing it 0 
that was done in the second movie 0 
works well 1 
this was utterly confusing at first which caused me to lose a couple of very very important contacts 0 
plug was the wrong size 0 
its been my choice headset for yearsgreat sound good volume good noise cancellation 1 
disappointed 0 
he came running after us when he realized my husband had left his sunglasses on the table 1 
my only problem is i thought the actor playing the villain was a low rent michael ironside 0 
i got it because it was so small and adorable 1 
it is indescribably the most annoying and idiotic show i have ever seen 0 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
the most annoying thing about cover girl is the way in which rita hayworth is put up on a pedestal 0 
doesnt work at all i bougth it for my l7c and its not working 0 
the characters are fleshed out surprisingly well particularly grimes and blake and all the actors deliver their sharply scripted lines with just the right amount of deadpan tongue in cheek to make the dialogue both hilarious and realistic 1 
the dialogue sucked 0 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
utterly without merit on any level this is akin to torture 0 
its just painful 0 
the seller is very understanding and patient i would definitely buy from them again 1 
i saw mirrormask last night and it was an unsatisfactory experience 0 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
my boyfriend and i sat at the bar and had a completely delightful experience 1 
coming here is like experiencing an underwhelming relationship where both parties cant wait for the other person to ask to break up 0 
great place fo take out or eat in 1 
schrader has made a resume full of lousy amateurish films 0 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
absolutely great 1 
this is truly an art movieit actually has a lot of art in it 1 
however bt headsets are currently not good for real time games like firstperson shooters since the audio delay messes me up 0 
the folks at otto always make us feel so welcome and special 1 
avoid this film at all costs 0 
buyer beware you could flush money right down the toilet 0 
it worked very well 1 
we watched our waiter pay a lot more attention to other tables and ignore us 0 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
the best part about nurse betty is its unpredictability 1 
waitress was good though 1 
there were too many close ups 0 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
the bus boy on the other hand was so rude 0 
we had a group of 70 when we claimed we would only have 40 and they handled us beautifully 1 
this movie was kind of long in length but i enjoyed every minute of it 1 
the script is was there a script 0 
i seriously cannot believe that the owner has so many unexperienced employees that all are running around like chickens with their heads cut off 0 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
i hope this place sticks around 1 
to those who find this movie intelligent or even masterful i can only say its your intelligence and your imagination you obviously used to try and make some sense of this pitiful attempt its in our human nature to try and make sense of things 0 
the waitresses are very friendly 1 
utter crap sound quality is terrible 0 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
the camera really likes her in this movie 1 
after the first charge kept going dead after 12 minutes 0 
we definately enjoyed ourselves 1 
lewis blacks considerable talent is wasted here too as he is at his most incendiary when he is unrestrained which the pg13 rating certainly wont allow 0 
the lead man is charismafree 0 
its been my choice headset for yearsgreat sound good volume good noise cancellation 1 
thanks again to amazon for having the things i need for a good price 1 
the stories were powerful explorations of the nature of man and of art 1 
the battery is working well as a replacement for the original that came with the phone over 2 years ago 1 
the service was great even the manager came and helped with our table 1 
the nokia ca42 usb cable did not work with my phone 0 
the movie lacks visual interest drama expression of feeling and celebration of the very patriotism that underlines the narrative 0 
good food good service 1 
both do good jobs and are quite amusing 1 
so i bought about 10 of these and saved alot of money 1 
the waiter wasnt helpful or friendly and rarely checked on us 0 
i didnt realize how wonderful the short really is until the last two scenes 1 
the food wasnt good 0 
i dont think well be going back anytime soon 0 
wont ever go here again 0 
he was terrible 0 
meredith m was better than all right 1 
this fixes all the problems 1 
not loud enough and doesnt turn on like it should 0 
verizon tech support walked my through a few procedures none of which worked and i ended up having to do a hard reset wiping out all my data 0 
cinematography noteworthy including fine views of barcelona and its famed gaudi towers 1 
and those baby owls were adorable 1 
as always the evening was wonderful and the food delicious 1 
the characters were all funny and had the peculiarity of not having a true lead character 1 
all i have to say is the food was amazing 1 
if it was to turn my good day feeling into a night of disturbing memories than i guess he succeeded 0 
this place is amazing 1 
the script is bad very bad Â– it contains both cheesiness and unethical joke that you normally see in rated r or nc17 movie 0 
very easy to use 1 
food was delicious 1 
the flair bartenders are absolutely amazing 1 
it defeats the purpose of a bluetooth headset 0 
it was equally awful 0 
all in all ha long bay was a bit of a flop 0 
the waitresses are very friendly 1 
i liked this movie way too much 1 
easy to use 1 
this film tries to be a serious and sophisticated thrillerhorror flick and it fails miserably 0 
fans of the genre will be in heaven 1 
this place is great 1 
hard to judge whether these sides were good because we were grossed out by the melted styrofoam and didnt want to eat it for fear of getting sick 0 
the selection of food was not the best 0 
this place was such a nice surprise 1 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in 0 
bland not a liking this place for a number of reasons and i dont want to waste time on bad reviewing ill leave it at that 0 
the chains which im no fan of beat this place easily 0 
tied to charger for conversations lasting more than 45 minutesmajor problems 0 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
its quite simply the highest most superlative form of cinema imaginable 1 
i never come again 0 
nargile i think you are great 1 
this is some seriously good pizza and im an expertconnisseur on the topic 1 
i especially liked the noncliche choices with the parents in other movies i could predict the dialog verbatim but the writing in this movie made better selections 1 
tied to charger for conversations lasting more than 45 minutesmajor problems 0 
this was a poor remake of my best friends wedding 0 
i wont be back 0 
nice ambiance 1 
raw and sublimely moving 1 
there was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters 0 
you need at least 3 mins to get to your phone book from the time you first turn on the phonebattery life is short 0 
very comfortable 1 
i received my headset in good time and was happy with it 1 
i was very excited to get this headset because i thought it was really cute 1 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
theres barely a boring moment in the film and there are plenty of humorous parts 1 
imdb ratings only go as low 1 for awful its time to get some negative numbers in there for cases such as these 0 
i particularly remember my senses being assaulted by strident cords of music that would blare out with very little warning and even less meaning 0 
i waited and waited 0 
and i just love the colors 1 
a pretty good product 1 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
i came back today since they relocated and still not impressed 0 
i love this phone it is very handy and has a lot of features 1 
no ear loop needed its tiny and the sound is great 1 
if you look for authentic thai food go else where 0 
the dining space is tiny but elegantly decorated and comfortable 1 
cooked to perfection and the service was impeccable 1 
we are so glad we found this place 1 
the nachos are a must have 1 
i like design and look of jabra behing the ear headsets and 5020 is pretty comfortible to wear 24 hours a day without pain in the ear 1 
this is one of peter watkins most accessible films 1 
its pretty easy 1 
excellent service 1 
this is a great phone 1 
favorite place in town for shawarrrrrrma 1 
it is worth the drive 1 
with great sound effects and impressive special effects i cant recommend this movie enough 1 
i have eaten here multiple times and each time the food was delicious 1 
i consider this theft 0 
the design is very odd as the ear clip is not very comfortable at all 0 
plantronics bluetooth excelent buy 1 
so far it has worked like a charm 1 
i found the product to be easy to set up and use 1 
the cashew cream sauce was bland and the vegetables were undercooked 0 
im happy about this purchase good quality and low price 1 
im not really sure how joeys was voted best hot dog in the valley by readers of phoenix magazine 0 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
some great music and terrific scenery 1 
duris has a wholesome appearance and gives a fine performance 1 
the scripting of the subtle comedy is unmatched by any movie in recent years 1 
this item is great installed it let it charged up overnite and it has been working good every since with no problems 1 
the goat taco didnt skimp on the meat and wow what flavor 1 
the poor actors 0 
not much dialogue not much music the whole film was shot as elaborately and aesthetically like a sculpture 1 
tied to charger for conversations lasting more than 45 minutesmajor problems 0 
this place should honestly be blown up 0 
this film tries to be a serious and sophisticated thrillerhorror flick and it fails miserably 0 
i let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this bad idea we both hated it 0 
each day of the week they have a different deal and its all so delicious 1 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
rating 010 grade z note the show is so bad that even mother of the cast pull her daughter out of the show 0 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
totally different with loads of understatement and black comedy this is a film few get to see but those who do will remember it 1 
i cant see how this movie can be an inspiration to anyone to come out or overcome fear and rejection 0 
this is cool because most cases are just open there allowing the screen to get all scratched up 1 
its the one movie that never ceases to interest me simply because it keeps me alert as i try to attempt to decipher its meanings 1 
does not fit 0 
they have horrible attitudes towards customers and talk down to each one when customers dont enjoy their food 0 
the story is lame not interesting and never really explains the sinister origins of the puppets 0 
if you dont find it too bad as again the unit comes with one earpad onlyi would not recommend this to anyone 0 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
terrible my car will not accept this cassette 0 
then i exchanged for the same phone even that had the same problem 0 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
never going back 0 
nice headphones for the price and they work great 1 
not only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic but it also managed to give away the entire movie and im not exaggerating every moment every plot point every joke is told in the trailer 0 
its like a really sexy party in your mouth where youre outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party 1 
the film gives meaning to the phrase never in the history of human conflict has so much been owed by so many to so few 1 
but this movie really got to me 1 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
fits comfortably came with three sizes of earbud tips 1 
110 and only because there is no setting for 010 0 
voice recognition is tremendous 1 
it was a riot to see hugo weaving play a sexobsessed gay real estate salesman who uses his clients houses for his trysts with the flaming darren tom hollander 1 
you never know if you pushed it hard enough or the right number of times for the function you want or not 0 
see it with your kids if you have a chanceit will open up some amazing dialog about how far race relations have come in the last 50 years 1 
the service was extremely slow 0 
dont waste your money 0 
elias koteasjack palance play good roles angelina is hot and gets nakedbilly drago appears in this and is cool as usual a cameo by sven ole thorsen helps make this a very enjoyable movie with good acting and a decent budget 1 
the film has great actors a master director a significant themeat least a wouldbe significant theme undertone of fifties existential worldweariness aerial scenes that ought to have thrilled both senses and imagination and characters about which one might deeply care 1 
what this film lacks is a convincing script 0 
if you plan to use this in a car forget about it 0 
dont buy it 0 
you could only take 2 videos at a time and the quality was very poor 0 
i highly recommend this case 1 
my sashimi was poor quality being soggy and tasteless 0 
the best place in vegas for breakfast just check out a sat or sun 1 
it just blew 0 
its also great to see that renowned silent screenwriter frances marion hasnt missed a step going from silent to sound 1 
black water is a thriller that manages to completely transcend its limitations its an indie flick by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience 1 
the lead man is charismafree 0 
total waste of time 0 
go to place for gyros 1 
i was sitting in my vehicle with the cradle on my belt and the headset lost signal 0 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
the least said about the acting the better 0 
im not really sure how joeys was voted best hot dog in the valley by readers of phoenix magazine 0 
people who like european films and art movies will like this movie 1 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
unless youre just out to visually collect all extant films of austens work you can skip this one 0 
the speaker is of low quality so as making the ring tones sound very cheap 0 
fantastic food 1 
frankly after cotton club and unfaithful it was kind of embarrassing to watch lane and gere in this film because it is bad 0 
there is a brilliant twist ending 1 
yet plantronincs continues to use the same flawed charger design 0 
not only did the software do a great job of this i could also make my own ringtones form my existing cds without an internet connection 1 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
after watching this film i wanted to learn more about the works of this artist 1 
an excellent new restaurant by an experienced frenchman 1 
unfortunately cover girl is an example of how hollywood used to exploit women for financial gain 0 
nice blanket of moz over top but i feel like this was done to cover up the subpar food 1 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
this movie has a cutting edge to it 1 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
for readers who have already seen one of miyazakis films he is still in top form and made another worthwhile experience 1 
my sashimi was poor quality being soggy and tasteless 0 
the only suspense i was feeling was the frustration at just how retarded the girls were 0 
the guys all had steaks and our steak loving son who has had steak at the best and worst places said it was the best steak hes ever eaten 1 
the earpiece on this is too large or too heavyit keeps falling out of my ear 0 
this was a different cut than the piece the other day but still wonderful and tender s well as well flavored 1 
its worth driving up from tucson 1 
the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach 0 
all in all i think it was a good investment 1 
this would not even be good as a made for tv flick 0 
every element of this story was so over the top excessively phony and contrived that it was painful to sit through 0 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
nothing special 0 
total brunch fail 0 
they know how to make them here 1 
the kids are annoying 0 
this is infuriating 0 
probably not in a hurry to go back 0 
i have been in more than a few bars in vegas and do not ever recall being charged for tap water 0 
everything about this product is wrongfirst 0 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
i found the product to be easy to set up and use 1 
the delivery was on time 1 
disappointment i hate anything that goes in my ear 0 
thats how id describe this painfully dreary timewaster of a film 0 
phenomenal food service and ambiance 1 
this is a really fantastic thai restaurant which is definitely worth a visit 1 
just dont know why they were so slow 0 
it has a great camera thats 2mp and the pics are nice and clear with great picture quality 1 
very disappointed and wondered how it could be in the oscar shortlist 0 
its a little geeky but i think thats its sex on toast and it rocks and oozes sex right down to its battery embedded sleek stylish leather case 1 
very very sad 0 
the plastic breaks really easy on this clip 0 
great service and food 1 
walked in and the place smelled like an old grease trap and only 2 others there eating 0 
the ending is so so perfect youll shed a tear 1 
it was a waste of my money 0 
improper description i had to return it 0 
the cast is good 1 
it is perfect for a sitdown family meal or get together with a few friends 1 
the range is very decent ive been able to roam around my house with the phone in the living room with no receptionsound quality issues 1 
highly recommend for any one who has a blue tooth phone 1 
the result is a powerhouse achievement made more timely now perhaps because of our cultures disturbing fascination with celebrity and its distorted interpretations of fame 1 
the soundtrack sucked 0 
owners are really great people 1 
terrible my car will not accept this cassette 0 
this place is handsdown one of the best places to eat in the phoenix metro area 1 
lange had become a great actress 1 
you cant beat the price on these 1 
the worst phone ive ever had only had it for a few months 0 
overpriced for what you are getting 0 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
overall i am psyched to have a phone which has all my appointments and contacts in and gets great reception 1 
im not eating here 0 
long whiny and pointless 0 
waitress was sweet and funny 1 
the transfers are very good 1 
the soundtrack sucked 0 
even if you love bad movies do not watch this movie 0 
food arrived quickly 1 
his performance as awarded was stunning 1 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
buttons are too small 0 
we got the food and apparently they have never heard of salt and the batter on the fish was chewy 0 
raw and sublimely moving 1 
this is probably one of the least effective and utterly unoriginal films i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
good audio quality 1 
it quit working after id used it for about 18 months so i just purchased another one because this is the best headset ive ever owned 1 
good servicecheck 1 
but it picked up speed and got right to the point 1 
there was hardly any meat 0 
what a disappointment 0 
damn good steak 1 
it didnt make me scared horrified or make me sympathetic towards the characters it was simply annoying 0 
simply beautiful 1 
its kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly its embarrassing how childlike the company is 0 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
the only thing really worth watching was the scenery and the house because it is beautiful 1 
im terribly disappointed that this film would receive so many awards and accolades especially when there are far more deserving works of film out there 0 
otherwise dont even waste your time on this 0 
great phone 1 
if you do watch it however there are small consolations the actresses playing annes sisters each do a wonderful job with their roles 1 
though the wind and the lion is told largely through the eyes of the son every member of the family can identify with one of the characters whether it be sean connerys noble brigand candace bergens feisty heroine john hustons wily john hay or steve kanalys spiffy radiant ruthless cando lieutenant roosevelts big stick 1 
plus its only 8 bucks 1 
i would definitely recommend the jabra bt250v for those who are looking for comfort clarity and a great price 1 
i love the camera its really pretty good quality 1 
not much flavor to them and very poorly constructed 0 
i wasted my little money with this earpiece 0 
what on earth is irons doing in this film 0 
i kept looking at the time and it had soon become 35 minutes yet still no food 0 
the accompanied software is almost brilliant 1 
the flat reenactments dont hold your attention because they are emotionally adrift and stagy 0 
dont waste your on this one 0 
the success of the film depends on the casting of sydney greenstreet as the alexander yardley character 1 
i might have gotten a defect but i would not risk buying it again because of the built quality alone 0 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
the writer gorman bechard undoubtedly did his homework because all references are industry and characterage appropriate 1 
not good by any stretch of the imagination 0
