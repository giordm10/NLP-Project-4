its like a really sexy party in your mouth where youre outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party 1 
it was an inexpensive piece but i would still have expected better quality 0 
lovely little thriller from hitchcock with lots of nice shenanigans surrounding a murdered spy a kidnapped child a nasty church a foreign plot and some random taxidermists 1 
we thought youd have to venture further away to get good sushi but this place really hit the spot that night 1 
thats how id describe this painfully dreary timewaster of a film 0 
i gave it a 10 1 
keep up the good work amazon 1 
reception is terrible and full of static 0 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
for sushi on the strip this is the place to go 1 
however i needed some better instructions 0 
i would not recommend this place 0 
not a good item it worked for a while then started having problems in my auto reverse tape player 0 
it has kept up very well 1 
you wont be disappointed 1 
wont work right or atleast for me 0 
what makes this story different are the terrific production values faultless photography composition and editing the terrific casting the underappreciated brian keith playing a bully teddy and vivid history 1 
in particular the relationship between the bakery assistant and the waitress just didnt work for me at all 0 
generous portions and great taste 1 
we enjoy their pizza and brunch 1 
i know he was a contract player with little control over his scripts but the acting was as bad as the script 0 
dont buy this product 0 
both do good jobs and are quite amusing 1 
basically the service was very bad 0 
good food good service 1 
great brunch spot 1 
krussel always good 1 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
the story is beyond stupid 0 
you cant relate with them hell you barely can understand them 0 
service is also cute 1 
what is even more stupid is that who had thought an idea that there should be a volcano in los angeles 0 
fast service 1 
it has all the features i want 1 
10 out of 10 stars 1 
excellent product for the price 1 
you wont forget this movie 1 
his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic 1 
i wouldnt see this movie again for free 0 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
i like armand assante my cable companys summary sounded interesting so i watched it twice already and probably will again 1 
incredible 1 
dont buy this product 0 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
it isnt even an achievement as a sobaditsgood or sobaditsmemorable movie 0 
unfortunately it will not recharge my iphone 4s despite connecting it from multiple power sources imac external battery wall outlet etc 0 
the biggest complaint i have is the battery drains superfast 0 
after watching this film i wanted to learn more about the works of this artist 1 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
has been working great 1 
its a shame to see good actors like thomerson and james make a living in a mess like this 0 
waiter was a jerk 0 
join the club and get awesome offers via email 1 
my salad had a bland vinegrette on the baby greens and hearts of palm 0 
ive owned this phone for 7 months now and can say that its the best mobile phone ive had 1 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
im happy about this purchase good quality and low price 1 
the phone takes forever to charge like 2 to 5 hours literally 0 
an amazing finale to possibly the best trilogy of all time 1 
but its just not funny 0 
horrible horrible protector 0 
o my gosh the best phone i have ever had 1 
the lighting is awful 0 
i was bored throughout the whole damn thing 0 
not much flavor to them and very poorly constructed 0 
they were excellent 1 
we wont be returning 0 
my sashimi was poor quality being soggy and tasteless 0 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
after two i felt disgusting 0 
and service was super friendly 1 
dont waste your time watching this rubbish nonresearched film 0 
the problem was the script 0 
this place receives stars for their appetizers 1 
not much dialogue not much music the whole film was shot as elaborately and aesthetically like a sculpture 1 
im so happy to be here 1 
overall the film is interesting and thoughtprovoking 1 
iam very pleased with my purchase 1 
fantastic buy and will get again for whatever my next phone is 1 
service was good and the company was better 1 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
useless phone simply deaf 0 
its this pandering to the audience that sabotages most of his films 0 
setup couldnt have been simpler 1 
the film has great actors a master director a significant themeat least a wouldbe significant theme undertone of fifties existential worldweariness aerial scenes that ought to have thrilled both senses and imagination and characters about which one might deeply care 1 
the owner used to work at nobu so this place is really similar for half the price 1 
i love that they put their food in nice plastic containers as opposed to cramming it in little paper takeout boxes 1 
i really hope the team behind this movie makes more movies and that they will continue to do so in their own some kinda weird style 1 
the ambiance isnt much better 0 
fantastic earphones 1 
tasted like dirt 0 
will go back next trip out 1 
extremely tasty 1 
each day of the week they have a different deal and its all so delicious 1 
improper description i had to return it 0 
brilliant 1 
i believe that this place is a great stop for those with a huge belly and hankering for sushi 1 
this is definitely a cult classic well worth viewing and sharing with others 1 
design flaw 0 
an hour and a half i wish i could bring back 0 
however this didnt make up for the fact that overall this was a tremendously boring movie 0 
im super pissd 0 
dessert panna cotta was amazing 1 
this is definitely a cult classic well worth viewing and sharing with others 1 
this place is amazing 1 
you wont regret it 1 
i wish i could return the unit and get back my money 0 
this does not fit the palm tungsten e2 and it broke the first time i tried to plug it in 0 
poor quality 0 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
this is was due to the fact that it took 20 minutes to be acknowledged then another 35 minutes to get our foodand they kept forgetting things 0 
there is really nothing for me at postinos hope your experience is better 0 
it is light has plenty of battery capacity and is very confortable to wear for somewhat extended periods of time 1 
food was great and so was the serivce 1 
i really hope the team behind this movie makes more movies and that they will continue to do so in their own some kinda weird style 1 
i would highly recommend this product 1 
an absolute must visit 1 
now the burgers arent as good the pizza which used to be amazing is doughy and flavorless 0 
an excellent new restaurant by an experienced frenchman 1 
an italian reviewer called this a small great film and thats right 1 
muddy low quality sound and the casing around the wires insert was poorly super glued and slid off 0 
nothing special 0 
these are the central themes of the film and they are handled ineptly stereotypically and with no depth of imagination 0 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
still waiting im sure this item would work well if i ever recieve it 0 
give this one a look 1 
great price also 1 
i really like this product over the motorola because it is allot clearer on the ear piece and the mic 1 
i have seen many movies starring jaclyn smith but my god this was one of her best though it came out 12 years ago 1 
the writer gorman bechard undoubtedly did his homework because all references are industry and characterage appropriate 1 
so flavorful and has just the perfect amount of heat 1 
we ordered the duck rare and it was pink and tender on the inside with a nice char on the outside 1 
there is so much good food in vegas that i feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to rice and company 0 
i love the ownerchef his one authentic japanese cool dude 1 
i totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is 1 
the management is rude 0 
seriously killer hot chai latte 1 
then i had to continue pairing it periodically since it somehow kept dropping 0 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
well never go again 0 
my drink was never empty and he made some really great menu suggestions 1 
if only someone involved with it knew how to string together narrative 0 
fantastic food 1 
but it does get better reception and clarity than any phone ive had before 1 
there was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth but it didnt really work into the rest of the plot 0 
a happy wonderful feel good ending 1 
the food was terrible 0 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
first time there and might just be the last 0 
over rated 0 
the results well are a shame 0 
very disappointing 0 
everything from acting to cinematography was solid 1 
really pleased with this product so far 1 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
i recommend this for everyone who loves film movies anythinga work of art 1 
a great way to finish a great 1 
good product good seller 1 
penne vodka excellent 1 
before i go in to why i gave a 1 star rating please know that this was my third time eating at bachi burger before writing a review 0 
the eargels channel the sound directly into your ear and seem to increase the sound volume and clarity 1 
its like a bad two hour tv movie 0 
the design is very good4 1 
this scene is very strong and unpleasant 0 
appetite instantly gone 0 
i thought errol flynn was brilliant as custer and has since become my favourite actor 1 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
all the characters in this film are tremendously well played 1 
the very idea of it was lame take a minor character from a mediocre pg13 film and make a complete nonsequel while changing its tone to a pgrated family movie 0 
i recommend this for everyone who loves film movies anythinga work of art 1 
i keep watching it over and over 1 
a very very very slowmoving aimless movie about a distressed drifting young man 0 
weird vibe from owners 0 
punishment park is a brilliant piece of cinema 1 
but it wasnt until i watched this film that i realised how great he actually was 1 
it rocked my world and is certainly a must see for anyone with no social or physical outlets 1 
my friend did not like his bloody mary 0 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
5 stars for the brick oven bread app 1 
i think that it is a must see older john wayne film 1 
linked to my phone without effort 1 
alexander nevsky is a great film 1 
very much disappointed with this company 0 
its a great item 1 
appears to actually outperform the original battery from china that came with my v325i 1 
of course the footage from the 70s was grainy but that only enhanced the film 1 
if you check the directors filmography on this site you will see why this film didnt have a chance 0 
it feels poorly constructed the menus are difficult to navigate and the buttons are so recessed that it is difficult to push them 0 
it features an outlandish array of memorable psychotic but lovable nuts 1 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
the story starts too fast with absolutely no suspense or buildup in the slightest 0 
1010 1 
im not sure how long we stood there but it was long enough for me to begin to feel awkwardly out of place 0 
it defeats the purpose of a bluetooth headset 0 
i went on motorolas website and followed all directions but could not get it to pair again 0 
the attention given to every character and complex psychological portrayals detailing loyalty treachery love and hope are tremendous 1 
the result is a powerhouse achievement made more timely now perhaps because of our cultures disturbing fascination with celebrity and its distorted interpretations of fame 1 
i would give this television series a 10 plus if i could 1 
i would highly recommend this product 1 
it fits my ear well and is comfortable on 1 
even when the women finally show up there is no sign of improvement the most expected things happen and by the time the film is over you might be far asleep 0 
the company shipped my product very promptly and it works well 1 
i could not stand to even watch it for very long for fear of losing iq 0 
go to place for gyros 1 
not good for the money 0 
this movie is also revealing 1 
integrated seamlessly with the motorola razr phone 1 
we wont be going back 0 
you wont regret it 1 
on a positive note our server was very attentive and provided great service 1 
i received my headset in good time and was happy with it 1 
a must study for anyone interested in the worst sins of industrial design 0 
the pizza tasted old super chewy in not a good way 0 
it is a joy to use 1 
i will never forget it now 1 
howeverthe riingtones are not the best and neither are the games 0 
it was so cool 1 
it was clear that she had the range and ability to pull off this part 1 
im really disappointed all i have now is a charger that doesnt work 0 
very very disappointed ordered the 35 big bay plater 0 
this is a stunning movie 1 
i give it 2 thumbs down 0 
the phone loads super 1 
lately they have been extremely nice and helpful on the phone 1 
great pizza and salads 1 
my friend loved the salmon tartar 1 
the directing and the cinematography arent quite as good 0 
i guess it was supposed to be clever twist then shed some light on the situation but it was just stupid 0 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
the ambiance isnt much better 0 
bluetooth does not work phone locks up screens just flash up and now it just makes calls randomly while in my pocket locked 0 
the scallop dish is quite appalling for value as well 0 
the story line is just awful 0 
the film has an ultracheap look to it 0 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is vegas and located inside the crystals shopping mall by aria 1 
i could barely stomach the meal but didnt complain because it was a business lunch 0 
a truly truly bad film 0 
they do not care about the consumer one bit 0 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
ive tried several different earpieces for my cell phone and this jabra one is the first one ive found that fits my ear comfortably 1 
they are so cool 1 
but now i was completely grossed out 0 
the servers went back and forth several times not even so much as an are you being helped 0 
i would highly recommend this 1 
krussel always good 1 
a usable keyboard actually turns a pda into a realworld useful machine instead of just a neat gadget 1 
so in a nutshell 1 the restaraunt smells like a combination of a dirty fish market and a sewer 0 
which has more depth and character than the man underneath it 0 
great product and price 1 
it deserves strong love 1 
the food was barely lukewarm so it must have been sitting waiting for the server to bring it out to us 0 
so far so good 1 
the use of slowmotion needlessly repeats itself throughout the movie but is well backed up by bad acting and bad is a kind word here no continuity scenes that are thrown in for no reason whatsoever vehicles that looked like they were made from a corn flakes box and a directorial style that bordered on stupidity 0 
i great reception all the time 1 
talk about useless customer service 0 
good servicecheck 1 
dont go here 0 
i promise they wont disappoint 1 
good beer drink selection and good food selection 1 
at a time when it seems that film animation has been dominated by disneypixars cgi masterpieces it is both refreshing and comforting to know that miyazaki is still relying on traditional handdrawn animation to tell his charming and enchanting stories 1 
wont work right or atleast for me 0 
if you are reading this please dont go there 0 
would recommend this item 1 
better than expected 1 
i have recommended it to friends 1 
there arent death scenes like in previous movies and the fx are terrible 0 
disappointed 0 
about 30 minutes of footage is wasted to show mediocre elderly actors awkwardly babbling overwrought pseudosatanic gibberish corny enough to make a teen goth blush almost always in olde english and sometimes in latin that may or may not be made up words 0 
this item is fantastic and works perfectly 1 
again no plot at all 0 
i dont like this nokia either 0 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
you wont forget this movie 1 
in fact im going to round up to 4 stars just because she was so awesome 1 
will never ever go back 0 
i have never had such bland food which surprised me considering the article we read focused so much on their spices and flavor 0 
i like design and look of jabra behing the ear headsets and 5020 is pretty comfortible to wear 24 hours a day without pain in the ear 1 
omit watching this 0 
if i take a picture the battery drops a bar and starts beeping letting me know its dieing 0 
a happy wonderful feel good ending 1 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
on the ground right next to our table was a large smeared beensteppedinandtrackedeverywhere pile of green bird poop 0 
excellent sound quality 1 
a happy wonderful feel good ending 1 
ill be looking for a new earpiece 0 
its a sad movie but very good 1 
it was so cool 1 
you truly take this journey through the eyes and soul of a child 1 
iam very pleased with my purchase 1 
service was exceptional and food was a good as all the reviews 1 
extremely tasty 1 
if there were zero stars i would give it zero stars 0 
the staff are also very friendly and efficient 1 
this pair of headphones is the worst that i have ever had soundwise 0 
youll love how thin it is 1 
comfortable in my hand 1 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
i especially liked the noncliche choices with the parents in other movies i could predict the dialog verbatim but the writing in this movie made better selections 1 
the kids are annoying 0 
this movie now joins revenge of the boogeyman and zombiez as part of the hellish trinity of horror films 0 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
it didnt work people can not hear me when i talk 0 
if you plan to use this in a car forget about it 0 
i have eaten here multiple times and each time the food was delicious 1 
a good time 1 
these are certainly very comfortable and functionality is decent 1 
plus it was wellpaced and suited its relatively short run time 1 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
the whole experience was underwhelming and i think well just go to ninja sushi next time 0 
great atmosphere friendly and fast service 1 
the jalapeno bacon is soooo good 1 
no one at the table thought the food was above average or worth the wait that we had for it 0 
so i bought about 10 of these and saved alot of money 1 
at around 4 pm i bought it at around 8pm i started to watch at around 815pm i fast forwarded the remaining film to see if there was anything left watchable for a human being with a brain but there wasnt 0 
but what really made it unwatchable was the direction 0 
the roast beef sandwich tasted really good 1 
i own 2 of these cases and would order another 1 
it was a huge awkward 15lb piece of cow that was 34ths gristle and fat 0 
i liked it 1 
and i really did find them funny 1 
plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job 1 
my girlfriends veal was very bad 0 
the jalapeno bacon is soooo good 1 
this is infuriating 0 
there was no chemistry between ben affleck and sandra bullock in this film and i couldnt understand why he would consider even leaving his wifetobe for this chick that he supposedly was knocked out by 0 
waste your money on this game 1 
the vanilla ice cream was creamy and smooth while the profiterole choux pastry was fresh enough 1 
the movie is terribly boring in places 0 
how awesome is that 1 
a pretty good product 1 
the best place in vegas for breakfast just check out a sat or sun 1 
seriously killer hot chai latte 1 
which is precisely why i am giving it such a bad review 0 
even the squibs look awful 0 
the point is the journey a journey that touches every member of the family 1 
putting the race card aside lets look at the major flaw in the film they destroy latifas character 0 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
im so happy to be here 1 
the server was very negligent of our needs and made us feel very unwelcome i would not suggest this place 0 
we wont be going back anytime soon 0 
great choice 1 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
we ordered the duck rare and it was pink and tender on the inside with a nice char on the outside 1 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
i came back today since they relocated and still not impressed 0 
so flavorful and has just the perfect amount of heat 1 
it dit not work most of the time with my nokia 5320 0 
the food was outstanding and the prices were very reasonable 1 
ive dropped my phone more times than i can say even on concrete and my phone is still great knock on wood 1 
the writer gorman bechard undoubtedly did his homework because all references are industry and characterage appropriate 1 
obviously they have a terrible customer service so you get what you pay for 0 
youd have to have the iq of particularly stupid mollusk not to see that one coming 0 
special thanks to dylan t for the recommendation on what to order all yummy for my tummy 1 
its one of the most boring horror movies from the 90s mainly because it starts slow and centers in a boring atmosphere 0 
it failed to convey the broad sweep of landscapes that were a great part of the original 0 
phone is sturdy as all nokia bar phones are 1 
what a mistake 0 
the cinematography is simply stunning to say the least and the fx are nothing if not stateoftheart 1 
at first glance it is a lovely bakery cafe nice ambiance clean friendly staff 1 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
not a weekly haunt but definitely a place to come back to every once in a while 1 
so there is no way for me to plug it in here in the us unless i go by a converter 0 
i received my orders well within the shipping timeframe everything was in good working order and overall i am very excited to have this source 1 
hitchcock is a great director 1 
think of the film being like a dream 1 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
she ordered a toasted english muffin that came out untoasted 0 
you cant relate with them hell you barely can understand them 0 
were jerks on the phone 0 
good product incredible value 1 
its very slow 0 
the food was delicious our bartender was attentive and personable and we got a great deal 1 
ill be looking for a new earpiece 0 
the only thing i did like was the prime rib and dessert section 1 
the update procedure is difficult and cumbersome 0 
not only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic but it also managed to give away the entire movie and im not exaggerating every moment every plot point every joke is told in the trailer 0 
anyways the food was definitely not filling at all and for the price you pay you should expect more 0 
when i saw it in the theater i thought i was going to be sick 0 
in the span of an hour i had two people exclaim whoa is that the new phone on tv 1 
ray charles life provided excellent biographical material for the film which goes well beyond being just another movie about a musician 1 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
i dont have to be an accountant to know im getting screwed 0 
bela lugosi was totally extraneous intoning odd lines 0 
the food wasnt good 0 
the food was great as always compliments to the chef 1 
this pair of headphones is the worst that i have ever had soundwise 0 
i do not know if this was emilio estevezs directorial debut but the pacing the interplay and development of the characters as well as some clever camera work surrounding the character estevez plays all suggest a natural eye 1 
i own a jabra earset and was very happy with it but the sound quality especially outgoing on this is better 1 
i even fully charged it before i went to bed and turned off blue tooth and wifi and noticed that it only had 20 left in the morning 0 
the result is a powerhouse achievement made more timely now perhaps because of our cultures disturbing fascination with celebrity and its distorted interpretations of fame 1 
im glad the film didnt go for the most obvious choice as a lesser film certainly would have 1 
as i said abovepretty useless 0 
cumbersome design 0 
this place is great 1 
great pizza and salads 1 
nice blanket of moz over top but i feel like this was done to cover up the subpar food 1 
graphics is far from the best part of the game 0 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
it is very comfortable to wear as well which is probably the most important aspect about using a case 1 
i just cant explain this movie more than romanticcharminghilariousand adorablethe junkyard scenes are funnyall the junkyard dogs have something specialtoo funny i laughedkids will love itbuy it when it comes outit has new features 1 
you need at least 3 mins to get to your phone book from the time you first turn on the phonebattery life is short 0 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
in particular the relationship between the bakery assistant and the waitress just didnt work for me at all 0 
you never know if you pushed it hard enough or the right number of times for the function you want or not 0 
i have 23 bars on my cell phone when i am home but you cant not hear anything 0 
saw the movie today and thought it was a good effort good messages for kids 1 
the only good thing was that it fits comfortably on small ears 1 
i wear glasses and it fits fine with them 1 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
using all earpieces left or right this thing will not stay on my ear 0 
im so happy to be here 1 
i would have given no star if i was able 0 
ive tried several different earpieces for my cell phone and this jabra one is the first one ive found that fits my ear comfortably 1 
the movie was so boring that i sometimes found myself occupied peaking in the paper instead of watching never happened during a columbo movie before 0 
makes it easier to keep up with my bluetooth when im not wearing it 0 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
great character actors telly savalas and peter boyle 1 
and then tragedy struck 0 
works like a charm it work the same as the one i got with the phone 1 
due to this happening on every call i was forced to stop using this headset 0 
i received my orders well within the shipping timeframe everything was in good working order and overall i am very excited to have this source 1 
very disappointing 0 
a drive thru means you do not want to wait around for half an hour for your food but somehow when we end up going here they make us wait and wait 0 
tied to charger for conversations lasting more than 45 minutesmajor problems 0 
the story is lame not interesting and never really explains the sinister origins of the puppets 0 
it rocked my world and is certainly a must see for anyone with no social or physical outlets 1 
if you are reading this please dont go there 0 
aside from its terrible lead this film has loads of other debits 0 
definitely not worth the 3 i paid 0 
if you havent gone here go now 1 
a happy wonderful feel good ending 1 
the staff is great the food is delish and they have an incredible beer selection 1 
the acting helps the writing along very well maybe the idiotsavant sister could have been played better and it is a real joy to watch 1 
not impressed 0 
you get what you pay for i guess 0 
main thing i didnt enjoy is that the crowd is of older crowd around mid 30s and up 0 
easily none other cartoon made me laugh in a tender way before getting into dark sitcoms oriented for teenagers 1 
i dont have to be an accountant to know im getting screwed 0 
this phone is very fast with sending any kind of messages and web browsing is significantly faster than previous phones i have used 1 
i was so insulted 0 
i think not again 0 
food was average at best 0 
this is just a great movie 1 
a good time 1 
bad choice 0 
even when the women finally show up there is no sign of improvement the most expected things happen and by the time the film is over you might be far asleep 0 
the goat taco didnt skimp on the meat and wow what flavor 1 
this place deserves no stars 0 
this is so embarassing and also my ears hurt if i try to push the ear plug into my ear 0 
come hungry leave happy and stuffed 1 
raw and sublimely moving 1 
none of the new ones have ever quite worked properly 0 
it was so bad i had lost the heart to finish it 0 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
i was able to do voice dialing in the car with no problem 1 
the ripped banana was not only ripped but petrified and tasteless 0 
anyways the food was definitely not filling at all and for the price you pay you should expect more 0 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
the phone crashed completely and now i have to get it replaced 0 
every thing on phone work perfectly she like it 1 
worst thai ever 0 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
another note about this phones appearance is that it really looks rather bland especially in the all black model 0 
i think that it is a must see older john wayne film 1 
good transmit audio 1 
im happy about this purchase good quality and low price 1 
of course the footage from the 70s was grainy but that only enhanced the film 1 
worthless product 0 
not loud enough and doesnt turn on like it should 0 
this hole in the wall has great mexican street tacos and friendly staff 1 
and the sound quality is great 1 
best fish ive ever had in my life 1 
a world better than 95 of the garbage in the theatres today 1 
emily watsons character is very strong and she has only to give a quick glance and you understand everything 1 
as many people complained i found this headsets microphone was very weak 0 
in a word it is embarrassing 0 
the restaurant atmosphere was exquisite 1 
the construction of the headsets is poor 0 
i ate there twice on my last visit and especially enjoyed the salmon salad 1 
the lighting is awful 0 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
im still trying to get over how bad it was 0 
worse theres an incredibly weak subplot thrown in that follows a little band of latterday mansonites as they go after a reporter whos working on a story on the anniversary of the killings 0 
total letdown i would much rather just go to the camelback flower shop and cartel coffee 0 
the sound quality is excellent as well 1 
my only complaint is the standard sound volume is a little low even when turned up to 5of 5 0 
waste of money 0 
a truly truly bad film 0 
aailiyah was pretty good as akasha in places compelling her first entrance and mini dance scene 1 
their onscreen chemistry critical to the entire film is genuine 1 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
i dont think there are any redeeming qualities in this remake 0 
he also came back to check on us regularly excellent service 1 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
alexander nevsky is a great film 1 
the acting from all involved and that includes those like shatner and nimoy is bad and washed out and making them seem as old as they look in real life the special effects are tacky like when spock has to rescue kirk on a jet pack when he falls down from a mountain 0 
nice spicy and tender 1 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
it is perfect for a sitdown family meal or get together with a few friends 1 
the food came out at a good pace 1 
im so happy to be here 1 
then as if i hadnt wasted enough of my life there they poured salt in the wound by drawing out the time it took to bring the check 0 
see it 1 
they do not last forever but is not overly expensive to replaceeasy to operate and the sound is much better than others i have tried 1 
this gets a 1 out of 10 simply because theres nothing lower 0 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
the awful dialogue and hopeless overacting by everyone who gets shot top off a real waste of space and time 0 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
also the fries are without a doubt the worst fries ive ever had 0 
it was awesome 1 
in the summer you can dine in a charming outdoor patio so very delightful 1 
you cant go wrong with any of the food here 1 
their chow mein is so good 1 
the awful dialogue and hopeless overacting by everyone who gets shot top off a real waste of space and time 0 
the burger had absolutely no flavor the meat itself was totally bland the burger was overcooked and there was no charcoal flavor 0 
avoid this one if you can 0 
i vomited in the bathroom mid lunch 0 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
barney is definitely super de duper 1 
the mic is great 1 
excellent product 1 
this is not moviemaking 0 
this place should honestly be blown up 0 
predictable but not a bad watch 1 
also the story and acting were weak 0 
i seriously cannot believe that the owner has so many unexperienced employees that all are running around like chickens with their heads cut off 0 
horrible dont waste your time and money 0 
dont waste your money 0 
i will be back many times soon 1 
wont work right or atleast for me 0 
everything about this product is wrongfirst 0 
i am so pleased to know such a modern day genius is out there letting is passion for art drive him and taking us as an audience with him 1 
also its slim enough to fit into my alarm clock docking station without removing the case 1 
the movie had you on the edge of your seat and made you somewhat afraid to go to your car at the end of the night 1 
the characters are interesting even if a bit predictable 1 
the plot has more holes than a pair of fishnet stockings and the direction and editing is astonishingly ham fisted 0 
fantastic service here 1 
it works 1 
a great film by a great director 1 
this item is great installed it let it charged up overnite and it has been working good every since with no problems 1 
i was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar not only because the quality is great but the service is fast and the food impeccable 1 
now we were chosen to be tortured with this disgusting piece of blatant american propaganda 0 
i wear glasses and it fits fine with them 1 
on the good side the staff was genuinely pleasant and enthusiastic a real treat 1 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
the server was very negligent of our needs and made us feel very unwelcome i would not suggest this place 0 
the buffet at bellagio was far from what i anticipated 0 
i can assure you that you wont be disappointed 1 
also its a real treat to see anthony quinn playing crazy horse 1 
doesnt work at all i bougth it for my l7c and its not working 0 
this review is long overdue since i consider a tale of two sisters to be the single greatest film ever made 1 
having trouble with volume 0 
although i very much liked the look and sound of this place the actual experience was a bit disappointing 0 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
we wont be returning 0 
the film has an ultracheap look to it 0 
they have horrible attitudes towards customers and talk down to each one when customers dont enjoy their food 0 
the cable looks so thin and flimsy it is scary 0 
this place is handsdown one of the best places to eat in the phoenix metro area 1 
unfortunately inexperience of direction meant that scene after scene passed with little in the way of dramatic tension or conflict 0 
the story starts too fast with absolutely no suspense or buildup in the slightest 0 
see it 1 
the hockey scenes are terrible defensemen playing like theyre 5 years old goalies diving at shots that are 10 feet wide of the net etc 0 
this movie is excellentangel is beautiful and scamp is adorablehis little yelps when hes scaredand the funniest parts are whenscamp is caught under the curtain and when angel and scamp are singing ive never had this feeling beforei totally recommend this movieits coming out on special edition on june 20the cover has scamp on a garbage can and angel underneath the lid 1 
the show would begin with smart ass ed comments to each other that would be totally off the wall and uncalled for 0 
hence the whole story lacks a certain energy 0 
if it was to turn my good day feeling into a night of disturbing memories than i guess he succeeded 0 
to sum the film up breeders is a terrible cheaply made horror movie that should be avoided like the ebola virus 0 
we asked for the bill to leave without eating and they didnt bring that either 0 
i have eaten here multiple times and each time the food was delicious 1 
im not impressed with the concept or the food 0 
will never ever go back 0 
on the ground right next to our table was a large smeared beensteppedinandtrackedeverywhere pile of green bird poop 0 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
i was particularly pleased with the acting ability of dwight schultz 1 
this results in the phone being either stuck at max volume or mute 0 
there still are good actors around 1 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
a great touch 1 
i have never had such bland food which surprised me considering the article we read focused so much on their spices and flavor 0 
but the actingeven that of such professionals as drago and debbie rochonwas terrible the directing worse perhaps contributory to the former the dialog chimplike and the camera work barely tolerable 0 
actually the graphics were good at the time 1 
if good intentions made a film great then this film might be one of the greatest films ever made 1 
to call this movie a drama is ridiculous 0 
each day of the week they have a different deal and its all so delicious 1 
the kids are very cool too 1 
the management is rude 0 
i have to mention this and it is a huge spoiler i loved the ending how all the characters of the three films were the remaining survivors of the ferry disaster with valentine and the young judge together and the old man watching it on her tv solidifying his happiness over the suffering which he dealt with for those many years 1 
it is shameful 0 
does not fit 0 
it is unusable in a moving car at freeway speed 0 
and it was boring 0 
i have only had it for a few weeks but so far so good 1 
the movie is terribly boring in places 0 
ordered a double cheeseburger got a single patty that was falling apart picture uploaded yeah still sucks 0 
excellent bluetooth headset 1 
crostini that came with the salad was stale 0 
you need at least 3 mins to get to your phone book from the time you first turn on the phonebattery life is short 0 
the greek dressing was very creamy and flavorful 1 
i love this place 1 
really awful 0 
we had 7 at our table and the service was pretty fast 1 
oh this is such a thing of beauty this restaurant 1 
this review is long overdue since i consider a tale of two sisters to be the single greatest film ever made 1 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
you could drive a semi truck into these holes 0 
the jalapeno bacon is soooo good 1 
definitely worth checking out 1 
i started this review with two stars but im editing it to give it only one 0 
we sat another ten minutes and finally gave up and left 0 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
i go to far too many places and ive never seen any restaurant that serves a 1 egg breakfast especially for 400 0 
steamboat willie is an amazingly important film to our cinema history 1 
1010 1 
youll love how thin it is 1 
i was so insulted 0 
excellent starter wireless headset 0 
this phone tries very hard to do everything but fails at its very ability to be a phone 0 
the story unfolds in 18th century jutland and the use of period music played on period instruments is just one more fine touch 1 
this one wants to surf on the small wave of space movies in 1998 deep impact and armageddon and this one fails everywhere 0 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
it was a drive to get there 0 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
when my mom and i got home she immediately got sick and she only had a few bites of salad 0 
seafood was limited to boiled shrimp and crab legs but the crab legs definitely did not taste fresh 0 
it didnt work people can not hear me when i talk 0 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
recommend with confidence 1 
this place is handsdown one of the best places to eat in the phoenix metro area 1 
works for me 1 
he also came back to check on us regularly excellent service 1 
simple lightweight and great fit 1 
nice blanket of moz over top but i feel like this was done to cover up the subpar food 1 
i like steiners because its dark and it feels like a bar 1 
the staff are great the ambiance is great 1 
i have two more years left in this contract and i hate this phone 0 
that movie was bad 0 
not only did the software do a great job of this i could also make my own ringtones form my existing cds without an internet connection 1 
it probably would have been better if the director hadnt spent most of the movie showcasing his own art work which really isnt that noteworthy 0 
garbo who showed right off the bat that her talents could carry over from the silent era i wanted to see some of her silent work but netflix doesnt seem to be stocking them 1 
the two main characters may be two of the most believable children i ever saw put on screen 1 
i wear glasses and it fits fine with them 1 
the staff is great the food is delish and they have an incredible beer selection 1 
the mic is great 1
