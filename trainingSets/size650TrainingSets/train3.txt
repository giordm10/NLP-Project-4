everything was good and tasty 1 
similarly the delivery man did not say a word of apology when our food was 45 minutes late 0 
i really wanted the plantronics 510 to be the right one but it has too many issues for methe good 0 
he really didnt seem to want to be hosting his voiceovers were monotonous didnt get involved with the guests 0 
but storm trooper is not even bad enough to make it to the list of wonderfully terrible movies 0 
jamie foxx absolutely is ray charles 1 
phone is sturdy as all nokia bar phones are 1 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
lately they have been extremely nice and helpful on the phone 1 
im not impressed with the concept or the food 0 
stay away from the q 0 
i could not understand what kind of idiot would produce this mess in the first place not to mention several season 0 
its a gloriously fun fast paced and fairly accurate portrayal of the night of a raver 1 
im really disappointed all i have now is a charger that doesnt work 0 
plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job 1 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
this movie is bad 0 
the service was a little slow considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace 0 
try them in the airport to experience some tasty food and speedy friendly service 1 
it was just too horrible 0 
wont ever go here again 0 
recommend with confidence 1 
i came back today since they relocated and still not impressed 0 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
i would not recommend this place 0 
the flat reenactments dont hold your attention because they are emotionally adrift and stagy 0 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
however after seeing the short again after about 25 years i was amazed at how timeless the film actually is 1 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
the cast of veteran actors are more than just a nostalgia trip 1 
it was a great phone 1 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
this movie creates its own universe and is fascinating in every way 1 
great food and awesome service 1 
this is definitely one of the better documentaries i have seen looking at family relationships and marriage 1 
and the sound quality is great 1 
the pizza selections are good 1 
characters are onedimensional even the good guys and especially the bad guys 0 
i would definitely recommend the jabra bt250v for those who are looking for comfort clarity and a great price 1 
truly awful 0 
the food was very good 1 
i love this place 1 
low quality 0 
this phone is slim and light and the display is beautiful 1 
service was exceptional and food was a good as all the reviews 1 
it is just the sort of pap that is screened in the afternoon to punish the unemployed for not having jobs 0 
dont buy this product 0 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
do not make the same mistake as me 0 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
anyway the plot flowed smoothly and the malebonding scenes were a hoot 1 
i was shocked because no signs indicate cash only 0 
spoilers whatever else can or cant be said about it surface is superbly crafted 1 
dont waste your on this one 0 
go to place for gyros 1 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
very tough and very short on flavor 0 
this is probably one of the least effective and utterly unoriginal films i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
this movie was kind of long in length but i enjoyed every minute of it 1 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
either way it sucks 0 
this phone is very fast with sending any kind of messages and web browsing is significantly faster than previous phones i have used 1 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
from what my dinner companions told meeverything was very fresh with nice texture and taste 1 
still its quite interesting and entertaining to follow 1 
i will come back here every time im in vegas 1 
the acting was bad the dialogs were extremely shallow and insincere 0 
also its slim enough to fit into my alarm clock docking station without removing the case 1 
the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach 0 
this convention never worked well in the past and certainly doesnt work here 0 
again lame 0 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
the headset fulfills my requirements so i am happy with my purchase 1 
last time buying from you 0 
of course the acting is blah 0 
this was my first and only vegas buffet and it did not disappoint 1 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
the characters are interesting even if a bit predictable 1 
lucy bell is so much higher than this crap and for her to sink this low is quite depressing 0 
horrible had to switch 3 times 0 
it was either too cold not enough flavor or just bad 0 
i believe the screenwriter did a good job of tying up the loose ends 1 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
i only hear garbage for audio 0 
the selection on the menu was great and so were the prices 1 
the chains which im no fan of beat this place easily 0 
great software for motorolas 1 
if you plan to use this in a car forget about it 0 
all the pretty pictures in the world cannot make up for a piece of work that is flawed at the core 0 
elias koteasjack palance play good roles angelina is hot and gets nakedbilly drago appears in this and is cool as usual a cameo by sven ole thorsen helps make this a very enjoyable movie with good acting and a decent budget 1 
it is wonderful and inspiring to watch and i hope that it gets released again on to video or dvd 1 
if you do watch it however there are small consolations the actresses playing annes sisters each do a wonderful job with their roles 1 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
best tater tots in the southwest 1 
i really dont see how anyone could enjoy this movie 0 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
they could be used as exemplars for any set designer 1 
artless camerawork endlessly presents us with the ugliest setting imaginable ie 0 
a film not easily forgotten 1 
the text messaging feature is really tricky to use 0 
the construction of the headsets is poor 0 
dont waste your time watching this rubbish nonresearched film 0 
its kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly its embarrassing how childlike the company is 0 
the jerky camera movements were also annoying 0 
bought mainly for the charger which broke soon after purchasing 0 
what a piece of junk i lose more calls on this phone 0 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
the lighting is awful 0 
the film has an ultracheap look to it 0 
hence the whole story lacks a certain energy 0 
i would recommend this 1 
the stories were powerful explorations of the nature of man and of art 1 
i cannot believe that the actors agreed to do this film 0 
i have seen many movies starring jaclyn smith but my god this was one of her best though it came out 12 years ago 1 
tom wilkinson broke my heart at the end and everyone elses judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike 1 
they were goldencrispy and delicious 1 
10 out of 10 for both the movie and trilogy 1 
just what i wanted 1 
this is was due to the fact that it took 20 minutes to be acknowledged then another 35 minutes to get our foodand they kept forgetting things 0 
i got to enjoy the seafood salad with a fabulous vinegrette 1 
you need at least 3 mins to get to your phone book from the time you first turn on the phonebattery life is short 0 
third the cheese on my friends burger was cold 0 
anyways the food was definitely not filling at all and for the price you pay you should expect more 0 
up there with the best of melville 1 
you could only take 2 videos at a time and the quality was very poor 0 
being a 90s child i truly enjoyed this show and i can proudly say that i enjoyed it big time and even more than the classical wb cartoons 1 
i left the theater with a lilt in my step joy in my heart and hope for the human race 1 
comes with a strong light that you can use to light up your camera shots and even flash sos signals seriously 1 
pretty good beer selection too 1 
the earpiece on this is too large or too heavyit keeps falling out of my ear 0 
but the service was beyond bad 0 
treo and tmobile refused to replace it again and forced me to buy another phone without any kind of upgrade discount 0 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
very windresistant 1 
light weight i hardly notice it is there 1 
generous portions and great taste 1 
bad script bad direction and horrible acting make this one plain bad 0 
dont waste your time here 0 
this short film certainly pulls no punches 0 
yet i enjoy watching it 1 
i also didnt like the on button it felt like it would crack with use 0 
this phone is slim and light and the display is beautiful 1 
new battery works great in phone 1 
if the food isnt bad enough for you then enjoy dealing with the worlds worstannoying drunk people 0 
as for the mains also uninspired 0 
sooooo good 1 
the plot has more holes than a pair of fishnet stockings and the direction and editing is astonishingly ham fisted 0 
if it were possible to give them zero stars theyd have it 0 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
i have always used corded headsets and the freedom from the wireless is very helpful 1 
i received my headset in good time and was happy with it 1 
i always order from the vegetarian menu during dinner which has a wide array of options to choose from 1 
great pocket pc phone combination 1 
ive tried several different earpieces for my cell phone and this jabra one is the first one ive found that fits my ear comfortably 1 
ive never been more insulted or felt disrespected 0 
cant say enough good things about this place 1 
if there were zero stars i would give it zero stars 0 
this is was due to the fact that it took 20 minutes to be acknowledged then another 35 minutes to get our foodand they kept forgetting things 0 
the staff was very attentive 1 
it was a riot to see hugo weaving play a sexobsessed gay real estate salesman who uses his clients houses for his trysts with the flaming darren tom hollander 1 
the poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying 0 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
great phone 1 
this was like the final blow 0 
fantastic service here 1 
i went on motorolas website and followed all directions but could not get it to pair again 0 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
the staff is always super friendly and helpful which is especially cool when you bring two small boys and a baby 1 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
i would recommend it 1 
not a good bargain 0 
its practically perfect in all of them  a true masterpiece in a sea of faux masterpieces 1 
waste your money on this game 1 
i saw this movie and i thought this is a stupid movie 0 
the stories were as unbelievable as the actors 0 
avoid at all costs 0 
it was either too cold not enough flavor or just bad 0 
the chains which im no fan of beat this place easily 0 
bad purchase 0 
the plot simply rumbles on like a machine desperately depending on the addition of new scenes 0 
i literally vomited while watching this film 0 
great bluetooth 1 
kind of flops around 0 
i love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it 1 
there was hardly any meat 0 
very very fun chef 1 
the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach 0 
tried to go here for lunch and it was a madhouse 0 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
very satisifed with that 1 
i use this product in a motor control center where there is a lot of high voltage humming from the equipment and it works great 1 
the only good thing was that it fits comfortably on small ears 1 
phone now holds charge like it did when it was new 1 
it is the best charger i have seen on the market yet 1 
fantastic service here 1 
she carries the movie well 1 
poor talk time performance 0 
the film is well paced understated and one of the best courtroom documentaries ive seen 1 
it presents a idyllic yet serious portrayal of the ups and downs of the characters lives 1 
it has northern humour and positive about the community it represents 1 
of all the dishes the salmon was the best but all were great 1 
excellent product for the price 1 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
editing the editing of this film was phenomenal in my opinion 1 
lame would be the best way to describe it 0 
the food was excellent and service was very good 1 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
the film has great actors a master director a significant themeat least a wouldbe significant theme undertone of fifties existential worldweariness aerial scenes that ought to have thrilled both senses and imagination and characters about which one might deeply care 1 
the movie is terribly boring in places 0 
my girlfriends veal was very bad 0 
very comfortable 1 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
lets start with all the problemsthe acting especially from the lead professor was very very bad 0 
i have yet to run this new battery below two bars and thats three days without charging 1 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
it was probably dirt 0 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
it was delicious 1 
up there with the best of melville 1 
this is definitely a cult classic well worth viewing and sharing with others 1 
great product fast shipping 1 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
has been working great 1 
i mean really how do you get so famous for your fish and chips when its so terrible 0 
this may be the only bad film he ever made 0 
the best electronics of the available fm transmitters 1 
rating 1 out of 10 0 
excellent phone 1 
the script is bad very bad  it contains both cheesiness and unethical joke that you normally see in rated r or nc17 movie 0 
which is precisely why i am giving it such a bad review 0 
our server was very nice and even though he looked a little overwhelmed with all of our needs he stayed professional and friendly until the end 1 
we had a group of 70 when we claimed we would only have 40 and they handled us beautifully 1 
this particular model would not work with my motorola q smartphone 0 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
the sangria was about half of a glass wine full and was 12 ridiculous 0 
they were excellent 1 
but then they came back cold 0 
ryans bar is definitely one edinburgh establishment i wont be revisiting 0 
i ordered the lemon raspberry ice cocktail which was also incredible 1 
the price was very good and with the free shipping and all it was a good purchase 1 
he cant act one of the least scary villains i have ever seen he cant write did he write this damn movie in his sleep 0 
very windresistant 1 
great food and great service in a clean and friendly setting 1 
it was a long time that i didnt see a so charismatic actor on screen 1 
great product and price 1 
gave up trying to eat any of the crust teeth still sore 0 
a very good film indeed about great and unconditional love 1 
constantine gives everything the right intensity and seems to have a good understanding of the underlying psychological motivations 1 
good show samsung 1 
new battery works great in phone 1 
definitely worth seeing its the sort of thought provoking film that forces you to question your own threshold of loneliness 1 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
if it was to turn my good day feeling into a night of disturbing memories than i guess he succeeded 0 
it was absolutely amazing 1 
its so bad its actually worth seeing just for that reason 0 
it wasnt busy at all and now we know why 0 
the story line is totally predictable 0 
excellent service 1 
this place is awesome if you want something light and healthy during the summer 1 
now this is a movie i really dislike 0 
meredith m was better than all right 1 
i have yet to run this new battery below two bars and thats three days without charging 1 
this item is fantastic and works perfectly 1 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
i dont think it would hold it too securly on your belt 0 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
frankly after cotton club and unfaithful it was kind of embarrassing to watch lane and gere in this film because it is bad 0 
this movie has a cutting edge to it 1 
very pleased with this headset 1 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
you can watch them preparing the delicious food 1 
i got to enjoy the seafood salad with a fabulous vinegrette 1 
the lighting is awful 0 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
i purchased this and within 2 days it was no longer working 0 
would recommend this item 1 
the movie seemed a little slow at first 0 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
this was a different cut than the piece the other day but still wonderful and tender s well as well flavored 1 
totally different with loads of understatement and black comedy this is a film few get to see but those who do will remember it 1 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
it fits so securely that the ear hook does not even need to be used and the sound is better directed through your ear canal 1 
the instruction manual is lacking 0 
what i really like there is the crepe station 1 
the aerial scenes were welldone 1 
will never ever go back and have told many people what had happened 0 
but the convoluted plot just didnt convince me and much of the film was watched with a weird questioning glance 0 
this may be the only bad film he ever made 0 
this is truly an art movieit actually has a lot of art in it 1 
so just beware 0 
i recommend this for everyone who loves film movies anythinga work of art 1 
i got to enjoy the seafood salad with a fabulous vinegrette 1 
third the cheese on my friends burger was cold 0 
delicious 1 
i want to first say our server was great and we had perfect service 1 
very comfortable 1 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
really bad 0 
damn good steak 1 
its a fresh subtle and rather sublime effect 1 
omelets are to die for 1 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
even worse than ticker 0 
it shouldnt take 30 min for pancakes and eggs 0 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
i really dont see how anyone could enjoy this movie 0 
howeverthe riingtones are not the best and neither are the games 0 
i really loved the story line and the poler bear was kinda cutebut if anyone has a question about fort steele just ask away 1 
everything is appalling 0 
its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
the basic premise is wasted since it is sidelined by the inexplicable focus on the documentary crew 0 
the mic there is a joke and the volume is quite low 0 
to those who find this movie intelligent or even masterful i can only say its your intelligence and your imagination you obviously used to try and make some sense of this pitiful attempt its in our human nature to try and make sense of things 0 
must have been an off night at this place 0 
this phone is pretty sturdy and ive never had any large problems with it 1 
also were served hot bread and butter and home made potato chips with bacon bits on topvery original and very good 1 
better than new 1 
hell no will i go back 0 
as a courtroom drama its compelling as an indictment on the american justice system its frightening 1 
not impressed 0 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
would not reccommend 0 
wed definitely go back here again 1 
the acting is terrible and the writing is worse 0 
we also ordered the spinach and avocado salad the ingredients were sad and the dressing literally had zero taste 0 
my fiancé and i came in the middle of the day and we were greeted and seated right away 1 
the charger arrived within the promised timeframe but it did not work 0 
the nano stated itmy son was dissapointed 0 
earbud piece breaks easily 0 
i find wasting food to be despicable but this just wasnt food 0 
the mic there is a joke and the volume is quite low 0 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
bad purchase 0 
this would not even be good as a made for tv flick 0 
the veggitarian platter is out of this world 1 
the nachos are a must have 1 
this place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver 0 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
the food is rich so order accordingly 1 
the bartender was also nice 1 
im so happy to be here 1 
it doesnt make you look cool 0 
i have had problems wit hit dropping signal and more 0 
worked perfectly 1 
it is zillion times away from reality 0 
fast service 1 
i own 2 of these cases and would order another 1 
in addition to having one of the most lovely songs ever written french cancan also boasts one of the cutest leading ladies ever to grace the screen 1 
the movie has almost no action scenes in it and very little comedy 0 
but it does get better reception and clarity than any phone ive had before 1 
none of the three sizes they sent with the headset would stay in my ears 0 
constantine gives everything the right intensity and seems to have a good understanding of the underlying psychological motivations 1 
linksys should have some way to exchange a bad phone for a refurb unit or something 0 
this place lacked style 0 
would not reccommend 0 
the screen does get smudged easily because it touches your ear and face 0 
very good stuff for the price 1 
how awesome is that 1 
even if you love bad movies do not watch this movie 0 
you wont forget this movie 1 
it will drive you barking mad 0 
its pure brilliance 1 
the worst piece of crap ever along with the verizon customer service 0 
down the drain because of a weak snap 0 
i really liked that 1 
worst phone ever 0 
the movie has almost no action scenes in it and very little comedy 0 
i had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get some relief 0 
special thanks to dylan t for the recommendation on what to order all yummy for my tummy 1 
crash is a depressing little nothing that provokes emotion but teaches you nothing if you already know racism and prejudice are bad things 0 
i wear it everyday and it holds up very well 1 
i think this restaurant suffers from not trying hard enough 0 
talk about great customer service of course we will be back 1 
my only problem is i thought the actor playing the villain was a low rent michael ironside 0 
its a fresh subtle and rather sublime effect 1 
shes poised and amazing 1 
obviously they have a terrible customer service so you get what you pay for 0 
i used bitpim a free program you can find on the internetto transfer data to the phonethe price of the cable was excellent 1 
excellent product for the price 1 
i dont know exactly what it is about this movie but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our familys memories 1 
they work about 2 weeks then break 0 
anyways the food was definitely not filling at all and for the price you pay you should expect more 0 
service is quick and even to go orders are just like we like it 1 
the films dialogue is natural real to life 1 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
the acting is terrible and the writing is worse 0 
i probably wont be coming back here 0 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
perhaps my phone is defective but people cannot hear me when i use this 0 
this place is not worth your time let alone vegas 0 
i checked everywhere and there is no feature for it which is really disappointing 0 
the battery works great 1 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
my salad had a bland vinegrette on the baby greens and hearts of palm 0 
i took back my money and got outta there 0 
nevertheless yet another wonderful film from the great masters stable 1 
so far it has worked like a charm 1 
his losing his marbles so early in the proceedings is totally implausible and unconvincing 0 
this place is great 1 
honeslty it didnt taste that fresh 0 
reasonably priced also 1 
about 30 minutes of footage is wasted to show mediocre elderly actors awkwardly babbling overwrought pseudosatanic gibberish corny enough to make a teen goth blush almost always in olde english and sometimes in latin that may or may not be made up words 0 
unless youre just out to visually collect all extant films of austens work you can skip this one 0 
it defeats the purpose of a bluetooth headset 0 
i struggle to find anything bad to say about it 1 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
never going back 0 
not good when wearing a hat or sunglasses 0 
the bottowm lineanother worthless cheap gimmick from sprint 0 
if you are razr owneryou must have this 1 
it also had a new problem 0 
the bartender was also nice 1 
this movie contained an allstar cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i havent seen before 1 
waitress was a little slow in service 0 
my boyfriend and i came here for the first time on a recent trip to vegas and could not have been more pleased with the quality of food and service 1 
i will not be eating there again 0 
that one didnt work either 0 
horrible had to switch 3 times 0 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
piece of trash 0 
the plastic breaks really easy on this clip 0 
lately they have been extremely nice and helpful on the phone 1 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
just reading on the specs alone makes you say wow 1 
i was seated immediately 1 
good show samsung 1 
very true to shakespear and a must for all shakespear fans 1 
do not purchase this phone 0 
punishment park is a brilliant piece of cinema 1 
dont waste your time 0 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
this one works and was priced right 1 
all the other cases ive tried normally fall apart after a few months but this one seems to be in for the long haul 1 
i guess i should have known that this place would suck because it is inside of the excalibur but i didnt use my common sense 0 
everything about this product is wrongfirst 0 
that being said for a phone the camera is very nice many cool effects to play with and video is decent as well 1 
i as well wouldve given godfathers zero stars if possible 0 
this is one of the best italian thrillers of the early 70s 1 
the budget was evidently very limited 0 
both films are terrible but to the credit of the 1986 version it was watchable 0 
which is precisely why i am giving it such a bad review 0 
phone is sturdy as all nokia bar phones are 1 
jamie foxx absolutely is ray charles 1 
the management is rude 0 
a fantastic neighborhood gem 1 
if you check the directors filmography on this site you will see why this film didnt have a chance 0 
when i placed my treo into the case not only was it not snug but there was a lot of extra room on the sides 0 
chinese forgeries abound 0 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
this device is great in several situations1 1 
this mostly routine factbased tv drama gets a boost from the fine performance by cole 1 
arrived quickly and much less expensive than others being sold 1 
i gave it 5 stars because of the sound quality 1 
i dont think you will be disappointed 1 
however after finally watching this film i realized that not only had i had a closed mind to the brilliance it depicts i also found myself watching it over and over again 1 
barney is definitely super de duper 1 
from what my dinner companions told meeverything was very fresh with nice texture and taste 1 
and generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode 0 
thats how id describe this painfully dreary timewaster of a film 0 
barney is definitely super de duper 1 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
the sound quality for the device is unacceptableunless you are in a really quiet area you almost hear nothing 0 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
bad script bad direction and horrible acting make this one plain bad 0 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
wont go back 0 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
ive had better not only from dedicated boba tea spots but even from jenni pho 0 
i wasted my little money with this earpiece 0 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
in summary this was a largely disappointing dining experience 0 
think it over when you plan to own this onethis sure is the last moto phone for me 0 
there was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth but it didnt really work into the rest of the plot 0 
its just painful 0 
great brunch spot 1 
the food is about on par with dennys which is to say not good at all 0 
probably not in a hurry to go back 0 
this is not moviemaking 0 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
the acting is fantastic the stories are seamlessly woven together and the dogs are splendid a must rent view or see 1 
bad purchase 0 
a good commentary of todays love and undoubtedly a film worth seeing 1 
ryans bar is definitely one edinburgh establishment i wont be revisiting 0 
overall a delight 1 
the tracfonewebsite is user friendly and makes it easy toactivate etc 1 
it defeats the purpose of a bluetooth headset 0 
the eargels channel the sound directly into your ear and seem to increase the sound volume and clarity 1 
my only complaint is the standard sound volume is a little low even when turned up to 5of 5 0 
excellent sound battery life and inconspicuous to boot 1 
all of the tapas dishes were delicious 1 
the design is very good4 1 
do not waste your time 0 
the death row scenes were entirely unmoving 0 
works great 1 
works great 1 
i have had tmobile service for 2 or 3 years now and i am pretty happy with it 1 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
spend your money and time some place else 0 
i got the aluminum case for my new palm vx and it worked really wellit has protected my handheld perfectly so far 1 
the food amazing 1 
the warm beer didnt help 0 
see both films if you can 1 
the microphone also works well but according to people i have called it applifies everything 1 
a good time 1 
great product and price 1 
if you havent choked in your own vomit by the end by all the cheap drama and worthless dialogue youve must have bored yourself to death with this waste of time 0 
best headset ever 1 
unfortunately we must have hit the bakery on leftover day because everything we ordered was stale 0 
does everything it should and more 1 
i have tried these cables with my computer and my ipod and it works just fine 1 
i received my supposedly new motorola 375 and apparently there was not a match between the phone and the charger 0 
the most annoying thing about cover girl is the way in which rita hayworth is put up on a pedestal 0 
this is a very average phone with bad battery life that operates on a weak network 0 
this is a great little item 1 
i had the mac salad and it was pretty bland so i will not be getting that again 0 
the battery is completely useless to me 0 
how awful she is 0 
food quality has been horrible 0 
great food 1 
if youre not familiar check it out 1 
very disappointing 0 
just does not work 0 
there is no plot or storyline 0 
portable and it works 1 
this is probably the most irritating show i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
the screen size is big key pad lit well enough and the camera quality is excellent for a camera phone 1 
the shrimp tender and moist 1 
i went to bachi burger on a friends recommendation and was not disappointed 1 
my breakfast was perpared great with a beautiful presentation of 3 giant slices of toast lightly dusted with powdered sugar 1 
i knew when i saw the film that more great things were to come from this gifted actor 1 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
it was so bad i had lost the heart to finish it 0 
will never ever go back 0 
cumbersome design 0 
it was forced like everything in this movie 0 
better than youd expect 1 
speaking of the music it is unbearably predictably and kitchy 0 
the nachos are a must have 1 
the instruction manual is lacking 0 
then i had to continue pairing it periodically since it somehow kept dropping 0 
i gave it 5 stars because of the sound quality 1 
terrible service 0 
w810i is just superb 1 
the menu is always changing food quality is going down service is extremely slow 0 
i use this product in a motor control center where there is a lot of high voltage humming from the equipment and it works great 1 
it was a very superficial movie and it gave me the feeling that i was watching play rather than a film 0 
i give it 2 thumbs down 0 
very unreliable service from tmobile 0 
useless phone simply deaf 0 
another note about this phones appearance is that it really looks rather bland especially in the all black model 0 
this movie is greatespecially if you enjoy visual arts 1 
i know he was a contract player with little control over his scripts but the acting was as bad as the script 0 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
will never ever go back 0 
the script is a big flawed mess 0 
the battery is completely useless to me 0 
first the bathrooms at this location were dirty seat covers were not replenished just plain yucky 0 
it worked very well 1 
cant store anything but phone numbers to sim 0 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
excellent cast story line performances 1 
it even has its sweet moments 1 
i give wirefly 1 stari will contact cingularatt and inform them of this practice 0 
about ten minutes into this film i started having second thoughts 0 
i gave it 5 stars because of the sound quality 1 
these are fabulous 1 
it also had a new problem 0 
when i received my pita it was huge it did have a lot of meat in it so thumbs up there 1 
def coming back to bowl next time 1 
you can find better movies at youtube 0 
this movie has a cutting edge to it 1 
this place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver 0 
a pretty good product 1 
the price was very good and with the free shipping and all it was a good purchase 1 
if good intentions made a film great then this film might be one of the greatest films ever made 1 
integrated seamlessly with the motorola razr phone 1 
dont make the same mistake that i did and please dont buy this phone 0 
very disappointed and wondered how it could be in the oscar shortlist 0 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
the sound quality is excellent as well 1 
still i do like this movie for its empowerment of women theres not enough movies out there like this one 1 
you cant go wrong with any of the food here 1 
same evening him and i are both drastically sick 0 
the food was great as always compliments to the chef 1 
i ordered the lemon raspberry ice cocktail which was also incredible 1 
my gyro was basically lettuce only 0 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
the meat was pretty dry i had the sliced brisket and pulled pork 0 
this is so embarassing and also my ears hurt if i try to push the ear plug into my ear 0 
the chains which im no fan of beat this place easily 0 
it works 1 
will be back again 1 
very good stuff for the price 1 
it is an insane game 1 
if you do watch it however there are small consolations the actresses playing annes sisters each do a wonderful job with their roles 1 
i can think of no other film where something vitally important occurs every other minute 1 
if you are razr owneryou must have this 1 
i felt as though her going to ireland did absolutely nothing whatsoever 0 
case was more or less an extra that i originally put on but later discarded because it scratched my ear 0 
cooked to perfection and the service was impeccable 1 
the script is horrendously stupid 0 
it is an hour and half waste of time following a bunch of very pretty high schoolers whine and cry about life 0 
one of the worst shows of all time 0 
they have horrible attitudes towards customers and talk down to each one when customers dont enjoy their food 0 
the service was terrible though 0 
its not hard to make a decent hamburger 0 
this would not even be good as a made for tv flick 0 
this review is long overdue since i consider a tale of two sisters to be the single greatest film ever made 1 
disappointed 0 
im not sure how long we stood there but it was long enough for me to begin to feel awkwardly out of place 0 
any grandmother can make a roasted chicken better than this one 0 
the service was great even the manager came and helped with our table 1 
i have to mention this and it is a huge spoiler i loved the ending how all the characters of the three films were the remaining survivors of the ferry disaster with valentine and the young judge together and the old man watching it on her tv solidifying his happiness over the suffering which he dealt with for those many years 1 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
i would have given no star if i was able 0 
from what my dinner companions told meeverything was very fresh with nice texture and taste 1 
painful on the ear 0 
my order was not correct 0 
the story which was told so eloquently by francis ford coppola 25 years earlier really unfolds gradually and leaves room for the characters to develop 1 
reversible plug works great 1 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
then i exchanged for the same phone even that had the same problem 0 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
i love this device 1 
it is indescribably the most annoying and idiotic show i have ever seen 0 
terrible phone holder 0 
very disappointing 0 
excellent dualpurpose headset 1 
ps the only scene in the movie that was cool is when the central character finds her room blown up 1 
this movie has a cutting edge to it 1 
the films dialogue is natural real to life 1 
terrible phone holder 0 
loved the casting of jimmy buffet as the science teacher 1 
i was totally fascinated by the music the dancing everything 1 
a good quality bargain i bought this after i bought a cheapy from big lots that sounded awful and people on the other end couldnt hear me 1 
dont waste your time watching this rubbish nonresearched film 0 
its the best headset i have used 1 
as many people complained i found this headsets microphone was very weak 0 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
the staff are also very friendly and efficient 1 
my sanyo has survived dozens of drops on blacktop without ill effect 1 
we asked for the bill to leave without eating and they didnt bring that either 0 
a good film by a great director 1 
it definitely was not as good as my s11 1 
the good cinematography also makes her and monica bellucci look very beautiful 1 
if the food isnt bad enough for you then enjoy dealing with the worlds worstannoying drunk people 0
