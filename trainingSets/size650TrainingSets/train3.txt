it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
main thing i didnt enjoy is that the crowd is of older crowd around mid 30s and up 0 
w810i is just superb 1 
highly recommended 1 
the movie showed a lot of florida at its best made it look very appealing 1 
the only place good for this film is in the garbage 0 
be sure to order dessert even if you need to pack it togo the tiramisu and cannoli are both to die for 1 
the ambiance isnt much better 0 
the explosion of the gas tanks at the end was just as awful 0 
just as good as when i had it more than a year ago 1 
the cast of veteran actors are more than just a nostalgia trip 1 
i felt as though her going to ireland did absolutely nothing whatsoever 0 
first off the reception sucks i have never had more than 2 bars ever 0 
it is super charged up for use as a small hybrid palmtopcameracellphone and excels in those roles 1 
this is truly an art movieit actually has a lot of art in it 1 
ordered a double cheeseburger got a single patty that was falling apart picture uploaded yeah still sucks 0 
no im going to eat the potato that i found some strangers hair in it 0 
not loud enough and doesnt turn on like it should 0 
not even good for camp value 0 
absolutely great 1 
perhaps my phone is defective but people cannot hear me when i use this 0 
all the pretty pictures in the world cannot make up for a piece of work that is flawed at the core 0 
the service was not up to par either 0 
whatever the producer was going for he missed entirely 0 
excellent 1 
i particularly remember my senses being assaulted by strident cords of music that would blare out with very little warning and even less meaning 0 
i still maintain that monkeys shouldnt make headphones we just obviously dont share enough dna to copy the design over to humans 0 
i would advise to not purchase this item it never worked very well 0 
loved itfriendly servers great food wonderful and imaginative menu 1 
i mean this in a terrible way 0 
plantronics bluetooth excelent buy 1 
of all the dishes the salmon was the best but all were great 1 
the screen does get smudged easily because it touches your ear and face 0 
how awesome is that 1 
my salad had a bland vinegrette on the baby greens and hearts of palm 0 
then a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use 0 
my sister has one also and she loves it 1 
this is simply the best bluetooth headset for sound quality 1 
the acting is like watching wooden puppets moving around and reading from a book thats how bad it is 0 
the price is reasonable and the service is great 1 
you get incredibly fresh fish prepared with care 1 
main thing i didnt enjoy is that the crowd is of older crowd around mid 30s and up 0 
the management is rude 0 
this was a poor remake of my best friends wedding 0 
i left with a stomach ache and felt sick the rest of the day 0 
honeslty it didnt taste that fresh 0 
i had strawberry tea which was good 1 
those phones are working just fine now 1 
recommend with confidence 1 
im a big fan of this series mostly due to anne rices style sensitivities and treatments 1 
best ive found so far ive tried 2 other bluetooths and this one has the best quality for both me and the listener as well as ease of using 1 
not good when wearing a hat or sunglasses 0 
first of all there are enough racial stereotypes and racial jokes to offend everyone 0 
it makes very strange ticking noises before it ends the call 0 
generally it just lacked imagination 0 
after the first charge kept going dead after 12 minutes 0 
i dont have to be an accountant to know im getting screwed 0 
piece of trash 0 
then scene where they debated whether or not to sack the trumpeter who falsely was accused for the murder is pure horror really stupid 0 
unfortunately any virtue in this films production work was lost on a regrettable script 0 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
i love it 1 
steer clear of this product and go with the genuine palm replacementr pens which come in a threepack 0 
disapointing results 0 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
the very idea of it was lame take a minor character from a mediocre pg13 film and make a complete nonsequel while changing its tone to a pgrated family movie 0 
i got this phone on reccomendation from a relative and im glad i did 1 
everything about it is fine and reasonable for the price ie 1 
the majority of the logitech earbud headsets failed 0 
our server was super nice and checked on us many times 1 
what a big waste of time 0 
friends pasta also bad he barely touched it 0 
what did bother me was the slow service 0 
plus its only 8 bucks 1 
i was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar not only because the quality is great but the service is fast and the food impeccable 1 
disappointed 0 
the food is about on par with dennys which is to say not good at all 0 
food was great and so was the serivce 1 
great steak great sides great wine amazing desserts 1 
we enjoy their pizza and brunch 1 
buttons are too small 0 
i love their fries and their beans 1 
this phone tries very hard to do everything but fails at its very ability to be a phone 0 
service is friendly and inviting 1 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
but i thought his acting was skilled 1 
the service was poor and thats being nice 0 
110 and only because there is no setting for 010 0 
love it great armband 1 
an excellent new restaurant by an experienced frenchman 1 
the food was terrible 0 
as a courtroom drama its compelling as an indictment on the american justice system its frightening 1 
of course the acting is blah 0 
the use of slowmotion needlessly repeats itself throughout the movie but is well backed up by bad acting and bad is a kind word here no continuity scenes that are thrown in for no reason whatsoever vehicles that looked like they were made from a corn flakes box and a directorial style that bordered on stupidity 0 
of course the footage from the 70s was grainy but that only enhanced the film 1 
my breakfast was perpared great with a beautiful presentation of 3 giant slices of toast lightly dusted with powdered sugar 1 
very nice and relaxing late night viewing 1 
i do think tom hanks is a good actor 1 
it was a great phone 1 
well packaged arrived on time and works as intended 1 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
then i watched it again two sundays ago march 20th 2005 and i began to really enjoy it and this time i taped the entire thing 1 
the server was very negligent of our needs and made us feel very unwelcome i would not suggest this place 0 
essentially you can forget microsofts tech support 0 
beautiful styling though 1 
food was great and so was the serivce 1 
great food and service huge portions and they give a military discount 1 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
lousy product 0 
ordered a double cheeseburger got a single patty that was falling apart picture uploaded yeah still sucks 0 
great pork sandwich 1 
a drive thru means you do not want to wait around for half an hour for your food but somehow when we end up going here they make us wait and wait 0 
totally different with loads of understatement and black comedy this is a film few get to see but those who do will remember it 1 
avoid this film at all costs 0 
the cashier had no care what so ever on what i had to say it still ended up being wayyy overpriced 0 
in the summer you can dine in a charming outdoor patio so very delightful 1 
the best part about nurse betty is its unpredictability 1 
im trying to return it for a refund 0 
great pork sandwich 1 
wont go back 0 
its pure brilliance 1 
i consider this theft 0 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
i cant believe theres even a sequel to this 0 
doesnt work at all i bougth it for my l7c and its not working 0 
avoid at any and all costs 0 
i probably wont be coming back here 0 
i could eat their bruschetta all day it is devine 1 
problem is that the ear loops are made of weak material and break easily 0 
though the wind and the lion is told largely through the eyes of the son every member of the family can identify with one of the characters whether it be sean connerys noble brigand candace bergens feisty heroine john hustons wily john hay or steve kanalys spiffy radiant ruthless cando lieutenant roosevelts big stick 1 
mobile phone tools are a must have 1 
i never come again 0 
i believe the screenwriter did a good job of tying up the loose ends 1 
useless phone simply deaf 0 
all the other cases ive tried normally fall apart after a few months but this one seems to be in for the long haul 1 
we definately enjoyed ourselves 1 
what a disappointment 0 
was not happy 0 
so anyone near you will hear part of your conversation 0 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
it was a huge awkward 15lb piece of cow that was 34ths gristle and fat 0 
stay away from this store be careful 0 
you also cannot take pictures with it in the case because the lense is covered 0 
its a piece of crap 0 
it was pretty gross 0 
excellent cast story line performances 1 
if you dont find it too bad as again the unit comes with one earpad onlyi would not recommend this to anyone 0 
i cannot believe that the actors agreed to do this film 0 
just what i wanted 1 
the foreigner is not worth one second of your time 0 
the phone crashed completely and now i have to get it replaced 0 
i live in the neighborhood so i am disappointed i wont be back here because it is a convenient location 0 
its pretty surprising that this wonderful film was made in 1949 as hollywood generally had its collective heads in the sand concerning black and white issues at that time 1 
but now i was completely grossed out 0 
im trying to return it for a refund 0 
also great directing and photography 1 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
food is way overpriced and portions are fucking small 0 
it plays louder than any other speaker of this size the price is so low that most would think the quality is lacking however its not 1 
we got the food and apparently they have never heard of salt and the batter on the fish was chewy 0 
punishment park is a brilliant piece of cinema 1 
even in my bmw 3 series which is fairly quiet i have trouble hearing what the other person is saying 0 
the movie is terribly boring in places 0 
wed definitely go back here again 1 
oh the charger seems to work fine 1 
i found this move beautiful enjoyable and uplifting 1 
the service was meh 0 
the fries were great too 1 
also the phone doesnt seem to accept anything except cbr mp3s preferably ripped by windows media player 0 
its a great tool for entertainment communication and data managementoh be sure to use activesync 42 for optimal data synchronization results 1 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
this is probably one of the least effective and utterly unoriginal films i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
disappointed 0 
i received my orders well within the shipping timeframe everything was in good working order and overall i am very excited to have this source 1 
as i said abovepretty useless 0 
ive tried several different earpieces for my cell phone and this jabra one is the first one ive found that fits my ear comfortably 1 
do not buy if you want to use the holster 0 
great it was new packaged nice works good no problems and it came in less time then i expected 1 
the movie in movie situations in the beginning and through the game that is played with her by the acting coach are fascinating 1 
of course the acting is blah 0 
i was able to do voice dialing in the car with no problem 1 
penne vodka excellent 1 
this would not even be good as a made for tv flick 0 
the veggitarian platter is out of this world 1 
i love my 350 headset my jabra350 bluetooth headset is great the reception is very good and the ear piece is a comfortable fit 1 
very displeased 0 
the scenes with the ohsomature neighbourgirl are a misplace 0 
dont go here 0 
no additional ear gels provided and no instructions whatsoever 0 
i love this bluetooth 1 
their onscreen chemistry critical to the entire film is genuine 1 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
i had to wait over 30 minutes to get my drink and longer to get 2 arepas 0 
will go back next trip out 1 
utter crap sound quality is terrible 0 
no shifting no bubbling no peeling not even a scratch nothingi couldnt be more happier with my new one for the droid 1 
but it is great i would really recommend it 1 
i ordered the lemon raspberry ice cocktail which was also incredible 1 
worst phone ever 0 
brilliant 1 
nice headphones for the price and they work great 1 
perfect for the ps3 1 
however the keypads are so tinny that i sometimes reach the wrong buttons 0 
my brother in law who works at the mall ate here same day and guess what he was sick all night too 0 
a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it 1 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
this was my first and only vegas buffet and it did not disappoint 1 
the servers are not pleasant to deal with and they dont always honor pizza hut coupons 0 
the cast was great 1 
this is truly an art movieit actually has a lot of art in it 1 
the live music on fridays totally blows 0 
they have horrible attitudes towards customers and talk down to each one when customers dont enjoy their food 0 
after a year the battery went completely dead on my headset 0 
i was disgusted because i was pretty sure that was human hair 0 
you need two hands to operate the screenthis software interface is decade old and cannot compete with new software designs 0 
do not waste your time 0 
headset works great was packaged nicely to avoid any damage 1 
5 stars for the brick oven bread app 1 
for a self proclaimed coffee cafe i was wildly disappointed 0 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
food arrived quickly 1 
also great directing and photography 1 
a greasy unhealthy meal 0 
would recommend this item 1 
phone now holds charge like it did when it was new 1 
all the actors give a wonderful performance especially jennifer rubin as jamie harris who changes from the nervous starlet in the beginning through the strange events she is part of to the cool star 1 
im terribly disappointed that this film would receive so many awards and accolades especially when there are far more deserving works of film out there 0 
i find this inexcusable and so will probably be returning this phone and perhaps changing carriers 0 
the battery is unreliable as well as the service use antena 0 
for that price i can think of a few place i would have much rather gone 0 
the attention given to every character and complex psychological portrayals detailing loyalty treachery love and hope are tremendous 1 
horrible dont waste your time and money 0 
basically the service was very bad 0 
babie bop is very cute 1 
the battery works great 1 
we waited for thirty minutes to be seated although there were 8 vacant tables and we were the only folks waiting 0 
it is the best charger i have seen on the market yet 1 
the desserts were a bit strange 0 
they do not last forever but is not overly expensive to replaceeasy to operate and the sound is much better than others i have tried 1 
using all earpieces left or right this thing will not stay on my ear 0 
and generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode 0 
very very disappointed ordered the 35 big bay plater 0 
the waiter wasnt helpful or friendly and rarely checked on us 0 
the staff was very attentive 1 
yes its shiny on front side and i love it 1 
its a case of so bad it is laughable 0 
and i really did find them funny 1 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
yeah the movie pretty much sucked 0 
reasonably priced also 1 
this is hands down the best phone ive ever had 1 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
great time family dinner on a sunday night 1 
the salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop which was perfectly cooked 1 
but despite these few flaws this case is of exceptional quality and well worth the additional costs of owning an official oem product 1 
now you know why i gave it a 10 1 
the croutons also taste homemade which is an extra plus 1 
the characters are fleshed out surprisingly well particularly grimes and blake and all the actors deliver their sharply scripted lines with just the right amount of deadpan tongue in cheek to make the dialogue both hilarious and realistic 1 
he deserves 5 stars 1 
avoid this film at all costs 0 
this is infuriating 0 
it was just too horrible 0 
i was very disappointed in the movie 0 
this particular model would not work with my motorola q smartphone 0 
dont go here 0 
the ending is so so perfect youll shed a tear 1 
the service was great even the manager came and helped with our table 1 
their regular toasted bread was equally satisfying with the occasional pats of butter mmmm 1 
the cashew cream sauce was bland and the vegetables were undercooked 0 
macbeth jason connery moved me to tears with his final monolog out brief candle outhe gave the sphere of moral decay and dark forces a human face which makes it the more interesting 1 
we wont be returning 0 
blue ant is easy to use 1 
not sure who was more lost the flat characters or the audience nearly half of whom walked out 0 
i would definitely recommend the jabra bt250v for those who are looking for comfort clarity and a great price 1 
frankly after cotton club and unfaithful it was kind of embarrassing to watch lane and gere in this film because it is bad 0 
this is an outstanding little restaurant with some of the best food i have ever tasted 1 
the croutons also taste homemade which is an extra plus 1 
her lines seem to have been written by a fifteen year old though they are trying oh so so hard to sound like how a fifteen year old would really um you know well talk 0 
our server was super nice and checked on us many times 1 
great place to eat reminds me of the little mom and pop shops in the san francisco bay area 1 
love the margaritas too 1 
beware this is not a trashy cult movie this is trash period 0 
its welldesigned and very sharp the blue is a very nice color 1 
who in their right mind is gonna buy this battery 0 
and it was way to expensive 0 
it is the best charger i have seen on the market yet 1 
the best place to go for a tasty bowl of pho 1 
then the film just dropped the ball 0 
the volume for the ringer is real good you have choices how loud 1 
the bartender was also nice 1 
i might have gotten a defect but i would not risk buying it again because of the built quality alone 0 
it came free with a dvd player i bought but i still turned the thing off halfway through because i was embarrassed for howell 0 
they really want to make your experience a good one 1 
the nachos are a must have 1 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
great headset very impressed h500 1 
my gyro was basically lettuce only 0 
brilliance indeed 1 
the fact is this film is a wonderful heartwarming tale about two people chasing their dreams 1 
i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
excellent service 1 
we would recommend these to others 1 
i received my orders well within the shipping timeframe everything was in good working order and overall i am very excited to have this source 1 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
the plastic breaks really easy on this clip 0 
i am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this 1 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
to my disbelief each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods i have ever tasted 0 
great headset very impressed h500 1 
total brunch fail 0 
im not really sure how joeys was voted best hot dog in the valley by readers of phoenix magazine 0 
wont work right or atleast for me 0 
one character is totally annoying with a voice that gives me the feeling of fingernails on a chalkboard 0 
exactly what i wanted 1 
i guess it was supposed to be clever twist then shed some light on the situation but it was just stupid 0 
this film highlights the fundamental flaws of the legal process that its not about discovering guilt or innocence but rather is about who presents better in court 1 
the hockey scenes are terrible defensemen playing like theyre 5 years old goalies diving at shots that are 10 feet wide of the net etc 0 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
excellent service 1 
great phone 1 
why are these sad little vegetables so overcooked 0 
this phone tries very hard to do everything but fails at its very ability to be a phone 0 
the acting is beyond abysmal 0 
great choice 1 
its pretty easy 1 
the very idea of it was lame take a minor character from a mediocre pg13 film and make a complete nonsequel while changing its tone to a pgrated family movie 0 
the goat taco didnt skimp on the meat and wow what flavor 1 
how awful she is 0 
this movie is excellentangel is beautiful and scamp is adorablehis little yelps when hes scaredand the funniest parts are whenscamp is caught under the curtain and when angel and scamp are singing ive never had this feeling beforei totally recommend this movieits coming out on special edition on june 20the cover has scamp on a garbage can and angel underneath the lid 1 
it is rare when a filmmaker takes the time to tell a worthy moral tale with care and love that doesnt fall into the trap of being overly syrupy or over indulgent 1 
its very slow 0 
the story is also both funny and poignant at times 1 
i enjoyed it 1 
it wasnt busy at all and now we know why 0 
could not get strong enough signal 0 
i know this is not like the other restaurants at all something is very off here 0 
great food and awesome service 1 
star trek v the final frontier is the worst in the series 0 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
but kevin spacey is an excellent verbal tsunami as buddy ackerman  and totally believable because he is a great actor 1 
much more interesting more action more suspense and less of the unneeded controversy 1 
it presents a idyllic yet serious portrayal of the ups and downs of the characters lives 1 
the acting is like watching wooden puppets moving around and reading from a book thats how bad it is 0 
definitely a turn off for me i doubt ill be back unless someone else is buying 0 
it defeats the purpose of a bluetooth headset 0 
horrible phone 0 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
nice spicy and tender 1 
i love this place 1 
its extremely slow and takes forever to do anything with it 0 
the first time i ever came here i had an amazing experience i still tell people how awesome the duck was 1 
if you see it you should probably just leave it on the shelf 0 
i have been very happy with the 510 and have had no complaints from any one regarding my sound quality on their end 1 
none of the three sizes they sent with the headset would stay in my ears 0 
the poor actors 0 
this place is handsdown one of the best places to eat in the phoenix metro area 1 
its too bad the food is so damn generic 0 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
no shifting no bubbling no peeling not even a scratch nothingi couldnt be more happier with my new one for the droid 1 
we sat another ten minutes and finally gave up and left 0 
main thing i didnt enjoy is that the crowd is of older crowd around mid 30s and up 0 
there are so many problems i dont know where to start 0 
they dropped more than the ball 0 
the buffet at bellagio was far from what i anticipated 0 
dont make the same mistake i did 0 
juano hernandez an exceptional actor who played supporting roles in many films of the era is a proud black man who is accused of murdering a white man in the south 1 
horrible phone 0 
comes with a strong light that you can use to light up your camera shots and even flash sos signals seriously 1 
the acting is fantastic the stories are seamlessly woven together and the dogs are splendid a must rent view or see 1 
the only place good for this film is in the garbage 0 
this place is awesome if you want something light and healthy during the summer 1 
nice quality build unlike some cheap s out there 1 
this is the kind of money that is wasted properly 1 
doesnt hold charge 0 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
worst foodservice ive had in a while 0 
the football scenes at the end were perplexing 0 
blue ant is easy to use 1 
this is an excellent film 1 
the worst phone ive ever had only had it for a few months 0 
will go back next trip out 1 
they have horrible attitudes towards customers and talk down to each one when customers dont enjoy their food 0 
come hungry leave happy and stuffed 1 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
i probably would not go here again 0 
its worth driving up from tucson 1 
then i exchanged for the same phone even that had the same problem 0 
i dont think ill be running back to carlys anytime soon for food 0 
one thing i hate is the mode set button at the side 0 
it was a huge awkward 15lb piece of cow that was 34ths gristle and fat 0 
it is not good 0 
then i watched it again two sundays ago march 20th 2005 and i began to really enjoy it and this time i taped the entire thing 1 
i have seen many movies starring jaclyn smith but my god this was one of her best though it came out 12 years ago 1 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
this is high adventure at its best 1 
this film and i use that word loosely is an insult to the moviegoing public 0 
not much dialogue not much music the whole film was shot as elaborately and aesthetically like a sculpture 1 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
this is an unbelievable bargain 1 
i live in the neighborhood so i am disappointed i wont be back here because it is a convenient location 0 
disappointed with battery 0 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
their research and development division obviously knows what theyre doing 1 
try them in the airport to experience some tasty food and speedy friendly service 1 
the live music on fridays totally blows 0 
lasted one day and then blew up 0 
the only very disappointing thing was there was no speakerphone 0 
the show would begin with smart ass ed comments to each other that would be totally off the wall and uncalled for 0 
but what really made it unwatchable was the direction 0 
the classic maine lobster roll was fantastic 1 
an amazing finale to possibly the best trilogy of all time 1 
all in all an excellent restaurant highlighted by great service a unique menu and a beautiful setting 1 
omg the food was delicioso 1 
dont buy this product it fails 0 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
the potato chip order was sad i could probably count how many chips were in that box and it was probably around 12 0 
the memories are murky but i can only say that i enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show 1 
server did a great job handling our large rowdy table 1 
everything was gross 0 
it fits my ear well and is comfortable on 1 
one thing i hate is the mode set button at the side 0 
the problem was the script 0 
either way it sucks 0 
you can even take self portraits with the outside exterior display very cool 1 
generally it just lacked imagination 0 
what a waste of money and time 0 
the black eyed peas and sweet potatoes unreal 1 
this early film from future goremeister lucio fulci is a very good addition to the giallo subgenre 1 
this company charge me a restocking fee and still not given me my refund back 0 
i liked this movie way too much 1 
i found this move beautiful enjoyable and uplifting 1 
unfortunately it did not work 0 
the best place to go for a tasty bowl of pho 1 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
def coming back to bowl next time 1 
simple lightweight and great fit 1 
dee snider just plain sucks 0 
unreliable im giving up 0 
really good product 1 
this is not moviemaking 0 
the staff was very attentive 1 
editing the editing of this film was phenomenal in my opinion 1 
the problem i have is that they charge 1199 for a sandwich that is no bigger than a subway sub which offers better and more amount of vegetables 0 
i guess maybe we went on an off night but it was disgraceful 0 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
maybe there would be a reasonable explanation for this atrocity 0 
wont go back 0 
everyone is very attentive providing excellent customer service 1 
one of the most disappointing aspects is the lack of notable gore 0 
bland not a liking this place for a number of reasons and i dont want to waste time on bad reviewing ill leave it at that 0 
ive tried several different earpieces for my cell phone and this jabra one is the first one ive found that fits my ear comfortably 1 
this place was such a nice surprise 1 
as for the mains also uninspired 0 
then our food came out disappointment ensued 0 
my fiancé and i came in the middle of the day and we were greeted and seated right away 1 
almost everyone involved must be return to school acting is utterly predictable and bad script is pile of garbage all round 0 
ive tried several different earpieces for my cell phone and this jabra one is the first one ive found that fits my ear comfortably 1 
the only thing really worth watching was the scenery and the house because it is beautiful 1 
disappointed 0 
the servers went back and forth several times not even so much as an are you being helped 0 
i wasted my little money with this earpiece 0 
very disappointed in accessoryone 0 
this place is overpriced not consistent with their boba and it really is overpriced 0 
food was so gooodd 1 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
this greedy corporation will never see another dime from me 0 
worthwhile 1 
we had so much to say about the place before we walked in that he expected it to be amazing but was quickly disappointed 0 
jawbone era is awesome too 1 
the best electronics of the available fm transmitters 1 
today the graphics are crap 0 
total brunch fail 0 
i just cant explain this movie more than romanticcharminghilariousand adorablethe junkyard scenes are funnyall the junkyard dogs have something specialtoo funny i laughedkids will love itbuy it when it comes outit has new features 1 
however bt headsets are currently not good for real time games like firstperson shooters since the audio delay messes me up 0 
this movie is greatespecially if you enjoy visual arts 1 
they brought a fresh batch of fries and i was thinking yay something warm but no 0 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
worthless product 0 
i recommend igo to anyone with different brand cell phonesmp3 players in the family 1 
i bought this phone as a replacement for my startac and have regretted it since 0 
we definately enjoyed ourselves 1 
someone shouldve invented this sooner 1 
what a disappointment 0 
the worst piece of crap ever along with the verizon customer service 0 
only had this a month but its worked flawlessly so far 1 
all in all ha long bay was a bit of a flop 0 
these are certainly very comfortable and functionality is decent 1 
the eargels channel the sound directly into your ear and seem to increase the sound volume and clarity 1 
the malta settings are as dry and as barren as the dialogue 0 
service is friendly and inviting 1 
the only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port irda 0 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
lewis blacks considerable talent is wasted here too as he is at his most incendiary when he is unrestrained which the pg13 rating certainly wont allow 0 
all in all an excellent restaurant highlighted by great service a unique menu and a beautiful setting 1 
the last 15 minutes of movie are also not bad as well 1 
great case and price 1 
reasonably priced also 1 
i really recommend this faceplates since it looks very nice elegant and cool 1 
ordered a double cheeseburger got a single patty that was falling apart picture uploaded yeah still sucks 0 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
perhaps i caught them on an off night judging by the other reviews but im not inspired to go back 0 
i was bored throughout the whole damn thing 0 
bland not a liking this place for a number of reasons and i dont want to waste time on bad reviewing ill leave it at that 0 
its a shame to see good actors like thomerson and james make a living in a mess like this 0 
for readers who have already seen one of miyazakis films he is still in top form and made another worthwhile experience 1 
because both ears are occupied background is not distracting at all 1 
love this headset 1 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
however after about a year the fliptop started to get loose and wobbly and eventually my screen went black and i couldnt receive and place calls 0 
she ordered a toasted english muffin that came out untoasted 0 
for the price on amazon it is an excellent product which i would highly recommend 1 
on three different occasions i asked for well done or medium well and all three times i got the bloodiest piece of meat on my plate 0 
i put the latest os on it v115g and it now likes to slow to a crawl and lock up every once in a while 0 
here in the wind and the lion we see a wonderful rendering of americas own imperial age 1 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
dont do it 0 
i wasted my little money with this earpiece 0 
so they performed 1 
the music in the film is really nice too 1 
the food amazing 1 
went for lunch service was slow 0 
then i had to continue pairing it periodically since it somehow kept dropping 0 
trouble is the writing and directing make it impossible to establish those things that make a movie watchable like character story theme and so on 0 
not good when wearing a hat or sunglasses 0 
is pretty funny 1 
i sat riveted to the tv screen 1 
the service was not up to par either 0 
we waited an hour for what was a breakfast i could have done 100 times better at home 0 
to call this movie a drama is ridiculous 0 
i would definitely recommend the jabra bt250v for those who are looking for comfort clarity and a great price 1 
great service and food 1 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
a film not easily forgotten 1 
this place is handsdown one of the best places to eat in the phoenix metro area 1 
avoid at any and all costs 0 
it is not good 0 
i wont be back 0 
i guess i liked the details of his dysfunctionhe was believable 1 
very good quality though 1 
i liked this movie way too much 1 
but other than that the movie seemed to drag and the heroes didnt really work for their freedom 0 
i had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get some relief 0 
motorola finally got the voice quality of a bluetooth headset right 1 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
the plot simply rumbles on like a machine desperately depending on the addition of new scenes 0 
the battery works great 1 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
however the keypads are so tinny that i sometimes reach the wrong buttons 0 
i do love sushi but i found kabuki to be overpriced overhip and underservices 0 
the waiter wasnt helpful or friendly and rarely checked on us 0 
the mic is great 1 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
i guess maybe we went on an off night but it was disgraceful 0 
its a great tool for entertainment communication and data managementoh be sure to use activesync 42 for optimal data synchronization results 1 
just whatever you do avoid groove as its the antithesis of all that is good about human traffic 0 
so anyone near you will hear part of your conversation 0 
its too bad the food is so damn generic 0 
rip off over charge shipping 0 
the puppets look really cheesy not in a good way like in the puppet master 80s flicks 0 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
we got the food and apparently they have never heard of salt and the batter on the fish was chewy 0 
i believe that this place is a great stop for those with a huge belly and hankering for sushi 1 
it is easy to turn on and off when you are in the car and the volume controls are quite accessable 1 
you get extra minutes so that you can carry out the call and not get cut off 1 
unfortunately cover girl is an example of how hollywood used to exploit women for financial gain 0 
if you love death and decay and shakespears lyrics this is the one 1 
works great 1 
worst customer service ever 0 
an instant classic with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits 1 
the food was great as always compliments to the chef 1 
the problem i have is that they charge 1199 for a sandwich that is no bigger than a subway sub which offers better and more amount of vegetables 0 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
the film is way too long 0 
magical help 1 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
superb phone on a great network 1 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
i guess i should have known that this place would suck because it is inside of the excalibur but i didnt use my common sense 0 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
i ordered the voodoo pasta and it was the first time id had really excellent pasta since going gluten free several years ago 1 
otherwise dont even waste your time on this 0 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
if you are reading this please dont go there 0 
will never ever go back 0 
this is definitely one of the better documentaries i have seen looking at family relationships and marriage 1 
definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly will return next time im in vegas 1 
we have tried 2 units and they both failed within 2 months pros 0 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
the reception has been generally good 1 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
its very attractive and appears to be of good quality 1 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
i loved it it was really scary 1 
we had fantastic service and were pleased by the atmosphere 1 
i love lane but ive never seen her in a movie this lousy 0 
if it were possible to give them zero stars theyd have it 0 
seriously flavorful delights folks 1 
case was more or less an extra that i originally put on but later discarded because it scratched my ear 0 
excellent 1 
id rather eat airline food seriously 0 
in an interesting part of town this place is amazing 1 
service was very prompt 1 
its a sad movie but very good 1 
i ordered the lemon raspberry ice cocktail which was also incredible 1 
an excellent new restaurant by an experienced frenchman 1 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
if you dont find it too bad as again the unit comes with one earpad onlyi would not recommend this to anyone 0 
how can you call yourself a steakhouse if you cant properly cook a steak i dont understand 0 
the visual effects were awful 0 
best of luck to the rude and noncustomer service focused new management 0 
some may say this buffet is pricey but i think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot 1 
the best part about nurse betty is its unpredictability 1 
i went to bachi burger on a friends recommendation and was not disappointed 1 
perfect for someone me who only likes beer ice cold or in this case even colder 1 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
how this piece of trash was ever released is beyond me the acting the story the characters the supposedly special effects etcits all wrong 0 
not a weekly haunt but definitely a place to come back to every once in a while 1 
imdb ratings only go as low 1 for awful its time to get some negative numbers in there for cases such as these 0 
i am very happy 1 
its really easy 1 
after my phone got to be about a year old its been slowly breaking despite much care on my part 0 
a lot of websites have been rating this a very good phone and so do i 1 
the pleather case doesnt fit 0 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
good prices 1 
then theres the plot holes 0 
the only good thing was that it fits comfortably on small ears 1 
50 down the drain 0 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
it even has its sweet moments 1 
tasted like dirt 0 
i mean this in a terrible way 0 
we definately enjoyed ourselves 1 
very happy with this product 1 
he is an amazing film artist one of the most important whoever lived 1 
there is nothing privileged about workingeating there 0 
and i just love the colors 1 
overall a great experience 1 
this is a great little item 1 
bad day or not i have a very low tolerance for rude customer service people it is your job to be nice and polite wash dishes otherwise 0 
a fantastic neighborhood gem 1 
poor product 0 
we also ordered the spinach and avocado salad the ingredients were sad and the dressing literally had zero taste 0 
great product 1 
i enjoyed it 1 
the point is the journey a journey that touches every member of the family 1 
hayao miyazakis latest and eighth film for studio ghibili gake no ue no ponyo ponyo on the cliff by the sea is a wonderfully fun and imaginative look at childhood 1
