the directing seems too pretentious 0 
it was a pale color instead of nice and char and has no flavor 0 
obviously they have a terrible customer service so you get what you pay for 0 
i am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this 1 
hell no will i go back 0 
worked very well paired with a treo 700w and as a skype headset on my pc using a usb bluetooth transceiver 1 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
save your money ive had this item for 11 months now 0 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
the cinematographyif it can be called thatsucked 0 
this blueant supertooth handsfree phone speaker is awesome 1 
as a courtroom drama its compelling as an indictment on the american justice system its frightening 1 
the food is very good for your typical bar food 1 
earbud piece breaks easily 0 
what happened next was prettyoff putting 0 
waited and waited and waited 0 
very convenient since we were staying at the mgm 1 
we would recommend these to others 1 
i will come back here every time im in vegas 1 
the scenes with the ohsomature neighbourgirl are a misplace 0 
not much flavor to them and very poorly constructed 0 
the sound quality for the device is unacceptableunless you are in a really quiet area you almost hear nothing 0 
i have had problems wit hit dropping signal and more 0 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
i rate this movie 910 1 
the jabra eargels fit my ears very well 1 
we arent ones to make a scene at restaurants but i just dont get itdefinitely lost the love after this one 0 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
only had this a month but its worked flawlessly so far 1 
no complaints 1 
five star plus plus 1 
logitech bluetooth headset is a 10 1 
in my house i was getting dropped coverage upstairs and no coverage in my basement 0 
i dont have very many words to say about this place but it does everything pretty well 1 
the awful dialogue and hopeless overacting by everyone who gets shot top off a real waste of space and time 0 
they are so cool 1 
no real improvement 0 
then theres the plot holes 0 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
headset works great was packaged nicely to avoid any damage 1 
i cant see how this movie can be an inspiration to anyone to come out or overcome fear and rejection 0 
the battery works great 1 
soggy and not good 0 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
the han nan chicken was also very tasty 1 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
and then tragedy struck 0 
the only possible way this movie could be redeemed would be as mst3k fodder 0 
works great 1 
the server was very negligent of our needs and made us feel very unwelcome i would not suggest this place 0 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
good quality 1 
now the pizza itself was good the peanut sauce was very tasty 1 
i promise they wont disappoint 1 
if that bug never showed up i would have given a 4 for sure but on the other side of the wall where this bug was climbing was the kitchen 0 
great sound and service 1 
i know this is not like the other restaurants at all something is very off here 0 
this is definitely a cult classic well worth viewing and sharing with others 1 
i still maintain that monkeys shouldnt make headphones we just obviously dont share enough dna to copy the design over to humans 0 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
worst phone ever 0 
the cashier was friendly and even brought the food out to me 1 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
i wasnt the least bit interested 0 
and finally after all that we get to an ending that wouldve been great had it been handled by competent people and not jerry falwell 0 
lewis blacks considerable talent is wasted here too as he is at his most incendiary when he is unrestrained which the pg13 rating certainly wont allow 0 
all it took was one drop from about 6 inches above the kitchen counter and it was crackedi am not impressed and i am not laughing 0 
at no point in the proceedings does it look remotely like america 0 
im glad the film didnt go for the most obvious choice as a lesser film certainly would have 1 
the bipolarity of the ruthless thug one minute a ruthless killer the next minute a luvs diaper commercial is completely unconvincing 0 
i connected my wifes bluetoothmotorola hs850 to my phone and it worked like a charm whether the phone was in my pocket or the case 1 
cinematography noteworthy including fine views of barcelona and its famed gaudi towers 1 
hard to judge whether these sides were good because we were grossed out by the melted styrofoam and didnt want to eat it for fear of getting sick 0 
the worst was the salmon sashimi 0 
i especially love the long battery life 1 
these are certainly very comfortable and functionality is decent 1 
i cant wait to go back 1 
the reception has been generally good 1 
ive had better not only from dedicated boba tea spots but even from jenni pho 0 
voice recognition is tremendous 1 
also the fries are without a doubt the worst fries ive ever had 0 
these headphones were a great find and i think they are perhaps the best purchase ive made in the last several years seriously 1 
highly unrecommended 0 
well just if you keep thinking how bad it is 0 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
ill put this gem up against any movie in terms of screenplay cinematography acting postproduction editing directing or any other aspect of filmmaking 1 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
the attempts at humor were pitiful and story is so awful it dosent bear thinking about which basically involves a vulcan stealing the enterprise to find god seriously i just didnt care about any of this film and oh not to mention uhura does a belly dance to distract male guards 0 
it is light has plenty of battery capacity and is very confortable to wear for somewhat extended periods of time 1 
thats how id describe this painfully dreary timewaster of a film 0 
i couldnt think of a better way to end the film but a smile on my face great way to wrap up an amazing film and trilogy 1 
never been to hard rock casino before will never ever step forward in it again 0 
sprint charges for this service 0 
too bad you have to pay up to a month for the service 0 
sounds good reasonably priced and effective its that simple 1 
i think this restaurant suffers from not trying hard enough 0 
they could be used as exemplars for any set designer 1 
poor product 0 
what on earth is irons doing in this film 0 
i had a salad with the wings and some ice cream for dessert and left feeling quite satisfied 1 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
very bad performance plays angela bennett a computer expert who is at home all the time 0 
hell no will i go back 0 
those burgers were amazing 1 
you share general loewenhielms exquisite joy in his partaking of the cailles en sarcophage even though you are just watching a movie but you do wish for just a small sample to savor 1 
one nice thing was that they added gratuity on the bill since our party was larger than 6 or 8 and they didnt expect more tip than that 1 
i got home to see the driest damn wings ever 0 
his losing his marbles so early in the proceedings is totally implausible and unconvincing 0 
great software for motorolas 1 
the movie was so boring that i sometimes found myself occupied peaking in the paper instead of watching never happened during a columbo movie before 0 
the only possible way this movie could be redeemed would be as mst3k fodder 0 
definitely a bargain 1 
the directing and the cinematography arent quite as good 0 
hes a national treasure 1 
we sat another ten minutes and finally gave up and left 0 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
highly unprofessional and rude to a loyal patron 0 
if the food isnt bad enough for you then enjoy dealing with the worlds worstannoying drunk people 0 
unless youre just out to visually collect all extant films of austens work you can skip this one 0 
special mention should be made of the superb music score and sound effects which are an integral element in helping to make this such a memorable and enjoyable cartoon 1 
the server was very negligent of our needs and made us feel very unwelcome i would not suggest this place 0 
but kevin spacey is an excellent verbal tsunami as buddy ackerman  and totally believable because he is a great actor 1 
i paid the bill but did not tip because i felt the server did a terrible job 0 
plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job 1 
i kept looking at the time and it had soon become 35 minutes yet still no food 0 
i will be back many times soon 1 
does not fit 0 
it shouldnt take 30 min for pancakes and eggs 0 
the waitresses are very friendly 1 
i will be back many times soon 1 
i rate this movie 910 1 
ray charles is legendary 1 
plus its only 8 bucks 1 
my ribeye steak was cooked perfectly and had great mesquite flavor 1 
im probably one of the few people to ever go to ians and not like it 0 
they do not care about the consumer one bit 0 
excellent cast story line performances 1 
even in my bmw 3 series which is fairly quiet i have trouble hearing what the other person is saying 0 
mishima is extremely uninteresting 0 
lewis blacks considerable talent is wasted here too as he is at his most incendiary when he is unrestrained which the pg13 rating certainly wont allow 0 
i cannot believe that the actors agreed to do this film 0 
the nano stated itmy son was dissapointed 0 
returned 8 hours later 0 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
i love being able to use one headset for both by landline and cell 1 
i can take a little bad service but the food sucks 0 
i could not recommend these more 0 
as for the killer dont expect anything original or even remotely frightening 0 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
not a weekly haunt but definitely a place to come back to every once in a while 1 
anne heche was utterly convincing 1 
definitely worth checking out 1 
you share general loewenhielms exquisite joy in his partaking of the cailles en sarcophage even though you are just watching a movie but you do wish for just a small sample to savor 1 
tonight i had the elk filet specialand it sucked 0 
battery is terrible 0 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
the headsets are easy to use and everyone loves them 1 
you need at least 3 mins to get to your phone book from the time you first turn on the phonebattery life is short 0 
the food is very good for your typical bar food 1 
all the pretty pictures in the world cannot make up for a piece of work that is flawed at the core 0 
for people who are first timers in film making i think they did an excellent job 1 
i dont have very many words to say about this place but it does everything pretty well 1 
product is exactly as described 1 
i am so pleased to know such a modern day genius is out there letting is passion for art drive him and taking us as an audience with him 1 
best of all is the rotating feature very helpful 1 
the story is beyond stupid 0 
i believe that pitch black was done well 1 
either way it sucks 0 
my rating just 3 out of 10 0 
sauce was tasteless 0 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
but it wasnt anything at all just one big yawn 0 
it has everything i need and i couldnt ask for more 1 
this is an excellent film 1 
dont buy this product it fails 0 
this is a chilly unremarkable movie about an author livingworking in a chilly abstruse culture 0 
food was delicious 1 
ps the only scene in the movie that was cool is when the central character finds her room blown up 1 
attempting artiness with black white and clever camera angles the movie disappointed became even more ridiculous as the acting was poor and the plot and lines almost nonexistent 0 
everything about this product is wrongfirst 0 
none of it works just dont buy it 0 
as many people complained i found this headsets microphone was very weak 0 
very very fun chef 1 
what should have been a hilarious yummy christmas eve dinner to remember was the biggest fail of the entire trip for us 0 
unless youre just out to visually collect all extant films of austens work you can skip this one 0 
it was not good 0 
it also took her forever to bring us the check when we asked for it 0 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
what a piece of junk i lose more calls on this phone 0 
kind of flops around 0 
i really loved the story line and the poler bear was kinda cutebut if anyone has a question about fort steele just ask away 1 
i highly recommend this device to everyone 1 
nice quality build unlike some cheap s out there 1 
the worst experience ever 0 
its like a bad two hour tv movie 0 
the worst one of the series 0 
this is an outstanding little restaurant with some of the best food i have ever tasted 1 
the greek dressing was very creamy and flavorful 1 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
the speaker is of low quality so as making the ring tones sound very cheap 0 
i had a pretty satifying experience 1 
i got to enjoy the seafood salad with a fabulous vinegrette 1 
the food came out at a good pace 1 
if you simply want a small flip phone look elsewhere as the extra bells whistles are mediocre 0 
this totally unfunny movie is so over the top and pathetic and unrealistic that throughout the whole 90 minutes of utter torture i probably looked at my watch about 70000 times 0 
do not purchase this phone 0 
stay away from this store be careful 0 
the soundtrack wasnt terrible either 1 
ambience is perfect 1 
worthwhile 1 
kris kristoffersen is good in this movie and really makes a difference 1 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
doesnt work at all i bougth it for my l7c and its not working 0 
the dialogue is composed of things that make little sense 0 
the success of the film depends on the casting of sydney greenstreet as the alexander yardley character 1 
ive owned this phone for 7 months now and can say that its the best mobile phone ive had 1 
they have been around for years and carries the highest quality of antiglare screen protector that i have found to date 1 
i would recommend saving room for this 1 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
i dont know what the big deal is about this place but i wont be back yaall 0 
nice ambiance 1 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
if good intentions made a film great then this film might be one of the greatest films ever made 1 
however i recently watched the whole thing again on dvd and i was completely struck by how extremely stupid the storyline was how it contained holes inconsistencies and frankly a whole lot of crap and how horrid the dancing was 0 
its pure brilliance 1 
i especially liked the noncliche choices with the parents in other movies i could predict the dialog verbatim but the writing in this movie made better selections 1 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
im using it with an iriver spinn with case and it fits fine 1 
not only did the software do a great job of this i could also make my own ringtones form my existing cds without an internet connection 1 
i knew when i saw the film that more great things were to come from this gifted actor 1 
its a mediocre miserable hollow laughable and predictable piece of garbage 0 
my boyfriend and i came here for the first time on a recent trip to vegas and could not have been more pleased with the quality of food and service 1 
this place should honestly be blown up 0 
i especially love the long battery life 1 
why was this film made 0 
but it is great i would really recommend it 1 
it just blew 0 
i highly recommend this device to everyone 1 
they have great dinners 1 
everything about this movie is stupid 0 
just as good as when i had it more than a year ago 1 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
its like a really sexy party in your mouth where youre outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party 1 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
ill put this gem up against any movie in terms of screenplay cinematography acting postproduction editing directing or any other aspect of filmmaking 1 
it isnt even an achievement as a sobaditsgood or sobaditsmemorable movie 0 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
the best place in vegas for breakfast just check out a sat or sun 1 
the chicken i got was definitely reheated and was only ok the wedges were cold and soggy 0 
now we were chosen to be tortured with this disgusting piece of blatant american propaganda 0 
it is perfect for a sitdown family meal or get together with a few friends 1 
much better than the other ayce sushi place i went to in vegas 1 
while you dont yet hear mickey speak there are tons of sound effects and music throughout the filmsomething we take for granted now but which was a huge crowd pleaser in 1928 1 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
there is simply no excuse for something this poorly done 0 
their onscreen chemistry critical to the entire film is genuine 1 
my salad had a bland vinegrette on the baby greens and hearts of palm 0 
wow loved this place 1 
bad day or not i have a very low tolerance for rude customer service people it is your job to be nice and polite wash dishes otherwise 0 
youd have to have the iq of particularly stupid mollusk not to see that one coming 0 
trying to make a call on these is an exercise in frustration 0 
well never go again 0 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
the only thing i wasnt too crazy about was their guacamole as i dont like it puréed 0 
i had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get some relief 0 
phenomenal food service and ambiance 1 
the kids are annoying 0 
worst martini ever 0 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
worst ever 0 
the movie seemed a little slow at first 0 
i ate there twice on my last visit and especially enjoyed the salmon salad 1 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach 0 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
this is hands down the best phone ive ever had 1 
absolutel junk 0 
it holds a charge for a long time is reasonably comfortable under longwearing conditions and the quality of sound is tremendous 1 
there is a totally unnecessary trainroller coaster scene 0 
i have seen many movies starring jaclyn smith but my god this was one of her best though it came out 12 years ago 1 
the acting by the whole cast could be put on a scale and balanced perfectly between overacting and underacting 0 
back to good bbq lighter fare reasonable pricing and tell the public they are back to the old ways 1 
the dialogue sucked 0 
i will never go back to this place and will never ever recommended this place to anyone 0 
lewis blacks considerable talent is wasted here too as he is at his most incendiary when he is unrestrained which the pg13 rating certainly wont allow 0 
the structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema 1 
of course the footage from the 70s was grainy but that only enhanced the film 1 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job 1 
ordered a double cheeseburger got a single patty that was falling apart picture uploaded yeah still sucks 0 
the price is reasonable and the service is great 1 
the best electronics of the available fm transmitters 1 
its worth driving up from tucson 1 
this isnt a small family restaurant this is a fine dining establishment 1 
the accompanied software is almost brilliant 1 
ps the only scene in the movie that was cool is when the central character finds her room blown up 1 
excellent product for the price 1 
waitress was a little slow in service 0 
the plot simply rumbles on like a machine desperately depending on the addition of new scenes 0 
the folks at otto always make us feel so welcome and special 1 
the only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive 1 
the potatoes were like rubber and you could tell they had been made up ahead of time being kept under a warmer 0 
excellent sound battery life and inconspicuous to boot 1 
those phones are working just fine now 1 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
bad day or not i have a very low tolerance for rude customer service people it is your job to be nice and polite wash dishes otherwise 0 
the best part about nurse betty is its unpredictability 1 
i advise everyone do not be fooled 0 
i was very disappointed in the movie 0 
never been to hard rock casino before will never ever step forward in it again 0 
my salad had a bland vinegrette on the baby greens and hearts of palm 0 
waiter was a jerk 0 
talk about useless customer service 0 
sauce was tasteless 0 
the first thing that happened was that the tracking was off 0 
for a product that costs as much as this one does i expect it to work far better and with greater ease than this thing does 0 
after all the rave reviews i couldnt wait to eat herewhat a disappointment 0 
thus far have only visited twice and the food was absolutely delicious each time 1 
design flaw 0 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
after charging overnight these batteries work great 1 
the food is rich so order accordingly 1 
the battery runs down quickly 0 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
same problem as others have mentioned 0 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
the service was a bit lacking 0 
this product is clearly not ready for prime time i dont care how cool it looks if you cant tell a call is coming in its worthless 0 
the worst one of the series 0 
this game rocks 1 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
the performances are not improved by improvisation because the actors now have twice as much to worry about not only whether theyre delivering the line well but whether the line itself is any good 0 
we recently witnessed her poor quality of management towards other guests as well 0 
awesome device 1 
some highlights great quality nigiri here 1 
and service was super friendly 1 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
i thought errol flynn was brilliant as custer and has since become my favourite actor 1 
however bt headsets are currently not good for real time games like firstperson shooters since the audio delay messes me up 0 
i got the aluminum case for my new palm vx and it worked really wellit has protected my handheld perfectly so far 1 
those phones are working just fine now 1 
at no point in the proceedings does it look remotely like america 0 
all the pretty pictures in the world cannot make up for a piece of work that is flawed at the core 0 
i could not recommend these more 0 
the pizza tasted old super chewy in not a good way 0 
we loved the biscuits 1 
this is a great restaurant at the mandalay bay 1 
god and i can never get that 90 minutes back 0 
love this headset 1 
the problem i have is that they charge 1199 for a sandwich that is no bigger than a subway sub which offers better and more amount of vegetables 0 
the steak and the shrimp are in my opinion the best entrees at gc 1 
it is light has plenty of battery capacity and is very confortable to wear for somewhat extended periods of time 1 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
im glad i found this product on amazon it is hard to find it wasnt high priced 1 
be sure to order dessert even if you need to pack it togo the tiramisu and cannoli are both to die for 1 
if you are razr owneryou must have this 1 
well im satisfied 1 
it plays louder than any other speaker of this size the price is so low that most would think the quality is lacking however its not 1 
also its a real treat to see anthony quinn playing crazy horse 1 
would come back again if i had a sushi craving while in vegas 1 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
we received a white colored battery that goes dead after a couple hoursthe original used to last a week but still lasts longer than thereplacement 0 
plus its only 8 bucks 1 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
that was nice 1 
but now that it is out of warranty the same problems reoccurebottom line put your money somewhere else cingular will not support it 0 
you share general loewenhielms exquisite joy in his partaking of the cailles en sarcophage even though you are just watching a movie but you do wish for just a small sample to savor 1 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
the awful dialogue and hopeless overacting by everyone who gets shot top off a real waste of space and time 0 
nicest chinese restaurant ive been in a while 1 
i like the fact that it rests lightly against your ear rather than inside 1 
people who like european films and art movies will like this movie 1 
works as described 1 
good service very clean and inexpensive to boot 1 
in fact its hard to remember that the part of ray charles is being acted and not played by the man himself 1 
it was forced like everything in this movie 0 
i was amazed at the quick arrival of the two original lg cell phone batteries and and at a fraction of the price 1 
the entire audience applauded at the conclusion of the film 1 
overall a great experience 1 
the phone crashed completely and now i have to get it replaced 0 
im happy about this purchase good quality and low price 1 
nice solid keyboard 1 
the least said about the acting the better 0 
kris kristoffersen is good in this movie and really makes a difference 1 
ray charles life provided excellent biographical material for the film which goes well beyond being just another movie about a musician 1 
waitress was good though 1 
my breakfast was perpared great with a beautiful presentation of 3 giant slices of toast lightly dusted with powdered sugar 1 
jawbone era is awesome too 1 
you wont be disappointed 1 
the script is a big flawed mess 0 
the bipolarity of the ruthless thug one minute a ruthless killer the next minute a luvs diaper commercial is completely unconvincing 0 
this is probably one of the least effective and utterly unoriginal films i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
excellent cast story line performances 1 
when im on this side of town this will definitely be a spot ill hit up again 1 
the potato chip order was sad i could probably count how many chips were in that box and it was probably around 12 0 
krussel always good 1 
i own a jabra earset and was very happy with it but the sound quality especially outgoing on this is better 1 
the sets especially designed to work with the camera are amazingstylized beautiful and effective 1 
i still maintain that monkeys shouldnt make headphones we just obviously dont share enough dna to copy the design over to humans 0 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
delicious and i will absolutely be back 1 
i promise they wont disappoint 1 
so absolutley fantastic 1 
perfect for the ps3 1 
this item is fantastic and works perfectly 1 
this totally unfunny movie is so over the top and pathetic and unrealistic that throughout the whole 90 minutes of utter torture i probably looked at my watch about 70000 times 0 
the food is not tasty at all not to say its real traditional hunan style 0 
the only possible way this movie could be redeemed would be as mst3k fodder 0 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
oh and i forgot to also mention the weird color effect it has on your phone 0 
you share general loewenhielms exquisite joy in his partaking of the cailles en sarcophage even though you are just watching a movie but you do wish for just a small sample to savor 1 
phone is sturdy as all nokia bar phones are 1 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
this is a very average phone with bad battery life that operates on a weak network 0 
really really good rice all the time 1 
although i very much liked the look and sound of this place the actual experience was a bit disappointing 0 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
either way it sucks 0 
after all the rave reviews i couldnt wait to eat herewhat a disappointment 0 
defective crap 0 
this is the kind of money that is wasted properly 1 
the design might be ergonomic in theory but i could not stand having these in my ear 0 
people couldnt hear me talk and i had to pull out the earphone and talk on the phone 0 
generally it just lacked imagination 0 
plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job 1 
tried to go here for lunch and it was a madhouse 0 
if you havent gone here go now 1 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
the bottowm lineanother worthless cheap gimmick from sprint 0 
excellent product for the price 1 
though the wind and the lion is told largely through the eyes of the son every member of the family can identify with one of the characters whether it be sean connerys noble brigand candace bergens feisty heroine john hustons wily john hay or steve kanalys spiffy radiant ruthless cando lieutenant roosevelts big stick 1 
the bartender was also nice 1 
cool phone 1 
the best place in vegas for breakfast just check out a sat or sun 1 
i love that they put their food in nice plastic containers as opposed to cramming it in little paper takeout boxes 1 
i got home to see the driest damn wings ever 0 
the battery works great 1 
this film highlights the fundamental flaws of the legal process that its not about discovering guilt or innocence but rather is about who presents better in court 1 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
battery has no life 0 
great phone 1 
the best electronics of the available fm transmitters 1 
for readers who have already seen one of miyazakis films he is still in top form and made another worthwhile experience 1 
we are sending it back 0 
i waited and waited 0 
it was awesome 1 
delicious nyc bagels good selections of cream cheese real lox with capers even 1 
the waitress and manager are so friendly 1 
other than that the leather is nice and soft the fit is very tight the cut out for the face is a good shape 1 
trying to make a call on these is an exercise in frustration 0 
well im satisfied 1 
i checked out this place a couple years ago and was not impressed 0 
the film is well paced understated and one of the best courtroom documentaries ive seen 1 
recommend with confidence 1 
predictable but not a bad watch 1 
we asked for the bill to leave without eating and they didnt bring that either 0 
the warm beer didnt help 0 
battery is holding up well 1 
con spotty service 0 
later i found myself lost in the power of the film 1 
i guess i liked the details of his dysfunctionhe was believable 1 
not my thing 0 
the performances are real and gripping the crocdodile is extremely well done indeed if the black water website is to be believed thats because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous 1 
every thing on phone work perfectly she like it 1 
people who like european films and art movies will like this movie 1 
worst foodservice ive had in a while 0 
i got home to see the driest damn wings ever 0 
the camera although rated at an impressive 13 megapixels renders images that fall well below expectations of such a relatively high resolution 0 
bought mainly for the charger which broke soon after purchasing 0 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
it had some average acting from the main person and it was a low budget as you clearly can see 0 
hell no will i go back 0 
we literally sat there for 20 minutes with no one asking to take our order 0 
the turkey and roast beef were bland 0 
the cinematography is simply stunning to say the least and the fx are nothing if not stateoftheart 1 
what a mistake that was 0 
they have great dinners 1 
this place is great 1 
i received it quickly and it works great 1 
i believe that pitch black was done well 1 
is pretty funny 1 
the charger arrived within the promised timeframe but it did not work 0 
top line dont waste your time and money on this one its as bad as it comes 0 
the hockey scenes are terrible defensemen playing like theyre 5 years old goalies diving at shots that are 10 feet wide of the net etc 0 
it was a very superficial movie and it gave me the feeling that i was watching play rather than a film 0 
omg the food was delicioso 1 
fits comfortably came with three sizes of earbud tips 1 
this is one of peter watkins most accessible films 1 
mark my words this is one of those cult films like evil dead 2 or phantasm that people will still be discovering and falling in love with 20 30 40 years down the line 1 
returned 8 hours later 0 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
awesome service and food 1 
ill put this gem up against any movie in terms of screenplay cinematography acting postproduction editing directing or any other aspect of filmmaking 1 
lucy bell is so much higher than this crap and for her to sink this low is quite depressing 0 
setup went very smoothly 1 
dont waste your money and time 0 
its reception is very very poor 0 
this is was due to the fact that it took 20 minutes to be acknowledged then another 35 minutes to get our foodand they kept forgetting things 0 
thus far have only visited twice and the food was absolutely delicious each time 1 
mobile phone tools are a must have 1 
the yellowtail carpaccio was melt in your mouth fresh 1 
plus it was wellpaced and suited its relatively short run time 1 
it was quite comfortable in the ear 1 
that was nice 1 
i highly recommend this movie for anyone interested in art poetry theater politics or japanese history 1 
will be back again 1 
i was very disappointed 0 
so i basically threw my money out the window for nothing 0 
the phone gets extremely hot 0 
it has all the features i want 1 
the service was terrible food was mediocre 0 
great food and great service in a clean and friendly setting 1 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
i great reception all the time 1 
you will leave the theater wanting to go out and dance under the stars 1 
i was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar not only because the quality is great but the service is fast and the food impeccable 1 
were jerks on the phone 0 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
but whatever it was that cost them so much it didnt translate to quality thats for sure 0 
totally different with loads of understatement and black comedy this is a film few get to see but those who do will remember it 1 
very tough and very short on flavor 0 
i will come back here every time im in vegas 1 
the management is rude 0 
the pizza selections are good 1 
i love the ringtones because they are so upbeat 1 
the nokia ca42 usb cable did not work with my phone 0 
at least think to refill my water before i struggle to wave you over for 10 minutes 0 
one more thing i can tolerate political incorrectness very well im all for artistic freedom and suspension of disbelief but the slavic female character was just too much 0 
an awesome new look for fall 2000 1 
i can assure you that you wont be disappointed 1 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
he is almost unbearable to watch on screen he has little to no charisma and terrible comedic timing 0 
works fine 1 
food was really good and i got full petty fast 1 
good works fine 1 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
thus far have only visited twice and the food was absolutely delicious each time 1 
item does not match picture 0 
the lines the cuts the audio everything is wrong 0 
everything captain howdy says is either laughable or just plain stupid 0 
hayao miyazakis latest and eighth film for studio ghibili gake no ue no ponyo ponyo on the cliff by the sea is a wonderfully fun and imaginative look at childhood 1 
this item worked great but it broke after 6 months of use 0 
would not reccommend 0 
poor product 0 
but she is still a bad actress repeating her robotic face moves in each of her pictures 0 
so i basically threw my money out the window for nothing 0 
the dining space is tiny but elegantly decorated and comfortable 1 
i saw mirrormask last night and it was an unsatisfactory experience 0 
the plantains were the worst ive ever tasted 0 
there is a totally unnecessary trainroller coaster scene 0 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
okay i like to consider myself a fair critic so ill give credit where credits duethe creature effects were actually pretty cool 1 
they never brought a salad we asked for 0 
from what my dinner companions told meeverything was very fresh with nice texture and taste 1 
awesome device 1 
it finds my cell phone right away when i enter the car 1 
the handsfree part works fine but then the car tries to download the address book and the treo rebootsoverall i still rate this device high 1 
when i placed my treo into the case not only was it not snug but there was a lot of extra room on the sides 0 
after the first charge kept going dead after 12 minutes 0 
generous portions and great taste 1 
w810i is just superb 1 
the problem was the script 0 
a very very very slowmoving aimless movie about a distressed drifting young man 0 
these are the nicest restaurant owners ive ever come across 1 
unfortunately cover girl is an example of how hollywood used to exploit women for financial gain 0 
it shouldnt take 30 min for pancakes and eggs 0 
it is very comfortable to wear as well which is probably the most important aspect about using a case 1 
i bought this to use with my kindle fire and absolutely loved it 1 
all in all i can assure you ill be back 1 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
its this pandering to the audience that sabotages most of his films 0 
delicious nyc bagels good selections of cream cheese real lox with capers even 1 
im super pissd 0 
i must say i have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again 1 
i never come again 0 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
this is a great place to eat 1 
i mean in a realistic world she would never have gotten into that ballet repertory the whole thing was quite pathetic 0 
10 out of 10 stars 1 
just what i wanted 1 
i wasnt the least bit interested 0 
my 5year old nokia 2160 from tracfone holds the charge a lot better than this 0 
the ri style calamari was a joke 0 
the service was a bit lacking 0 
i think the most wonderful parts literally full of wonder are the excerpts from his works 1 
this is definitely a cult classic well worth viewing and sharing with others 1 
the food is very good for your typical bar food 1 
so i had to take the battery out of the phone put it all back together and then restart it 0 
plug was the wrong size 0 
lange had become a great actress 1 
great place to relax and have an awesome burger and beer 1 
i am very impressed with the job that motorola did on the sturdiness of this phone 1 
1010 1 
this movie is so awesome 1 
crash is a depressing little nothing that provokes emotion but teaches you nothing if you already know racism and prejudice are bad things 0 
everyone is treated equally special 1 
the owner used to work at nobu so this place is really similar for half the price 1 
it is simple to use and i like it 1 
the shrimp tender and moist 1 
food was great and so was the serivce 1 
this is the place where i first had pho and it was amazing 1 
you need two hands to operate the screenthis software interface is decade old and cannot compete with new software designs 0 
there is a lot of beautiful places 1 
plus it was wellpaced and suited its relatively short run time 1 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
the plastic breaks really easy on this clip 0 
food quality has been horrible 0 
tonight i had the elk filet specialand it sucked 0 
in fact its hard to remember that the part of ray charles is being acted and not played by the man himself 1 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
it came free with a dvd player i bought but i still turned the thing off halfway through because i was embarrassed for howell 0 
so i am here to warn youdo not rent this movie it is the dumbest thing you have never seen 0 
if i take a picture the battery drops a bar and starts beeping letting me know its dieing 0 
the battery is unreliable as well as the service use antena 0 
you cant relate with them hell you barely can understand them 0 
soggy and not good 0 
the instruction manual is lacking 0 
this is a great product sure beats using your fingers 1 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
this is the first phone ive had that has been so cheaply made 0 
the food wasnt good 0 
i am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this 1 
this phone is very fast with sending any kind of messages and web browsing is significantly faster than previous phones i have used 1 
shrimp when i unwrapped it i live only 12 a mile from brushfire it was literally ice cold 0 
im so sorry but i really cant recommend it to anyone 0 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
the only thing worse than taylors acting was stanwycks singing 0 
i was seated immediately 1 
better than expected 1 
but now i was completely grossed out 0 
great food and great service in a clean and friendly setting 1 
not too screamy not to masculine but just right 1 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
very funny 1 
the decor is nice and the piano music soundtrack is pleasant 1 
kind of hard to mess up a steak but they did 0 
the phone loads super 1 
unfortunately cover girl is an example of how hollywood used to exploit women for financial gain 0
