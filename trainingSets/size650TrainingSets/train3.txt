i guess i should have known that this place would suck because it is inside of the excalibur but i didnt use my common sense 0 
but when i check voice mail at night the keypad backlight turns off a few seconds into the first message and then im lost 0 
all in all i give this one a resounding 9 out of 10 1 
he really didnt seem to want to be hosting his voiceovers were monotonous didnt get involved with the guests 0 
absolutely great 1 
highquality chicken on the chicken caesar salad 1 
avoid at all costs 0 
left very frustrated 0 
i would not recommend this place 0 
its a feelgood film and thats how i felt when i came out of the cinema 1 
2 thumbs up to this seller 1 
we loved the biscuits 1 
poor quality 0 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
the worst was the salmon sashimi 0 
this gets a 1 out of 10 simply because theres nothing lower 0 
he deserves 5 stars 1 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
this place is not quality sushi it is not a quality restaurant 0 
it is perfect for a sitdown family meal or get together with a few friends 1 
this is so embarassing and also my ears hurt if i try to push the ear plug into my ear 0 
not good by any stretch of the imagination 0 
i bought this to use with my kindle fire and absolutely loved it 1 
it is wonderful and inspiring to watch and i hope that it gets released again on to video or dvd 1 
almost everyone involved must be return to school acting is utterly predictable and bad script is pile of garbage all round 0 
didnt laugh or even smile once 0 
the food came out at a good pace 1 
first time going but i think i will quickly become a regular 1 
i guess i liked the details of his dysfunctionhe was believable 1 
dessert panna cotta was amazing 1 
avoid this one if you can 0 
nargile i think you are great 1 
my mother and brother had to do thiswhen i saw robert ryan portraying this type of man it was a very good imitation of this type of individual and i was impressed 1 
and i really did find them funny 1 
hands down my favorite italian restaurant 1 
thus far have only visited twice and the food was absolutely delicious each time 1 
shes poised and amazing 1 
i believe the screenwriter did a good job of tying up the loose ends 1 
none of the new ones have ever quite worked properly 0 
we wont be returning 0 
unfortunately this is a bad movie that is just plain bad 0 
i would recommend saving room for this 1 
unfortunately it was not good 0 
i received my headset in good time and was happy with it 1 
its quite simply the highest most superlative form of cinema imaginable 1 
long whiny and pointless 0 
we asked for the bill to leave without eating and they didnt bring that either 0 
it failed to convey the broad sweep of landscapes that were a great part of the original 0 
the movie is littered with overt racial slurs towards the black cast members and in return the whites are depicted as morons and boobs 0 
if good intentions made a film great then this film might be one of the greatest films ever made 1 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
what a disappointment 0 
its extremely slow and takes forever to do anything with it 0 
the menu is always changing food quality is going down service is extremely slow 0 
excellent product 1 
i saw this short film on hbo the other day and absolutely loved it 1 
dont bother coming here 0 
i checked out this place a couple years ago and was not impressed 0 
the reception is excellent 1 
personally i think it shows that people should learn to find a compromise them self without involving other people into issue 1 
my sister has one also and she loves it 1 
if you do watch it however there are small consolations the actresses playing annes sisters each do a wonderful job with their roles 1 
the food amazing 1 
the menu is always changing food quality is going down service is extremely slow 0 
and the rest of it just sits there being awful with soldiers singing songs about the masculinity they pledge themselves to hairsplitting about purity the admiration of swords etc 0 
there is really nothing for me at postinos hope your experience is better 0 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
good case 1 
artless camerawork endlessly presents us with the ugliest setting imaginable ie 0 
i saw this film over christmas and what a great film it was 1 
if you dont find it too bad as again the unit comes with one earpad onlyi would not recommend this to anyone 0 
this place is overpriced not consistent with their boba and it really is overpriced 0 
and considering the two of us left there very full and happy for about 20 you just cant go wrong 1 
clear skype calls long battery life long range 1 
its a great item 1 
everything from acting to cinematography was solid 1 
the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach 0 
this greedy corporation will never see another dime from me 0 
this place has it 1 
the chains which im no fan of beat this place easily 0 
best headset ever 1 
the speaker is of low quality so as making the ring tones sound very cheap 0 
the vegetables are so fresh and the sauce feels like authentic thai 1 
very good lunch spot 1 
this is so embarassing and also my ears hurt if i try to push the ear plug into my ear 0 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
definitely will come back here again 1 
wow what a bad film 0 
then i had to continue pairing it periodically since it somehow kept dropping 0 
food arrived quickly 1 
service is perfect and the family atmosphere is nice to see 1 
his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic 1 
a disappointment 0 
even if you love bad movies do not watch this movie 0 
rating 1 out of 10 0 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
all in all a great disappointment 0 
all the actors give a wonderful performance especially jennifer rubin as jamie harris who changes from the nervous starlet in the beginning through the strange events she is part of to the cool star 1 
the script is bad very bad Â– it contains both cheesiness and unethical joke that you normally see in rated r or nc17 movie 0 
this is an unbelievable bargain 1 
camera color balance is awful 0 
good service very clean and inexpensive to boot 1 
the earpiece on this is too large or too heavyit keeps falling out of my ear 0 
not only did the software do a great job of this i could also make my own ringtones form my existing cds without an internet connection 1 
so good i am going to have to review this place twice once hereas a tribute to the place and once as a tribute to an event held here last night 1 
these were so good we ordered them twice 1 
i find wasting food to be despicable but this just wasnt food 0 
we waited an hour for what was a breakfast i could have done 100 times better at home 0 
terrible service 0 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
phenomenal food service and ambiance 1 
this place has it 1 
but it wasnt anything at all just one big yawn 0 
but the premise of the film was so ridiculous that the president of the us 0 
i got the car charger and not even after a week the charger was brokeni went to plug it in and it started smoking 0 
i think not again 0 
the potato chip order was sad i could probably count how many chips were in that box and it was probably around 12 0 
but now i was completely grossed out 0 
very serious spoilers this movie was a huge disappointment 0 
otherwise dont even waste your time on this 0 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
very disappointing 0 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
i dont understand how this garbage got on the shelves of the movie store its not even a real movie 0 
this is essentially a communications tool that does not communicate 0 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
i could not recommend these more 0 
theres also enough hypocrisy in this film to make me vomit 0 
this movie is possibly one of the most creative works of horror ever 1 
very good food great atmosphere1 1 
they could serve it with just the vinaigrette and it may make for a better overall dish but it was still very good 1 
easy to pair with my samsung cell 1 
i had the chicken pho and it tasted very bland 0 
the casting is also horrible cause all you see is a really really bad actors period 0 
ive had this for nearly 2 years and it has worked great for me 1 
things that went wrong they burned the saganaki 0 
how awful she is 0 
needless to say i wont be going back anytime soon 0 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
this really is how vegas fine dining used to be right down to the menus handed to the ladies that have no prices listed 1 
i really enjoyed eating here 1 
john garfield ann revere lilli plmer william conrad canada leeand filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screenjames wong howe 1 
the acting is beyond abysmal 0 
in a word it is embarrassing 0 
product is useless since it does not have enough charging current to charge the 2 cellphones i was planning to use it with 0 
the bt headset was such a disapoinment 0 
when my order arrived one of the gyros was missing 0 
it dit not work most of the time with my nokia 5320 0 
maybe its just their vegetarian fare but ive been twice and i thought it was average at best 0 
the jamaican mojitos are delicious 1 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
i guess i liked the details of his dysfunctionhe was believable 1 
crostini that came with the salad was stale 0 
there was no chemistry between ben affleck and sandra bullock in this film and i couldnt understand why he would consider even leaving his wifetobe for this chick that he supposedly was knocked out by 0 
one of the worst shows of all time 0 
hell no will i go back 0 
that being said for a phone the camera is very nice many cool effects to play with and video is decent as well 1 
some may say this buffet is pricey but i think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot 1 
we enjoy their pizza and brunch 1 
the story which was told so eloquently by francis ford coppola 25 years earlier really unfolds gradually and leaves room for the characters to develop 1 
everything was gross 0 
i love this place 1 
what a waste of time 0 
the real disappointment was our waiter 0 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
couldnt figure it out 0 
instead we got a bore fest about a whiny spoiled brat babysitting 0 
it does everything the description said it would 1 
after 20 minutes wait i got a table 0 
the delivery was on time 1 
i came back today since they relocated and still not impressed 0 
her lines seem to have been written by a fifteen year old though they are trying oh so so hard to sound like how a fifteen year old would really um you know well talk 0 
who in their right mind is gonna buy this battery 0 
this is by far the worst purchase ive made on amazon 0 
i am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this 1 
this is a great little item 1 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
even if you love bad movies do not watch this movie 0 
i would not recommend this place 0 
everything was fresh and delicious 1 
this place is good 1 
the food is rich so order accordingly 1 
dont buy this product 0 
dont bother coming here 0 
the majority of the logitech earbud headsets failed 0 
i love my 350 headset my jabra350 bluetooth headset is great the reception is very good and the ear piece is a comfortable fit 1 
and i really did find them funny 1 
great character actors telly savalas and peter boyle 1 
the chains which im no fan of beat this place easily 0 
the shower area is outside so you can only rinse not take a full shower unless you dont mind being nude for everyone to see 0 
dont waste your money 0 
anne heche was utterly convincing 1 
there is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again 0 
an extensive menu provides lots of options for breakfast 1 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
this place lacked style 0 
i love this thing 1 
i have had tmobile service for 2 or 3 years now and i am pretty happy with it 1 
this film has no redeeming features 0 
great choice 1 
a very very very slowmoving aimless movie about a distressed drifting young man 0 
a cheap and cheerless heist movie with poor characterisation lots of underbite style stoic emoting think chow yun fat in a better tomorrow and some cheesy clichÃ©s thrown into an abandoned factory ready for a few poorly executed flying judo rolls a la john woo 0 
as i said abovepretty useless 0 
the soundtrack wasnt terrible either 1 
tom wilkinson broke my heart at the end and everyone elses judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike 1 
lightweight and works well 1 
works great 1 
however after finally watching this film i realized that not only had i had a closed mind to the brilliance it depicts i also found myself watching it over and over again 1 
not good enough for the price 0 
there is simply no excuse for something this poorly done 0 
the 12 mega pixel camera being a part of a phone is reasonably good7 1 
what did bother me was the slow service 0 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
itll be a regular stop on my trips to phoenix 1 
good product incredible value 1 
thats how id describe this painfully dreary timewaster of a film 0 
some applause should be given to the prelude however 1 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
too bad cause i know its family owned i really wanted to like this place 0 
however after finally watching this film i realized that not only had i had a closed mind to the brilliance it depicts i also found myself watching it over and over again 1 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
i ended up sliding it on the edge of my pants or back pockets instead 1 
10 out of 10 stars 1 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
made very sturdy 1 
definitely a bargain 1 
their chow mein is so good 1 
i dont think it would hold it too securly on your belt 0 
and i really did find them funny 1 
my order was not correct 0 
everyone is treated equally special 1 
i would advise to not purchase this item it never worked very well 0 
pretty piece of junk 0 
we watched our waiter pay a lot more attention to other tables and ignore us 0 
not what i wanted 0 
there was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth but it didnt really work into the rest of the plot 0 
food was great and so was the serivce 1 
when it opens the battery connection is broken and the device is turned off 0 
someone shouldve invented this sooner 1 
all i have to say is the food was amazing 1 
the story itself is just predictable and lazy 0 
i didnt want the clip going over the top of my ear causing discomfort 0 
i tried talking real loud but shouting on the telephone gets old and i was still told it wasnt great 0 
the waitress and manager are so friendly 1 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
this movie has a cutting edge to it 1 
service is quick and friendly 1 
i couldnt think of a better way to end the film but a smile on my face great way to wrap up an amazing film and trilogy 1 
i ordered this for sony ericsson w810i but i think it only worked once thats when i first used it 0 
love it great armband 1 
nonlinear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well 1 
they know how to make them here 1 
all in all i think it was a good investment 1 
it is zillion times away from reality 0 
im surprised this is a good quality car charger and theres not much reviews about it 1 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
the headset fulfills my requirements so i am happy with my purchase 1 
this place is good 1 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
price is good too 1 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
id say that would be the hardest decision honestly all of ms dishes taste how they are supposed to taste amazing 1 
this company charge me a restocking fee and still not given me my refund back 0 
much better than the other ayce sushi place i went to in vegas 1 
this product is clearly not ready for prime time i dont care how cool it looks if you cant tell a call is coming in its worthless 0 
i like design and look of jabra behing the ear headsets and 5020 is pretty comfortible to wear 24 hours a day without pain in the ear 1 
my boyfriend tried the mediterranean chicken salad and fell in love 1 
thanks again to amazon for having the things i need for a good price 1 
a very good film indeed about great and unconditional love 1 
great phone 1 
on the negative its insipid enough to cause regret for another 2 hours of life wasted in front of the screen 0 
unfortunately this is a bad movie that is just plain bad 0 
all i have to say is the food was amazing 1 
anyways the food was definitely not filling at all and for the price you pay you should expect more 0 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
crust is not good 0 
a must study for anyone interested in the worst sins of industrial design 0 
an instant classic with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits 1 
after two i felt disgusting 0 
great for the jawbone 1 
the headset fulfills my requirements so i am happy with my purchase 1 
it works 1 
its a feelgood film and thats how i felt when i came out of the cinema 1 
we sat another ten minutes and finally gave up and left 0 
the scenes with the ohsomature neighbourgirl are a misplace 0 
my sanyo has survived dozens of drops on blacktop without ill effect 1 
well just if you keep thinking how bad it is 0 
the price was very good and with the free shipping and all it was a good purchase 1 
iam very pleased with my purchase 1 
it was just too horrible 0 
in conclusion i will not bother with this movie because a volcano in los angeles is nothing but nonsense 0 
nice quality build unlike some cheap s out there 1 
their research and development division obviously knows what theyre doing 1 
i love this device 1 
all i can do is whine on the internet so here it goesthe more i use the thing the less i like it 0 
we loved the place 1 
they refuse to refund or replace 0 
a piece of junk that broke after being on my phone for 2 days 0 
your brain will attempt to shutdown as part of a primal impulse of selfpreservation 0 
things that went wrong they burned the saganaki 0 
the camera although rated at an impressive 13 megapixels renders images that fall well below expectations of such a relatively high resolution 0 
this is a great phone 1 
works fine 1 
director paul matthews who also wrotedirected the weak 1995 monster movie grim clearly doesnt know how to pace his films 0 
this phone is pretty sturdy and ive never had any large problems with it 1 
dont buy it 0 
i let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this bad idea we both hated it 0 
five star plus plus 1 
the construction of the headsets is poor 0 
the charger arrived within the promised timeframe but it did not work 0 
worst hour and a half of my lifeoh my gosh 0 
call me a nut but i think this is one of the best movies ever 1 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
seafood was limited to boiled shrimp and crab legs but the crab legs definitely did not taste fresh 0 
this is high adventure at its best 1 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
this convention never worked well in the past and certainly doesnt work here 0 
the waitress and manager are so friendly 1 
perfect for the ps3 1 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
lastly the mozzarella sticks they were the best thing we ordered 1 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
highquality chicken on the chicken caesar salad 1 
the battery is unreliable as well as the service use antena 0 
i received my orders well within the shipping timeframe everything was in good working order and overall i am very excited to have this source 1 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
hot dishes are not hot cold dishes are close to room tempi watched staff prepare food with bare hands no gloveseverything is deep fried in oil 0 
my husband said she was very rude did not even apologize for the bad food or anything 0 
my breakfast was perpared great with a beautiful presentation of 3 giant slices of toast lightly dusted with powdered sugar 1 
good item low price 1 
the writer gorman bechard undoubtedly did his homework because all references are industry and characterage appropriate 1 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
i have been to very few places to eat that under no circumstances would i ever return to and this tops the list 0 
the feel of the dining room was more college cooking course than high class dining and the service was slow at best 0 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
i still maintain that monkeys shouldnt make headphones we just obviously dont share enough dna to copy the design over to humans 0 
and finally after all that we get to an ending that wouldve been great had it been handled by competent people and not jerry falwell 0 
i dont recommend unless your car breaks down in front of it and you are starving 0 
simply beautiful 1 
how can that bethe audio quality is poor 0 
2 thumbs up to this seller 1 
very slow at seating even with reservation 0 
as for the killer dont expect anything original or even remotely frightening 0 
the design might be ergonomic in theory but i could not stand having these in my ear 0 
not even a hello we will be right with you 0 
service was exceptional and food was a good as all the reviews 1 
this was such an awesome movie that i bought it off of ebay 1 
a standout scene 1 
conclusion very filling meals 1 
im so sorry but i really cant recommend it to anyone 0 
first the bathrooms at this location were dirty seat covers were not replenished just plain yucky 0 
omelets are to die for 1 
the awful dialogue and hopeless overacting by everyone who gets shot top off a real waste of space and time 0 
i live in the neighborhood so i am disappointed i wont be back here because it is a convenient location 0 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
the poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying 0 
i did not have any problem with this item and would order it again if needed 1 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
the ambiance was incredible 1 
the tracfonewebsite is user friendly and makes it easy toactivate etc 1 
you share general loewenhielms exquisite joy in his partaking of the cailles en sarcophage even though you are just watching a movie but you do wish for just a small sample to savor 1 
thank you for wasting my money 0 
5 stars for the brick oven bread app 1 
the entire audience applauded at the conclusion of the film 1 
the dining space is tiny but elegantly decorated and comfortable 1 
great phone 1 
i gave it a 10 1 
we waited for forty five minutes in vain 0 
i always order from the vegetarian menu during dinner which has a wide array of options to choose from 1 
is it possible for a movie to get any worse than this 0 
same problem as others have mentioned 0 
an awesome new look for fall 2000 1 
all in all i think it was a good investment 1 
those phones are working just fine now 1 
i dont know exactly what it is about this movie but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our familys memories 1 
does not work 0 
i recommend this for everyone who loves film movies anythinga work of art 1 
this is a great deal 1 
and those baby owls were adorable 1 
fantastic food 1 
i love the scream movies and all horror movies and this one ranks way up there 1 
jamie foxx absolutely is ray charles 1 
lasted one day and then blew up 0 
their steaks are 100 recommended 1 
awful 0 
if she had not rolled the eyes we may have stayed not sure if we will go back and try it again 0 
brilliance indeed 1 
you can even take self portraits with the outside exterior display very cool 1 
uncomfortable in the ear dont use with lg vx9900 env 0 
this is one of peter watkins most accessible films 1 
end of days is one of the worst bigbudget action movies ive ever seen 0 
yes its that bad 0 
omg the food was delicioso 1 
all the characters in this film are tremendously well played 1 
the warmth it generates is in contrast to its austere backdrop 1 
it is the best charger i have seen on the market yet 1 
i saw mirrormask last night and it was an unsatisfactory experience 0 
very satisifed with that 1 
fits comfortably came with three sizes of earbud tips 1 
it probably would have been better if the director hadnt spent most of the movie showcasing his own art work which really isnt that noteworthy 0 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
great phone 1 
of all the dishes the salmon was the best but all were great 1 
this place is not quality sushi it is not a quality restaurant 0 
i liked it 1 
the place was fairly clean but the food simply wasnt worth it 0 
this place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver 0 
couldnt figure it out 0 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
some applause should be given to the prelude however 1 
the mic is great 1 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
punishment park is a brilliant piece of cinema 1 
great case and price 1 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
i didnt realize how wonderful the short really is until the last two scenes 1 
now i know that i made a wise decision 1 
horrible horrible protector 0 
regrettably the film fails 0 
judith light is one of my favorite actresses and i think she does a superb job in this film 1 
the cashew cream sauce was bland and the vegetables were undercooked 0 
piece of trash 0 
after trying many many handsfree gadgets this is the one that finally works well 1 
kind of flops around 0 
good food good service 1 
i love the look and feel of samsung flipphones 1 
even in my bmw 3 series which is fairly quiet i have trouble hearing what the other person is saying 0 
weird vibe from owners 0 
there is no plot or storyline 0 
this place is awesome if you want something light and healthy during the summer 1 
it has all the features i want 1 
the chains which im no fan of beat this place easily 0 
it came free with a dvd player i bought but i still turned the thing off halfway through because i was embarrassed for howell 0 
the design might be ergonomic in theory but i could not stand having these in my ear 0 
i have bought this nokia cell phone a few weeks ago and it was a nightmare 0 
i did not have any problem with this item and would order it again if needed 1 
the camera on the phone may be used as a dustpan when indoors id rather be using a disposable then this 0 
i would have given no star if i was able 0 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
i didnt realize how wonderful the short really is until the last two scenes 1 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
the acting was decidely wooden though no worse than a period universal b movie 0 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
the acting was bad 0 
excellent sound quality 1 
i give wirefly 1 stari will contact cingularatt and inform them of this practice 0 
i must say i have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again 1 
it is very comfortable to wear as well which is probably the most important aspect about using a case 1 
we were promptly greeted and seated 1 
the presentation of the food was awful 0 
but the duet between the astronaut and his doctor at the beginning of the movie is a perfect exchange if one considers that this movie was made well into the cold war and the astronauts biggest fear is that he has crashed in the ussr 1 
i was left shattered from the experience of watching this film and i took a good two hours to fully recover 0 
it was so cool 1 
easy to pair with my samsung cell 1 
theres barely a boring moment in the film and there are plenty of humorous parts 1 
the interplay between martin and emilio contains the same wonderful chemistry we saw in wall street with martin and charlie 1 
they work about 2 weeks then break 0 
the eargels channel the sound directly into your ear and seem to increase the sound volume and clarity 1 
i think that it is a must see older john wayne film 1 
great price too 1 
gotta love those closeups of slimy drooling teeth 1 
the food wasnt good 0 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
but when i check voice mail at night the keypad backlight turns off a few seconds into the first message and then im lost 0 
design flaw 0 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
the accompanied software is almost brilliant 1 
we watched our waiter pay a lot more attention to other tables and ignore us 0 
best ive found so far ive tried 2 other bluetooths and this one has the best quality for both me and the listener as well as ease of using 1 
helen baxendale is a very credible lady macbeth who can be very cheerfull at times and sometimes she just looks like a naughty girl but deadly in her taste for blood and evil 1 
sooooo good 1 
1010 1 
thanks again to amazon for having the things i need for a good price 1 
it has been a winner for us 1 
i have two more years left in this contract and i hate this phone 0 
this place is disgusting 0 
we enjoy their pizza and brunch 1 
unfortunately cover girl is an example of how hollywood used to exploit women for financial gain 0 
avoid this one if you can 0 
tonight i had the elk filet specialand it sucked 0 
our server was super nice and checked on us many times 1 
the restaurant is very clean and has a family restaurant feel to it 1 
this is a simple little phone to use but the breakage is unacceptible 0 
the loudspeaker option is great the bumpers with the lights is very appealing 0 
a very very very slowmoving aimless movie about a distressed drifting young man 0 
i will never forget it now 1 
woa talk about awful 0 
dee snider just plain sucks 0 
this one wants to surf on the small wave of space movies in 1998 deep impact and armageddon and this one fails everywhere 0 
also makes it easier to hold on to 1 
i liked it 1 
im very disappointed with my decision 0 
it didnt make me scared horrified or make me sympathetic towards the characters it was simply annoying 0 
the phone is sturdy and waterproof 1 
i guess that nobody at the network that aired this dribble watched it before putting it on 0 
however after seeing the short again after about 25 years i was amazed at how timeless the film actually is 1 
lasted one day and then blew up 0 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
after two i felt disgusting 0 
trying to make a call on these is an exercise in frustration 0 
very good stuff for the price 1 
i dont like this nokia either 0 
will definitely be back 1 
sending it back 0 
the movie is terribly boring in places 0 
i was totally fascinated by the music the dancing everything 1 
the entire audience applauded at the conclusion of the film 1 
his costars dont fare much better with people like morgan freeman jonah hill and ed helms just wasted 0 
omg the food was delicioso 1 
lucy bell is so much higher than this crap and for her to sink this low is quite depressing 0 
if only someone involved with it knew how to string together narrative 0 
his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic 1 
very poor service 0 
the lighting is just dark enough to set the mood 1 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
poor product 0 
the movie showed a lot of florida at its best made it look very appealing 1 
everything about it is fine and reasonable for the price ie 1 
so in a nutshell 1 the restaraunt smells like a combination of a dirty fish market and a sewer 0 
there is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again 0 
i mean really how do you get so famous for your fish and chips when its so terrible 0 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
imdb ratings only go as low 1 for awful its time to get some negative numbers in there for cases such as these 0 
the server was very negligent of our needs and made us feel very unwelcome i would not suggest this place 0 
this is by far the worst purchase ive made on amazon 0 
wonderful lil tapas and the ambience made me feel all warm and fuzzy inside 1 
the transfers are very good 1 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
it is wonderful and inspiring to watch and i hope that it gets released again on to video or dvd 1 
the plot is nonsense that doesnt interest in the slightest way or have any uniqueness to it 0 
if this premise sound stupid thats because it is 0 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
cumbersome design 0 
everything about this film is simply incredible 1 
emily watsons character is very strong and she has only to give a quick glance and you understand everything 1 
very funny 1 
i was very excited to get this headset because i thought it was really cute 1 
service was exceptional and food was a good as all the reviews 1 
i enjoyed reading this book to my children when they were little 1 
i was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar not only because the quality is great but the service is fast and the food impeccable 1 
during several different 2 minute calls i experienced 5 drops and it was in an area that had 5 bars 0 
very disappointed 0 
better than expected 1 
all in all its an insult to ones intelligence and a huge waste of money 0 
i dont each much pasta but i love the homemade hand made pastas and thin pizzas here 1 
we sat another ten minutes and finally gave up and left 0 
del taco is pretty nasty and should be avoided if possible 0 
i got it because it was so small and adorable 1 
i own 2 of these cases and would order another 1 
horrible had to switch 3 times 0 
it was that year however that reminded us that huston was still at the top of his game as evinced by his faithful adaptation of james joyces acclaimed novella the dead 1 
not good enough for the price 0 
and i really did find them funny 1 
nargile i think you are great 1 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
favorite place in town for shawarrrrrrma 1 
it was equally awful 0 
regardless the film fails on most levels 0 
cheap but hey it works was pleasantly suprised given the low cost of this item 1 
i dont know exactly what it is about this movie but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our familys memories 1 
the poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying 0 
but its just not funny 0 
this phone might well be the worst ive ever had in any brand 0 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
the food was very good 1 
fantastic service here 1 
which is precisely why i am giving it such a bad review 0 
del taco is pretty nasty and should be avoided if possible 0 
this is so embarassing and also my ears hurt if i try to push the ear plug into my ear 0 
i loved their mussels cooked in this wine reduction the duck was tender and their potato dishes were delicious 1 
first time there and might just be the last 0 
the battery is unreliable as well as the service use antena 0 
the screen size is big key pad lit well enough and the camera quality is excellent for a camera phone 1 
my wife had the lobster bisque soup which was lukewarm 0 
returned 8 hours later 0 
10 out of 10 for both the movie and trilogy 1 
this is the place where i first had pho and it was amazing 1 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
the battery is completely useless to me 0 
talk about great customer service of course we will be back 1 
the best place to go for a tasty bowl of pho 1 
summary the witticisms werent witty 0 
john wayne did an incredible job for being so young in the movie industry 1 
crostini that came with the salad was stale 0 
they have horrible attitudes towards customers and talk down to each one when customers dont enjoy their food 0 
not a good item it worked for a while then started having problems in my auto reverse tape player 0 
there is a brilliant twist ending 1 
it was either too cold not enough flavor or just bad 0 
pretty cool i would say 1 
that being said for a phone the camera is very nice many cool effects to play with and video is decent as well 1 
recommend with confidence 1 
what a great double cheeseburger 1 
also difficult to put onid recommend avoiding this product 0 
we waited an hour for what was a breakfast i could have done 100 times better at home 0 
perfect for someone me who only likes beer ice cold or in this case even colder 1 
perhaps my phone is defective but people cannot hear me when i use this 0 
i ordered albondigas soup which was just warm and tasted like tomato soup with frozen meatballs 0 
brilliant 1 
ive never been more insulted or felt disrespected 0 
any grandmother can make a roasted chicken better than this one 0 
i love this cable it allows me to connect any miniusb device to my pc 1 
we wont be going back 0 
now we were chosen to be tortured with this disgusting piece of blatant american propaganda 0 
utter crap sound quality is terrible 0 
about ten minutes into this film i started having second thoughts 0 
fits comfortably came with three sizes of earbud tips 1 
my first visit to hiro was a delight 1 
tonight i had the elk filet specialand it sucked 0 
unfortunately any virtue in this films production work was lost on a regrettable script 0 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
try them in the airport to experience some tasty food and speedy friendly service 1 
i have yet to run this new battery below two bars and thats three days without charging 1 
the battery is working well as a replacement for the original that came with the phone over 2 years ago 1 
this is a witty and delightful adaptation of the dr seuss book brilliantly animated by upas finest and thoroughly deserving of its academy award 1 
piece of junk 0 
the potatoes were great and so was the biscuit 1 
from what my dinner companions told meeverything was very fresh with nice texture and taste 1 
i totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is 1 
the real killer is the volume and of course it breaking 0 
this is a great phone 1 
best service and food ever maria our server was so good and friendly she made our day 1 
still its quite interesting and entertaining to follow 1 
battery life is also great 1 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
john wayne did an incredible job for being so young in the movie industry 1 
there is a totally unnecessary trainroller coaster scene 0 
great software for motorolas 1 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
its kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly its embarrassing how childlike the company is 0 
the story line is just awful 0 
in addition to having one of the most lovely songs ever written french cancan also boasts one of the cutest leading ladies ever to grace the screen 1 
works like a charm it work the same as the one i got with the phone 1 
bad day or not i have a very low tolerance for rude customer service people it is your job to be nice and polite wash dishes otherwise 0 
i was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar not only because the quality is great but the service is fast and the food impeccable 1 
i also didnt like the on button it felt like it would crack with use 0 
that just screams legit in my booksomethats also pretty rare here in vegas 1 
this place is not quality sushi it is not a quality restaurant 0 
walked in and the place smelled like an old grease trap and only 2 others there eating 0 
i get absolutely horrible reception in my apartment where with other phones i have not had this problem 0 
the acting sucks the music sucks the script sucks the pacing sucks the special fx suck the directing sucks basically this movie sucks 0 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
not even good for camp value 0 
i can assure you that you wont be disappointed 1
