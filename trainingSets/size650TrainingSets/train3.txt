it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
the bipolarity of the ruthless thug one minute a ruthless killer the next minute a luvs diaper commercial is completely unconvincing 0 
this product is great it makes working a lot easier i can go to the copier while waiting on hold for something 1 
it is just the sort of pap that is screened in the afternoon to punish the unemployed for not having jobs 0 
its reception is very very poor 0 
after the first charge kept going dead after 12 minutes 0 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
the plot was the same as pretty much every other cheap horror 0 
i dont think you will be disappointed 1 
does not fit 0 
i did not have any problem with this item and would order it again if needed 1 
i went to bachi burger on a friends recommendation and was not disappointed 1 
all in all a great disappointment 0 
i am a fan of his this movie sucked really bad 0 
i am so pleased to know such a modern day genius is out there letting is passion for art drive him and taking us as an audience with him 1 
honeslty it didnt taste that fresh 0 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
the good cinematography also makes her and monica bellucci look very beautiful 1 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
ill definitely be in soon again 1 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
i dont think ill be running back to carlys anytime soon for food 0 
i would recommend this 1 
for people who are first timers in film making i think they did an excellent job 1 
not much seafood and like 5 strings of pasta at the bottom 0 
after watching this film i wanted to learn more about the works of this artist 1 
their frozen margaritas are way too sugary for my taste 0 
best of all is the rotating feature very helpful 1 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
the phone loads super 1 
dont go here 0 
it is easy to turn on and off when you are in the car and the volume controls are quite accessable 1 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
this gets a 1 out of 10 simply because theres nothing lower 0 
it wasnt busy at all and now we know why 0 
often the dialogue doesnt really follow from one line to another or fit the surroundings 0 
his losing his marbles so early in the proceedings is totally implausible and unconvincing 0 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
i used bitpim a free program you can find on the internetto transfer data to the phonethe price of the cable was excellent 1 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
the chips that came out were dripping with grease and mostly not edible 0 
but in terms of the writing its very fresh and bold 1 
its extremely slow and takes forever to do anything with it 0 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
and it was way to expensive 0 
the only thing worse than taylors acting was stanwycks singing 0 
comfort for our whole family 1 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
everything was good and tasty 1 
the best part about nurse betty is its unpredictability 1 
it was so bad i had lost the heart to finish it 0 
a happy wonderful feel good ending 1 
best tacos in town by far 1 
does not work 0 
now imagine that every single one of those decisions was made wrong 0 
excellent phone 1 
disapointing results 0 
despite the pans of reviewers i liked this movie 1 
the movie had you on the edge of your seat and made you somewhat afraid to go to your car at the end of the night 1 
one of the worst shows of all time 0 
the fried rice was dry as well 0 
i literally vomited while watching this film 0 
so far it has worked like a charm 1 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
we ordered some old classics and some new dishes after going there a few times and were sorely disappointed with everything 0 
full of unconvincing cardboard characters it is blandly written by edward chodorov who also produced and is surprisingly directed by jean negulesco from whom one would expect a great deal more 0 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
all the characters in this film are tremendously well played 1 
every time he opened his mouth you expect to hear you see kids pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show 0 
what should have been a hilarious yummy christmas eve dinner to remember was the biggest fail of the entire trip for us 0 
do not buy do not buyit sucks 0 
then i watched it again two sundays ago march 20th 2005 and i began to really enjoy it and this time i taped the entire thing 1 
i was not impressed by this product 0 
i didnt realize how wonderful the short really is until the last two scenes 1 
it defeats the purpose of a bluetooth headset 0 
on the negative its insipid enough to cause regret for another 2 hours of life wasted in front of the screen 0 
i wasted my little money with this earpiece 0 
food is way overpriced and portions are fucking small 0 
the art style has the appearance of crayonpencil drawings and is wonderfully colorful and fanciful 1 
you cant beat the price on these 1 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
this is a great place to eat 1 
i guess it was supposed to be clever twist then shed some light on the situation but it was just stupid 0 
the movie is littered with overt racial slurs towards the black cast members and in return the whites are depicted as morons and boobs 0 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
awesome service and food 1 
all in all ha long bay was a bit of a flop 0 
i gave it 5 stars then and im giving it 5 stars now 1 
the very idea of it was lame take a minor character from a mediocre pg13 film and make a complete nonsequel while changing its tone to a pgrated family movie 0 
in fact its hard to remember that the part of ray charles is being acted and not played by the man himself 1 
ive had better not only from dedicated boba tea spots but even from jenni pho 0 
will not be back 0 
you also cannot take pictures with it in the case because the lense is covered 0 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
good product good seller 1 
great phone 1 
tom wilkinson broke my heart at the end and everyone elses judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike 1 
it is an hour and half waste of time following a bunch of very pretty high schoolers whine and cry about life 0 
i have seen many movies starring jaclyn smith but my god this was one of her best though it came out 12 years ago 1 
about ten minutes into this film i started having second thoughts 0 
again lame 0 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
im not sure how long we stood there but it was long enough for me to begin to feel awkwardly out of place 0 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
come hungry leave happy and stuffed 1 
bluetooth does not work phone locks up screens just flash up and now it just makes calls randomly while in my pocket locked 0 
lange had become a great actress 1 
waste your money on this game 1 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
this is a great deal 1 
that was nice 1 
i had to wait over 30 minutes to get my drink and longer to get 2 arepas 0 
worst service to boot but that is the least of their worries 0 
i would highly recommend this product 1 
theres really nothing bad i can say about this headset 0 
thanks again to amazon for having the things i need for a good price 1 
this place is handsdown one of the best places to eat in the phoenix metro area 1 
totally different with loads of understatement and black comedy this is a film few get to see but those who do will remember it 1 
great place fo take out or eat in 1 
the selection of food was not the best 0 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
i wont say any more i dont like spoilers so i dont want to be one but i believe this film is worth your time 1 
it really is impressive that the place hasnt closed down 0 
service was very prompt 1 
if you see it you should probably just leave it on the shelf 0 
his performance is simply genius 1 
i rather enjoyed it 1 
the sound quality is excellent as well 1 
great phone 1 
i like steiners because its dark and it feels like a bar 1 
any ring toneoverall good phone to buy 1 
shes poised and amazing 1 
it is so small and you dont even realize that it is there after a while of getting used to it 1 
i love that they put their food in nice plastic containers as opposed to cramming it in little paper takeout boxes 1 
this product is great it makes working a lot easier i can go to the copier while waiting on hold for something 1 
it is light has plenty of battery capacity and is very confortable to wear for somewhat extended periods of time 1 
the cocktails are all handmade and delicious 1 
this movie is also revealing 1 
its like a really sexy party in your mouth where youre outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party 1 
i connected my wifes bluetoothmotorola hs850 to my phone and it worked like a charm whether the phone was in my pocket or the case 1 
the charger worked for about a week and then completely stopped charging my phone 0 
this movie is also revealing 1 
i love this bluetooth 1 
definitely will come back here again 1 
if you hate earbugs avoid this phone by all means 0 
we recently witnessed her poor quality of management towards other guests as well 0 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
however i recently watched the whole thing again on dvd and i was completely struck by how extremely stupid the storyline was how it contained holes inconsistencies and frankly a whole lot of crap and how horrid the dancing was 0 
works as described 1 
the file browser offers all the options that one needshandsfree is great 1 
best tater tots in the southwest 1 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
in the summer you can dine in a charming outdoor patio so very delightful 1 
great it was new packaged nice works good no problems and it came in less time then i expected 1 
this is was due to the fact that it took 20 minutes to be acknowledged then another 35 minutes to get our foodand they kept forgetting things 0 
the sweet potato tots were good but the onion rings were perfection or as close as i have had 1 
we ordered the duck rare and it was pink and tender on the inside with a nice char on the outside 1 
i also decided not to send it back because our waitress looked like she was on the verge of having a heart attack 0 
he really didnt seem to want to be hosting his voiceovers were monotonous didnt get involved with the guests 0 
the bt headset was such a disapoinment 0 
i love this place 1 
the phone was unusable and was not new 0 
started watching this but didnt believe in any of the characters 0 
reversible plug works great 1 
i really dont see how anyone could enjoy this movie 0 
when my order arrived one of the gyros was missing 0 
it even has its sweet moments 1 
just as good as when i had it more than a year ago 1 
i wear glasses and it fits fine with them 1 
del taco is pretty nasty and should be avoided if possible 0 
those burgers were amazing 1 
works fine 1 
the burger had absolutely no flavor the meat itself was totally bland the burger was overcooked and there was no charcoal flavor 0 
it doesnt work in europe or asia 0 
things that went wrong they burned the saganaki 0 
the acting as youd expect from this cast is top notch 1 
i have read others reviews here but i havent had any problem with it 1 
the decor is nice and the piano music soundtrack is pleasant 1 
worthless product 0 
i had the mac salad and it was pretty bland so i will not be getting that again 0 
its a campy sort of film thats a joy to watch 1 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
but it wasnt until i watched this film that i realised how great he actually was 1 
i have recommended it to friends 1 
the warm beer didnt help 0 
i hope this place sticks around 1 
despite the pans of reviewers i liked this movie 1 
the servers went back and forth several times not even so much as an are you being helped 0 
comfort for our whole family 1 
macbeth jason connery moved me to tears with his final monolog out brief candle outhe gave the sphere of moral decay and dark forces a human face which makes it the more interesting 1 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
often the dialogue doesnt really follow from one line to another or fit the surroundings 0 
great place to relax and have an awesome burger and beer 1 
and the chef was generous with his time even came around twice so we can take pictures with him 1 
judith light is one of my favorite actresses and i think she does a superb job in this film 1 
then i exchanged for the same phone even that had the same problem 0 
the show would begin with smart ass ed comments to each other that would be totally off the wall and uncalled for 0 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
whatever prompted such a documentary is beyond me 0 
the ripped banana was not only ripped but petrified and tasteless 0 
never been to hard rock casino before will never ever step forward in it again 0 
barney is definitely super de duper 1 
i do love sushi but i found kabuki to be overpriced overhip and underservices 0 
first of all it doesnt wear well 0 
very disappointed and wondered how it could be in the oscar shortlist 0 
but its just not funny 0 
i ordered albondigas soup which was just warm and tasted like tomato soup with frozen meatballs 0 
in the summer you can dine in a charming outdoor patio so very delightful 1 
great steak great sides great wine amazing desserts 1 
the service was outshining i definitely recommend the halibut 1 
and generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode 0 
the calls drop the phone comes on and off at will the screen goes black and the worst of all it stops ringing intermittently 0 
seriously flavorful delights folks 1 
linked to my phone without effort 1 
absolutel junk 0 
the movie was very interesting from beginning to the end 1 
walked in and the place smelled like an old grease trap and only 2 others there eating 0 
but now that it is out of warranty the same problems reoccurebottom line put your money somewhere else cingular will not support it 0 
here in the wind and the lion we see a wonderful rendering of americas own imperial age 1 
we started with the tuna sashimi which was brownish in color and obviously wasnt fresh 0 
lovely little thriller from hitchcock with lots of nice shenanigans surrounding a murdered spy a kidnapped child a nasty church a foreign plot and some random taxidermists 1 
all the other cases ive tried normally fall apart after a few months but this one seems to be in for the long haul 1 
i wont be back 0 
thus far have only visited twice and the food was absolutely delicious each time 1 
this particular model would not work with my motorola q smartphone 0 
went in for happy hour great list of wines 1 
its a feelgood film and thats how i felt when i came out of the cinema 1 
we wont be returning 0 
however after finally watching this film i realized that not only had i had a closed mind to the brilliance it depicts i also found myself watching it over and over again 1 
oh yeah and the storyline was pathetic too 0 
i love it 1 
hard to judge whether these sides were good because we were grossed out by the melted styrofoam and didnt want to eat it for fear of getting sick 0 
definitely will come back here again 1 
the croutons also taste homemade which is an extra plus 1 
then i had to continue pairing it periodically since it somehow kept dropping 0 
it has all the features i want 1 
camerawork again bad 0 
go and see it 1 
the kids are annoying 0 
the guys all had steaks and our steak loving son who has had steak at the best and worst places said it was the best steak hes ever eaten 1 
i had to wait over 30 minutes to get my drink and longer to get 2 arepas 0 
the script is a big flawed mess 0 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
but this movie is definitely a below average rent 0 
the turkey and roast beef were bland 0 
the movie is not completely perfect but titta di girolamo will stay with you for a long time after the vision of the movie 1 
the film is way too long 0 
it has northern humour and positive about the community it represents 1 
it rocked my world and is certainly a must see for anyone with no social or physical outlets 1 
ive owned this phone for 7 months now and can say that its the best mobile phone ive had 1 
the food was outstanding and the prices were very reasonable 1 
if that bug never showed up i would have given a 4 for sure but on the other side of the wall where this bug was climbing was the kitchen 0 
the potatoes were great and so was the biscuit 1 
i was amazed at the quick arrival of the two original lg cell phone batteries and and at a fraction of the price 1 
arrived quickly and much less expensive than others being sold 1 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
unfortunately it will not recharge my iphone 4s despite connecting it from multiple power sources imac external battery wall outlet etc 0 
what a waste 0 
this pda rocks 1 
del taco is pretty nasty and should be avoided if possible 0 
the cast was great 1 
i will come back here every time im in vegas 1 
the design is very good4 1 
during several different 2 minute calls i experienced 5 drops and it was in an area that had 5 bars 0 
it is just the sort of pap that is screened in the afternoon to punish the unemployed for not having jobs 0 
her lines seem to have been written by a fifteen year old though they are trying oh so so hard to sound like how a fifteen year old would really um you know well talk 0 
the attention given to every character and complex psychological portrayals detailing loyalty treachery love and hope are tremendous 1 
also its slim enough to fit into my alarm clock docking station without removing the case 1 
i kept looking at the time and it had soon become 35 minutes yet still no food 0 
the last 15 minutes of movie are also not bad as well 1 
the fries were not hot and neither was my burger 0 
this is a good joint 1 
i did not bother contacting the company for few dollar product but i learned the lesson that i should not have bought this form online anyway 0 
the food is rich so order accordingly 1 
to my disbelief each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods i have ever tasted 0 
echo problemvery unsatisfactory 0 
ordered burger rare came in well done 0 
ive tried several different earpieces for my cell phone and this jabra one is the first one ive found that fits my ear comfortably 1 
whatever the producer was going for he missed entirely 0 
these are fabulous 1 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
things that went wrong they burned the saganaki 0 
the only good thing was that it fits comfortably on small ears 1 
everything was fresh and delicious 1 
i really like this product over the motorola because it is allot clearer on the ear piece and the mic 1 
how stupid is that 0 
i am going to have to be the first to negatively review this product 0 
this was my first and only vegas buffet and it did not disappoint 1 
poor talk time performance 0 
a good commentary of todays love and undoubtedly a film worth seeing 1 
very disappointed 0 
very dissapointing performance 0 
i took back my money and got outta there 0 
the lead man is charismafree 0 
soggy and not good 0 
it didnt charge for me 0 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
i probably wont be coming back here 0 
everyone is treated equally special 1 
very very sad 0 
the acting was decidely wooden though no worse than a period universal b movie 0 
hitchcock is a great director 1 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
ill give this film 10 out of 10 1 
this is truly an art movieit actually has a lot of art in it 1 
she carries the movie well 1 
50 down the drain 0 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
when my mom and i got home she immediately got sick and she only had a few bites of salad 0 
good case excellent value 1 
total letdown i would much rather just go to the camelback flower shop and cartel coffee 0 
i guess maybe we went on an off night but it was disgraceful 0 
the file browser offers all the options that one needshandsfree is great 1 
you share general loewenhielms exquisite joy in his partaking of the cailles en sarcophage even though you are just watching a movie but you do wish for just a small sample to savor 1 
good audio quality 1 
all i can do is whine on the internet so here it goesthe more i use the thing the less i like it 0 
this is infuriating 0 
internet is excrutiatingly slow 0 
at least think to refill my water before i struggle to wave you over for 10 minutes 0 
everything on the menu is terrific and we were also thrilled that they made amazing accommodations for our vegetarian daughter 1 
no plot whatsoever 0 
what makes this story different are the terrific production values faultless photography composition and editing the terrific casting the underappreciated brian keith playing a bully teddy and vivid history 1 
very disappointed in accessoryone 0 
what a mistake that was 0 
cinematography the film was shot in an interesting way 1 
item arrived quickly and works great with my metro pcs samsung schr450 slider phone and sony premium sound in ear plugs 1 
this fixes all the problems 1 
if she had not rolled the eyes we may have stayed not sure if we will go back and try it again 0 
i had ordered a motorola data cable got a very well finished and working product 1 
not recommended 0 
the bose noise cancelling is amazing which is very important for a nyc commuter 1 
both do good jobs and are quite amusing 1 
we thought youd have to venture further away to get good sushi but this place really hit the spot that night 1 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
i enjoyed reading this book to my children when they were little 1 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
you wont forget this movie 1 
thank you for such great service 1 
excellent starter wireless headset 0 
a truly truly bad film 0 
fantastic food 1 
i love it 1 
they could be used as exemplars for any set designer 1 
this allows the possibility of double booking for the same date and time after the first 0 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
unfortunately any virtue in this films production work was lost on a regrettable script 0 
there are so many problems i dont know where to start 0 
and generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode 0 
it will drive you barking mad 0 
its like a really sexy party in your mouth where youre outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party 1 
lastly the mozzarella sticks they were the best thing we ordered 1 
i enjoyed it 1 
if only someone involved with it knew how to string together narrative 0 
the malta settings are as dry and as barren as the dialogue 0 
well just if you keep thinking how bad it is 0 
cool phone 1 
i probably wont be coming back here 0 
it is so small and you dont even realize that it is there after a while of getting used to it 1 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
truly awful 0 
if there was ever an indication of a writer and a directors ability to meld two highly volatile temperaments into a seamless union of creativity then this is it 1 
they made this case too small and is very difficult to install 0 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
needless to say i wont be going back anytime soon 0 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
if you love authentic mexican food and want a whole bunch of interesting yet delicious meats to choose from you need to try this place 1 
food was delicious 1 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
i must say i have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again 1 
maybe there would be a reasonable explanation for this atrocity 0 
the chicken i got was definitely reheated and was only ok the wedges were cold and soggy 0 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
i wish i could return the unit and get back my money 0 
sorry i will not be getting food from here anytime soon 0 
the lead man is charismafree 0 
good product good seller 1 
i have bought this nokia cell phone a few weeks ago and it was a nightmare 0 
you also cannot take pictures with it in the case because the lense is covered 0 
food is way overpriced and portions are fucking small 0 
all in all a great disappointment 0 
the mic is great 1 
absolutel junk 0 
the flair bartenders are absolutely amazing 1 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
the menu had so much good stuff on it i could not decide 1 
crisp and clear 1 
i could not stand to even watch it for very long for fear of losing iq 0 
these are the central themes of the film and they are handled ineptly stereotypically and with no depth of imagination 0 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic 1 
it is unusable in a moving car at freeway speed 0 
if that bug never showed up i would have given a 4 for sure but on the other side of the wall where this bug was climbing was the kitchen 0 
what should have been a hilarious yummy christmas eve dinner to remember was the biggest fail of the entire trip for us 0 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
the service was not up to par either 0 
the acting was bad the dialogs were extremely shallow and insincere 0 
this convention never worked well in the past and certainly doesnt work here 0 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
there was hardly any meat 0 
took an hour to get our food only 4 tables in restaurant my food was luke warm our sever was running around like he was totally overwhelmed 0 
this phone works great 1 
wow what a bad film 0 
you get incredibly fresh fish prepared with care 1 
i bought this to use with my kindle fire and absolutely loved it 1 
i definitly recommend 1 
summary the witticisms werent witty 0 
as for the mains also uninspired 0 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
the memories are murky but i can only say that i enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show 1 
great price also 1 
the ambience is wonderful and there is music playing 1 
its the one movie that never ceases to interest me simply because it keeps me alert as i try to attempt to decipher its meanings 1 
their chow mein is so good 1 
i love all the features and form factor 1 
but in any case the best part is you can download these pictures to your laptop using ir or even send pictures from your laptop to the phone 1 
poor construction 0 
it probably would have been better if the director hadnt spent most of the movie showcasing his own art work which really isnt that noteworthy 0 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
i am far from a sushi connoisseur but i can definitely tell the difference between good food and bad food and this was certainly bad food 0 
avoid avoid avoid 0 
insults profound deuchebaggery and had to go outside for a smoke break while serving just to solidify it 0 
dont waste your on this one 0 
warning do not buy 0 
not good enough for the price 0 
it was clear that she had the range and ability to pull off this part 1 
you can even take self portraits with the outside exterior display very cool 1 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
great for ipods too 1 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
i dont think well be going back anytime soon 0 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
internet is excrutiatingly slow 0 
very funny 1 
it was a long time that i didnt see a so charismatic actor on screen 1 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
this phone works great 1 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
an absolute must visit 1 
if you havent gone here go now 1 
and there wasnt a single sour note struck actingwise either some surprisingly solid casting here 1 
the seller is very understanding and patient i would definitely buy from them again 1 
despite the pans of reviewers i liked this movie 1 
i like steiners because its dark and it feels like a bar 1 
the servers went back and forth several times not even so much as an are you being helped 0 
cant get the software to work with my computer 0 
also its a real treat to see anthony quinn playing crazy horse 1 
this is not moviemaking 0 
and the rest of it just sits there being awful with soldiers singing songs about the masculinity they pledge themselves to hairsplitting about purity the admiration of swords etc 0 
it is super charged up for use as a small hybrid palmtopcameracellphone and excels in those roles 1 
the building itself seems pretty neat the bathroom is pretty trippy but i wouldnt eat here again 0 
10 out of 10 for both the movie and trilogy 1 
if the food isnt bad enough for you then enjoy dealing with the worlds worstannoying drunk people 0 
even worse than ticker 0 
not good by any stretch of the imagination 0 
generally it just lacked imagination 0 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
dont waste your money and time 0 
barney is definitely super de duper 1 
new battery works great in phone 1 
the movie seemed a little slow at first 0 
in addition to having one of the most lovely songs ever written french cancan also boasts one of the cutest leading ladies ever to grace the screen 1 
my drink was never empty and he made some really great menu suggestions 1 
dont waste your money 0 
sauce was tasteless 0 
i like armand assante my cable companys summary sounded interesting so i watched it twice already and probably will again 1 
the scenes are often funny and occasionally touching as the characters evaluate their lives and where they are going 1 
i waited and waited 0 
a usable keyboard actually turns a pda into a realworld useful machine instead of just a neat gadget 1 
cooked to perfection and the service was impeccable 1 
it was a long time that i didnt see a so charismatic actor on screen 1 
very disappointed 0 
works as described 1 
our server was very nice and even though he looked a little overwhelmed with all of our needs he stayed professional and friendly until the end 1 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
dessert panna cotta was amazing 1 
graphics is far from the best part of the game 0 
this place is amazing 1 
fantastic food 1 
doesnt work at all i bougth it for my l7c and its not working 0 
it is zillion times away from reality 0 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
the feel of the dining room was more college cooking course than high class dining and the service was slow at best 0 
restaurant is always full but never a wait 1 
couldnt figure it out 0 
i just cant explain this movie more than romanticcharminghilariousand adorablethe junkyard scenes are funnyall the junkyard dogs have something specialtoo funny i laughedkids will love itbuy it when it comes outit has new features 1 
best of all is the rotating feature very helpful 1 
how stupid is that 0 
i am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this 1 
watching washing machine twirling around wouldnt hurt your eyes as much as this show 0 
im happy about this purchase good quality and low price 1 
everything was fresh and delicious 1 
avoid this one if you can 0 
customer service was terrible 0 
again no plot at all 0 
i struggle to find anything bad to say about it 1 
instead we got a bore fest about a whiny spoiled brat babysitting 0 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
great product 1 
i got to enjoy the seafood salad with a fabulous vinegrette 1 
this one works and was priced right 1 
her lines seem to have been written by a fifteen year old though they are trying oh so so hard to sound like how a fifteen year old would really um you know well talk 0 
when i opened the sandwich i was impressed but not in a good way 0 
reception is terrible and full of static 0 
elias koteasjack palance play good roles angelina is hot and gets nakedbilly drago appears in this and is cool as usual a cameo by sven ole thorsen helps make this a very enjoyable movie with good acting and a decent budget 1 
bland not a liking this place for a number of reasons and i dont want to waste time on bad reviewing ill leave it at that 0 
very disappointing 0 
worst hour and a half of my lifeoh my gosh 0 
great place to relax and have an awesome burger and beer 1 
service was good and the company was better 1 
not tasty and the texture was just nasty 0 
the kids are very cool too 1 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
very nice and relaxing late night viewing 1 
i never walked out of a movie faster 0 
10 out of 10 stars 1 
as for the mains also uninspired 0 
i highly recommend this movie for anyone interested in art poetry theater politics or japanese history 1 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
customer service was terrible 0 
an interesting premise and billy drago is always good as a dangerous nutbag side note id love to see drago stephen mchattie and lance hendrikson in a flick together talk about raging cheekbones 1 
this convention never worked well in the past and certainly doesnt work here 0 
it showed exactly how the government and the scientist argued for humanity and the reasons of the gadget 1 
disappointed 0 
its hard not to fall headoverheels in love with that girl 1 
i cant believe theres even a sequel to this 0 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
so far it has worked like a charm 1 
i enjoyed reading this book to my children when they were little 1 
nice leather 1 
this place is like chipotle but better 1 
an hour and a half i wish i could bring back 0 
a very good film indeed about great and unconditional love 1 
dont buy it 0 
i wasnt really impressed with strip steak 0 
never again will i be dining at this place 0 
now the pizza itself was good the peanut sauce was very tasty 1 
only had this a month but its worked flawlessly so far 1 
excellent performance 1 
if you stay in vegas you must get breakfast here at least once 1 
very happy with this product 1 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
now the pizza itself was good the peanut sauce was very tasty 1 
theres really nothing bad i can say about this headset 0 
i would advise to not purchase this item it never worked very well 0 
on the ground right next to our table was a large smeared beensteppedinandtrackedeverywhere pile of green bird poop 0 
the real disappointment was our waiter 0 
the story is beyond stupid 0 
its a long time since i was so entertained by a movie 1 
needless to say we will never be back here again 0 
in fact this stinker smells like a directtovideo release 0 
the jamaican mojitos are delicious 1 
took an hour to get our food only 4 tables in restaurant my food was luke warm our sever was running around like he was totally overwhelmed 0 
honeslty it didnt taste that fresh 0 
its worth driving up from tucson 1 
i particularly remember my senses being assaulted by strident cords of music that would blare out with very little warning and even less meaning 0 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
i would definitely recommend the jabra bt250v for those who are looking for comfort clarity and a great price 1 
restored my phone to like new performance 1 
but when someone strives for greatness and poetry but delivers a muddled and often ridiculous story a bunch of disparate scenes pretentious dialogue then you get the worst kind of a movie that some other reviewer very accurately defined as pretentious crap 0 
we started with the tuna sashimi which was brownish in color and obviously wasnt fresh 0 
never again will i be dining at this place 0 
their monster chicken fried steak and eggs is my all time favorite 1 
i was not happy with this item 0 
absolutely great 1 
aside from its terrible lead this film has loads of other debits 0 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
but the convoluted plot just didnt convince me and much of the film was watched with a weird questioning glance 0 
setup couldnt have been simpler 1 
it will drive you barking mad 0 
the plot was the same as pretty much every other cheap horror 0 
really awful 0 
finally after three or four times the spring of the latch broke and i could not use it any longer on the visor 0 
i mean really how do you get so famous for your fish and chips when its so terrible 0 
great movie 1 
watching washing machine twirling around wouldnt hurt your eyes as much as this show 0 
unfortunately the ability to actually know you are receiving a call is a rather important feature and this phone is pitiful in that respect 0 
battery has no life 0 
too bad cause i know its family owned i really wanted to like this place 0 
i exchanged the sony ericson z500a for this and im pretty happy with that decision 1 
artless camerawork endlessly presents us with the ugliest setting imaginable ie 0 
blue ant is easy to use 1 
almost all of the songs in cover girl are oldfashioned and not very tuneful 0 
i bought this battery with a coupon from amazon and im very happy with my purchase 1 
everyone is very attentive providing excellent customer service 1 
worst thai ever 0 
reception is terrible and full of static 0 
the staff is great the food is delish and they have an incredible beer selection 1 
overall a delight 1 
i loved it it was really scary 1 
otherwise dont even waste your time on this 0 
but i dont like it 0 
very poor service 0 
i saw mirrormask last night and it was an unsatisfactory experience 0 
not tasty and the texture was just nasty 0 
this short film certainly pulls no punches 0 
the bus boy on the other hand was so rude 0 
i love lane but ive never seen her in a movie this lousy 0 
bluetooth range is good a few days ago i left my phone in the trunk got a call and carried the conversation without a hitch 1 
these are certainly very comfortable and functionality is decent 1 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
the least said about the acting the better 0 
if this premise sound stupid thats because it is 0 
i cannot believe that the actors agreed to do this film 0 
nice case feels good in your hands 1 
it was forced like everything in this movie 0 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
all in all im quite satisfied with this purchase 1 
when my mom and i got home she immediately got sick and she only had a few bites of salad 0 
this item is fantastic and works perfectly 1 
the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach 0 
50 down the drain 0 
despite the pans of reviewers i liked this movie 1 
waste your money on this game 1 
this place deserves one star and 90 has to do with the food 0 
this place lacked style 0 
everything captain howdy says is either laughable or just plain stupid 0 
oh this is such a thing of beauty this restaurant 1 
the earpiece on this is too large or too heavyit keeps falling out of my ear 0 
oh yeah and the storyline was pathetic too 0 
a lot of websites have been rating this a very good phone and so do i 1 
each track commands sentiment actually contributing to the scenes and characters 1 
1010 1 
the attempts at humor were pitiful and story is so awful it dosent bear thinking about which basically involves a vulcan stealing the enterprise to find god seriously i just didnt care about any of this film and oh not to mention uhura does a belly dance to distract male guards 0 
otherwise easy to install and use clear sound 1 
so there is no way for me to plug it in here in the us unless i go by a converter 0 
dont buy this product 0 
this was a poor remake of my best friends wedding 0 
you can find better movies at youtube 0 
it is rare when a filmmaker takes the time to tell a worthy moral tale with care and love that doesnt fall into the trap of being overly syrupy or over indulgent 1 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
a pretty good product 1 
really ugly 0 
aside from its terrible lead this film has loads of other debits 0 
very good food great atmosphere1 1 
this fixes all the problems 1 
you get incredibly fresh fish prepared with care 1 
low quality 0 
no actress has been worse used that june allison in this movie 0 
having trouble with volume 0 
if it was to turn my good day feeling into a night of disturbing memories than i guess he succeeded 0 
schrader has made a resume full of lousy amateurish films 0 
the dialogue is composed of things that make little sense 0
