it finds my cell phone right away when i enter the car 1 
the foreigner is not worth one second of your time 0 
we asked for the bill to leave without eating and they didnt bring that either 0 
couldnt use the unit with sunglasses not good in texas 0 
also the phone doesnt seem to accept anything except cbr mp3s preferably ripped by windows media player 0 
the food was terrible 0 
2 times very bad customer service 0 
anyways the food was definitely not filling at all and for the price you pay you should expect more 0 
this is an extraordinary film 1 
we recently witnessed her poor quality of management towards other guests as well 0 
their frozen margaritas are way too sugary for my taste 0 
recommend with confidence 1 
the service was extremely slow 0 
i tried talking real loud but shouting on the telephone gets old and i was still told it wasnt great 0 
im not sure what he was trying to do with this film 0 
the service was terrible food was mediocre 0 
totally believable 1 
i let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this bad idea we both hated it 0 
a very very very slowmoving aimless movie about a distressed drifting young man 0 
def coming back to bowl next time 1 
not good when wearing a hat or sunglasses 0 
jawbone era is awesome too 1 
i saw mirrormask last night and it was an unsatisfactory experience 0 
from what my dinner companions told meeverything was very fresh with nice texture and taste 1 
very good food great atmosphere1 1 
this phone tries very hard to do everything but fails at its very ability to be a phone 0 
to call this movie a drama is ridiculous 0 
i had strawberry tea which was good 1 
food was so gooodd 1 
this case seems well made 1 
their rotating beers on tap is also a highlight of this place 1 
punishment park is a brilliant piece of cinema 1 
there was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters 0 
i guess i liked the details of his dysfunctionhe was believable 1 
it was so boring 0 
this is one of peter watkins most accessible films 1 
oh this is such a thing of beauty this restaurant 1 
dont buy this product 0 
if you have several dozen or several hundred contacts then imagine the fun of sending each of them one by one 0 
10 out of 10 stars 1 
the telephone repair man was really funny and his reactions to the nuts and bitchy boss were truly genuine 1 
this place is like chipotle but better 1 
itll be a regular stop on my trips to phoenix 1 
spend your money elsewhere 0 
delicious nyc bagels good selections of cream cheese real lox with capers even 1 
it makes very strange ticking noises before it ends the call 0 
all the other cases ive tried normally fall apart after a few months but this one seems to be in for the long haul 1 
a great touch 1 
food was really boring 0 
the movie is terribly boring in places 0 
this case seems well made 1 
how can anyone in their right mind ask for anything more from a movie than this 1 
never again will i be dining at this place 0 
the pairing of the two devices was so easy it barely took a couple minutes before i started making calls with the voice dialing feature 1 
personally i think it shows that people should learn to find a compromise them self without involving other people into issue 1 
probably never coming back and wouldnt recommend it 0 
i cant believe theres even a sequel to this 0 
its one of the movies i need to see whenever it comes on tvnever mind the fact that i already have it memorized 1 
a piece of junk that broke after being on my phone for 2 days 0 
in addition it feels amp looks as if the phone is all lightweight cheap plastic 0 
owners are really great people 1 
summary the witticisms werent witty 0 
dont go here 0 
o my gosh the best phone i have ever had 1 
bad reception 0 
it was a great phone 1 
the food wasnt good 0 
this is by far the worst purchase ive made on amazon 0 
i must say i have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again 1 
i love this cable it allows me to connect any miniusb device to my pc 1 
the two main characters may be two of the most believable children i ever saw put on screen 1 
awesome selection of beer 1 
this would not even be good as a made for tv flick 0 
low quality 0 
everything stinks 0 
good audio quality 1 
i got it because it was so small and adorable 1 
the seller is very understanding and patient i would definitely buy from them again 1 
i dont think it would hold it too securly on your belt 0 
i keep watching it over and over 1 
macbeth jason connery moved me to tears with his final monolog out brief candle outhe gave the sphere of moral decay and dark forces a human face which makes it the more interesting 1 
unfortunately the ability to actually know you are receiving a call is a rather important feature and this phone is pitiful in that respect 0 
frankly after cotton club and unfaithful it was kind of embarrassing to watch lane and gere in this film because it is bad 0 
things that went wrong they burned the saganaki 0 
but in any case the best part is you can download these pictures to your laptop using ir or even send pictures from your laptop to the phone 1 
everything from acting to cinematography was solid 1 
easy to use 1 
i didnt want the clip going over the top of my ear causing discomfort 0 
doesnt do the job 0 
everything about this movie is stupid 0 
in short dont bother with this movie 0 
watching washing machine twirling around wouldnt hurt your eyes as much as this show 0 
it has been a winner for us 1 
the characters are fleshed out surprisingly well particularly grimes and blake and all the actors deliver their sharply scripted lines with just the right amount of deadpan tongue in cheek to make the dialogue both hilarious and realistic 1 
1 long lasting battery you dont have to recharge it as frequentyly as some of the flip phones2 0 
omelets are to die for 1 
their rotating beers on tap is also a highlight of this place 1 
dont miss it 1 
my gyro was basically lettuce only 0 
in fact im going to round up to 4 stars just because she was so awesome 1 
the story unfolds in 18th century jutland and the use of period music played on period instruments is just one more fine touch 1 
you wont forget this movie 1 
the selection on the menu was great and so were the prices 1 
if you havent gone here go now 1 
although i very much liked the look and sound of this place the actual experience was a bit disappointing 0 
this is just a great movie 1 
all in all i can assure you ill be back 1 
i am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this 1 
it lasts less than 3o minutes if i actually try to use the phonemy wife has the same phone with the same problem 0 
its been my choice headset for yearsgreat sound good volume good noise cancellation 1 
we loved the place 1 
see it with your kids if you have a chanceit will open up some amazing dialog about how far race relations have come in the last 50 years 1 
better than expected 1 
what a waste of money and time 0 
the scallop dish is quite appalling for value as well 0 
good food good service 1 
pretty piece of junk 0 
this is infuriating 0 
as for the killer dont expect anything original or even remotely frightening 0 
despite how hard i rate businesses its actually rare for me to give a 1 star 0 
the acting was decidely wooden though no worse than a period universal b movie 0 
then a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use 0 
the chains which im no fan of beat this place easily 0 
i get absolutely horrible reception in my apartment where with other phones i have not had this problem 0 
theres barely a boring moment in the film and there are plenty of humorous parts 1 
it wasnt busy either also the building was freezing cold 0 
it ranks highly as a great noircrimedrama incredible performances by belmondo and lino ventura 1 
well never go again 0 
its a piece of crap 0 
this is a witty and delightful adaptation of the dr seuss book brilliantly animated by upas finest and thoroughly deserving of its academy award 1 
will not be back 0 
in fact i liked it better than interview with a vampire and i liked this lestat stuart townsend better than cruises attempt 1 
with great sound effects and impressive special effects i cant recommend this movie enough 1 
i love being able to use one headset for both by landline and cell 1 
food quality has been horrible 0 
i love this cable it allows me to connect any miniusb device to my pc 1 
i bought two of them and neither will charge 0 
linksys should have some way to exchange a bad phone for a refurb unit or something 0 
i highly recommend this device to everyone 1 
the food was great as always compliments to the chef 1 
best of all is the rotating feature very helpful 1 
the acting sucks the music sucks the script sucks the pacing sucks the special fx suck the directing sucks basically this movie sucks 0 
the new characters werent all that memorable and i found myself forgetting who was who 0 
the servers went back and forth several times not even so much as an are you being helped 0 
and i just love the colors 1 
low quality 0 
full of unconvincing cardboard characters it is blandly written by edward chodorov who also produced and is surprisingly directed by jean negulesco from whom one would expect a great deal more 0 
there is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again 0 
this hole in the wall has great mexican street tacos and friendly staff 1 
macbeth jason connery moved me to tears with his final monolog out brief candle outhe gave the sphere of moral decay and dark forces a human face which makes it the more interesting 1 
very disappointing 0 
food is way overpriced and portions are fucking small 0 
at a time when it seems that film animation has been dominated by disneypixars cgi masterpieces it is both refreshing and comforting to know that miyazaki is still relying on traditional handdrawn animation to tell his charming and enchanting stories 1 
restaurant is always full but never a wait 1 
better than expected 1 
it fits my ear well and is comfortable on 1 
the casting is also horrible cause all you see is a really really bad actors period 0 
voice quality signal strength dropped calls 0 
i give it 2 thumbs down 0 
i will come back here every time im in vegas 1 
the attention given to every character and complex psychological portrayals detailing loyalty treachery love and hope are tremendous 1 
so dont go there if you are looking for good food 0 
its worth driving up from tucson 1 
i know this is not like the other restaurants at all something is very off here 0 
i dont recommend unless your car breaks down in front of it and you are starving 0 
my fiancé and i came in the middle of the day and we were greeted and seated right away 1 
artless camerawork endlessly presents us with the ugliest setting imaginable ie 0 
i seriously cannot believe that the owner has so many unexperienced employees that all are running around like chickens with their heads cut off 0 
this item is fantastic and works perfectly 1 
my experience was terrible this was my fourth bluetooth headset and while it was much more comfortable than my last jabra which i hated 0 
in the summer you can dine in a charming outdoor patio so very delightful 1 
ive had no trouble accessing the internet downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions 1 
no actress has been worse used that june allison in this movie 0 
the memories are murky but i can only say that i enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show 1 
useless phone simply deaf 0 
otherwise easy to install and use clear sound 1 
the phone is sturdy and waterproof 1 
i especially liked the noncliche choices with the parents in other movies i could predict the dialog verbatim but the writing in this movie made better selections 1 
the plastic breaks really easy on this clip 0 
i would not recommend this place 0 
but what really made it unwatchable was the direction 0 
yes i am simplifying things here for the sake of brevity for this really is at the core of the problems with this film it has too much going on without any real fulfilling explanation 0 
the best example of how dumb the writing is when its established that you can turn the zombiestudents back into humans by removing a necklace containing a piece of the meteorite 0 
none of them are engaging or exciting 0 
so anyone near you will hear part of your conversation 0 
i can think of no other film where something vitally important occurs every other minute 1 
this movie is also revealing 1 
some applause should be given to the prelude however 1 
but the duet between the astronaut and his doctor at the beginning of the movie is a perfect exchange if one considers that this movie was made well into the cold war and the astronauts biggest fear is that he has crashed in the ussr 1 
just really good so far probably the best bt headset i have ever had 1 
the worst was the salmon sashimi 0 
some great music and terrific scenery 1 
not loud enough and doesnt turn on like it should 0 
what did bother me was the slow service 0 
if it was to turn my good day feeling into a night of disturbing memories than i guess he succeeded 0 
im not sure what he was trying to do with this film 0 
its so bad its actually worth seeing just for that reason 0 
then as if i hadnt wasted enough of my life there they poured salt in the wound by drawing out the time it took to bring the check 0 
i love my 350 headset my jabra350 bluetooth headset is great the reception is very good and the ear piece is a comfortable fit 1 
it was a great phone 1 
the bt headset was such a disapoinment 0 
excellent performance 1 
the handsfree part works fine but then the car tries to download the address book and the treo rebootsoverall i still rate this device high 1 
i got this phone on reccomendation from a relative and im glad i did 1 
the sangria was about half of a glass wine full and was 12 ridiculous 0 
dont make the same mistake that i did and please dont buy this phone 0 
the plot doesnt hang together at all and the acting is absolutely appalling 0 
and there wasnt a single sour note struck actingwise either some surprisingly solid casting here 1 
bluetooth does not work phone locks up screens just flash up and now it just makes calls randomly while in my pocket locked 0 
also if your phone is dropped this case is not going to save it specially when dropped face down 0 
the fries were not hot and neither was my burger 0 
id advise anyone to go and see it 1 
the plot is nonsense that doesnt interest in the slightest way or have any uniqueness to it 0 
the characters are interesting even if a bit predictable 1 
i think not again 0 
you wont forget this movie 1 
the hockey scenes are terrible defensemen playing like theyre 5 years old goalies diving at shots that are 10 feet wide of the net etc 0 
frankly after cotton club and unfaithful it was kind of embarrassing to watch lane and gere in this film because it is bad 0 
the range is very decent ive been able to roam around my house with the phone in the living room with no receptionsound quality issues 1 
the cast of veteran actors are more than just a nostalgia trip 1 
great product and price 1 
i cant believe theres even a sequel to this 0 
not a weekly haunt but definitely a place to come back to every once in a while 1 
i just wanted to leave 0 
all in all ha long bay was a bit of a flop 0 
the first thing that happened was that the tracking was off 0 
phone falls out easily 0 
dont go here 0 
the jabra eargels fit my ears very well 1 
i will never forget it now 1 
the shrimp tender and moist 1 
not recommended 0 
this is an outstanding little restaurant with some of the best food i have ever tasted 1 
as i said abovepretty useless 0 
the service was terrible though 0 
definitely not worth the 3 i paid 0 
the script is was there a script 0 
i highly recommend this movie for anyone interested in art poetry theater politics or japanese history 1 
battery is terrible 0 
i cant use this case because the smell is disgusting 0 
saw the movie today and thought it was a good effort good messages for kids 1 
im surprised this is a good quality car charger and theres not much reviews about it 1 
the earpiece on this is too large or too heavyit keeps falling out of my ear 0 
i cant use this case because the smell is disgusting 0 
best fish ive ever had in my life 1 
it showed exactly how the government and the scientist argued for humanity and the reasons of the gadget 1 
people who like european films and art movies will like this movie 1 
an amazing finale to possibly the best trilogy of all time 1 
honeslty it didnt taste that fresh 0 
the potato chip order was sad i could probably count how many chips were in that box and it was probably around 12 0 
the concert sequences just sucked 0 
it was not good 0 
the phone gets extremely hot 0 
awesome device 1 
a usable keyboard actually turns a pda into a realworld useful machine instead of just a neat gadget 1 
my salad had a bland vinegrette on the baby greens and hearts of palm 0 
the puppets look really cheesy not in a good way like in the puppet master 80s flicks 0 
its a piece of crap 0 
great phone 1 
third the cheese on my friends burger was cold 0 
tom wilkinson broke my heart at the end and everyone elses judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike 1 
everything from acting to cinematography was solid 1 
the service was a bit lacking 0 
he came running after us when he realized my husband had left his sunglasses on the table 1 
what a mistake 0 
setup couldnt have been simpler 1 
i always order from the vegetarian menu during dinner which has a wide array of options to choose from 1 
its reception is very very poor 0 
i am very happy 1 
1 hour 54 minutes of sheer tedium melodrama and horrible acting a mess of a script and a sinking feeling of good lord what were they thinking 0 
judith light is one of my favorite actresses and i think she does a superb job in this film 1 
come hungry leave happy and stuffed 1 
the staff is always super friendly and helpful which is especially cool when you bring two small boys and a baby 1 
great phone 1 
we waited for thirty minutes to be seated although there were 8 vacant tables and we were the only folks waiting 0 
unfortunately any virtue in this films production work was lost on a regrettable script 0 
then our food came out disappointment ensued 0 
this is one of the best italian thrillers of the early 70s 1 
both films are terrible but to the credit of the 1986 version it was watchable 0 
the headsets are easy to use and everyone loves them 1 
item does not match picture 0 
you also cannot take pictures with it in the case because the lense is covered 0 
for the price this was a great deal 1 
dont waste your money 0 
avoid this establishment 0 
the plot doesnt hang together at all and the acting is absolutely appalling 0 
poor reliability 0 
excellent bluetooth headset 1 
we wont be returning 0 
i just saw this film and i recommend it 1 
attempting artiness with black white and clever camera angles the movie disappointed became even more ridiculous as the acting was poor and the plot and lines almost nonexistent 0 
i had absolutely no problem with this headset linking to my 8530 blackberry curve 1 
excellent bluetooth headset 1 
awsome device works great 1 
this is the place where i first had pho and it was amazing 1 
there was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters 0 
im using it with an iriver spinn with case and it fits fine 1 
anne heche was utterly convincing 1 
the chips and salsa were really good the salsa was very fresh 1 
so good i am going to have to review this place twice once hereas a tribute to the place and once as a tribute to an event held here last night 1 
to my disbelief each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods i have ever tasted 0 
also its a real treat to see anthony quinn playing crazy horse 1 
the results well are a shame 0 
saw the movie today and thought it was a good effort good messages for kids 1 
nice headphones for the price and they work great 1 
krussel always good 1 
also its a real treat to see anthony quinn playing crazy horse 1 
it is super charged up for use as a small hybrid palmtopcameracellphone and excels in those roles 1 
small sleek impressive looking practical setup with ample storage in place 1 
initially the local sites in the film which was filmed here in buffalo intrigued me 1 
the incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film 1 
i believe that pitch black was done well 1 
i have bought this nokia cell phone a few weeks ago and it was a nightmare 0 
design flaw 0 
but if you liked movies like the matrix and better yet their sequels i think youll appreciate the thought provoking mindblowing experience this film will give you 1 
i had the mac salad and it was pretty bland so i will not be getting that again 0 
integrated seamlessly with the motorola razr phone 1 
poor voice clarity 0 
its aggravating 0 
this place is good 1 
the waitress was friendly and happy to accomodate for veganveggie options 1 
the best place to go for a tasty bowl of pho 1 
the instructions didnt explain that a microphone jack could be used 0 
it is easy to turn on and off when you are in the car and the volume controls are quite accessable 1 
it had some average acting from the main person and it was a low budget as you clearly can see 0 
your servers suck wait correction our server heimer sucked 0 
phone now holds charge like it did when it was new 1 
the veggitarian platter is out of this world 1 
damn good steak 1 
the food was very good 1 
my ribeye steak was cooked perfectly and had great mesquite flavor 1 
saw the movie today and thought it was a good effort good messages for kids 1 
i probably wont be coming back here 0 
one of the worst shows of all time 0 
a truly truly bad film 0 
even in my bmw 3 series which is fairly quiet i have trouble hearing what the other person is saying 0 
they have a really nice atmosphere 1 
i received my orders well within the shipping timeframe everything was in good working order and overall i am very excited to have this source 1 
stay away from this store be careful 0 
cooked to perfection and the service was impeccable 1 
it was a waste of my money 0 
food quality has been horrible 0 
definitely worth checking out 1 
i understand that its supposed to be a cheap popcorn comedy but that doesnt mean that it has to completely insult our intelligence and have writing so incredibly hackneyed that it borders on offensive 0 
i had a salad with the wings and some ice cream for dessert and left feeling quite satisfied 1 
i hate to disagree with my fellow yelpers but my husband and i were so disappointed with this place 0 
this film highlights the fundamental flaws of the legal process that its not about discovering guilt or innocence but rather is about who presents better in court 1 
bad choice 0 
good works fine 1 
ive also had problems with the phone reading the memory card in which i always turn it on and then off again 0 
my phone doesnt slide around my car now and the grip prevents my phone from slipping out of my hand 1 
not what i wanted 0 
the chips that came out were dripping with grease and mostly not edible 0 
this was one of the worst films i have ever seen 0 
i am very happy 1 
the burger had absolutely no flavor the meat itself was totally bland the burger was overcooked and there was no charcoal flavor 0 
i keep watching it over and over 1 
a piece of cinematic garbage captured on celluloid 0 
definitely worth checking out 1 
you wont forget this movie 1 
the story is also both funny and poignant at times 1 
being a 90s child i truly enjoyed this show and i can proudly say that i enjoyed it big time and even more than the classical wb cartoons 1 
the soundtrack wasnt terrible either 1 
the basic premise is wasted since it is sidelined by the inexplicable focus on the documentary crew 0 
my rating just 3 out of 10 0 
ive bought 5 wired headphones that sound better than these 0 
if you stay in vegas you must get breakfast here at least once 1 
i am so tired of clichés that is just lazy writing and here they come in thick and fast 0 
blue ant is easy to use 1 
we had a group of 70 when we claimed we would only have 40 and they handled us beautifully 1 
your staff spends more time talking to themselves than me 0 
excellent performance 1 
by the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant i was bored and didnt care what happened next and so i switched off 0 
im surprised this is a good quality car charger and theres not much reviews about it 1 
overall i would recommend this phone over the new walkman 1 
not impressed 0 
overall i wasnt very impressed with noca 0 
alexander nevsky is a great film 1 
this review is long overdue since i consider a tale of two sisters to be the single greatest film ever made 1 
i hope this place sticks around 1 
bt50 battery junk 0 
from here on the widmark character turns unintentionally comical 0 
he deserves 5 stars 1 
item does not match picture 0 
wont go back 0 
i love all the features and form factor 1 
everyone is very attentive providing excellent customer service 1 
it looses connection to the phone even when it is within a couple feet between the two 0 
i wasnt really impressed with strip steak 0 
echo problemvery unsatisfactory 0 
none of the three sizes they sent with the headset would stay in my ears 0 
the nano stated itmy son was dissapointed 0 
tried to go here for lunch and it was a madhouse 0 
seriously killer hot chai latte 1 
i cannot believe that the actors agreed to do this film 0 
if you simply want a small flip phone look elsewhere as the extra bells whistles are mediocre 0 
not good when wearing a hat or sunglasses 0 
you cant relate with them hell you barely can understand them 0 
also were served hot bread and butter and home made potato chips with bacon bits on topvery original and very good 1 
it really created a unique feeling though 1 
updatewent back for a second time and it was still just as amazing 1 
this place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver 0 
we ordered the duck rare and it was pink and tender on the inside with a nice char on the outside 1 
this is one of the best italian thrillers of the early 70s 1 
not good by any stretch of the imagination 0 
everything about this product is wrongfirst 0 
nice docking station for home or work 1 
first of all it doesnt wear well 0 
arrived quickly and much less expensive than others being sold 1 
i love this place 1 
the service was a little slow considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace 0 
nice ambiance 1 
the only consistent thread holding the series together were the amazing performances of leni parker and anita laselva as the two taelons in quiet idealogical conflict 0 
im so happy to be here 1 
these are the central themes of the film and they are handled ineptly stereotypically and with no depth of imagination 0 
it is rare when a filmmaker takes the time to tell a worthy moral tale with care and love that doesnt fall into the trap of being overly syrupy or over indulgent 1 
it really created a unique feeling though 1 
razr battery good buy 1 
just really good so far probably the best bt headset i have ever had 1 
wasted two hours 0 
food quality has been horrible 0 
does not work for listening to music with the cingular 8125 0 
keep up the good work amazon 1 
i know this is not like the other restaurants at all something is very off here 0 
then our food came out disappointment ensued 0 
i love this bluetooth 1 
the calls drop the phone comes on and off at will the screen goes black and the worst of all it stops ringing intermittently 0 
service was good and the company was better 1 
it is perfect for a sitdown family meal or get together with a few friends 1 
i had high hopes for this place since the burgers are cooked over a charcoal grill but unfortunately the taste fell flat way flat 0 
even allowing for poor production values for the time 1971 and the format some kind of miniseries this is baaaaaad 0 
this is definitely a cult classic well worth viewing and sharing with others 1 
the budget was evidently very limited 0 
he was very impressed when going from the original battery to the extended battery 1 
food was below average 0 
i let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this bad idea we both hated it 0 
some may say this buffet is pricey but i think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot 1 
but what really made it unwatchable was the direction 0 
it crackles with an unpredictable youthful energy but honestly i found it hard to follow and concentrate on it meanders so badly 0 
waste your money on this game 1 
if you are razr owneryou must have this 1 
oh the charger seems to work fine 1 
the best part about nurse betty is its unpredictability 1 
the 12 mega pixel camera being a part of a phone is reasonably good7 1 
in particular the relationship between the bakery assistant and the waitress just didnt work for me at all 0 
just really good so far probably the best bt headset i have ever had 1 
i also didnt like the on button it felt like it would crack with use 0 
i dressed up to be treated so rudely 0 
headset works great was packaged nicely to avoid any damage 1 
the jerky camera movements were also annoying 0 
great phone 1 
call me a nut but i think this is one of the best movies ever 1 
this place is like chipotle but better 1 
design flaw 0 
service was fantastic 1 
dont waste your money 0 
oh this is such a thing of beauty this restaurant 1 
nice case feels good in your hands 1 
i got to enjoy the seafood salad with a fabulous vinegrette 1 
i love this place 1 
my only complaint is the standard sound volume is a little low even when turned up to 5of 5 0 
this place is handsdown one of the best places to eat in the phoenix metro area 1 
this is a great deal 1 
i know he was a contract player with little control over his scripts but the acting was as bad as the script 0 
the story which was told so eloquently by francis ford coppola 25 years earlier really unfolds gradually and leaves room for the characters to develop 1 
i rate this movie 910 1 
i bought this to use with my kindle fire and absolutely loved it 1 
the pizza selections are good 1 
these are the central themes of the film and they are handled ineptly stereotypically and with no depth of imagination 0 
the price is reasonable and the service is great 1 
product was excellent and works better than the verizon one and boy was it cheaper 1 
cumbersome design 0 
highly recommended for all ages although the younger set will probably not appreciate some of the more subtle references they will certainly appreciate one galley scene in particular 1 
not good by any stretch of the imagination 0 
these are fabulous 1 
the plot simply rumbles on like a machine desperately depending on the addition of new scenes 0 
the performances are not improved by improvisation because the actors now have twice as much to worry about not only whether theyre delivering the line well but whether the line itself is any good 0 
it was a drive to get there 0 
the transfers are very good 1 
its a shame to see good actors like thomerson and james make a living in a mess like this 0 
i dont think you will be disappointed 1 
the chicken i got was definitely reheated and was only ok the wedges were cold and soggy 0 
we had so much to say about the place before we walked in that he expected it to be amazing but was quickly disappointed 0 
hackneyed writing certainly but made even worse by the bad directing 0 
camerawork again bad 0 
maybe its just their vegetarian fare but ive been twice and i thought it was average at best 0 
comes with a strong light that you can use to light up your camera shots and even flash sos signals seriously 1 
the plot simply rumbles on like a machine desperately depending on the addition of new scenes 0 
the dining space is tiny but elegantly decorated and comfortable 1 
fast service 1 
im not sure what he was trying to do with this film 0 
i saw mirrormask last night and it was an unsatisfactory experience 0 
this blueant supertooth handsfree phone speaker is awesome 1 
reasonably priced also 1 
oh yeah and the storyline was pathetic too 0 
defective crap 0 
however i needed some better instructions 0 
i also didnt like the on button it felt like it would crack with use 0 
the soundtrack wasnt terrible either 1 
i love this device 1 
it was so boring 0 
the film has an ultracheap look to it 0 
doesnt last long 0 
there is so much good food in vegas that i feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to rice and company 0 
nice case feels good in your hands 1 
i would recommend this 1 
we wont be going back 0 
its kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly its embarrassing how childlike the company is 0 
whatever prompted such a documentary is beyond me 0 
perabo has a nice energy level and is obviously very comfortable in front of a camera 1 
it is a joy to use 1 
so just beware 0 
bad reception 0 
ill put this gem up against any movie in terms of screenplay cinematography acting postproduction editing directing or any other aspect of filmmaking 1 
very prompt service 1 
this product had a strong rubberpetroleum smell that was unbearable after a while and caused me to return it 0 
in conclusion i will not bother with this movie because a volcano in los angeles is nothing but nonsense 0 
the art style has the appearance of crayonpencil drawings and is wonderfully colorful and fanciful 1 
motorola finally got the voice quality of a bluetooth headset right 1 
the whole experience was underwhelming and i think well just go to ninja sushi next time 0 
waited and waited and waited 0 
ambience is perfect 1 
it also took her forever to bring us the check when we asked for it 0 
nice leather 1 
emily watsons character is very strong and she has only to give a quick glance and you understand everything 1 
nice case feels good in your hands 1 
what a mistake that was 0 
not much seafood and like 5 strings of pasta at the bottom 0 
well just if you keep thinking how bad it is 0 
this place was such a nice surprise 1 
it is well made easy to access the phone and has a handy detachable belt clip 1 
a piece of junk that broke after being on my phone for 2 days 0 
clear skype calls long battery life long range 1 
the potatoes were like rubber and you could tell they had been made up ahead of time being kept under a warmer 0 
improper description i had to return it 0 
but above all the exquisite visual composition of each moment with inventive and elegant use of closeup camera angle and lighting including pointillistic faux home movie footage is a wonder and joy to behold 1 
come hungry leave happy and stuffed 1 
would recommend this item 1 
the company shipped my product very promptly and it works well 1 
better than expected 1 
this may be the only bad film he ever made 0 
i particularly remember my senses being assaulted by strident cords of music that would blare out with very little warning and even less meaning 0 
we enjoy their pizza and brunch 1 
not to mention the combination of pears almonds and bacon is a big winner 1 
it is unusable in a moving car at freeway speed 0 
in fact im going to round up to 4 stars just because she was so awesome 1 
leopard print is wonderfully wild 1 
we have tried 2 units and they both failed within 2 months pros 0 
dont go here 0 
the movie has almost no action scenes in it and very little comedy 0 
what a waste 0 
the han nan chicken was also very tasty 1 
this frog phone charm is adorable and very eye catching 1 
but even the talented carrell cant save this 0 
it showed exactly how the government and the scientist argued for humanity and the reasons of the gadget 1 
there is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again 0 
it features an outlandish array of memorable psychotic but lovable nuts 1 
same evening him and i are both drastically sick 0 
it was a long time that i didnt see a so charismatic actor on screen 1 
reaching for the bottom row is uncomfortable and the send and end keys are not where i expect them to be3 0 
these are the central themes of the film and they are handled ineptly stereotypically and with no depth of imagination 0 
i swung in to give them a try but was deeply disappointed 0 
the food came out at a good pace 1 
i advise you to look out for it 1 
and the red curry had so much bamboo shoots and wasnt very tasty to me 0 
even when the women finally show up there is no sign of improvement the most expected things happen and by the time the film is over you might be far asleep 0 
and the sound quality is great 1 
great character actors telly savalas and peter boyle 1 
the steak was amazingrge fillet relleno was the best seafood plate i have ever had 1 
the staff are great the ambiance is great 1 
poor voice clarity 0 
nothing short of magnificent photographycinematography in this film 1 
ive had better not only from dedicated boba tea spots but even from jenni pho 0 
its really easy 1 
the movie lacks visual interest drama expression of feeling and celebration of the very patriotism that underlines the narrative 0 
there was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth but it didnt really work into the rest of the plot 0 
just dont know why they were so slow 0 
my friend loved the salmon tartar 1 
you wont forget this movie 1 
excellent product for the price 1 
it is easy to turn on and off when you are in the car and the volume controls are quite accessable 1 
left very frustrated 0 
the shipping time was also very quick 1 
as a courtroom drama its compelling as an indictment on the american justice system its frightening 1 
all in all a great disappointment 0 
that was funny 1 
krussel always good 1 
it was so funny 1 
he cant act one of the least scary villains i have ever seen he cant write did he write this damn movie in his sleep 0 
i promise they wont disappoint 1 
comfort for our whole family 1 
this is a disgrace 0 
the atmosphere is modern and hip while maintaining a touch of coziness 1 
internet is excrutiatingly slow 0 
fast service 1 
chinese forgeries abound 0 
its not user friendly 0 
this case has passed the one year mark and while it shows signs of wear it is 100 functional 1 
we wont be going back 0 
think it over when you plan to own this onethis sure is the last moto phone for me 0 
if you want a real scare rent this one 1 
rating 010 grade z note the show is so bad that even mother of the cast pull her daughter out of the show 0 
good beer drink selection and good food selection 1 
its a little geeky but i think thats its sex on toast and it rocks and oozes sex right down to its battery embedded sleek stylish leather case 1 
the bose noise cancelling is amazing which is very important for a nyc commuter 1 
the worst phone ive ever had only had it for a few months 0 
the speaker is of low quality so as making the ring tones sound very cheap 0 
the ambiance was incredible 1 
the sweet potato tots were good but the onion rings were perfection or as close as i have had 1 
imdb ratings only go as low 1 for awful its time to get some negative numbers in there for cases such as these 0 
this place was such a nice surprise 1 
blue ant is easy to use 1 
the worst phone ive ever had only had it for a few months 0 
the service was poor and thats being nice 0 
this early film from future goremeister lucio fulci is a very good addition to the giallo subgenre 1 
a great touch 1 
nice design and quality 1 
the loudspeaker option is great the bumpers with the lights is very appealing 0 
great place to eat reminds me of the little mom and pop shops in the san francisco bay area 1 
i cant tell you how disappointed i was 0 
the food amazing 1 
def coming back to bowl next time 1 
they never brought a salad we asked for 0 
a truly truly bad film 0 
delicious nyc bagels good selections of cream cheese real lox with capers even 1 
i was disgusted because i was pretty sure that was human hair 0 
it is super charged up for use as a small hybrid palmtopcameracellphone and excels in those roles 1 
overall a delight 1 
the black eyed peas and sweet potatoes unreal 1 
i am not a filmmaker nor am i a director but i would hide my head in the sand if id spent whatever amount of money and time on this movie 0 
a cheap and cheerless heist movie with poor characterisation lots of underbite style stoic emoting think chow yun fat in a better tomorrow and some cheesy clichés thrown into an abandoned factory ready for a few poorly executed flying judo rolls a la john woo 0 
your servers suck wait correction our server heimer sucked 0 
i loved it it was really scary 1 
the writers were smack on and i think the best actors and actresses were a bonus to the showthese characters were so real 1 
the visual effects were awful 0 
glad i didnt pay to see it 0 
the speaker is of low quality so as making the ring tones sound very cheap 0 
but the service was beyond bad 0 
long whiny and pointless 0 
long whiny and pointless 0 
does not work for listening to music with the cingular 8125 0 
the nokia ca42 usb cable did not work with my phone 0 
we have gotten a lot of compliments on it 1 
you cant go wrong with any of the food here 1 
same evening him and i are both drastically sick 0 
it seems completely secure both holding on to my belt and keeping the iphone inside 1 
i consider this theft 0 
wont work right or atleast for me 0 
ive missed numerous calls because of this reason 0 
the sound quality for the device is unacceptableunless you are in a really quiet area you almost hear nothing 0
