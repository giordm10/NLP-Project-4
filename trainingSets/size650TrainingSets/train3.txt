we started with the tuna sashimi which was brownish in color and obviously wasnt fresh 0 
2 times very bad customer service 0 
it was attached to a gas station and that is rarely a good sign 0 
2 thumbs up to this seller 1 
there was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth but it didnt really work into the rest of the plot 0 
the wind and the lion is well written and superbly acted 1 
the film is well paced understated and one of the best courtroom documentaries ive seen 1 
the food came out at a good pace 1 
comfortable fit you need your headset to be comfortable for at least an hour at a time if not for an entire day 1 
yes its that bad 0 
you can find better movies at youtube 0 
nice blanket of moz over top but i feel like this was done to cover up the subpar food 1 
be sure to order dessert even if you need to pack it togo the tiramisu and cannoli are both to die for 1 
however the keypads are so tinny that i sometimes reach the wrong buttons 0 
the story line is just awful 0 
if you want healthy authentic or ethic food try this place 1 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
it crackles with an unpredictable youthful energy but honestly i found it hard to follow and concentrate on it meanders so badly 0 
i dont like this nokia either 0 
oh this is such a thing of beauty this restaurant 1 
im terribly disappointed that this film would receive so many awards and accolades especially when there are far more deserving works of film out there 0 
lately they have been extremely nice and helpful on the phone 1 
i felt insulted and disrespected how could you talk and judge another human being like that 0 
this one wants to surf on the small wave of space movies in 1998 deep impact and armageddon and this one fails everywhere 0 
this frog phone charm is adorable and very eye catching 1 
regardless the film fails on most levels 0 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
it didnt make me scared horrified or make me sympathetic towards the characters it was simply annoying 0 
cant get the software to work with my computer 0 
not good by any stretch of the imagination 0 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
very friendly staff 1 
this little device has transformed my organizational capability and made my life a whole lot easier 1 
watching washing machine twirling around wouldnt hurt your eyes as much as this show 0 
all in all id expected a better consumer experience from motorola 0 
this fixes all the problems 1 
this frog phone charm is adorable and very eye catching 1 
i exchanged the sony ericson z500a for this and im pretty happy with that decision 1 
it was a riot to see hugo weaving play a sexobsessed gay real estate salesman who uses his clients houses for his trysts with the flaming darren tom hollander 1 
i will not return 0 
after the first charge kept going dead after 12 minutes 0 
nothing short of magnificent photographycinematography in this film 1 
i also didnt like the on button it felt like it would crack with use 0 
a very very very slowmoving aimless movie about a distressed drifting young man 0 
does not fit 0 
excellent product 1 
20th century foxs road house 1948 is not only quite a silly noir but is an implausible unmitigated bore of a movie 0 
you can even take self portraits with the outside exterior display very cool 1 
a must study for anyone interested in the worst sins of industrial design 0 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
the presentation of the food was awful 0 
really ugly 0 
we enjoy their pizza and brunch 1 
the good cinematography also makes her and monica bellucci look very beautiful 1 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
i bought two of them and neither will charge 0 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
woa talk about awful 0 
it was horrible 0 
im in az all the time and now have my new spot 1 
this is infuriating 0 
we were promptly greeted and seated 1 
it dit not work most of the time with my nokia 5320 0 
to be honest with you this is unbelievable nonsense and very foolish 0 
by far the best cheesecurds we have ever had 1 
they have great dinners 1 
it has been a winner for us 1 
best breakfast buffet 1 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
to my disbelief each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods i have ever tasted 0 
you will leave the theater wanting to go out and dance under the stars 1 
the food wasnt good 0 
i totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is 1 
summary the witticisms werent witty 0 
hayao miyazakis latest and eighth film for studio ghibili gake no ue no ponyo ponyo on the cliff by the sea is a wonderfully fun and imaginative look at childhood 1 
the worst phone ive ever had only had it for a few months 0 
the cast of veteran actors are more than just a nostalgia trip 1 
warning do not buy 0 
adapter does not provide enough charging current 0 
from here on the widmark character turns unintentionally comical 0 
product is exactly as described 1 
this may be the only bad film he ever made 0 
bluetooth does not work phone locks up screens just flash up and now it just makes calls randomly while in my pocket locked 0 
everything about it is just bad 0 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
i was sitting in my vehicle with the cradle on my belt and the headset lost signal 0 
o my gosh the best phone i have ever had 1 
nice spicy and tender 1 
it crackles with an unpredictable youthful energy but honestly i found it hard to follow and concentrate on it meanders so badly 0 
seller shipped quickly and much cheaper than the competitors 1 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
this is essentially a communications tool that does not communicate 0 
muddy low quality sound and the casing around the wires insert was poorly super glued and slid off 0 
even the squibs look awful 0 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
damn good steak 1 
i was particularly pleased with the acting ability of dwight schultz 1 
the waitress was friendly and happy to accomodate for veganveggie options 1 
we thought youd have to venture further away to get good sushi but this place really hit the spot that night 1 
after 20 minutes wait i got a table 0 
very nice and relaxing late night viewing 1 
totally believable 1 
then i watched it again two sundays ago march 20th 2005 and i began to really enjoy it and this time i taped the entire thing 1 
that was nice 1 
the burrittos blah 0 
the characters were all funny and had the peculiarity of not having a true lead character 1 
no actress has been worse used that june allison in this movie 0 
this film has no redeeming features 0 
when im on this side of town this will definitely be a spot ill hit up again 1 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
the cg opening sequence in space looked like it could have been created on microsoft slideshow for gods sake 0 
i literally vomited while watching this film 0 
great product for the price 1 
not good enough for the price 0 
the ngage is still lacking in earbuds 0 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
10 out of 10 for both the movie and trilogy 1 
very disappointed 0 
if you havent choked in your own vomit by the end by all the cheap drama and worthless dialogue youve must have bored yourself to death with this waste of time 0 
ive had no trouble accessing the internet downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions 1 
i left the theater with a lilt in my step joy in my heart and hope for the human race 1 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
great phone 1 
waiter was a jerk 0 
really really good rice all the time 1 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
the only suspense i was feeling was the frustration at just how retarded the girls were 0 
there is really nothing for me at postinos hope your experience is better 0 
there are so many problems i dont know where to start 0 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
unfortunately this is a bad movie that is just plain bad 0 
yes i am simplifying things here for the sake of brevity for this really is at the core of the problems with this film it has too much going on without any real fulfilling explanation 0 
worst foodservice ive had in a while 0 
being a 90s child i truly enjoyed this show and i can proudly say that i enjoyed it big time and even more than the classical wb cartoons 1 
the cg opening sequence in space looked like it could have been created on microsoft slideshow for gods sake 0 
everything on the menu is terrific and we were also thrilled that they made amazing accommodations for our vegetarian daughter 1 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
this is by far the worst purchase ive made on amazon 0 
works fine 1 
bluetooth does not work phone locks up screens just flash up and now it just makes calls randomly while in my pocket locked 0 
go rent it 1 
definitely worth checking out 1 
do not buy if you want to use the holster 0 
i recently tried caballeros and i have been back every week since 1 
how can that bethe audio quality is poor 0 
its extremely slow and takes forever to do anything with it 0 
ray charles life provided excellent biographical material for the film which goes well beyond being just another movie about a musician 1 
their daily specials are always a hit with my group 1 
he is almost unbearable to watch on screen he has little to no charisma and terrible comedic timing 0 
this is an unbelievable bargain 1 
i definitly recommend 1 
spoilers whatever else can or cant be said about it surface is superbly crafted 1 
initially the local sites in the film which was filmed here in buffalo intrigued me 1 
great phone 1 
the only thing worse than taylors acting was stanwycks singing 0 
for a self proclaimed coffee cafe i was wildly disappointed 0 
while you dont yet hear mickey speak there are tons of sound effects and music throughout the filmsomething we take for granted now but which was a huge crowd pleaser in 1928 1 
the performances are not improved by improvisation because the actors now have twice as much to worry about not only whether theyre delivering the line well but whether the line itself is any good 0 
not good enough for the price 0 
an extensive menu provides lots of options for breakfast 1 
unfortunately it will not recharge my iphone 4s despite connecting it from multiple power sources imac external battery wall outlet etc 0 
not much seafood and like 5 strings of pasta at the bottom 0 
couldnt figure it out 0 
it is shameful 0 
worked very well paired with a treo 700w and as a skype headset on my pc using a usb bluetooth transceiver 1 
i would highly recommend this product 1 
top line dont waste your time and money on this one its as bad as it comes 0 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
the lead man is charismafree 0 
really pleased with this product so far 1 
the flair bartenders are absolutely amazing 1 
the story is lame not interesting and never really explains the sinister origins of the puppets 0 
i immediately said i wanted to talk to the manager but i did not want to talk to the guy who was doing shots of fireball behind the bar 0 
i mean really how do you get so famous for your fish and chips when its so terrible 0 
conclusion very filling meals 1 
service was fantastic 1 
damian is so talented and versatile in so many ways of writing and portraying different characters on screen 1 
the turkey and roast beef were bland 0 
excellent dualpurpose headset 1 
the chicken wings contained the driest chicken meat i have ever eaten 0 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
thats how id describe this painfully dreary timewaster of a film 0 
it has northern humour and positive about the community it represents 1 
if you check the directors filmography on this site you will see why this film didnt have a chance 0 
waiter was a jerk 0 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
this pair of headphones is the worst that i have ever had soundwise 0 
best breakfast buffet 1 
my only problem is i thought the actor playing the villain was a low rent michael ironside 0 
as a sushi lover avoid this place by all means 0 
i rather enjoyed it 1 
wow very spicy but delicious 1 
i came over from verizon because cingulair has nicer cell phones the first thing i noticed was the really bad service 0 
not worth it 0 
do not buy do not buyit sucks 0 
lets start with all the problemsthe acting especially from the lead professor was very very bad 0 
feelings thoughtsgabriels discomfort during the danceall these intangibles leap to life and come within the viewers grasp in hustons portrayal 1 
at a time when it seems that film animation has been dominated by disneypixars cgi masterpieces it is both refreshing and comforting to know that miyazaki is still relying on traditional handdrawn animation to tell his charming and enchanting stories 1 
im in az all the time and now have my new spot 1 
this is the place where i first had pho and it was amazing 1 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
this may be the only bad film he ever made 0 
there is nothing authentic about this place 0 
will definitely be back 1 
must have been an off night at this place 0 
product is useless since it does not have enough charging current to charge the 2 cellphones i was planning to use it with 0 
i left the theater with a lilt in my step joy in my heart and hope for the human race 1 
i love this place 1 
in fact i liked it better than interview with a vampire and i liked this lestat stuart townsend better than cruises attempt 1 
to those who find this movie intelligent or even masterful i can only say its your intelligence and your imagination you obviously used to try and make some sense of this pitiful attempt its in our human nature to try and make sense of things 0 
i highly recommend this modest priced cellular phone 1 
the roast beef sandwich tasted really good 1 
so for our enjoyment we get to see them run around play games and be dangerous 1 
it did not work in my cell phone plug i am very up set with the charger 0 
crostini that came with the salad was stale 0 
food was really boring 0 
tonight i had the elk filet specialand it sucked 0 
everything is appalling 0 
good food good service 1 
the file browser offers all the options that one needshandsfree is great 1 
better than youd expect 1 
the ambiance was incredible 1 
items stated as included from the description are not included 0 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
honeslty it didnt taste that fresh 0 
its so stupid to have to keep buying new chargers car chargers cradles headphones and car kits every time a new phone comes out 0 
very bad experience 0 
not a pleasant voyage of selfdiscovery 0 
the acting sucked 0 
oh and i forgot to also mention the weird color effect it has on your phone 0 
its one of the movies i need to see whenever it comes on tvnever mind the fact that i already have it memorized 1 
very cheap plastic creaks like an old wooden floor 0 
summary the witticisms werent witty 0 
it was either too cold not enough flavor or just bad 0 
it didnt charge for me 0 
it dit not work most of the time with my nokia 5320 0 
perfect for the ps3 1 
i was particularly pleased with the acting ability of dwight schultz 1 
he was terrible 0 
not good for the money 0 
not worth it 0 
ive only had my bluetooth for a few weeks but i really like it 1 
i wont be back 0 
well never go again 0 
warning stay away 0 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
go to place for gyros 1 
krussel always good 1 
everything about this film is simply incredible 1 
i would not recommend this place 0 
good audio quality 1 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
magical help 1 
do not buy if you want to use the holster 0 
steamboat willie is an amazingly important film to our cinema history 1 
their research and development division obviously knows what theyre doing 1 
mic doesnt work 0 
the servers are not pleasant to deal with and they dont always honor pizza hut coupons 0 
the server was very negligent of our needs and made us feel very unwelcome i would not suggest this place 0 
nice case feels good in your hands 1 
im in az all the time and now have my new spot 1 
audio quality is poor very poor 0 
it crackles with an unpredictable youthful energy but honestly i found it hard to follow and concentrate on it meanders so badly 0 
great product for the price 1 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
this particular model would not work with my motorola q smartphone 0 
i just wanted to leave 0 
juano hernandez an exceptional actor who played supporting roles in many films of the era is a proud black man who is accused of murdering a white man in the south 1 
great food and awesome service 1 
took an hour to get our food only 4 tables in restaurant my food was luke warm our sever was running around like he was totally overwhelmed 0 
the waitress and manager are so friendly 1 
and i just love the colors 1 
this review is long overdue since i consider a tale of two sisters to be the single greatest film ever made 1 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
worst customer service ever 0 
so i am here to warn youdo not rent this movie it is the dumbest thing you have never seen 0 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
but it wasnt until i watched this film that i realised how great he actually was 1 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
i work in the hospitality industry in paradise valley and have refrained from recommending cibo any longer 0 
it was too predictable even for a chick flick 0 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
what this film lacks is a convincing script 0 
its very slow 0 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
the poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying 0 
thanks again to amazon for having the things i need for a good price 1 
worked perfectly 1 
the acting is fantastic the stories are seamlessly woven together and the dogs are splendid a must rent view or see 1 
not tasty and the texture was just nasty 0 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
first off the reception sucks i have never had more than 2 bars ever 0 
i wish i could return the unit and get back my money 0 
great place fo take out or eat in 1 
the selection of food was not the best 0 
nice blanket of moz over top but i feel like this was done to cover up the subpar food 1 
the best electronics of the available fm transmitters 1 
i will not return 0 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
it did not work in my cell phone plug i am very up set with the charger 0 
highquality chicken on the chicken caesar salad 1 
and service was super friendly 1 
steamboat willie is an amazingly important film to our cinema history 1 
much more interesting more action more suspense and less of the unneeded controversy 1 
this one wants to surf on the small wave of space movies in 1998 deep impact and armageddon and this one fails everywhere 0 
bacon is hella salty 1 
the only good thing was our waiter he was very helpful and kept the bloddy marys coming 1 
all the bread is made inhouse 1 
my friend loved the salmon tartar 1 
best fish ive ever had in my life 1 
the folks at otto always make us feel so welcome and special 1 
the waitress was friendly and happy to accomodate for veganveggie options 1 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
it works 1 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
i dont think ive ever gone to a movie and disliked it as much 0 
weve have gotten a much better service from the pizza place next door than the services we received from this restaurant 0 
the characters are interesting and you really care for them 1 
a usable keyboard actually turns a pda into a realworld useful machine instead of just a neat gadget 1 
ive only had my bluetooth for a few weeks but i really like it 1 
so dont go there if you are looking for good food 0 
very very fun chef 1 
overall i like there food and the service 1 
to sum the film up breeders is a terrible cheaply made horror movie that should be avoided like the ebola virus 0 
great product for the price 1 
my gyro was basically lettuce only 0 
i didnt know pulled pork could be soooo delicious 1 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
i live in the neighborhood so i am disappointed i wont be back here because it is a convenient location 0 
the ri style calamari was a joke 0 
went for lunch service was slow 0 
this frog phone charm is adorable and very eye catching 1 
i was not impressed by this product 0 
this case has passed the one year mark and while it shows signs of wear it is 100 functional 1 
i am sorry i made this purchase 0 
the igo chargers and tips are really great 1 
judith light is one of my favorite actresses and i think she does a superb job in this film 1 
for a self proclaimed coffee cafe i was wildly disappointed 0 
the atmosphere is modern and hip while maintaining a touch of coziness 1 
the cinematographyif it can be called thatsucked 0 
2 thumbs up 1 
i do love sushi but i found kabuki to be overpriced overhip and underservices 0 
the food was delicious our bartender was attentive and personable and we got a great deal 1 
from here on the widmark character turns unintentionally comical 0 
i also decided not to send it back because our waitress looked like she was on the verge of having a heart attack 0 
i definitly recommend 1 
i have had tmobile service for 2 or 3 years now and i am pretty happy with it 1 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
the sangria was about half of a glass wine full and was 12 ridiculous 0 
it didnt make me scared horrified or make me sympathetic towards the characters it was simply annoying 0 
it was way over fried 0 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
helen baxendale is a very credible lady macbeth who can be very cheerfull at times and sometimes she just looks like a naughty girl but deadly in her taste for blood and evil 1 
the acting by the whole cast could be put on a scale and balanced perfectly between overacting and underacting 0 
everything was fresh and delicious 1 
disapointing results 0 
the ambience is wonderful and there is music playing 1 
headset works great was packaged nicely to avoid any damage 1 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
this is probably the most irritating show i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
editing the editing of this film was phenomenal in my opinion 1 
greatno problems at all 1 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
the folks at otto always make us feel so welcome and special 1 
and then tragedy struck 0 
phone falls out easily 0 
this product is clearly not ready for prime time i dont care how cool it looks if you cant tell a call is coming in its worthless 0 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
the camera really likes her in this movie 1 
sauce was tasteless 0 
the movie lacks visual interest drama expression of feeling and celebration of the very patriotism that underlines the narrative 0 
i cant wait to go back 1 
with great sound effects and impressive special effects i cant recommend this movie enough 1 
the macarons here are insanely good 1 
i dont think you will be disappointed 1 
it looks very nice 1 
great atmosphere friendly and fast service 1 
the color is even prettier than i thought it would be and the graphics are incredibly sharp 1 
obviously they have a terrible customer service so you get what you pay for 0 
great choice 1 
lightweight and works well 1 
it only recognizes the phone as its storage device 0 
everything about it is just bad 0 
gotta love those closeups of slimy drooling teeth 1 
it was pretty gross 0 
this is actually a very smart movie 1 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
the phone crashed completely and now i have to get it replaced 0 
level 5 spicy was perfect where spice didnt overwhelm the soup 1 
the food was delicious our bartender was attentive and personable and we got a great deal 1 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
also the story and acting were weak 0 
it makes very strange ticking noises before it ends the call 0 
if you havent choked in your own vomit by the end by all the cheap drama and worthless dialogue youve must have bored yourself to death with this waste of time 0 
i would recommend it 1 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
either way it sucks 0 
this place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver 0 
predictable but not a bad watch 1 
definitely will come back here again 1 
great phone 1 
unfortunately cover girl is an example of how hollywood used to exploit women for financial gain 0 
i promise they wont disappoint 1 
which is precisely why i am giving it such a bad review 0 
the art style has the appearance of crayonpencil drawings and is wonderfully colorful and fanciful 1 
dont go here 0 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
food was below average 0 
great phone 1 
i would recommend it 1 
having trouble with volume 0 
my mother and brother had to do thiswhen i saw robert ryan portraying this type of man it was a very good imitation of this type of individual and i was impressed 1 
there are so many problems i dont know where to start 0 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
i dont think ill be running back to carlys anytime soon for food 0 
the songs were the best and the muppets were so hilarious 1 
ive had this for nearly 2 years and it has worked great for me 1 
works good 1 
they are so cool 1 
so in a nutshell 1 the restaraunt smells like a combination of a dirty fish market and a sewer 0 
i think the most wonderful parts literally full of wonder are the excerpts from his works 1 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
i have seen many movies starring jaclyn smith but my god this was one of her best though it came out 12 years ago 1 
lastly the mozzarella sticks they were the best thing we ordered 1 
after one bite i was hooked 1 
this place is handsdown one of the best places to eat in the phoenix metro area 1 
i do think tom hanks is a good actor 1 
sorry i will not be getting food from here anytime soon 0 
none of them are engaging or exciting 0 
this is a disgrace 0 
food arrived quickly 1 
things that went wrong they burned the saganaki 0 
this is not moviemaking 0 
ive missed numerous calls because of this reason 0 
im not sure how long we stood there but it was long enough for me to begin to feel awkwardly out of place 0 
it is super charged up for use as a small hybrid palmtopcameracellphone and excels in those roles 1 
the battery life is highly unacceptable 0 
do not buy if you want to use the holster 0 
would not recommend to others 0 
it is indescribably the most annoying and idiotic show i have ever seen 0 
this is some seriously good pizza and im an expertconnisseur on the topic 1 
this one wants to surf on the small wave of space movies in 1998 deep impact and armageddon and this one fails everywhere 0 
damian is so talented and versatile in so many ways of writing and portraying different characters on screen 1 
service sucks 0 
tied to charger for conversations lasting more than 45 minutesmajor problems 0 
good case excellent value 1 
it was just too horrible 0 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
you wont be disappointed 1 
works great 1 
the headsets are easy to use and everyone loves them 1 
victor mclaglen was even bad and brian donlevy was almost unrecognizable 0 
things that went wrong they burned the saganaki 0 
i was very disappointed in the movie 0 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
the characters are interesting and you want to find out more about them the longer the movie goes on and i think people will be surprised by who does and doesnt make it 1 
not worth it 0 
also its slim enough to fit into my alarm clock docking station without removing the case 1 
there is really nothing for me at postinos hope your experience is better 0 
even allowing for poor production values for the time 1971 and the format some kind of miniseries this is baaaaaad 0 
works great 1 
if only someone involved with it knew how to string together narrative 0 
this place deserves no stars 0 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
great food and great service in a clean and friendly setting 1 
i was deeply impressed with the character he played 1 
id rather eat airline food seriously 0 
just dont know why they were so slow 0 
this is a great product sure beats using your fingers 1 
id like to return it 0 
im using it with an iriver spinn with case and it fits fine 1 
i always order from the vegetarian menu during dinner which has a wide array of options to choose from 1 
the sides are delish mixed mushrooms yukon gold puree white corn beateous 1 
very true to shakespear and a must for all shakespear fans 1 
however paul schrader has indeed made a film about mishima that is both superb complex 1 
while you dont yet hear mickey speak there are tons of sound effects and music throughout the filmsomething we take for granted now but which was a huge crowd pleaser in 1928 1 
also notable is john baileys fine crisp beautifully colored cinematography and the great production design costumes by eiko ishioka who went on to do the memorable costumes for coppolas dracula for which she received a well deserved oscar 1 
we started with the tuna sashimi which was brownish in color and obviously wasnt fresh 0 
i believe the screenwriter did a good job of tying up the loose ends 1 
a fantastic neighborhood gem 1 
i seriously cannot believe that the owner has so many unexperienced employees that all are running around like chickens with their heads cut off 0 
the film gives meaning to the phrase never in the history of human conflict has so much been owed by so many to so few 1 
case was more or less an extra that i originally put on but later discarded because it scratched my ear 0 
but it picked up speed and got right to the point 1 
even in my bmw 3 series which is fairly quiet i have trouble hearing what the other person is saying 0 
we waited an hour for what was a breakfast i could have done 100 times better at home 0 
worst customer service ever 0 
the best place in vegas for breakfast just check out a sat or sun 1 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
the aerial scenes were welldone 1 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
this little device has transformed my organizational capability and made my life a whole lot easier 1 
what a big waste of time 0 
over rated 0 
have been going since 2007 and every meal has been awesome 1 
i will continue to come here on ladies night andddd date night highly recommend this place to anyone who is in the area 1 
in conclusion i will not bother with this movie because a volcano in los angeles is nothing but nonsense 0 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
its too bad that everyone else involved didnt share crowes level of dedication to quality for if they did wed have a far better film on our hands than this subpar mess 0 
very true to shakespear and a must for all shakespear fans 1 
the nano stated itmy son was dissapointed 0 
you have to hold the phone at a particular angle for the other party to hear you clearly 0 
they have great dinners 1 
as for the service im a fan because its quick and youre being served by some nice folks 1 
lewis blacks considerable talent is wasted here too as he is at his most incendiary when he is unrestrained which the pg13 rating certainly wont allow 0 
very convenient since we were staying at the mgm 1 
after all the rave reviews i couldnt wait to eat herewhat a disappointment 0 
you get what you pay for i guess 0 
i wont say any more i dont like spoilers so i dont want to be one but i believe this film is worth your time 1 
i tried talking real loud but shouting on the telephone gets old and i was still told it wasnt great 0 
first off the reception sucks i have never had more than 2 bars ever 0 
yeah the movie pretty much sucked 0 
the food wasnt good 0 
the attempts at humor were pitiful and story is so awful it dosent bear thinking about which basically involves a vulcan stealing the enterprise to find god seriously i just didnt care about any of this film and oh not to mention uhura does a belly dance to distract male guards 0 
the cow tongue and cheek tacos are amazing 1 
a disappointment 0 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
now the pizza itself was good the peanut sauce was very tasty 1 
the best place in vegas for breakfast just check out a sat or sun 1 
the characters are interesting and you really care for them 1 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
the scenes are often funny and occasionally touching as the characters evaluate their lives and where they are going 1 
you will leave the theater wanting to go out and dance under the stars 1 
wonderful lil tapas and the ambience made me feel all warm and fuzzy inside 1 
there was no chemistry between ben affleck and sandra bullock in this film and i couldnt understand why he would consider even leaving his wifetobe for this chick that he supposedly was knocked out by 0 
if you want a sandwich just go to any firehouse 1 
works great 1 
this movie does an excellent job of revealing the complexity of the task and the incredible challenges facing south africa 1 
this is definitely one of the better documentaries i have seen looking at family relationships and marriage 1 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
id say that would be the hardest decision honestly all of ms dishes taste how they are supposed to taste amazing 1 
go and see it 1 
i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
they know how to make them here 1 
the croutons also taste homemade which is an extra plus 1 
worst foodservice ive had in a while 0 
too bad cause i know its family owned i really wanted to like this place 0 
if that bug never showed up i would have given a 4 for sure but on the other side of the wall where this bug was climbing was the kitchen 0 
i would definitely recommend the jabra bt250v for those who are looking for comfort clarity and a great price 1 
but now i was completely grossed out 0 
the films dialogue is natural real to life 1 
phone now holds charge like it did when it was new 1 
i felt insulted and disrespected how could you talk and judge another human being like that 0 
things happen characters personalities change plot twists occur for no real reason other than that script calls for it 0 
the best place in vegas for breakfast just check out a sat or sun 1 
the building itself seems pretty neat the bathroom is pretty trippy but i wouldnt eat here again 0 
the instruction manual is lacking 0 
great pork sandwich 1 
say bye bye to your tip lady 0 
yeah the movie pretty much sucked 0 
this is an extraordinary film 1 
very unreliable service from tmobile 0 
definitely worth checking out 1 
it works 1 
this is a great product sure beats using your fingers 1 
waiter was a jerk 0 
the food was excellent and service was very good 1 
product is useless since it does not have enough charging current to charge the 2 cellphones i was planning to use it with 0 
so they performed 1 
the casting is also horrible cause all you see is a really really bad actors period 0 
very good quality though 1 
verizon tech support walked my through a few procedures none of which worked and i ended up having to do a hard reset wiping out all my data 0 
it was a good thing that the tickets only cost five dollars because i would be mad if id have paid 750 to see this crap 0 
its very slow 0 
their steaks are 100 recommended 1 
you cant go wrong with any of the food here 1 
just dont know why they were so slow 0 
horrible phone 0 
piece of trash 0 
the food came out at a good pace 1 
i had verizon 2 years ago and really liked their service 1 
i kept catching the cable on the seat and i had to pull the phone out to turn it on an off 0 
once you get inside youll be impressed with the place 1 
one more thing i can tolerate political incorrectness very well im all for artistic freedom and suspension of disbelief but the slavic female character was just too much 0 
yet plantronincs continues to use the same flawed charger design 0 
useless phone simply deaf 0 
bt50 battery junk 0 
very happy with this product 1 
needless to say i wont be going back anytime soon 0 
one of the worst shows of all time 0 
very disappointing 0 
great phone 1 
they could serve it with just the vinaigrette and it may make for a better overall dish but it was still very good 1 
the buttons for on and off are bad 0 
shrimp when i unwrapped it i live only 12 a mile from brushfire it was literally ice cold 0 
disappointing experience 0 
good item low price 1 
hence the whole story lacks a certain energy 0 
the plastic breaks really easy on this clip 0 
i give it 2 thumbs down 0 
the macarons here are insanely good 1 
great phone 1 
this film and i use that word loosely is an insult to the moviegoing public 0 
keep up the good work amazon 1 
it worked very well 1 
i will not return 0 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
very windresistant 1 
i especially love the long battery life 1 
i really loved the story line and the poler bear was kinda cutebut if anyone has a question about fort steele just ask away 1 
ordered an appetizer and took 40 minutes and then the pizza another 10 minutes 0 
this is was due to the fact that it took 20 minutes to be acknowledged then another 35 minutes to get our foodand they kept forgetting things 0 
very disappointing 0 
in my house i was getting dropped coverage upstairs and no coverage in my basement 0 
there was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters 0 
the story which was told so eloquently by francis ford coppola 25 years earlier really unfolds gradually and leaves room for the characters to develop 1 
this is a stunning movie 1 
i knew when i saw the film that more great things were to come from this gifted actor 1 
i let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this bad idea we both hated it 0 
this was like the final blow 0 
with the originality and freshness of the first movie now spent this remake had little else to offer 0 
the cow tongue and cheek tacos are amazing 1 
shrimp when i unwrapped it i live only 12 a mile from brushfire it was literally ice cold 0 
this phone might well be the worst ive ever had in any brand 0 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
i keep watching it over and over 1 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
the only very disappointing thing was there was no speakerphone 0 
im so sorry but i really cant recommend it to anyone 0 
cooked to perfection and the service was impeccable 1 
the volume switch rocketed out of the unit to a destination unknown 0 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
the best phone in market 1 
i was totally fascinated by the music the dancing everything 1 
nice spicy and tender 1 
i was left shattered from the experience of watching this film and i took a good two hours to fully recover 0 
and the red curry had so much bamboo shoots and wasnt very tasty to me 0 
but storm trooper is not even bad enough to make it to the list of wonderfully terrible movies 0 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
on the good side the staff was genuinely pleasant and enthusiastic a real treat 1 
comes with a strong light that you can use to light up your camera shots and even flash sos signals seriously 1 
however i recently watched the whole thing again on dvd and i was completely struck by how extremely stupid the storyline was how it contained holes inconsistencies and frankly a whole lot of crap and how horrid the dancing was 0 
i find wasting food to be despicable but this just wasnt food 0 
pricing is a bit of a concern at mellow mushroom 0 
also if your phone is dropped this case is not going to save it specially when dropped face down 0 
my mother and brother had to do thiswhen i saw robert ryan portraying this type of man it was a very good imitation of this type of individual and i was impressed 1 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
but this movie is not funny considering the ridiculousness of it 0 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
it has been a winner for us 1
