im not sure what he was trying to do with this film 0 
ive dropped my phone more times than i can say even on concrete and my phone is still great knock on wood 1 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
the holster that arrived did not match the photo in the ad 0 
this totally unfunny movie is so over the top and pathetic and unrealistic that throughout the whole 90 minutes of utter torture i probably looked at my watch about 70000 times 0 
was not happy 0 
i love this place 1 
graphics is far from the best part of the game 0 
lately they have been extremely nice and helpful on the phone 1 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
the restaurant atmosphere was exquisite 1 
i received my supposedly new motorola 375 and apparently there was not a match between the phone and the charger 0 
some may say this buffet is pricey but i think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot 1 
the poor actors 0 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
cant upload ringtones from a third party 0 
it was not good 0 
of course the acting is blah 0 
at first i thought i was grtting a good deal at 744 until i plugged it into my phone v3c razr 0 
fits comfortably came with three sizes of earbud tips 1 
i thoroughly enjoyed it when christopher eccleston took control of the tardis and the continuation of the series 1 
i had verizon 2 years ago and really liked their service 1 
definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly will return next time im in vegas 1 
this is a chilly unremarkable movie about an author livingworking in a chilly abstruse culture 0 
highly entertaining at all angles 1 
to call this movie a drama is ridiculous 0 
i agree with jessica this movie is pretty bad 0 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
this is one of the worst sandra bullock movie since speed 2 but not quite that bad 0 
both do good jobs and are quite amusing 1 
the only good thing was our waiter he was very helpful and kept the bloddy marys coming 1 
i liked the patio and the service was outstanding 1 
i received my orders well within the shipping timeframe everything was in good working order and overall i am very excited to have this source 1 
verizon tech support walked my through a few procedures none of which worked and i ended up having to do a hard reset wiping out all my data 0 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
awsome device works great 1 
not as good as i had hoped 0 
how stupid is that 0 
worst service to boot but that is the least of their worries 0 
an awesome new look for fall 2000 1 
this is a disgrace 0 
dont buy this product it fails 0 
the films sole bright spot was jonah hill who will look almost unrecognizable to fans of the recent superbad due to the amount of weight he lost in the interim 1 
all in all i give this one a resounding 9 out of 10 1 
excellent product for the price 1 
highquality chicken on the chicken caesar salad 1 
i love the look and feel of samsung flipphones 1 
artless camerawork endlessly presents us with the ugliest setting imaginable ie 0 
plug was the wrong size 0 
they are so cool 1 
this is such a fun and funny movie 1 
but the premise of the film was so ridiculous that the president of the us 0 
on the negative its insipid enough to cause regret for another 2 hours of life wasted in front of the screen 0 
frozen pucks of disgust with some of the worst people behind the register 0 
how stupid is that 0 
would not reccommend 0 
crash is a depressing little nothing that provokes emotion but teaches you nothing if you already know racism and prejudice are bad things 0 
love this phone 1 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
will go back next trip out 1 
this is hands down the best phone ive ever had 1 
why was this film made 0 
it was a bit too sweet not really spicy enough and lacked flavor 0 
works like a charm it work the same as the one i got with the phone 1 
poor talk time performance 0 
i really loved the story line and the poler bear was kinda cutebut if anyone has a question about fort steele just ask away 1 
this phone is slim and light and the display is beautiful 1 
the worst phone from samsungcrap this crappy samsung e715 is the worst i have ever seeen 0 
do not make the same mistake as me 0 
however the ear pads come off easily and after only one week i lost one 0 
with the originality and freshness of the first movie now spent this remake had little else to offer 0 
saw the movie today and thought it was a good effort good messages for kids 1 
lifetime does not air it enough so if anyone knows what store sells it let me know because this is a musthave 1 
seafood was limited to boiled shrimp and crab legs but the crab legs definitely did not taste fresh 0 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
if you check the directors filmography on this site you will see why this film didnt have a chance 0 
we waited an hour for what was a breakfast i could have done 100 times better at home 0 
no real improvement 0 
omit watching this 0 
wont ever go here again 0 
the performances are real and gripping the crocdodile is extremely well done indeed if the black water website is to be believed thats because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous 1 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
i was seated immediately 1 
i understand that its supposed to be a cheap popcorn comedy but that doesnt mean that it has to completely insult our intelligence and have writing so incredibly hackneyed that it borders on offensive 0 
the problem was the script 0 
kris kristoffersen is good in this movie and really makes a difference 1 
it isnt even an achievement as a sobaditsgood or sobaditsmemorable movie 0 
horrible phone 0 
yeah the movie pretty much sucked 0 
will not be back 0 
oh the charger seems to work fine 1 
his performance is simply genius 1 
it quit working after id used it for about 18 months so i just purchased another one because this is the best headset ive ever owned 1 
nothing at all to recommend 0 
server did a great job handling our large rowdy table 1 
its a sad movie but very good 1 
do not make the same mistake as me 0 
prosgood camera very nice pictures also has cool styles like black and white and more 1 
ill even say it again  this is torture 0 
food was really boring 0 
the camera really likes her in this movie 1 
nice blanket of moz over top but i feel like this was done to cover up the subpar food 1 
the chicken i got was definitely reheated and was only ok the wedges were cold and soggy 0 
i felt insulted and disrespected how could you talk and judge another human being like that 0 
everything was gross 0 
this was a different cut than the piece the other day but still wonderful and tender s well as well flavored 1 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
if you have several dozen or several hundred contacts then imagine the fun of sending each of them one by one 0 
cheap but hey it works was pleasantly suprised given the low cost of this item 1 
the phone takes forever to charge like 2 to 5 hours literally 0 
the story is lame not interesting and never really explains the sinister origins of the puppets 0 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
i love the ownerchef his one authentic japanese cool dude 1 
the cast is always entertaining as usual 1 
i was very disappointed 0 
this is one of the worst sandra bullock movie since speed 2 but not quite that bad 0 
the potato chip order was sad i could probably count how many chips were in that box and it was probably around 12 0 
att is not clear sound is very distorted and you have to yell when you talk 0 
we got sitting fairly fast but ended up waiting 40 minutes just to place our order another 30 minutes before the food arrived 0 
this is an excellent tool especially when paired with your phones autoanswer 1 
i checked everywhere and there is no feature for it which is really disappointing 0 
the shower area is outside so you can only rinse not take a full shower unless you dont mind being nude for everyone to see 0 
its reception is very very poor 0 
i think not again 0 
the mic there is a joke and the volume is quite low 0 
talk about great customer service of course we will be back 1 
excellent product for the price 1 
voice recognition is tremendous 1 
personally i think it shows that people should learn to find a compromise them self without involving other people into issue 1 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
now this dish was quite flavourful 1 
this movie was kind of long in length but i enjoyed every minute of it 1 
great food 1 
first time going but i think i will quickly become a regular 1 
the inside is really quite nice and very clean 1 
we watched our waiter pay a lot more attention to other tables and ignore us 0 
each day of the week they have a different deal and its all so delicious 1 
highly recommended for all ages although the younger set will probably not appreciate some of the more subtle references they will certainly appreciate one galley scene in particular 1 
none of them are engaging or exciting 0 
why are these sad little vegetables so overcooked 0 
while you dont yet hear mickey speak there are tons of sound effects and music throughout the filmsomething we take for granted now but which was a huge crowd pleaser in 1928 1 
there is a totally unnecessary trainroller coaster scene 0 
i know he was a contract player with little control over his scripts but the acting was as bad as the script 0 
no plot whatsoever 0 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
by the time the film ended i not only disliked it i despised it 0 
i keep watching it over and over 1 
not too screamy not to masculine but just right 1 
i vomited in the bathroom mid lunch 0 
i went to bachi burger on a friends recommendation and was not disappointed 1 
it was attached to a gas station and that is rarely a good sign 0 
it also took her forever to bring us the check when we asked for it 0 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
the headset fulfills my requirements so i am happy with my purchase 1 
very slow at seating even with reservation 0 
it is an excellent drama an excellent thriller and an excellent film 1 
this item is fantastic and works perfectly 1 
its a mediocre miserable hollow laughable and predictable piece of garbage 0 
overall i rate this movie a 10 out of a 110 scale 1 
i had about two bites and refused to eat anymore 0 
we are sending it back 0 
this mostly routine factbased tv drama gets a boost from the fine performance by cole 1 
oh the charger seems to work fine 1 
dont buy it 0 
this is an excellent tool especially when paired with your phones autoanswer 1 
would not go back 0 
other than that the leather is nice and soft the fit is very tight the cut out for the face is a good shape 1 
i am far from a sushi connoisseur but i can definitely tell the difference between good food and bad food and this was certainly bad food 0 
a very good film indeed about great and unconditional love 1 
this is a great phone 1 
its the best headset i have used 1 
the success of the film depends on the casting of sydney greenstreet as the alexander yardley character 1 
so good i am going to have to review this place twice once hereas a tribute to the place and once as a tribute to an event held here last night 1 
this movie now joins revenge of the boogeyman and zombiez as part of the hellish trinity of horror films 0 
this is a great deal 1 
awesome selection of beer 1 
i enjoyed reading this book to my children when they were little 1 
i wish i could return the unit and get back my money 0 
its a gloriously fun fast paced and fairly accurate portrayal of the night of a raver 1 
considering the relations off screen between taylor and stanwyck it was surprising how little chemistry there was on screen between the two of them 0 
overall i rate this movie a 10 out of a 110 scale 1 
perhaps i caught them on an off night judging by the other reviews but im not inspired to go back 0 
big disappointment with calendar sync 0 
the bipolarity of the ruthless thug one minute a ruthless killer the next minute a luvs diaper commercial is completely unconvincing 0 
initially the local sites in the film which was filmed here in buffalo intrigued me 1 
this place is overpriced not consistent with their boba and it really is overpriced 0 
i let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this bad idea we both hated it 0 
1010 1 
food was really good and i got full petty fast 1 
this was one of the worst films i have ever seen 0 
dont buy it 0 
definitely a turn off for me i doubt ill be back unless someone else is buying 0 
it defeats the purpose of a bluetooth headset 0 
very convenient since we were staying at the mgm 1 
here in the wind and the lion we see a wonderful rendering of americas own imperial age 1 
this is a great restaurant at the mandalay bay 1 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
i have always used corded headsets and the freedom from the wireless is very helpful 1 
i saw this film over christmas and what a great film it was 1 
by the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant i was bored and didnt care what happened next and so i switched off 0 
the cashew cream sauce was bland and the vegetables were undercooked 0 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
it came free with a dvd player i bought but i still turned the thing off halfway through because i was embarrassed for howell 0 
this movie creates its own universe and is fascinating in every way 1 
secondly hitchcock pretty much perfected the thriller and chase movie 1 
product is exactly as described 1 
will be back again 1 
works for me 1 
i used bitpim a free program you can find on the internetto transfer data to the phonethe price of the cable was excellent 1 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
it looks very nice 1 
i had to wait over 30 minutes to get my drink and longer to get 2 arepas 0 
appears to actually outperform the original battery from china that came with my v325i 1 
pretty cool i would say 1 
i dont have to be an accountant to know im getting screwed 0 
also notable is john baileys fine crisp beautifully colored cinematography and the great production design costumes by eiko ishioka who went on to do the memorable costumes for coppolas dracula for which she received a well deserved oscar 1 
i find this inexcusable and so will probably be returning this phone and perhaps changing carriers 0 
the selection was probably the worst ive seen in vegasthere was none 0 
the voice recognition thru the handset is excellent 1 
i highly recommend this modest priced cellular phone 1 
horrible 0 
weve tried to like this place but after 10 times i think were done with them 0 
the loudspeaker option is great the bumpers with the lights is very appealing 0 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
the only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive 1 
the service was a bit lacking 0 
20th century foxs road house 1948 is not only quite a silly noir but is an implausible unmitigated bore of a movie 0 
then theres the plot holes 0 
aailiyah was pretty good as akasha in places compelling her first entrance and mini dance scene 1 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
the biggest complaint i have is the battery drains superfast 0 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
yet plantronincs continues to use the same flawed charger design 0 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
car charger as well as ac charger are included to make sure you never run out of juicehighy recommended 1 
warning do not buy 0 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
1 hour 54 minutes of sheer tedium melodrama and horrible acting a mess of a script and a sinking feeling of good lord what were they thinking 0 
this is a disgrace 0 
waaaaaayyyyyyyyyy over rated is all i am saying 0 
great service and food 1 
the only place good for this film is in the garbage 0 
i give wirefly 1 stari will contact cingularatt and inform them of this practice 0 
i advise everyone do not be fooled 0 
anne heche was utterly convincing 1 
bad fit way too big 0 
however my girl was complain that some time the phone doesnt wake up like normal phone does 0 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
i know this is not like the other restaurants at all something is very off here 0 
it is shameful 0 
it is simple to use and i like it 1 
for service i give them no stars 0 
overall a great experience 1 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
i went to bachi burger on a friends recommendation and was not disappointed 1 
i am going to have to be the first to negatively review this product 0 
the story line is totally predictable 0 
this is so embarassing and also my ears hurt if i try to push the ear plug into my ear 0 
do not waste your time 0 
food was great and so was the serivce 1 
i sat riveted to the tv screen 1 
drinks took close to 30 minutes to come out at one point 0 
the ambiance isnt much better 0 
i know this is not like the other restaurants at all something is very off here 0 
food arrived quickly 1 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
its reception is very very poor 0 
your servers suck wait correction our server heimer sucked 0 
stopped by during the late may bank holiday off rick steve recommendation and loved it 1 
product was excellent and works better than the verizon one and boy was it cheaper 1 
maybe its just their vegetarian fare but ive been twice and i thought it was average at best 0 
the directing seems too pretentious 0 
i was bored throughout the whole damn thing 0 
the live music on fridays totally blows 0 
the directing seems too pretentious 0 
i have bought this nokia cell phone a few weeks ago and it was a nightmare 0 
doesnt work at all i bougth it for my l7c and its not working 0 
overpriced for what you are getting 0 
krussel always good 1 
worst customer service 0 
ryans bar is definitely one edinburgh establishment i wont be revisiting 0 
the service was meh 0 
ive had no trouble accessing the internet downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions 1 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
basically the service was very bad 0 
nice leather 1 
bought mainly for the charger which broke soon after purchasing 0 
delete this film from your mind 0 
nice solid keyboard 1 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
the script is a big flawed mess 0 
best fish ive ever had in my life 1 
the cg opening sequence in space looked like it could have been created on microsoft slideshow for gods sake 0 
it was so funny 1 
it didnt charge for me 0 
gets the job done 1 
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 
its just painful 0 
first time going but i think i will quickly become a regular 1 
the cinematographyif it can be called thatsucked 0 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
its the best headset i have used 1 
the service was a bit lacking 0 
the fried rice was dry as well 0 
this was my first time and i cant wait until the next 1 
for 40 bucks a head i really expect better food 0 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
im terribly disappointed that this film would receive so many awards and accolades especially when there are far more deserving works of film out there 0 
on a positive note our server was very attentive and provided great service 1 
however i recently watched the whole thing again on dvd and i was completely struck by how extremely stupid the storyline was how it contained holes inconsistencies and frankly a whole lot of crap and how horrid the dancing was 0 
an hour seriously 0 
updatewent back for a second time and it was still just as amazing 1 
im a bit disappointed 0 
it is simple to use and i like it 1 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
talk about great customer service of course we will be back 1 
i purcashed this for the car charger and it does not work 0 
im pleased 1 
a happy wonderful feel good ending 1 
it was not good 0 
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0 
the pan cakes everyone are raving about taste like a sugary disaster tailored to the palate of a six year old 0 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
this if the first movie ive given a 10 to in years 1 
this movie contained an allstar cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i havent seen before 1 
went in for happy hour great list of wines 1 
sweetest phone 1 
but it wasnt until i watched this film that i realised how great he actually was 1 
i got the aluminum case for my new palm vx and it worked really wellit has protected my handheld perfectly so far 1 
echo problemvery unsatisfactory 0 
the ngage is still lacking in earbuds 0 
disappointing 0 
an interesting premise and billy drago is always good as a dangerous nutbag side note id love to see drago stephen mchattie and lance hendrikson in a flick together talk about raging cheekbones 1 
seems like a good quick place to grab a bite of some familiar pub food but do yourself a favor and look elsewhere 0 
made very sturdy 1 
just what i wanted 1 
i had the chicken pho and it tasted very bland 0 
its still wild stuff though and is highly recommended to fans of giallo cinema 1 
the steak and the shrimp are in my opinion the best entrees at gc 1 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
think it over when you plan to own this onethis sure is the last moto phone for me 0 
a very charming film with wonderful sentiment and heart 1 
steamboat willie is an amazingly important film to our cinema history 1 
level 5 spicy was perfect where spice didnt overwhelm the soup 1 
an interesting premise and billy drago is always good as a dangerous nutbag side note id love to see drago stephen mchattie and lance hendrikson in a flick together talk about raging cheekbones 1 
we wont be going back 0 
i was very disappointed 0 
another thing i didnt really like is when a character got punched in the face a gallon of blood would spew forth soon after 0 
good show samsung 1 
ive had no trouble accessing the internet downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions 1 
they really want to make your experience a good one 1 
instead we got a bore fest about a whiny spoiled brat babysitting 0 
magical help 1 
and the red curry had so much bamboo shoots and wasnt very tasty to me 0 
as a courtroom drama its compelling as an indictment on the american justice system its frightening 1 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
i have to mention this and it is a huge spoiler i loved the ending how all the characters of the three films were the remaining survivors of the ferry disaster with valentine and the young judge together and the old man watching it on her tv solidifying his happiness over the suffering which he dealt with for those many years 1 
i just saw this film and i recommend it 1 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
the films sole bright spot was jonah hill who will look almost unrecognizable to fans of the recent superbad due to the amount of weight he lost in the interim 1 
the lead man is charismafree 0 
my breakfast was perpared great with a beautiful presentation of 3 giant slices of toast lightly dusted with powdered sugar 1 
the staff is always super friendly and helpful which is especially cool when you bring two small boys and a baby 1 
the point is the journey a journey that touches every member of the family 1 
the atmosphere was great with a lovely duo of violinists playing songs we requested 1 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
linksys should have some way to exchange a bad phone for a refurb unit or something 0 
this company charge me a restocking fee and still not given me my refund back 0 
worthless product 0 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
the potatoes were like rubber and you could tell they had been made up ahead of time being kept under a warmer 0 
great value 1 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
poor quality 0 
this was like the final blow 0 
this was reflected not only in the cast but also in the belowpar script which borrowed much from the earlier classic 0 
the jabra eargels fit my ears very well 1 
dee snider just plain sucks 0 
kieslowski never ceases to amaze me 1 
it was that loudglad to say that the plantronics 510 maintains a flawless connection to my cell and with no static during normal use 1 
artless camerawork endlessly presents us with the ugliest setting imaginable ie 0 
to be honest with you this is unbelievable nonsense and very foolish 0 
i mean in a realistic world she would never have gotten into that ballet repertory the whole thing was quite pathetic 0 
crostini that came with the salad was stale 0 
so flavorful and has just the perfect amount of heat 1 
the price was very good and with the free shipping and all it was a good purchase 1 
if this premise sound stupid thats because it is 0 
star trek v the final frontier is the worst in the series 0 
ill be looking for a new earpiece 0 
he owns the film just as spacek owned coal miners daughter and quaid owned great balls of fire 1 
similarly the delivery man did not say a word of apology when our food was 45 minutes late 0 
the service here leaves a lot to be desired 0 
if you love death and decay and shakespears lyrics this is the one 1 
the show would begin with smart ass ed comments to each other that would be totally off the wall and uncalled for 0 
none of them are engaging or exciting 0 
i cant wait to go back 1 
he came running after us when he realized my husband had left his sunglasses on the table 1 
i would not recommend this place 0 
it was a bit too sweet not really spicy enough and lacked flavor 0 
you could drive a semi truck into these holes 0 
nice sound 1 
now this dish was quite flavourful 1 
i also didnt like the on button it felt like it would crack with use 0 
bluetooth does not work phone locks up screens just flash up and now it just makes calls randomly while in my pocket locked 0 
uncomfortable in the ear dont use with lg vx9900 env 0 
the staff are great the ambiance is great 1 
im pleased 1 
anyways the food was definitely not filling at all and for the price you pay you should expect more 0 
unfortunately we must have hit the bakery on leftover day because everything we ordered was stale 0 
if you simply want a small flip phone look elsewhere as the extra bells whistles are mediocre 0 
all of the tapas dishes were delicious 1 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
for sushi on the strip this is the place to go 1 
not even good for camp value 0 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
great price too 1 
there was so much hype over this phone that i assumed it was the best my mistake 0 
i use this product in a motor control center where there is a lot of high voltage humming from the equipment and it works great 1 
give this one a look 1 
the nano stated itmy son was dissapointed 0 
i was very excited to get this headset because i thought it was really cute 1 
the hockey scenes are terrible defensemen playing like theyre 5 years old goalies diving at shots that are 10 feet wide of the net etc 0 
the chains which im no fan of beat this place easily 0 
dont bother go to the store 0 
it is zillion times away from reality 0 
my fella got the huevos rancheros and they didnt look too appealing 0 
it is a joy to use 1 
overall i rate this movie a 10 out of a 110 scale 1 
camerawork again bad 0 
the service was poor and thats being nice 0 
i was seated immediately 1 
the sweet potato fries were very good and seasoned well 1 
i believe that pitch black was done well 1 
this is the kind of money that is wasted properly 1 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
god and i can never get that 90 minutes back 0 
i get absolutely horrible reception in my apartment where with other phones i have not had this problem 0 
horrible 0 
but in any case the best part is you can download these pictures to your laptop using ir or even send pictures from your laptop to the phone 1 
id love to go back 1 
pretty good beer selection too 1 
punishment park is a brilliant piece of cinema 1 
i received my orders well within the shipping timeframe everything was in good working order and overall i am very excited to have this source 1 
after arguing with verizon regarding the dropped calls we returned the phones after two days 0 
will not be back 0 
the movie has almost no action scenes in it and very little comedy 0 
very funny 1 
i love my 350 headset my jabra350 bluetooth headset is great the reception is very good and the ear piece is a comfortable fit 1 
this place was such a nice surprise 1 
i ordered the voodoo pasta and it was the first time id had really excellent pasta since going gluten free several years ago 1 
mark my words this is one of those cult films like evil dead 2 or phantasm that people will still be discovering and falling in love with 20 30 40 years down the line 1 
if you love authentic mexican food and want a whole bunch of interesting yet delicious meats to choose from you need to try this place 1 
it was pretty gross 0 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
best headset ever 1 
still waiting im sure this item would work well if i ever recieve it 0 
after all the rave reviews i couldnt wait to eat herewhat a disappointment 0 
i enjoyed reading this book to my children when they were little 1 
i think that it is a must see older john wayne film 1 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
this was reflected not only in the cast but also in the belowpar script which borrowed much from the earlier classic 0 
a good commentary of todays love and undoubtedly a film worth seeing 1 
its too bad that everyone else involved didnt share crowes level of dedication to quality for if they did wed have a far better film on our hands than this subpar mess 0 
problem is that the ear loops are made of weak material and break easily 0 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
its the best headset i have used 1 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
the volume for the ringer is real good you have choices how loud 1 
i found a six inch long piece of wire in my salsa 0 
it defeats the purpose of a bluetooth headset 0 
they are so easy to love but even more easy to identify with 1 
i loved it it was really scary 1 
my 810 score is mostly for the plot 1 
this place is like chipotle but better 1 
id like to return it 0 
great product for the price 1 
there are so many problems i dont know where to start 0 
its still wild stuff though and is highly recommended to fans of giallo cinema 1 
last night was my second time dining here and i was so happy i decided to go back 1 
this allows the possibility of double booking for the same date and time after the first 0 
this is was due to the fact that it took 20 minutes to be acknowledged then another 35 minutes to get our foodand they kept forgetting things 0 
bad reception 0 
painful on the ear 0 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
logitech bluetooth headset is a 10 1 
good beer drink selection and good food selection 1 
and i just love the colors 1 
this was utterly confusing at first which caused me to lose a couple of very very important contacts 0 
i own 2 of these cases and would order another 1 
im trying to return it for a refund 0 
wont ever go here again 0 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
the casting is also horrible cause all you see is a really really bad actors period 0 
the seller is very understanding and patient i would definitely buy from them again 1 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
but this movie is not funny considering the ridiculousness of it 0 
it was just too horrible 0 
they brought a fresh batch of fries and i was thinking yay something warm but no 0 
i searched the internet and found this one to be the best value 1 
as many people complained i found this headsets microphone was very weak 0 
the attention given to every character and complex psychological portrayals detailing loyalty treachery love and hope are tremendous 1 
good value great food great service 1 
i am very impressed with this headset from plantronics 1 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
all the characters in this film are tremendously well played 1 
back to good bbq lighter fare reasonable pricing and tell the public they are back to the old ways 1 
this was my first and only vegas buffet and it did not disappoint 1 
the chips and salsa were really good the salsa was very fresh 1 
but it does get better reception and clarity than any phone ive had before 1 
new battery works great in phone 1 
linked to my phone without effort 1 
both great 1 
i really hope the team behind this movie makes more movies and that they will continue to do so in their own some kinda weird style 1 
it is a true classic 1 
do not buy do not buyit sucks 0 
now we were chosen to be tortured with this disgusting piece of blatant american propaganda 0 
not tasty and the texture was just nasty 0 
worst thai ever 0 
however the keypads are so tinny that i sometimes reach the wrong buttons 0 
probably never coming back and wouldnt recommend it 0 
i as well wouldve given godfathers zero stars if possible 0 
so i bought about 10 of these and saved alot of money 1 
great atmosphere friendly and fast service 1 
the scripting of the subtle comedy is unmatched by any movie in recent years 1 
the shower area is outside so you can only rinse not take a full shower unless you dont mind being nude for everyone to see 0 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
not to mention the combination of pears almonds and bacon is a big winner 1 
i thoroughly enjoyed it when christopher eccleston took control of the tardis and the continuation of the series 1 
its a gloriously fun fast paced and fairly accurate portrayal of the night of a raver 1 
this was utterly confusing at first which caused me to lose a couple of very very important contacts 0 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
im surprised this is a good quality car charger and theres not much reviews about it 1 
excellent service 1 
cant get the software to work with my computer 0 
the art style has the appearance of crayonpencil drawings and is wonderfully colorful and fanciful 1 
a pretty good product 1 
a fantastic neighborhood gem 1 
yes its that bad 0 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
but whatever it was that cost them so much it didnt translate to quality thats for sure 0 
this greedy corporation will never see another dime from me 0 
they were excellent 1 
doesnt work 0 
good item low price 1 
but this movie is not funny considering the ridiculousness of it 0 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
its still wild stuff though and is highly recommended to fans of giallo cinema 1 
someone shouldve invented this sooner 1 
even in my bmw 3 series which is fairly quiet i have trouble hearing what the other person is saying 0 
now imagine that every single one of those decisions was made wrong 0 
will not be back 0 
the service was meh 0 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
sauce was tasteless 0 
we waited an hour for what was a breakfast i could have done 100 times better at home 0 
im big fan of rpg games too but this movie its a disgrace to any selfrespecting rpger there is 0 
so anyone near you will hear part of your conversation 0 
i was able to do voice dialing in the car with no problem 1 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
well never go again 0 
this gets a 1 out of 10 simply because theres nothing lower 0 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
kind of flops around 0 
its so bad its actually worth seeing just for that reason 0 
brilliant 1 
good works fine 1 
after my phone got to be about a year old its been slowly breaking despite much care on my part 0 
weve tried to like this place but after 10 times i think were done with them 0 
just dont know why they were so slow 0 
the waitress and manager are so friendly 1 
it probably would have been better if the director hadnt spent most of the movie showcasing his own art work which really isnt that noteworthy 0 
great food and awesome service 1 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
initially the local sites in the film which was filmed here in buffalo intrigued me 1 
freezes frequently4 0 
this is hands down the best phone ive ever had 1 
this is high adventure at its best 1 
works well 1 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
i cant wait to go back 1 
both of the egg rolls were fantastic 1 
it makes very strange ticking noises before it ends the call 0 
i dont think i will be back for a very long time 0 
however i needed some better instructions 0 
over rated 0 
in particular the relationship between the bakery assistant and the waitress just didnt work for me at all 0 
the movie in movie situations in the beginning and through the game that is played with her by the acting coach are fascinating 1 
i consider this theft 0 
good quality 1 
very nice and relaxing late night viewing 1 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
att is not clear sound is very distorted and you have to yell when you talk 0 
too bad you have to pay up to a month for the service 0 
i asked multiple times for the wine list and after some time of being ignored i went to the hostess and got one myself 0 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
great food and awesome service 1 
i didnt want the clip going over the top of my ear causing discomfort 0 
things that went wrong they burned the saganaki 0 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
very good product well made 1 
but its just not funny 0 
fans of the genre will be in heaven 1 
the bipolarity of the ruthless thug one minute a ruthless killer the next minute a luvs diaper commercial is completely unconvincing 0 
phone falls out easily 0 
raw and sublimely moving 1 
first of all there are enough racial stereotypes and racial jokes to offend everyone 0 
highly unprofessional and rude to a loyal patron 0 
awful service 0 
if you want healthy authentic or ethic food try this place 1 
unfortunately it was not good 0 
the success of the film depends on the casting of sydney greenstreet as the alexander yardley character 1 
unfortunately it will not recharge my iphone 4s despite connecting it from multiple power sources imac external battery wall outlet etc 0 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
incredible 1 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
this is the first phone ive had that has been so cheaply made 0 
an instant classic with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits 1 
this would not even be good as a made for tv flick 0 
this movie does an excellent job of revealing the complexity of the task and the incredible challenges facing south africa 1 
on the ground right next to our table was a large smeared beensteppedinandtrackedeverywhere pile of green bird poop 0 
excellent performance 1 
shrimp when i unwrapped it i live only 12 a mile from brushfire it was literally ice cold 0 
an amazing finale to possibly the best trilogy of all time 1 
you never know if you pushed it hard enough or the right number of times for the function you want or not 0 
finally after three or four times the spring of the latch broke and i could not use it any longer on the visor 0 
nice ambiance 1 
my 5year old nokia 2160 from tracfone holds the charge a lot better than this 0 
tasted like dirt 0 
i am pairing this with my iphone and i could not be happier with it so far 1 
when a song could explain the emotions of the subjects better such as when jay adams unfortunate life was a subject of talk the song old man by neil young was played which evokes many emotions 1 
similarly the delivery man did not say a word of apology when our food was 45 minutes late 0 
the text messaging feature is really tricky to use 0 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
this place is not quality sushi it is not a quality restaurant 0 
im not really sure how joeys was voted best hot dog in the valley by readers of phoenix magazine 0 
its the best headset i have used 1 
all in all i think it was a good investment 1 
we recently witnessed her poor quality of management towards other guests as well 0 
worst martini ever 0 
horrible horrible protector 0 
good audio quality 1 
incredible 1 
avoid avoid avoid 0 
i give wirefly 1 stari will contact cingularatt and inform them of this practice 0 
thank you for such great service 1 
i have had mine for about a year and this christmas i bought some for the rest of the family 1
