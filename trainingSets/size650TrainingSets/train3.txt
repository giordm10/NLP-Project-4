she ordered a toasted english muffin that came out untoasted 0 
best of all is the rotating feature very helpful 1 
best service and food ever maria our server was so good and friendly she made our day 1 
poorly contstruct hinge 0 
nothing short of magnificent photographycinematography in this film 1 
there was no chemistry between ben affleck and sandra bullock in this film and i couldnt understand why he would consider even leaving his wifetobe for this chick that he supposedly was knocked out by 0 
this item is great installed it let it charged up overnite and it has been working good every since with no problems 1 
thus far have only visited twice and the food was absolutely delicious each time 1 
nothing special 0 
food was so gooodd 1 
i received my supposedly new motorola 375 and apparently there was not a match between the phone and the charger 0 
plug was the wrong size 0 
overall a delight 1 
i give wirefly 1 stari will contact cingularatt and inform them of this practice 0 
i would definitely recommend the jabra bt250v for those who are looking for comfort clarity and a great price 1 
sending it back 0 
dont buy this product 0 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
the screen size is big key pad lit well enough and the camera quality is excellent for a camera phone 1 
i found this place by accident and i could not be happier 1 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
the accompanied software is almost brilliant 1 
im not sure what he was trying to do with this film 0 
lasted one day and then blew up 0 
my order was not correct 0 
only like 3 or 4 buildings used a couple of locations maybe poor hummh 0 
all this movie does is make you sick watching all these slackers make excuses for their stupid actions for 90 minutes 0 
thank you for such great service 1 
i particularly remember my senses being assaulted by strident cords of music that would blare out with very little warning and even less meaning 0 
i really dont see how anyone could enjoy this movie 0 
generous portions and great taste 1 
its a fresh subtle and rather sublime effect 1 
yet i enjoy watching it 1 
any ring toneoverall good phone to buy 1 
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1 
the ear buds only play music in one ear 0 
i like design and look of jabra behing the ear headsets and 5020 is pretty comfortible to wear 24 hours a day without pain in the ear 1 
sending it back 0 
the servers are not pleasant to deal with and they dont always honor pizza hut coupons 0 
does not work 0 
the movie had you on the edge of your seat and made you somewhat afraid to go to your car at the end of the night 1 
dont waste your time watching this rubbish nonresearched film 0 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
excellent starter wireless headset 0 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
happy so far 1 
no real improvement 0 
now the pizza itself was good the peanut sauce was very tasty 1 
no im going to eat the potato that i found some strangers hair in it 0 
definitely not worth the 3 i paid 0 
best headset ever 1 
the sound quality for the device is unacceptableunless you are in a really quiet area you almost hear nothing 0 
these are the nicest restaurant owners ive ever come across 1 
i definitly recommend 1 
disappointing accessory from a good manufacturer 0 
i wasnt the least bit interested 0 
i highly recommend this modest priced cellular phone 1 
good service very clean and inexpensive to boot 1 
rude inconsiderate management 0 
good show samsung 1 
comfortable fit you need your headset to be comfortable for at least an hour at a time if not for an entire day 1 
there are massive levels massive unlockable characters its just a massive game 1 
disappointing experience 0 
kieslowski never ceases to amaze me 1 
here in the wind and the lion we see a wonderful rendering of americas own imperial age 1 
motorola finally got the voice quality of a bluetooth headset right 1 
there is no real plot 0 
by this time our side of the restaurant was almost empty so there was no excuse 0 
if it was to turn my good day feeling into a night of disturbing memories than i guess he succeeded 0 
of course the footage from the 70s was grainy but that only enhanced the film 1 
i could not stand to even watch it for very long for fear of losing iq 0 
gets the job done 1 
very well made and fits my surefire gx2 perfectly 1 
i did not expect this to be so good 1 
so they performed 1 
the loudspeaker option is great the bumpers with the lights is very appealing 0 
the art style has the appearance of crayonpencil drawings and is wonderfully colorful and fanciful 1 
but the service was beyond bad 0 
started watching this but didnt believe in any of the characters 0 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
it came free with a dvd player i bought but i still turned the thing off halfway through because i was embarrassed for howell 0 
its also great to see that renowned silent screenwriter frances marion hasnt missed a step going from silent to sound 1 
the nano stated itmy son was dissapointed 0 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
if you see it you should probably just leave it on the shelf 0 
but i thought his acting was skilled 1 
the sweet potato fries were very good and seasoned well 1 
he also came back to check on us regularly excellent service 1 
spend your money elsewhere 0 
her lines seem to have been written by a fifteen year old though they are trying oh so so hard to sound like how a fifteen year old would really um you know well talk 0 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
im glad i found this product on amazon it is hard to find it wasnt high priced 1 
setup couldnt have been simpler 1 
i can assure you that you wont be disappointed 1 
then i watched it again two sundays ago march 20th 2005 and i began to really enjoy it and this time i taped the entire thing 1 
they brought a fresh batch of fries and i was thinking yay something warm but no 0 
cinematography the film was shot in an interesting way 1 
i love the pho and the spring rolls oh so yummy you have to try 1 
perabo has a nice energy level and is obviously very comfortable in front of a camera 1 
insults profound deuchebaggery and had to go outside for a smoke break while serving just to solidify it 0 
the charger worked for about a week and then completely stopped charging my phone 0 
earbud piece breaks easily 0 
there are massive levels massive unlockable characters its just a massive game 1 
service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is vegas and located inside the crystals shopping mall by aria 1 
avoid this establishment 0 
it looks very nice 1 
restored my phone to like new performance 1 
disapointing results 0 
our server was super nice and checked on us many times 1 
not even good for camp value 0 
its too bad that everyone else involved didnt share crowes level of dedication to quality for if they did wed have a far better film on our hands than this subpar mess 0 
i love being able to use one headset for both by landline and cell 1 
but now i was completely grossed out 0 
the script is bad very bad  it contains both cheesiness and unethical joke that you normally see in rated r or nc17 movie 0 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
they will customize your order any way youd like my usual is eggplant with green bean stir fry love it 1 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
wasted two hours 0 
insults profound deuchebaggery and had to go outside for a smoke break while serving just to solidify it 0 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
but storm trooper is not even bad enough to make it to the list of wonderfully terrible movies 0 
very satisifed with that 1 
20th century foxs road house 1948 is not only quite a silly noir but is an implausible unmitigated bore of a movie 0 
what this film lacks is a convincing script 0 
bad purchase 0 
but the premise of the film was so ridiculous that the president of the us 0 
it kept getting worse and worse so now im officially done 0 
special mention should be made of the superb music score and sound effects which are an integral element in helping to make this such a memorable and enjoyable cartoon 1 
you need at least 3 mins to get to your phone book from the time you first turn on the phonebattery life is short 0 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
the phone gets extremely hot 0 
gets a signal when other verizon phones wont 1 
it was packed 0 
during several different 2 minute calls i experienced 5 drops and it was in an area that had 5 bars 0 
i really do recommend this place you can go wrong with this donut place 1 
a great touch 1 
service was good and the company was better 1 
id advise anyone to go and see it 1 
coming here is like experiencing an underwhelming relationship where both parties cant wait for the other person to ask to break up 0 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
horrible dont waste your time and money 0 
the staff was very attentive 1 
i will come back here every time im in vegas 1 
comfortable in my hand 1 
i mean in a realistic world she would never have gotten into that ballet repertory the whole thing was quite pathetic 0 
for service i give them no stars 0 
delicious nyc bagels good selections of cream cheese real lox with capers even 1 
the staff is great the food is delish and they have an incredible beer selection 1 
my brother in law who works at the mall ate here same day and guess what he was sick all night too 0 
aside from its terrible lead this film has loads of other debits 0 
saggy floppy piece of junk 0 
unfortunately this is a bad movie that is just plain bad 0 
doesnt work at all i bougth it for my l7c and its not working 0 
it really created a unique feeling though 1 
utter crap sound quality is terrible 0 
headset works great was packaged nicely to avoid any damage 1 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
needless to say we will never be back here again 0 
this hole in the wall has great mexican street tacos and friendly staff 1 
cute quaint simple honest 1 
avoid at any and all costs 0 
i go to far too many places and ive never seen any restaurant that serves a 1 egg breakfast especially for 400 0 
good case 1 
not what i wanted 0 
new battery works great in phone 1 
this is a good battery and it got here really fast 1 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
did not like at all 0 
nicest chinese restaurant ive been in a while 1 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
another note about this phones appearance is that it really looks rather bland especially in the all black model 0 
this was one of the worst films i have ever seen 0 
i believe that pitch black was done well 1 
if you want a real scare rent this one 1 
the sweet potato tots were good but the onion rings were perfection or as close as i have had 1 
mishima is extremely uninteresting 0 
the bus boy on the other hand was so rude 0 
feelings thoughtsgabriels discomfort during the danceall these intangibles leap to life and come within the viewers grasp in hustons portrayal 1 
bt50 battery junk 0 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
it was so bad i had lost the heart to finish it 0 
i will come back here every time im in vegas 1 
great software for motorolas 1 
thanks good a movie like this was done and released 1 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
horrible horrible protector 0 
buttons are too small 0 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
this was like the final blow 0 
horrible phone 0 
its reception is very very poor 0 
the chips and salsa were really good the salsa was very fresh 1 
service was fantastic 1 
works fine 1 
all in all ha long bay was a bit of a flop 0 
its a great item 1 
there is really nothing for me at postinos hope your experience is better 0 
but when i check voice mail at night the keypad backlight turns off a few seconds into the first message and then im lost 0 
i found the product to be easy to set up and use 1 
the burger had absolutely no flavor the meat itself was totally bland the burger was overcooked and there was no charcoal flavor 0 
for a product that costs as much as this one does i expect it to work far better and with greater ease than this thing does 0 
cumbersome design 0 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
this phone is pretty sturdy and ive never had any large problems with it 1 
i especially liked the noncliche choices with the parents in other movies i could predict the dialog verbatim but the writing in this movie made better selections 1 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
the speaker is of low quality so as making the ring tones sound very cheap 0 
an absolute must visit 1 
as an earlier review noted plug in this charger and nothing happens 0 
i got it because it was so small and adorable 1 
rip off over charge shipping 0 
spend your money elsewhere 0 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
i rather enjoyed it 1 
this place is like chipotle but better 1 
works great 1 
by far the best cheesecurds we have ever had 1 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
lange had become a great actress 1 
i love the camera its really pretty good quality 1 
ive only had my bluetooth for a few weeks but i really like it 1 
looks great and is strong 1 
we are so glad we found this place 1 
i thought it was bad 0 
this movie is a good and humorous comment on life in 2006 1 
worked great 1 
the staff is great the food is delish and they have an incredible beer selection 1 
nice sound 1 
also notable is john baileys fine crisp beautifully colored cinematography and the great production design costumes by eiko ishioka who went on to do the memorable costumes for coppolas dracula for which she received a well deserved oscar 1 
the ngage is still lacking in earbuds 0 
god and i can never get that 90 minutes back 0 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
cant say enough good things about this place 1 
the sweet potato fries were very good and seasoned well 1 
any ring toneoverall good phone to buy 1 
the greek dressing was very creamy and flavorful 1 
talk about useless customer service 0 
for those that havent seen it dont waste your time 0 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
one of my favorite purchases ever 1 
saggy floppy piece of junk 0 
this is truly an art movieit actually has a lot of art in it 1 
this phone is pretty sturdy and ive never had any large problems with it 1 
well im satisfied 1 
then i had to continue pairing it periodically since it somehow kept dropping 0 
favorite place in town for shawarrrrrrma 1 
a fly was in my apple juice a fly 0 
really really good rice all the time 1 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
bad characters bad story and bad acting 0 
ps the only scene in the movie that was cool is when the central character finds her room blown up 1 
you wont regret it 1 
the ngage is still lacking in earbuds 0 
we would recommend these to others 1 
for that price i can think of a few place i would have much rather gone 0 
schrader has made a resume full of lousy amateurish films 0 
i great reception all the time 1 
battery has no life 0 
phenomenal food service and ambiance 1 
do not waste your money here 0 
the fact is this film is a wonderful heartwarming tale about two people chasing their dreams 1 
excellent dualpurpose headset 1 
the cg opening sequence in space looked like it could have been created on microsoft slideshow for gods sake 0 
no ear loop needed its tiny and the sound is great 1 
the steak was amazingrge fillet relleno was the best seafood plate i have ever had 1 
there are massive levels massive unlockable characters its just a massive game 1 
at first glance it is a lovely bakery cafe nice ambiance clean friendly staff 1 
this device is great in several situations1 1 
i would definitely recommend the jabra bt250v for those who are looking for comfort clarity and a great price 1 
these were so good we ordered them twice 1 
judith light is one of my favorite actresses and i think she does a superb job in this film 1 
but i thought his acting was skilled 1 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
the script is bad very bad  it contains both cheesiness and unethical joke that you normally see in rated r or nc17 movie 0 
all things considered a job very well done 1 
pretty piece of junk 0 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
barney is definitely super de duper 1 
really good product 1 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
nice quality build unlike some cheap s out there 1 
it was a good thing that the tickets only cost five dollars because i would be mad if id have paid 750 to see this crap 0 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
using all earpieces left or right this thing will not stay on my ear 0 
the company shipped my product very promptly and it works well 1 
the malta settings are as dry and as barren as the dialogue 0 
good product good seller 1 
this item is great installed it let it charged up overnite and it has been working good every since with no problems 1 
steamboat willie is an amazingly important film to our cinema history 1 
i would give this television series a 10 plus if i could 1 
food quality has been horrible 0 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
to be honest with you this is unbelievable nonsense and very foolish 0 
i must say i have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again 1 
very good though 1 
20th century foxs road house 1948 is not only quite a silly noir but is an implausible unmitigated bore of a movie 0 
the reception is excellent 1 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
the ambience is wonderful and there is music playing 1 
we arent ones to make a scene at restaurants but i just dont get itdefinitely lost the love after this one 0 
one of the most disappointing aspects is the lack of notable gore 0 
item does not match picture 0 
this item worked great but it broke after 6 months of use 0 
the attempts at humor were pitiful and story is so awful it dosent bear thinking about which basically involves a vulcan stealing the enterprise to find god seriously i just didnt care about any of this film and oh not to mention uhura does a belly dance to distract male guards 0 
does not work 0 
the battery is unreliable as well as the service use antena 0 
of course the acting is blah 0 
reaching for the bottom row is uncomfortable and the send and end keys are not where i expect them to be3 0 
i am very impressed with this headset from plantronics 1 
horrible 0 
its the best headset i have used 1 
the plot has more holes than a pair of fishnet stockings and the direction and editing is astonishingly ham fisted 0 
defective crap 0 
the attractive set used throughout most of the film is an eyepleasing gem 1 
superb phone on a great network 1 
i rather enjoyed it 1 
it deserves strong love 1 
the poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying 0 
integrated seamlessly with the motorola razr phone 1 
the best scene in the movie was when gerardo is trying to find a song that keeps running through his head 1 
after arguing with verizon regarding the dropped calls we returned the phones after two days 0 
everything about this film is simply incredible 1 
i believe that pitch black was done well 1 
today the graphics are crap 0 
very bad experience 0 
reversible plug works great 1 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
we got sitting fairly fast but ended up waiting 40 minutes just to place our order another 30 minutes before the food arrived 0 
i advise you to look out for it 1 
the story is lame not interesting and never really explains the sinister origins of the puppets 0 
im so sorry but i really cant recommend it to anyone 0 
nice docking station for home or work 1 
otherwise easy to install and use clear sound 1 
definitely worth seeing its the sort of thought provoking film that forces you to question your own threshold of loneliness 1 
ive only had my bluetooth for a few weeks but i really like it 1 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
the cast was great 1 
first off the reception sucks i have never had more than 2 bars ever 0 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
then a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use 0 
doesnt do the job 0 
the scallop dish is quite appalling for value as well 0 
so in a nutshell 1 the restaraunt smells like a combination of a dirty fish market and a sewer 0 
great food 1 
but the actingeven that of such professionals as drago and debbie rochonwas terrible the directing worse perhaps contributory to the former the dialog chimplike and the camera work barely tolerable 0 
my only complaint is the standard sound volume is a little low even when turned up to 5of 5 0 
my fella got the huevos rancheros and they didnt look too appealing 0 
the mic there is a joke and the volume is quite low 0 
i would recommend purchasing the jabra jx10 series 2 which works flawlessly with my moto q go figure 1 
light weight i hardly notice it is there 1 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
i got the aluminum case for my new palm vx and it worked really wellit has protected my handheld perfectly so far 1 
dont buy this product 0 
does not fit 0 
service sucks 0 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
if you are razr owneryou must have this 1 
the only place good for this film is in the garbage 0 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
im not eating here 0 
the price was very good and with the free shipping and all it was a good purchase 1 
i consider this theft 0 
the cg opening sequence in space looked like it could have been created on microsoft slideshow for gods sake 0 
this place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver 0 
it is the best charger i have seen on the market yet 1 
it is rare when a filmmaker takes the time to tell a worthy moral tale with care and love that doesnt fall into the trap of being overly syrupy or over indulgent 1 
first the bathrooms at this location were dirty seat covers were not replenished just plain yucky 0 
clever and a real crowdpleaserthis film still ranks among mickeys best films even after 80 wonderful years 1 
great movie 1 
but the premise of the film was so ridiculous that the president of the us 0 
the live music on fridays totally blows 0 
the menu had so much good stuff on it i could not decide 1 
if i take a picture the battery drops a bar and starts beeping letting me know its dieing 0 
there were too many close ups 0 
piece of junk 0 
aailiyah was pretty good as akasha in places compelling her first entrance and mini dance scene 1 
an italian reviewer called this a small great film and thats right 1 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
first off the reception sucks i have never had more than 2 bars ever 0 
the phone gets extremely hot 0 
our server was super nice and checked on us many times 1 
setup couldnt have been simpler 1 
great software for motorolas 1 
the delivery was on time 1 
the volume for the ringer is real good you have choices how loud 1 
i found this move beautiful enjoyable and uplifting 1 
i mean in a realistic world she would never have gotten into that ballet repertory the whole thing was quite pathetic 0 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
at first i thought i was grtting a good deal at 744 until i plugged it into my phone v3c razr 0 
the death row scenes were entirely unmoving 0 
love the margaritas too 1 
i love this phone it is very handy and has a lot of features 1 
i mean in a realistic world she would never have gotten into that ballet repertory the whole thing was quite pathetic 0 
obviously they have a terrible customer service so you get what you pay for 0 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
i love the pho and the spring rolls oh so yummy you have to try 1 
your brain will attempt to shutdown as part of a primal impulse of selfpreservation 0 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
not easy to watch 0 
however the ear pads come off easily and after only one week i lost one 0 
i love this device 1 
we arent ones to make a scene at restaurants but i just dont get itdefinitely lost the love after this one 0 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
overall i was not impressed and would not go back 0 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
the acting helps the writing along very well maybe the idiotsavant sister could have been played better and it is a real joy to watch 1 
it is zillion times away from reality 0 
yes its shiny on front side and i love it 1 
my salad had a bland vinegrette on the baby greens and hearts of palm 0 
the lighting is awful 0 
there was no chemistry between ben affleck and sandra bullock in this film and i couldnt understand why he would consider even leaving his wifetobe for this chick that he supposedly was knocked out by 0 
worked perfectly 1 
this is actually a very smart movie 1 
im not really sure how joeys was voted best hot dog in the valley by readers of phoenix magazine 0 
gotta love those closeups of slimy drooling teeth 1 
it is an hour and half waste of time following a bunch of very pretty high schoolers whine and cry about life 0 
saw the movie today and thought it was a good effort good messages for kids 1 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
the acting helps the writing along very well maybe the idiotsavant sister could have been played better and it is a real joy to watch 1 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
dont make the same mistake i did 0 
the design is very odd as the ear clip is not very comfortable at all 0 
glad i didnt pay to see it 0 
i ordered the lemon raspberry ice cocktail which was also incredible 1 
an instant classic with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits 1 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
this game rocks 1 
then a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use 0 
i gave it 5 stars then and im giving it 5 stars now 1 
on the negative its insipid enough to cause regret for another 2 hours of life wasted in front of the screen 0 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
he really didnt seem to want to be hosting his voiceovers were monotonous didnt get involved with the guests 0 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
glad i didnt pay to see it 0 
people couldnt hear me talk and i had to pull out the earphone and talk on the phone 0 
customer service was terrible 0 
excellent bluetooth headset 1 
imdb ratings only go as low 1 for awful its time to get some negative numbers in there for cases such as these 0 
the tracfonewebsite is user friendly and makes it easy toactivate etc 1 
jamie foxx absolutely is ray charles 1 
the soundtrack wasnt terrible either 1 
her role was played well 1 
you learn a lot about the real inside emotions of people in this movie and a lot about the movie business itself 1 
this is a simple little phone to use but the breakage is unacceptible 0 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
the sweet potato tots were good but the onion rings were perfection or as close as i have had 1 
each track commands sentiment actually contributing to the scenes and characters 1 
ive had better not only from dedicated boba tea spots but even from jenni pho 0 
it sure does beat the nachos at the movies but i would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant 0 
i asked multiple times for the wine list and after some time of being ignored i went to the hostess and got one myself 0 
this is a great phone 1 
she ordered a toasted english muffin that came out untoasted 0 
i really do recommend this place you can go wrong with this donut place 1 
the real killer is the volume and of course it breaking 0 
things that went wrong they burned the saganaki 0 
a standout scene 1 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
superb phone on a great network 1 
disappointing experience 0 
good case excellent value 1 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
food quality has been horrible 0 
i really wanted the plantronics 510 to be the right one but it has too many issues for methe good 0 
mobile phone tools are a must have 1 
the plastic breaks really easy on this clip 0 
one of the worst shows of all time 0 
the live music on fridays totally blows 0 
but what really made it unwatchable was the direction 0 
pretty awesome place 1 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
avoid at all costs 0 
the only suspense i was feeling was the frustration at just how retarded the girls were 0 
even allowing for poor production values for the time 1971 and the format some kind of miniseries this is baaaaaad 0 
this one works and was priced right 1 
ryans bar is definitely one edinburgh establishment i wont be revisiting 0 
overall i am psyched to have a phone which has all my appointments and contacts in and gets great reception 1 
delete this film from your mind 0 
service stinks here 0 
this place deserves one star and 90 has to do with the food 0 
after watching this film i wanted to learn more about the works of this artist 1 
not too screamy not to masculine but just right 1 
being a 90s child i truly enjoyed this show and i can proudly say that i enjoyed it big time and even more than the classical wb cartoons 1 
overall a delight 1 
nice ambiance 1 
this phone is very fast with sending any kind of messages and web browsing is significantly faster than previous phones i have used 1 
do not buy do not buyit sucks 0 
doesnt hold charge 0 
an instant classic with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits 1 
so bad 0 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
i believe that pitch black was done well 1 
very poor service 0 
the art style has the appearance of crayonpencil drawings and is wonderfully colorful and fanciful 1 
dont make the same mistake i did 0 
this product is great it makes working a lot easier i can go to the copier while waiting on hold for something 1 
this is one of the better buffets that i have been to 1 
not too screamy not to masculine but just right 1 
gotta love those closeups of slimy drooling teeth 1 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
definitely worth checking out 1 
lucy bell is so much higher than this crap and for her to sink this low is quite depressing 0 
best tater tots in the southwest 1 
if you do watch it however there are small consolations the actresses playing annes sisters each do a wonderful job with their roles 1 
the vegetables are so fresh and the sauce feels like authentic thai 1 
everything stinks 0 
the explosion of the gas tanks at the end was just as awful 0 
service is friendly and inviting 1 
adapter does not provide enough charging current 0 
the calls drop the phone comes on and off at will the screen goes black and the worst of all it stops ringing intermittently 0 
all in all a great disappointment 0 
a must study for anyone interested in the worst sins of industrial design 0 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
unfortunately this is a bad movie that is just plain bad 0 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
this is a great little item 1 
what a mistake 0 
good food good service 1 
i have been very happy with the 510 and have had no complaints from any one regarding my sound quality on their end 1 
im translating movies for a living and this is the first movie in my 5year working experience that i found offensive to my intelligence 0 
it is shameful 0 
lasted one day and then blew up 0 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
after my phone got to be about a year old its been slowly breaking despite much care on my part 0 
i have been to very few places to eat that under no circumstances would i ever return to and this tops the list 0 
its not what it says it is 0 
there were too many close ups 0 
linksys should have some way to exchange a bad phone for a refurb unit or something 0 
everything from acting to cinematography was solid 1 
anyways the food was definitely not filling at all and for the price you pay you should expect more 0 
poor product 0 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
when my mom and i got home she immediately got sick and she only had a few bites of salad 0 
this is a great product sure beats using your fingers 1 
the art style has the appearance of crayonpencil drawings and is wonderfully colorful and fanciful 1 
this early film from future goremeister lucio fulci is a very good addition to the giallo subgenre 1 
i dont have to be an accountant to know im getting screwed 0 
call me a nut but i think this is one of the best movies ever 1 
also the fries are without a doubt the worst fries ive ever had 0 
the igo chargers and tips are really great 1 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
great earpiece 1 
i wouldnt see this movie again for free 0 
lame would be the best way to describe it 0 
garbo who showed right off the bat that her talents could carry over from the silent era i wanted to see some of her silent work but netflix doesnt seem to be stocking them 1 
but it wasnt anything at all just one big yawn 0 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
the color is even prettier than i thought it would be and the graphics are incredibly sharp 1 
of all the dishes the salmon was the best but all were great 1 
this place is disgusting 0 
its quite simply the highest most superlative form of cinema imaginable 1 
i live in the neighborhood so i am disappointed i wont be back here because it is a convenient location 0 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
very disappointing 0 
110 and only because there is no setting for 010 0 
it also took her forever to bring us the check when we asked for it 0 
i have read others reviews here but i havent had any problem with it 1 
spend your money elsewhere 0 
this is probably one of the least effective and utterly unoriginal films i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
and then tragedy struck 0 
i consider this theft 0 
the soundtrack sucked 0 
it always cuts out and makes a beep beep beep sound then says signal failed 0 
this is a great restaurant at the mandalay bay 1 
they are so easy to love but even more easy to identify with 1 
the refried beans that came with my meal were dried out and crusty and the food was bland 0 
this blueant supertooth handsfree phone speaker is awesome 1 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
my boyfriend and i sat at the bar and had a completely delightful experience 1 
this is a simple little phone to use but the breakage is unacceptible 0 
i received my headset in good time and was happy with it 1 
i think not again 0 
happy so far 1 
very good quality though 1 
the 12 mega pixel camera being a part of a phone is reasonably good7 1 
some highlights great quality nigiri here 1 
poor sound quality 0 
server did a great job handling our large rowdy table 1 
the movie lacks visual interest drama expression of feeling and celebration of the very patriotism that underlines the narrative 0 
the characters are interesting and you want to find out more about them the longer the movie goes on and i think people will be surprised by who does and doesnt make it 1 
i am far from a sushi connoisseur but i can definitely tell the difference between good food and bad food and this was certainly bad food 0 
i ordered the lemon raspberry ice cocktail which was also incredible 1 
customer service was terrible 0 
i believe the screenwriter did a good job of tying up the loose ends 1 
be sure to order dessert even if you need to pack it togo the tiramisu and cannoli are both to die for 1 
it presents a idyllic yet serious portrayal of the ups and downs of the characters lives 1 
it really created a unique feeling though 1 
her role was played well 1 
same evening him and i are both drastically sick 0 
the food was very good 1 
the chains which im no fan of beat this place easily 0 
works great 1 
the cashier was friendly and even brought the food out to me 1 
it was forced like everything in this movie 0 
and those baby owls were adorable 1 
anyways the food was definitely not filling at all and for the price you pay you should expect more 0 
very disappointed in accessoryone 0 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
the movie seemed a little slow at first 0 
it is an insane game 1 
this is a great restaurant at the mandalay bay 1 
do not waste your time 0 
howeverthe riingtones are not the best and neither are the games 0 
disappointed 0 
will be back again 1 
ive never been more insulted or felt disrespected 0 
bad fit way too big 0 
it was attached to a gas station and that is rarely a good sign 0 
the food was terrible 0 
the best part about nurse betty is its unpredictability 1 
for readers who have already seen one of miyazakis films he is still in top form and made another worthwhile experience 1 
i checked out this place a couple years ago and was not impressed 0 
i dont think ive ever gone to a movie and disliked it as much 0 
im a big fan of this series mostly due to anne rices style sensitivities and treatments 1 
poor talk time performance 0 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
i kept catching the cable on the seat and i had to pull the phone out to turn it on an off 0 
waaaaaayyyyyyyyyy over rated is all i am saying 0 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
great product 1 
worst service to boot but that is the least of their worries 0 
great character actors telly savalas and peter boyle 1 
you can find better movies at youtube 0 
worst thai ever 0 
a piece of cinematic garbage captured on celluloid 0 
very good food great atmosphere1 1 
much better than the other ayce sushi place i went to in vegas 1 
in a word it is embarrassing 0 
save your money ive had this item for 11 months now 0 
would recommend this item 1 
it quit working after id used it for about 18 months so i just purchased another one because this is the best headset ive ever owned 1 
definitely a bargain 1 
it is cheap and it feel and look just as cheap 0 
bad reception 0 
their onscreen chemistry critical to the entire film is genuine 1 
an italian reviewer called this a small great film and thats right 1 
the plot has more holes than a pair of fishnet stockings and the direction and editing is astonishingly ham fisted 0 
even if you love bad movies do not watch this movie 0 
his performance is simply genius 1 
design flaw 0 
bad fit way too big 0 
there is a totally unnecessary trainroller coaster scene 0
