very good phone 1 
easy to pair with my samsung cell 1 
the charger worked for about a week and then completely stopped charging my phone 0 
if you stay in vegas you must get breakfast here at least once 1 
price is good too 1 
enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film 1 
timely shipment and quality product 1 
the music in the film is really nice too 1 
they have a really nice atmosphere 1 
the roast beef sandwich tasted really good 1 
and i just love the colors 1 
and it was boring 0 
much less than the jawbone i was going to replace it with 1 
one of the worst shows of all time 0 
i will continue to come here on ladies night andddd date night highly recommend this place to anyone who is in the area 1 
very disappointed 0 
the best place in vegas for breakfast just check out a sat or sun 1 
and dont even get me started on the jerky camerawork 0 
so i bought about 10 of these and saved alot of money 1 
lastly the mozzarella sticks they were the best thing we ordered 1 
its quite simply the highest most superlative form of cinema imaginable 1 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
terrible service 0 
the portion was huge 1 
cumbersome design 0 
often the dialogue doesnt really follow from one line to another or fit the surroundings 0 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
youll love it 1 
a good commentary of todays love and undoubtedly a film worth seeing 1 
her lines seem to have been written by a fifteen year old though they are trying oh so so hard to sound like how a fifteen year old would really um you know well talk 0 
but if you liked movies like the matrix and better yet their sequels i think youll appreciate the thought provoking mindblowing experience this film will give you 1 
great hands free device 1 
but the premise of the film was so ridiculous that the president of the us 0 
not worth it 0 
over rated 0 
steamboat willie is an amazingly important film to our cinema history 1 
everything about this film is simply incredible 1 
i left the theater with a lilt in my step joy in my heart and hope for the human race 1 
the best electronics of the available fm transmitters 1 
anyways the food was definitely not filling at all and for the price you pay you should expect more 0 
this is a stunning movie 1 
if you see it you should probably just leave it on the shelf 0 
and the accents are absolutely abysmal 0 
and the chef was generous with his time even came around twice so we can take pictures with him 1 
2 times very bad customer service 0 
easy to use 1 
food was really boring 0 
this item is great installed it let it charged up overnite and it has been working good every since with no problems 1 
they are so cool 1 
the phone takes forever to charge like 2 to 5 hours literally 0 
the food was great as always compliments to the chef 1 
waitress was a little slow in service 0 
the steak and the shrimp are in my opinion the best entrees at gc 1 
the wind and the lion is well written and superbly acted 1 
go watch it 1 
ive also had problems with the phone reading the memory card in which i always turn it on and then off again 0 
it looked like a wonderful story 1 
nice quality build unlike some cheap s out there 1 
i really dont see how anyone could enjoy this movie 0 
the ri style calamari was a joke 0 
maybe its just their vegetarian fare but ive been twice and i thought it was average at best 0 
all the other cases ive tried normally fall apart after a few months but this one seems to be in for the long haul 1 
this place is pretty good nice little vibe in the restaurant 1 
to my disbelief each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods i have ever tasted 0 
if you see it you should probably just leave it on the shelf 0 
then a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use 0 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
portable and it works 1 
very disappointing 0 
unless youre just out to visually collect all extant films of austens work you can skip this one 0 
the screen does get smudged easily because it touches your ear and face 0 
it is just the sort of pap that is screened in the afternoon to punish the unemployed for not having jobs 0 
its a fresh subtle and rather sublime effect 1 
there still are good actors around 1 
the story starts too fast with absolutely no suspense or buildup in the slightest 0 
battery life is real good 1 
a drive thru means you do not want to wait around for half an hour for your food but somehow when we end up going here they make us wait and wait 0 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0 
i was very disappointed in the movie 0 
the sound quality is excellent as well 1 
the acting is beyond abysmal 0 
the acting was bad 0 
so they performed 1 
you wont regret it 1 
that movie was bad 0 
these products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet 0 
wow very spicy but delicious 1 
the han nan chicken was also very tasty 1 
if you love death and decay and shakespears lyrics this is the one 1 
worthless product 0 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
the speaker is of low quality so as making the ring tones sound very cheap 0 
so anyone near you will hear part of your conversation 0 
i recommend igo to anyone with different brand cell phonesmp3 players in the family 1 
the staff is great the food is delish and they have an incredible beer selection 1 
sooooo good 1 
great phone 1 
on the up side their cafe serves really good food 1 
your servers suck wait correction our server heimer sucked 0 
i would not recommend this place 0 
wed definitely go back here again 1 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
i am also very happy with the price 1 
only like 3 or 4 buildings used a couple of locations maybe poor hummh 0 
i felt as though her going to ireland did absolutely nothing whatsoever 0 
doesnt do the job 0 
owners are really great people 1 
this is an unbelievable bargain 1 
works like a charm it work the same as the one i got with the phone 1 
definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly will return next time im in vegas 1 
this may be the only bad film he ever made 0 
by far the best cheesecurds we have ever had 1 
if you do go see this movie bring a pillow or a girlfriendboyfriend to keep you occupied through out 0 
i think i was one of the people who found this another one of roths pearls 1 
plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job 1 
we are sending it back 0 
first of all there are enough racial stereotypes and racial jokes to offend everyone 0 
there is really nothing for me at postinos hope your experience is better 0 
emily watsons character is very strong and she has only to give a quick glance and you understand everything 1 
this was such an awesome movie that i bought it off of ebay 1 
i am very happy 1 
having trouble with volume 0 
the service here leaves a lot to be desired 0 
very happy with this product 1 
this film offers many delights and surprises 1 
this scene is very strong and unpleasant 0 
unfortunately it will not recharge my iphone 4s despite connecting it from multiple power sources imac external battery wall outlet etc 0 
it has been a winner for us 1 
i have bought this nokia cell phone a few weeks ago and it was a nightmare 0 
the dining space is tiny but elegantly decorated and comfortable 1 
well never go again 0 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
the service was meh 0 
plus its only 8 bucks 1 
pretty piece of junk 0 
it works fine on my motorola 325 cellphone and a lot better than the wornout battery did 1 
i immediately said i wanted to talk to the manager but i did not want to talk to the guy who was doing shots of fireball behind the bar 0 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
dont buy this product it fails 0 
bland and flavorless is a good way of describing the barely tepid meat 0 
why was this film made 0 
both great 1 
ray charles is legendary 1 
none of them are engaging or exciting 0 
the charger worked for about a week and then completely stopped charging my phone 0 
not even good for camp value 0 
will never ever go back 0 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
i dont understand how this garbage got on the shelves of the movie store its not even a real movie 0 
a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it 1 
this film offers many delights and surprises 1 
the jamaican mojitos are delicious 1 
at around 4 pm i bought it at around 8pm i started to watch at around 815pm i fast forwarded the remaining film to see if there was anything left watchable for a human being with a brain but there wasnt 0 
he is an amazing film artist one of the most important whoever lived 1 
it also had a new problem 0 
an absolute must visit 1 
i cannot believe that the actors agreed to do this film 0 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
the instruction manual is lacking 0 
you wont regret it 1 
my sashimi was poor quality being soggy and tasteless 0 
problem is that the ear loops are made of weak material and break easily 0 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
the cashew cream sauce was bland and the vegetables were undercooked 0 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
i found this move beautiful enjoyable and uplifting 1 
if you havent choked in your own vomit by the end by all the cheap drama and worthless dialogue youve must have bored yourself to death with this waste of time 0 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
i highly recommend this modest priced cellular phone 1 
great phone 1 
but i thought his acting was skilled 1 
heres where the movie really pied me off 0 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
reaching for the bottom row is uncomfortable and the send and end keys are not where i expect them to be3 0 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
wow very spicy but delicious 1 
its just painful 0 
how can that bethe audio quality is poor 0 
this movie is terrible 0 
i would avoid this place if you are staying in the mirage 0 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
if you have not seen this movie i definitely recommend it 1 
this one works and was priced right 1 
i probably wont be coming back here 0 
dont waste your money 0 
macbeth jason connery moved me to tears with his final monolog out brief candle outhe gave the sphere of moral decay and dark forces a human face which makes it the more interesting 1 
i found this move beautiful enjoyable and uplifting 1 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
if you do go see this movie bring a pillow or a girlfriendboyfriend to keep you occupied through out 0 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
the new characters werent all that memorable and i found myself forgetting who was who 0 
this is a masterful piece of filmmaking with many themes simmering and occasionally boiling over in this warts and all study of the poets bohemian selfindulgent wartime years that span the aerial bombardments of london and the outward tranquillity of a welsh coastal retreat the borderlines between friendship lust and love dedication to art and experience versus practical concerns jealousy rivalry cowardice and egotism versus heroism and selfsacrifice and more 1 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
the acting sucks the music sucks the script sucks the pacing sucks the special fx suck the directing sucks basically this movie sucks 0 
lucy bell is so much higher than this crap and for her to sink this low is quite depressing 0 
one of the best mexican movies ever and one of the less understood even by mexican themselves no matter how identified the should have felt with it 1 
did not like at all 0 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
last night was my second time dining here and i was so happy i decided to go back 1 
we made the drive all the way from north scottsdale and i was not one bit disappointed 1 
then as if i hadnt wasted enough of my life there they poured salt in the wound by drawing out the time it took to bring the check 0 
camera color balance is awful 0 
i liked it 1 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
the story itself is just predictable and lazy 0 
id love to go back 1 
it looked like a wonderful story 1 
delicious and i will absolutely be back 1 
any ring toneoverall good phone to buy 1 
i would give this television series a 10 plus if i could 1 
yes its shiny on front side and i love it 1 
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1 
great pocket pc phone combination 1 
they have great dinners 1 
this item is great installed it let it charged up overnite and it has been working good every since with no problems 1 
food was really good and i got full petty fast 1 
it has northern humour and positive about the community it represents 1 
very unreliable service from tmobile 0 
this would not even be good as a made for tv flick 0 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
how stupid is that 0 
this movie creates its own universe and is fascinating in every way 1 
director paul matthews who also wrotedirected the weak 1995 monster movie grim clearly doesnt know how to pace his films 0 
this phone is pretty sturdy and ive never had any large problems with it 1 
they are so cool 1 
this allows the possibility of double booking for the same date and time after the first 0 
mic doesnt work 0 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
shes poised and amazing 1 
the only thing worse than taylors acting was stanwycks singing 0 
another thing i didnt really like is when a character got punched in the face a gallon of blood would spew forth soon after 0 
but she is still a bad actress repeating her robotic face moves in each of her pictures 0 
the selection was probably the worst ive seen in vegasthere was none 0 
the only good thing was our waiter he was very helpful and kept the bloddy marys coming 1 
id say that would be the hardest decision honestly all of ms dishes taste how they are supposed to taste amazing 1 
i totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is 1 
this phone tries very hard to do everything but fails at its very ability to be a phone 0 
the portion was huge 1 
the burger i got the gold standard a 17 burger and was kind of disappointed 0 
it quit working after id used it for about 18 months so i just purchased another one because this is the best headset ive ever owned 1 
great phone 1 
in an interesting part of town this place is amazing 1 
so far it has worked like a charm 1 
i got the car charger and not even after a week the charger was brokeni went to plug it in and it started smoking 0 
its pretty easy 1 
sauce was tasteless 0 
its a fresh subtle and rather sublime effect 1 
this blueant supertooth handsfree phone speaker is awesome 1 
w810i is just superb 1 
i cant wait to go back 1 
i have read others reviews here but i havent had any problem with it 1 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
it even has its sweet moments 1 
i thought errol flynn was brilliant as custer and has since become my favourite actor 1 
im trying to return it for a refund 0 
its a total package 1 
the owners really really need to quit being soooooo cheap let them wrap my freaking sandwich in two papers not one 0 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
great steak great sides great wine amazing desserts 1 
i still maintain that monkeys shouldnt make headphones we just obviously dont share enough dna to copy the design over to humans 0 
it works fine on my motorola 325 cellphone and a lot better than the wornout battery did 1 
the worst sappiest dialogue i could go on and on 0 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
walked in and the place smelled like an old grease trap and only 2 others there eating 0 
the waitresses are very friendly 1 
that was done in the second movie 0 
very nice and relaxing late night viewing 1 
the place was fairly clean but the food simply wasnt worth it 0 
this was my first time and i cant wait until the next 1 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
the tracfonewebsite is user friendly and makes it easy toactivate etc 1 
the dining space is tiny but elegantly decorated and comfortable 1 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
disappointed 0 
the plastic breaks really easy on this clip 0 
not a good item it worked for a while then started having problems in my auto reverse tape player 0 
when my mom and i got home she immediately got sick and she only had a few bites of salad 0 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
this is probably one of the least effective and utterly unoriginal films i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
worst customer service 0 
great steak great sides great wine amazing desserts 1 
how awesome is that 1 
the cast is good 1 
for service i give them no stars 0 
at no point in the proceedings does it look remotely like america 0 
worst ever 0 
this is the first phone ive had that has been so cheaply made 0 
weve have gotten a much better service from the pizza place next door than the services we received from this restaurant 0 
i am a fan of his this movie sucked really bad 0 
you get extra minutes so that you can carry out the call and not get cut off 1 
as for the killer dont expect anything original or even remotely frightening 0 
razr battery good buy 1 
this is one of the worst sandra bullock movie since speed 2 but not quite that bad 0 
we had a group of 70 when we claimed we would only have 40 and they handled us beautifully 1 
it was delicious 1 
the majority of the logitech earbud headsets failed 0 
if you look for authentic thai food go else where 0 
i bought this battery with a coupon from amazon and im very happy with my purchase 1 
best of all is the rotating feature very helpful 1 
great pizza and salads 1 
service was fantastic 1 
a piece of cinematic garbage captured on celluloid 0 
very disappointed 0 
hence the whole story lacks a certain energy 0 
verizons bills however are difficult to understand even though their pricing plans are simple 0 
great place fo take out or eat in 1 
an hour seriously 0 
initially the local sites in the film which was filmed here in buffalo intrigued me 1 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
i cant wait to go back 1 
seriously its not worth wasting your or your kids time on 0 
thus far have only visited twice and the food was absolutely delicious each time 1 
omit watching this 0 
hitchcock is a great director 1 
this one wants to surf on the small wave of space movies in 1998 deep impact and armageddon and this one fails everywhere 0 
the attempts at humor were pitiful and story is so awful it dosent bear thinking about which basically involves a vulcan stealing the enterprise to find god seriously i just didnt care about any of this film and oh not to mention uhura does a belly dance to distract male guards 0 
hot dishes are not hot cold dishes are close to room tempi watched staff prepare food with bare hands no gloveseverything is deep fried in oil 0 
again no plot at all 0 
as for the service im a fan because its quick and youre being served by some nice folks 1 
i got the car charger and not even after a week the charger was brokeni went to plug it in and it started smoking 0 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
i will come back here every time im in vegas 1 
muddy low quality sound and the casing around the wires insert was poorly super glued and slid off 0 
talk about useless customer service 0 
that being said for a phone the camera is very nice many cool effects to play with and video is decent as well 1 
i went on motorolas website and followed all directions but could not get it to pair again 0 
works good 1 
no plot whatsoever 0 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
it is the best charger i have seen on the market yet 1 
im super pissd 0 
used and dirty 0 
all the other cases ive tried normally fall apart after a few months but this one seems to be in for the long haul 1 
at first glance it is a lovely bakery cafe nice ambiance clean friendly staff 1 
worst martini ever 0 
1 hour 54 minutes of sheer tedium melodrama and horrible acting a mess of a script and a sinking feeling of good lord what were they thinking 0 
i find wasting food to be despicable but this just wasnt food 0 
sending it back 0 
those burgers were amazing 1 
not much seafood and like 5 strings of pasta at the bottom 0 
i cant wait to go back 1 
ill give this film 10 out of 10 1 
at no point in the proceedings does it look remotely like america 0 
for those that havent seen it dont waste your time 0 
it is worth the drive 1 
also great directing and photography 1 
does not work 0 
end of days is one of the worst bigbudget action movies ive ever seen 0 
this case seems well made 1 
worked great 1 
the only consistent thread holding the series together were the amazing performances of leni parker and anita laselva as the two taelons in quiet idealogical conflict 0 
i liked it 1 
con spotty service 0 
greatno problems at all 1 
i have had problems wit hit dropping signal and more 0 
linked to my phone without effort 1 
the only thing i wasnt too crazy about was their guacamole as i dont like it puréed 0 
the cable looks so thin and flimsy it is scary 0 
this is a really fantastic thai restaurant which is definitely worth a visit 1 
i ate there twice on my last visit and especially enjoyed the salmon salad 1 
dont waste your money 0 
it is very educational for children 1 to 8 years old 1 
first time there and might just be the last 0 
why was this film made 0 
lasted one day and then blew up 0 
no real improvement 0 
do not waste your time 0 
i had absolutely no problem with this headset linking to my 8530 blackberry curve 1 
third the cheese on my friends burger was cold 0 
these are the nicest restaurant owners ive ever come across 1 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
some applause should be given to the prelude however 1 
both of them were truly unbelievably good and i am so glad we went back 1 
i really recommend this faceplates since it looks very nice elegant and cool 1 
i felt insulted and disrespected how could you talk and judge another human being like that 0 
this early film from future goremeister lucio fulci is a very good addition to the giallo subgenre 1 
we made the drive all the way from north scottsdale and i was not one bit disappointed 1 
the nano stated itmy son was dissapointed 0 
not good when wearing a hat or sunglasses 0 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
ray charles is legendary 1 
kris kristoffersen is good in this movie and really makes a difference 1 
doesnt do the job 0 
i believe that pitch black was done well 1 
it is a really good show to watch 1 
gets a signal when other verizon phones wont 1 
great place to relax and have an awesome burger and beer 1 
this movie is terrible 0 
leopard print is wonderfully wild 1 
try them in the airport to experience some tasty food and speedy friendly service 1 
if you stay in vegas you must get breakfast here at least once 1 
here in the wind and the lion we see a wonderful rendering of americas own imperial age 1 
i agree with jessica this movie is pretty bad 0 
steamboat willie is an amazingly important film to our cinema history 1 
these are the central themes of the film and they are handled ineptly stereotypically and with no depth of imagination 0 
our server was super nice and checked on us many times 1 
would not reccommend 0 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
excellent hands free tool 1 
eew this location needs a complete overhaul 0 
the only thing that i think could improve is the sound leaks out from the headset 0 
this early film from future goremeister lucio fulci is a very good addition to the giallo subgenre 1 
then as if i hadnt wasted enough of my life there they poured salt in the wound by drawing out the time it took to bring the check 0 
the service was great even the manager came and helped with our table 1 
im translating movies for a living and this is the first movie in my 5year working experience that i found offensive to my intelligence 0 
this case has passed the one year mark and while it shows signs of wear it is 100 functional 1 
however the ear pads come off easily and after only one week i lost one 0 
it isnt even an achievement as a sobaditsgood or sobaditsmemorable movie 0 
great for the jawbone 1 
went for lunch service was slow 0 
the food came out at a good pace 1 
i am so tired of clichés that is just lazy writing and here they come in thick and fast 0 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
this is some seriously good pizza and im an expertconnisseur on the topic 1 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
you cant beat that 1 
doesnt do the job 0 
this place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver 0 
i dont understand how this garbage got on the shelves of the movie store its not even a real movie 0 
it was pretty gross 0 
i tried the cape cod ravoli chickenwith cranberrymmmm 1 
dont waste your time watching this rubbish nonresearched film 0 
the design is very odd as the ear clip is not very comfortable at all 0 
and considering the two of us left there very full and happy for about 20 you just cant go wrong 1 
youll love it 1 
i ended up sliding it on the edge of my pants or back pockets instead 1 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
an absolute must visit 1 
10 out of 10 for both the movie and trilogy 1 
im glad i found this product on amazon it is hard to find it wasnt high priced 1 
in conclusion i will not bother with this movie because a volcano in los angeles is nothing but nonsense 0 
food was good service was good prices were good 1 
as a courtroom drama its compelling as an indictment on the american justice system its frightening 1 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
after all the rave reviews i couldnt wait to eat herewhat a disappointment 0 
ive missed numerous calls because of this reason 0 
for the price on amazon it is an excellent product which i would highly recommend 1 
voice recognition is tremendous 1 
end of days is one of the worst bigbudget action movies ive ever seen 0 
low quality 0 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
you get incredibly fresh fish prepared with care 1 
feelings thoughtsgabriels discomfort during the danceall these intangibles leap to life and come within the viewers grasp in hustons portrayal 1 
ive had better not only from dedicated boba tea spots but even from jenni pho 0 
these are the nicest restaurant owners ive ever come across 1 
brilliance indeed 1 
the battery is working well as a replacement for the original that came with the phone over 2 years ago 1 
special mention should be made of the superb music score and sound effects which are an integral element in helping to make this such a memorable and enjoyable cartoon 1 
the acting helps the writing along very well maybe the idiotsavant sister could have been played better and it is a real joy to watch 1 
food is way overpriced and portions are fucking small 0 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
crostini that came with the salad was stale 0 
both of them were truly unbelievably good and i am so glad we went back 1 
i really enjoyed eating here 1 
the plot has more holes than a pair of fishnet stockings and the direction and editing is astonishingly ham fisted 0 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
lasted one day and then blew up 0 
terrible phone holder 0 
pretty cool i would say 1 
the story is beyond stupid 0 
the kids are very cool too 1 
too bad you have to pay up to a month for the service 0 
but when someone strives for greatness and poetry but delivers a muddled and often ridiculous story a bunch of disparate scenes pretentious dialogue then you get the worst kind of a movie that some other reviewer very accurately defined as pretentious crap 0 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
a good time 1 
when i received my pita it was huge it did have a lot of meat in it so thumbs up there 1 
i think that it is a must see older john wayne film 1 
the writer gorman bechard undoubtedly did his homework because all references are industry and characterage appropriate 1 
best of all is the rotating feature very helpful 1 
ive never been more insulted or felt disrespected 0 
it really created a unique feeling though 1 
i gave it 5 stars then and im giving it 5 stars now 1 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
the nachos are a must have 1 
this blueant supertooth handsfree phone speaker is awesome 1 
for service i give them no stars 0 
regardless the film fails on most levels 0 
his use of the colours of the french flag in the three films was nothing short of incredible every shot every scene was like a work of art 1 
i dont think ill be running back to carlys anytime soon for food 0 
great time family dinner on a sunday night 1 
i would not recommend this place 0 
what did bother me was the slow service 0 
i have never had such bland food which surprised me considering the article we read focused so much on their spices and flavor 0 
hot dishes are not hot cold dishes are close to room tempi watched staff prepare food with bare hands no gloveseverything is deep fried in oil 0 
check it out 1 
ive also had problems with the phone reading the memory card in which i always turn it on and then off again 0 
i rate this movie 910 1 
it was just too horrible 0 
but other than that the movie seemed to drag and the heroes didnt really work for their freedom 0 
audio quality is poor very poor 0 
this place is overpriced not consistent with their boba and it really is overpriced 0 
the chicken dishes are ok the beef is like shoe leather 0 
not sure who was more lost the flat characters or the audience nearly half of whom walked out 0 
mishima is extremely uninteresting 0 
thank you for such great service 1 
ill even say it again  this is torture 0 
what on earth is irons doing in this film 0 
i own a jabra earset and was very happy with it but the sound quality especially outgoing on this is better 1 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
nargile i think you are great 1 
my only problem is i thought the actor playing the villain was a low rent michael ironside 0 
i really hope the team behind this movie makes more movies and that they will continue to do so in their own some kinda weird style 1 
all in all its an insult to ones intelligence and a huge waste of money 0 
the reception is excellent 1 
echo problemvery unsatisfactory 0 
doesnt do the job 0 
1 hour 54 minutes of sheer tedium melodrama and horrible acting a mess of a script and a sinking feeling of good lord what were they thinking 0 
we have gotten a lot of compliments on it 1 
battery life is real good 1 
hard to judge whether these sides were good because we were grossed out by the melted styrofoam and didnt want to eat it for fear of getting sick 0 
i do not know if this was emilio estevezs directorial debut but the pacing the interplay and development of the characters as well as some clever camera work surrounding the character estevez plays all suggest a natural eye 1 
spoilers whatever else can or cant be said about it surface is superbly crafted 1 
an italian reviewer called this a small great film and thats right 1 
the story unfolds in 18th century jutland and the use of period music played on period instruments is just one more fine touch 1 
you wont regret it 1 
damian is so talented and versatile in so many ways of writing and portraying different characters on screen 1 
the staff are also very friendly and efficient 1 
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 
also the fries are without a doubt the worst fries ive ever had 0 
i like steiners because its dark and it feels like a bar 1 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
for service i give them no stars 0 
i have been to very few places to eat that under no circumstances would i ever return to and this tops the list 0 
highly recommend for any one who has a blue tooth phone 1 
those burgers were amazing 1 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
overall i rate this movie a 10 out of a 110 scale 1 
it is very educational for children 1 to 8 years old 1 
not worth it 0 
hard to judge whether these sides were good because we were grossed out by the melted styrofoam and didnt want to eat it for fear of getting sick 0 
echo problemvery unsatisfactory 0 
the worst piece of crap ever along with the verizon customer service 0 
the plug did not work very well 0 
the staff was very attentive 1 
this isnt a small family restaurant this is a fine dining establishment 1 
they work about 2 weeks then break 0 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
used and dirty 0 
not a good item it worked for a while then started having problems in my auto reverse tape player 0 
avoid at any and all costs 0 
everything about this movie is stupid 0 
his costars dont fare much better with people like morgan freeman jonah hill and ed helms just wasted 0 
im a big fan of this series mostly due to anne rices style sensitivities and treatments 1 
for the price on amazon it is an excellent product which i would highly recommend 1 
the warm beer didnt help 0 
it is perfect for a sitdown family meal or get together with a few friends 1 
the charger worked for about a week and then completely stopped charging my phone 0 
sauce was tasteless 0 
the scallop dish is quite appalling for value as well 0 
give this one a look 1 
never heard of any of them except cole who was totally unbelievable in the part 0 
ill put this gem up against any movie in terms of screenplay cinematography acting postproduction editing directing or any other aspect of filmmaking 1 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
the only thing really worth watching was the scenery and the house because it is beautiful 1 
and the red curry had so much bamboo shoots and wasnt very tasty to me 0 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
must have been an off night at this place 0 
this is a simple little phone to use but the breakage is unacceptible 0 
an interesting premise and billy drago is always good as a dangerous nutbag side note id love to see drago stephen mchattie and lance hendrikson in a flick together talk about raging cheekbones 1 
its too bad the food is so damn generic 0 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
to be honest with you this is unbelievable nonsense and very foolish 0 
which has more depth and character than the man underneath it 0 
a standout scene 1 
the burger i got the gold standard a 17 burger and was kind of disappointed 0 
disappointment i hate anything that goes in my ear 0 
its a great tool for entertainment communication and data managementoh be sure to use activesync 42 for optimal data synchronization results 1 
this convention never worked well in the past and certainly doesnt work here 0 
great phone 1 
heres where the movie really pied me off 0 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
its aggravating 0 
not much seafood and like 5 strings of pasta at the bottom 0 
the waiter wasnt helpful or friendly and rarely checked on us 0 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
by this time our side of the restaurant was almost empty so there was no excuse 0 
the restaurant is very clean and has a family restaurant feel to it 1 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
then the film just dropped the ball 0 
will not be back 0 
lastly the mozzarella sticks they were the best thing we ordered 1 
if i take a picture the battery drops a bar and starts beeping letting me know its dieing 0 
but its just not funny 0 
a piece of cinematic garbage captured on celluloid 0 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
very unreliable service from tmobile 0 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
food arrived quickly 1 
and considering the two of us left there very full and happy for about 20 you just cant go wrong 1 
again no plot at all 0 
however i recently watched the whole thing again on dvd and i was completely struck by how extremely stupid the storyline was how it contained holes inconsistencies and frankly a whole lot of crap and how horrid the dancing was 0 
wed definitely go back here again 1 
this really is how vegas fine dining used to be right down to the menus handed to the ladies that have no prices listed 1 
it has all the features i want 1 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
awful service 0 
worst customer service 0 
perabo has a nice energy level and is obviously very comfortable in front of a camera 1 
nice design and quality 1 
this movie does an excellent job of revealing the complexity of the task and the incredible challenges facing south africa 1 
very disappointed 0 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
i liked the patio and the service was outstanding 1 
those phones are working just fine now 1 
weve have gotten a much better service from the pizza place next door than the services we received from this restaurant 0 
do not buy do not buyit sucks 0 
but it does get better reception and clarity than any phone ive had before 1 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
everything about this product is wrongfirst 0 
the nano stated itmy son was dissapointed 0 
it was a great phone 1 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
in short dont bother with this movie 0 
the greek dressing was very creamy and flavorful 1 
simple lightweight and great fit 1 
i paid the bill but did not tip because i felt the server did a terrible job 0 
the warm beer didnt help 0 
the plug did not work very well 0 
this is high adventure at its best 1 
worth every penny 1 
i was particularly pleased with the acting ability of dwight schultz 1 
it deserves strong love 1 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
plus it was wellpaced and suited its relatively short run time 1 
the igo chargers and tips are really great 1 
utterly without merit on any level this is akin to torture 0 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
is pretty funny 1 
well packaged arrived on time and works as intended 1 
all of the main players are mesmerising 1 
overall i rate this movie a 10 out of a 110 scale 1 
i checked everywhere and there is no feature for it which is really disappointing 0 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
howeverthe riingtones are not the best and neither are the games 0 
by the time the film ended i not only disliked it i despised it 0
