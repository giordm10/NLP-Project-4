oh the charger seems to work fine 1 
an italian reviewer called this a small great film and thats right 1 
the only good thing was our waiter he was very helpful and kept the bloddy marys coming 1 
i paid the bill but did not tip because i felt the server did a terrible job 0 
talk about great customer service of course we will be back 1 
generally it just lacked imagination 0 
this would not even be good as a made for tv flick 0 
doesnt work at all i bougth it for my l7c and its not working 0 
they made this case too small and is very difficult to install 0 
great food 1 
wasted two hours 0 
but above all the exquisite visual composition of each moment with inventive and elegant use of closeup camera angle and lighting including pointillistic faux home movie footage is a wonder and joy to behold 1 
first off the reception sucks i have never had more than 2 bars ever 0 
i really enjoyed eating here 1 
very disappointed and wondered how it could be in the oscar shortlist 0 
then as if i hadnt wasted enough of my life there they poured salt in the wound by drawing out the time it took to bring the check 0 
i could barely stomach the meal but didnt complain because it was a business lunch 0 
thank you for such great service 1 
love this phone 1 
im still infatuated with this phone 1 
for sushi on the strip this is the place to go 1 
i have to use the smallest earpieces provided but it stays on pretty well 1 
bela lugosi was totally extraneous intoning odd lines 0 
also the story and acting were weak 0 
you cant go wrong with any of the food here 1 
what should have been a hilarious yummy christmas eve dinner to remember was the biggest fail of the entire trip for us 0 
i could not stand to even watch it for very long for fear of losing iq 0 
the food is good 1 
of course the footage from the 70s was grainy but that only enhanced the film 1 
but i definitely would not eat here again 0 
top line dont waste your time and money on this one its as bad as it comes 0 
itll be a regular stop on my trips to phoenix 1 
i love all the features and form factor 1 
at any rate this film stinks its not funny and fulci should have stayed with giallo and supernatural zombie movies 0 
no complaints 1 
it has northern humour and positive about the community it represents 1 
i would definitely recommend the jabra bt250v for those who are looking for comfort clarity and a great price 1 
it works 1 
crust is not good 0 
do not buy for d807wrongly advertised for d807 0 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
weve tried to like this place but after 10 times i think were done with them 0 
and dont even get me started on the jerky camerawork 0 
and then tragedy struck 0 
everything on the menu is terrific and we were also thrilled that they made amazing accommodations for our vegetarian daughter 1 
i would recommend this 1 
all in all i think it was a good investment 1 
reasonably priced also 1 
very well made and fits my surefire gx2 perfectly 1 
this is the first phone ive had that has been so cheaply made 0 
just really good so far probably the best bt headset i have ever had 1 
the cinematography is simply stunning to say the least and the fx are nothing if not stateoftheart 1 
so anyone near you will hear part of your conversation 0 
the best place to go for a tasty bowl of pho 1 
battery life is real good 1 
i liked the patio and the service was outstanding 1 
overall i like this place a lot 1 
special mention should be made of the superb music score and sound effects which are an integral element in helping to make this such a memorable and enjoyable cartoon 1 
i am far from a sushi connoisseur but i can definitely tell the difference between good food and bad food and this was certainly bad food 0 
obviously they have a terrible customer service so you get what you pay for 0 
the film deserves strong kudos for taking this stand for having exceptional acting from its mostly lesserknown cast and for the superintelligent script that doesnt insult the audience or take the easy way out when it comes to white racism 1 
overpriced for what you are getting 0 
this review is long overdue since i consider a tale of two sisters to be the single greatest film ever made 1 
the movie showed a lot of florida at its best made it look very appealing 1 
otherwise dont even waste your time on this 0 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
the range is very decent ive been able to roam around my house with the phone in the living room with no receptionsound quality issues 1 
when my mom and i got home she immediately got sick and she only had a few bites of salad 0 
this is a simple little phone to use but the breakage is unacceptible 0 
bland and flavorless is a good way of describing the barely tepid meat 0 
so bad 0 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
i had the mac salad and it was pretty bland so i will not be getting that again 0 
its practically perfect in all of them  a true masterpiece in a sea of faux masterpieces 1 
i hope this place sticks around 1 
its a gloriously fun fast paced and fairly accurate portrayal of the night of a raver 1 
does not fit 0 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
i also didnt like the on button it felt like it would crack with use 0 
my fiancé and i came in the middle of the day and we were greeted and seated right away 1 
nevertheless yet another wonderful film from the great masters stable 1 
this is an unbelievable bargain 1 
the only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port irda 0 
the fries were not hot and neither was my burger 0 
an extensive menu provides lots of options for breakfast 1 
bacon is hella salty 1 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
it has been a winner for us 1 
ill definitely be in soon again 1 
that company is a joke 0 
i wouldnt return 0 
all in all i can assure you ill be back 1 
the worst was the salmon sashimi 0 
do not buy for d807wrongly advertised for d807 0 
if you want a sandwich just go to any firehouse 1 
the worst phone from samsungcrap this crappy samsung e715 is the worst i have ever seeen 0 
at any rate this film stinks its not funny and fulci should have stayed with giallo and supernatural zombie movies 0 
the cast of veteran actors are more than just a nostalgia trip 1 
otherwise dont even waste your time on this 0 
it looks very nice 1 
but it wasnt until i watched this film that i realised how great he actually was 1 
im so sorry but i really cant recommend it to anyone 0 
tied to charger for conversations lasting more than 45 minutesmajor problems 0 
that company is a joke 0 
and sometimes it was so embarrassing that i had to look away 0 
1 long lasting battery you dont have to recharge it as frequentyly as some of the flip phones2 0 
after a year the battery went completely dead on my headset 0 
ive never been treated so bad 0 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
service was good and the company was better 1 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
great place fo take out or eat in 1 
i thought it was bad 0 
it shouldnt take 30 min for pancakes and eggs 0 
as for the killer dont expect anything original or even remotely frightening 0 
excellent bluetooth headset 1 
the explosion of the gas tanks at the end was just as awful 0 
an hour and a half i wish i could bring back 0 
i love it 1 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
thanks good a movie like this was done and released 1 
im happy about this purchase good quality and low price 1 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
and the chef was generous with his time even came around twice so we can take pictures with him 1 
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 
very good quality though 1 
how awesome is that 1 
i have always used corded headsets and the freedom from the wireless is very helpful 1 
nargile i think you are great 1 
first of all it doesnt wear well 0 
third the cheese on my friends burger was cold 0 
their research and development division obviously knows what theyre doing 1 
waitress was a little slow in service 0 
our server was very nice and even though he looked a little overwhelmed with all of our needs he stayed professional and friendly until the end 1 
even in my bmw 3 series which is fairly quiet i have trouble hearing what the other person is saying 0 
a week later after i activated it it suddenly died 0 
no ear loop needed its tiny and the sound is great 1 
thats how id describe this painfully dreary timewaster of a film 0 
iam very pleased with my purchase 1 
of all the dishes the salmon was the best but all were great 1 
what the hell kind of crap is that 0 
returned 8 hours later 0 
the sound is clear and the people i talk to on it are amazed at the quality too 1 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
would not reccommend 0 
you can find better movies at youtube 0 
i as well wouldve given godfathers zero stars if possible 0 
but storm trooper is not even bad enough to make it to the list of wonderfully terrible movies 0 
this is a witty and delightful adaptation of the dr seuss book brilliantly animated by upas finest and thoroughly deserving of its academy award 1 
first time there and might just be the last 0 
the decor is nice and the piano music soundtrack is pleasant 1 
ordered an appetizer and took 40 minutes and then the pizza another 10 minutes 0 
very very sad 0 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
the cocktails are all handmade and delicious 1 
as for the service im a fan because its quick and youre being served by some nice folks 1 
there is however some pretty good acting at least for this type of film 1 
another note about this phones appearance is that it really looks rather bland especially in the all black model 0 
i used bitpim a free program you can find on the internetto transfer data to the phonethe price of the cable was excellent 1 
the chains which im no fan of beat this place easily 0 
im not impressed with the concept or the food 0 
about ten minutes into this film i started having second thoughts 0 
we made the drive all the way from north scottsdale and i was not one bit disappointed 1 
another note about this phones appearance is that it really looks rather bland especially in the all black model 0 
well never go again 0 
i tried talking real loud but shouting on the telephone gets old and i was still told it wasnt great 0 
it is so small and you dont even realize that it is there after a while of getting used to it 1 
my order was not correct 0 
wont work right or atleast for me 0 
im probably one of the few people to ever go to ians and not like it 0 
not recommended 0 
every thing on phone work perfectly she like it 1 
needless to say i wont be going back anytime soon 0 
it has all the features i want 1 
great atmosphere friendly and fast service 1 
oh the charger seems to work fine 1 
they really want to make your experience a good one 1 
awful service 0 
i struggle to find anything bad to say about it 1 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
better than expected 1 
what this film lacks is a convincing script 0 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
better than new 1 
first time there and might just be the last 0 
these are the central themes of the film and they are handled ineptly stereotypically and with no depth of imagination 0 
as for the service im a fan because its quick and youre being served by some nice folks 1 
the characters are interesting even if a bit predictable 1 
great audio 1 
the inside is really quite nice and very clean 1 
still its quite interesting and entertaining to follow 1 
great software for motorolas 1 
initially the local sites in the film which was filmed here in buffalo intrigued me 1 
funny clever hip just like prays previous film hype 1 
item does not match picture 0 
i mean really how do you get so famous for your fish and chips when its so terrible 0 
the turkey and roast beef were bland 0 
id like to return it 0 
no plot whatsoever 0 
not good by any stretch of the imagination 0 
were jerks on the phone 0 
the best place to go for a tasty bowl of pho 1 
kind of hard to mess up a steak but they did 0 
owners are really great people 1 
but i definitely would not eat here again 0 
worst foodservice ive had in a while 0 
great pocket pc phone combination 1 
i dont know what the big deal is about this place but i wont be back yaall 0 
not impressed 0 
your staff spends more time talking to themselves than me 0 
they have a really nice atmosphere 1 
my 5year old nokia 2160 from tracfone holds the charge a lot better than this 0 
2 thumbs up to this seller 1 
i tried talking real loud but shouting on the telephone gets old and i was still told it wasnt great 0 
this is an extraordinary film 1 
and the sound quality is great 1 
it works 1 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
the voice recognition thru the handset is excellent 1 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
those phones are working just fine now 1 
an awesome new look for fall 2000 1 
overall i wasnt very impressed with noca 0 
gets the job done 1 
yet plantronincs continues to use the same flawed charger design 0 
after the disappointing dinner we went elsewhere for dessert 0 
waited and waited and waited 0 
very disappointed 0 
i hate writing bad reviews about films especially those in which i really like the star but this film is so bad i dont believe for one second that anyone could have been proud of it 0 
i will be back many times soon 1 
its too bad the food is so damn generic 0 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
it quit working after id used it for about 18 months so i just purchased another one because this is the best headset ive ever owned 1 
almost all of the songs in cover girl are oldfashioned and not very tuneful 0 
if i take a picture the battery drops a bar and starts beeping letting me know its dieing 0 
buttons are too small 0 
what possesed me to get this junk i have no idea 0 
a drive thru means you do not want to wait around for half an hour for your food but somehow when we end up going here they make us wait and wait 0 
so for our enjoyment we get to see them run around play games and be dangerous 1 
garbo who showed right off the bat that her talents could carry over from the silent era i wanted to see some of her silent work but netflix doesnt seem to be stocking them 1 
an amazing finale to possibly the best trilogy of all time 1 
i was disgusted because i was pretty sure that was human hair 0 
i am a fan of his this movie sucked really bad 0 
this would not even be good as a made for tv flick 0 
talk about useless customer service 0 
im super pissd 0 
the film gives meaning to the phrase never in the history of human conflict has so much been owed by so many to so few 1 
i didnt realize how wonderful the short really is until the last two scenes 1 
lordy the khao soi is a dish that is not to be missed for curry lovers 1 
that being said for a phone the camera is very nice many cool effects to play with and video is decent as well 1 
the only very disappointing thing was there was no speakerphone 0 
im surprised this is a good quality car charger and theres not much reviews about it 1 
i still maintain that monkeys shouldnt make headphones we just obviously dont share enough dna to copy the design over to humans 0 
the instruction manual is lacking 0 
i cant use this case because the smell is disgusting 0 
they have great dinners 1 
it is cheap and it feel and look just as cheap 0 
dont waste your money 0 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
1010 1 
you wont regret it 1 
it really is impressive that the place hasnt closed down 0 
the acting is like watching wooden puppets moving around and reading from a book thats how bad it is 0 
i would recommend it 1 
the service was terrible food was mediocre 0 
the sound is clear and the people i talk to on it are amazed at the quality too 1 
the acting from all involved and that includes those like shatner and nimoy is bad and washed out and making them seem as old as they look in real life the special effects are tacky like when spock has to rescue kirk on a jet pack when he falls down from a mountain 0 
with the originality and freshness of the first movie now spent this remake had little else to offer 0 
what a great double cheeseburger 1 
i checked everywhere and there is no feature for it which is really disappointing 0 
the service here leaves a lot to be desired 0 
the only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port irda 0 
these are certainly very comfortable and functionality is decent 1 
great pocket pc phone combination 1 
i was deeply impressed with the character he played 1 
i hate writing bad reviews about films especially those in which i really like the star but this film is so bad i dont believe for one second that anyone could have been proud of it 0 
now the burgers arent as good the pizza which used to be amazing is doughy and flavorless 0 
it dit not work most of the time with my nokia 5320 0 
youd have to have the iq of particularly stupid mollusk not to see that one coming 0 
trumbull on i love lucy 1 
their research and development division obviously knows what theyre doing 1 
i cant use this case because the smell is disgusting 0 
do not make the same mistake as me 0 
dont make the same mistake i did 0 
i wasnt expecting oscar material but this 0 
i bought this phone as a replacement for my startac and have regretted it since 0 
the songs were the best and the muppets were so hilarious 1 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
and those baby owls were adorable 1 
anyways the food was definitely not filling at all and for the price you pay you should expect more 0 
still waiting im sure this item would work well if i ever recieve it 0 
dont waste your time watching this rubbish nonresearched film 0 
but it is great i would really recommend it 1 
i give it 2 thumbs down 0 
i just saw this film and i recommend it 1 
there is no plot or storyline 0 
1010 1 
its a piece of crap 0 
their steaks are 100 recommended 1 
add betty white and jean smart and you have a great cast everyone played their parts really well 1 
the characters are interesting and you want to find out more about them the longer the movie goes on and i think people will be surprised by who does and doesnt make it 1 
dont waste your time 0 
it dit not work most of the time with my nokia 5320 0 
the film gives meaning to the phrase never in the history of human conflict has so much been owed by so many to so few 1 
its like a really sexy party in your mouth where youre outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party 1 
a very good film indeed about great and unconditional love 1 
but even the talented carrell cant save this 0 
i especially love the long battery life 1 
omelets are to die for 1 
the burger is good beef cooked just right 1 
i go to far too many places and ive never seen any restaurant that serves a 1 egg breakfast especially for 400 0 
also difficult to put onid recommend avoiding this product 0 
the sets especially designed to work with the camera are amazingstylized beautiful and effective 1 
oh yeah and the storyline was pathetic too 0 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
i am very impressed with the job that motorola did on the sturdiness of this phone 1 
worst service to boot but that is the least of their worries 0 
no actress has been worse used that june allison in this movie 0 
simply beautiful 1 
i dont like this nokia either 0 
its like a really sexy party in your mouth where youre outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party 1 
dont buy this product it fails 0 
host staff were for lack of a better word bitches 0 
garbo who showed right off the bat that her talents could carry over from the silent era i wanted to see some of her silent work but netflix doesnt seem to be stocking them 1 
appetite instantly gone 0 
i cant see how this movie can be an inspiration to anyone to come out or overcome fear and rejection 0 
the only very disappointing thing was there was no speakerphone 0 
all of the tapas dishes were delicious 1 
very bad performance plays angela bennett a computer expert who is at home all the time 0 
the waitresses are very friendly 1 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
these headphones were a great find and i think they are perhaps the best purchase ive made in the last several years seriously 1 
those burgers were amazing 1 
i got this phone on reccomendation from a relative and im glad i did 1 
there are the usual hitchcock logic flaws 0 
everything was gross 0 
the service was a little slow considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace 0 
pretty piece of junk 0 
never again will i be dining at this place 0 
the descriptions said yum yum sauce and another said eel sauce yet another said spicy mayowell none of the rolls had sauces on them 0 
i thoroughly enjoyed it when christopher eccleston took control of the tardis and the continuation of the series 1 
i didnt realize how wonderful the short really is until the last two scenes 1 
disappointed 0 
if you hate earbugs avoid this phone by all means 0 
they could be used as exemplars for any set designer 1 
fast service 1 
not impressed 0 
the dining space is tiny but elegantly decorated and comfortable 1 
the bipolarity of the ruthless thug one minute a ruthless killer the next minute a luvs diaper commercial is completely unconvincing 0 
the flat reenactments dont hold your attention because they are emotionally adrift and stagy 0 
i had about two bites and refused to eat anymore 0 
i waited and waited 0 
weve have gotten a much better service from the pizza place next door than the services we received from this restaurant 0 
needless to say i wont be going back anytime soon 0 
the volume for the ringer is real good you have choices how loud 1 
this blueant supertooth handsfree phone speaker is awesome 1 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
i would recommend this 1 
it definitely was not as good as my s11 1 
it felt like a very gripping intelligent stage play but without the overly theatrical feeling one actually gets from watching people on a stage which plays on everyones terror of a white lie escalating to monstrous consequences 1 
though the wind and the lion is told largely through the eyes of the son every member of the family can identify with one of the characters whether it be sean connerys noble brigand candace bergens feisty heroine john hustons wily john hay or steve kanalys spiffy radiant ruthless cando lieutenant roosevelts big stick 1 
im big fan of rpg games too but this movie its a disgrace to any selfrespecting rpger there is 0 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
if you are looking for a good quality motorola headset keep looking this isnt it 0 
it has been a winner for us 1 
the company shipped my product very promptly and it works well 1 
nargile i think you are great 1 
after the first charge kept going dead after 12 minutes 0 
i dont know what the big deal is about this place but i wont be back yaall 0 
as for the killer dont expect anything original or even remotely frightening 0 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
audio quality is poor very poor 0 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
worse theres an incredibly weak subplot thrown in that follows a little band of latterday mansonites as they go after a reporter whos working on a story on the anniversary of the killings 0 
there are many continuity errors one other user commented on different cars in the garage joes glassesthe one that got to me the most was the fact joes facial hair configuration seemed to change from scene to scene 0 
i can say that the desserts were yummy 1 
fantastic service here 1 
very disappointed and wondered how it could be in the oscar shortlist 0 
not much seafood and like 5 strings of pasta at the bottom 0 
but i definitely would not eat here again 0 
this does not fit the palm tungsten e2 and it broke the first time i tried to plug it in 0 
i hate movies like that 0 
this movie contained an allstar cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i havent seen before 1 
i saw this short film on hbo the other day and absolutely loved it 1 
this place is not quality sushi it is not a quality restaurant 0 
server did a great job handling our large rowdy table 1 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
if you dont find it too bad as again the unit comes with one earpad onlyi would not recommend this to anyone 0 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
you wont regret it 1 
i could not stand to even watch it for very long for fear of losing iq 0 
all i can do is whine on the internet so here it goesthe more i use the thing the less i like it 0 
trouble is the writing and directing make it impossible to establish those things that make a movie watchable like character story theme and so on 0 
not a good item it worked for a while then started having problems in my auto reverse tape player 0 
this movie is excellentangel is beautiful and scamp is adorablehis little yelps when hes scaredand the funniest parts are whenscamp is caught under the curtain and when angel and scamp are singing ive never had this feeling beforei totally recommend this movieits coming out on special edition on june 20the cover has scamp on a garbage can and angel underneath the lid 1 
any grandmother can make a roasted chicken better than this one 0 
interesting decor 1 
but i thought his acting was skilled 1 
i love the scream movies and all horror movies and this one ranks way up there 1 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
disappointment i hate anything that goes in my ear 0 
its uncomfortable and the sound quality is quite poor compared with the phone razr or with my previous wired headset that plugged into an lg 0 
poor product 0 
ive never been treated so bad 0 
this movie has a cutting edge to it 1 
the acting is fantastic the stories are seamlessly woven together and the dogs are splendid a must rent view or see 1 
the crêpe was delicate and thin and moist 1 
i really do recommend this place you can go wrong with this donut place 1 
im glad the film didnt go for the most obvious choice as a lesser film certainly would have 1 
good works fine 1 
it was awesome 1 
i was very pleased to see that i could replace my well travled swivel holster for my blackberry flip 1 
of course the footage from the 70s was grainy but that only enhanced the film 1 
integrated seamlessly with the motorola razr phone 1 
despite how hard i rate businesses its actually rare for me to give a 1 star 0 
the kids are very cool too 1 
very windresistant 1 
anne heche was utterly convincing 1 
del taco is pretty nasty and should be avoided if possible 0 
the service here leaves a lot to be desired 0 
i would recommend this 1 
lastly the mozzarella sticks they were the best thing we ordered 1 
it was also the right balance of war and love 1 
i thought it was bad 0 
all this movie does is make you sick watching all these slackers make excuses for their stupid actions for 90 minutes 0 
there is a totally unnecessary trainroller coaster scene 0 
i have two more years left in this contract and i hate this phone 0 
mediocre food 0 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
if you do go see this movie bring a pillow or a girlfriendboyfriend to keep you occupied through out 0 
it is rare when a filmmaker takes the time to tell a worthy moral tale with care and love that doesnt fall into the trap of being overly syrupy or over indulgent 1 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
dont make the same mistake i did 0 
my sashimi was poor quality being soggy and tasteless 0 
having to humour him just to get by and get through the day was so apt 1 
finally after three or four times the spring of the latch broke and i could not use it any longer on the visor 0 
the staff are great the ambiance is great 1 
she ordered a toasted english muffin that came out untoasted 0 
jawbone era is awesome too 1 
i just wanted to leave 0 
but it wasnt until i watched this film that i realised how great he actually was 1 
the ear buds only play music in one ear 0 
unfortunately this is a bad movie that is just plain bad 0 
even in my bmw 3 series which is fairly quiet i have trouble hearing what the other person is saying 0 
i came over from verizon because cingulair has nicer cell phones the first thing i noticed was the really bad service 0 
best fish ive ever had in my life 1 
not my thing 0 
yet plantronincs continues to use the same flawed charger design 0 
i wish i could return the unit and get back my money 0 
avoid at all costs 0 
for people who are first timers in film making i think they did an excellent job 1 
this is a great product sure beats using your fingers 1 
it was not good 0 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
the films dialogue is natural real to life 1 
the stories were as unbelievable as the actors 0 
the staff is friendly and the joint is always clean 1 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
sam shepards portrayal of a gung ho marine was sobering 1 
i am a fan of his this movie sucked really bad 0 
but even the talented carrell cant save this 0 
very very disappointed ordered the 35 big bay plater 0 
and generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode 0 
magical help 1 
by far the best cheesecurds we have ever had 1 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
i was sitting in my vehicle with the cradle on my belt and the headset lost signal 0 
avoid this film at all costs 0 
on the good side the staff was genuinely pleasant and enthusiastic a real treat 1 
so i had to take the battery out of the phone put it all back together and then restart it 0 
i never walked out of a movie faster 0 
beautiful styling though 1 
i will never go back to this place and will never ever recommended this place to anyone 0 
even in my bmw 3 series which is fairly quiet i have trouble hearing what the other person is saying 0 
unfortunately it did not work 0 
if only someone involved with it knew how to string together narrative 0 
he was terrible 0 
see it 1 
great character actors telly savalas and peter boyle 1 
the volume for the ringer is real good you have choices how loud 1 
i would have given no star if i was able 0 
ive owned this phone for 7 months now and can say that its the best mobile phone ive had 1 
this place is handsdown one of the best places to eat in the phoenix metro area 1 
it is not good 0 
i didnt know pulled pork could be soooo delicious 1 
sweetest phone 1 
coming here is like experiencing an underwhelming relationship where both parties cant wait for the other person to ask to break up 0 
fantastic service here 1 
dont buy this product it fails 0 
there is a totally unnecessary trainroller coaster scene 0 
the waitresses are very friendly 1 
i would recommend this 1 
youll love it 1 
nothing short of magnificent photographycinematography in this film 1 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
there is however some pretty good acting at least for this type of film 1 
oh and i forgot to also mention the weird color effect it has on your phone 0 
will never ever go back and have told many people what had happened 0 
you wont regret it 1 
the speaker is of low quality so as making the ring tones sound very cheap 0 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
it was horrible 0 
also the area where my unit broke im not too fond of the magnetic strap 0 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
i am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this 1 
the battery life is highly unacceptable 0 
the dialogue is composed of things that make little sense 0 
the worst one of the series 0 
but this movie really got to me 1 
this is a stunning movie 1 
i checked everywhere and there is no feature for it which is really disappointing 0 
this mostly routine factbased tv drama gets a boost from the fine performance by cole 1 
for service i give them no stars 0 
i am so tired of clichés that is just lazy writing and here they come in thick and fast 0 
i love this device 1 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
the memories are murky but i can only say that i enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show 1 
hated it 0 
all in all i think it was a good investment 1 
easy to use 1 
the acting is beyond abysmal 0 
the construction of the headsets is poor 0 
this place is great 1 
i even fully charged it before i went to bed and turned off blue tooth and wifi and noticed that it only had 20 left in the morning 0 
think of the film being like a dream 1 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
overall i would recommend this phone over the new walkman 1 
the characters are interesting and you want to find out more about them the longer the movie goes on and i think people will be surprised by who does and doesnt make it 1 
but other than that the movie seemed to drag and the heroes didnt really work for their freedom 0 
they dropped more than the ball 0 
he surely doesnt know how to make a coherent action movie from the screenwriter of air force one who was only obliged to write the script just for a big sum of money 0 
we made the drive all the way from north scottsdale and i was not one bit disappointed 1 
the films dialogue is natural real to life 1 
very serious spoilers this movie was a huge disappointment 0 
this game rocks 1 
their chow mein is so good 1 
generally it just lacked imagination 0 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
how can you call yourself a steakhouse if you cant properly cook a steak i dont understand 0 
both of them were truly unbelievably good and i am so glad we went back 1 
its a fresh subtle and rather sublime effect 1 
good case excellent value 1 
hes a national treasure 1 
this phone might well be the worst ive ever had in any brand 0 
it quit working after id used it for about 18 months so i just purchased another one because this is the best headset ive ever owned 1 
ive had no trouble accessing the internet downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions 1 
duris has a wholesome appearance and gives a fine performance 1 
the wind and the lion is well written and superbly acted 1 
i found a six inch long piece of wire in my salsa 0 
in other words the content level of this film is enough to easily fill a dozen other films 1 
avoid avoid avoid 0 
i really hope the team behind this movie makes more movies and that they will continue to do so in their own some kinda weird style 1 
the story unfolds in 18th century jutland and the use of period music played on period instruments is just one more fine touch 1 
i will continue to come here on ladies night andddd date night highly recommend this place to anyone who is in the area 1 
nothing new there 0 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
i find wasting food to be despicable but this just wasnt food 0 
steer clear of this product and go with the genuine palm replacementr pens which come in a threepack 0 
10 out of 10 stars 1 
treo and tmobile refused to replace it again and forced me to buy another phone without any kind of upgrade discount 0 
even the squibs look awful 0 
do not buy if you want to use the holster 0 
i had to wait over 30 minutes to get my drink and longer to get 2 arepas 0 
overall i wasnt very impressed with noca 0 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
so i am here to warn youdo not rent this movie it is the dumbest thing you have never seen 0 
i go to far too many places and ive never seen any restaurant that serves a 1 egg breakfast especially for 400 0 
cant upload ringtones from a third party 0 
this hole in the wall has great mexican street tacos and friendly staff 1 
disappointing 0 
great choice 1 
it was delicious 1 
i wouldnt see this movie again for free 0 
the volume for the ringer is real good you have choices how loud 1 
an italian reviewer called this a small great film and thats right 1 
plug was the wrong size 0 
it was a drive to get there 0 
a cheap and cheerless heist movie with poor characterisation lots of underbite style stoic emoting think chow yun fat in a better tomorrow and some cheesy clichés thrown into an abandoned factory ready for a few poorly executed flying judo rolls a la john woo 0 
the handsfree part works fine but then the car tries to download the address book and the treo rebootsoverall i still rate this device high 1 
i love this place 1 
for readers who have already seen one of miyazakis films he is still in top form and made another worthwhile experience 1 
once your food arrives its meh 0 
needless to say we will never be back here again 0 
both great 1 
makes it easier to keep up with my bluetooth when im not wearing it 0 
i especially love the long battery life 1 
i have been very happy with the 510 and have had no complaints from any one regarding my sound quality on their end 1 
the story unfolds in 18th century jutland and the use of period music played on period instruments is just one more fine touch 1 
what a disappointment 0 
awesome device 1 
the roast beef sandwich tasted really good 1 
i did not have any problem with this item and would order it again if needed 1 
great sound and service 1 
this is high adventure at its best 1 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
main thing i didnt enjoy is that the crowd is of older crowd around mid 30s and up 0 
this place is awesome if you want something light and healthy during the summer 1 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
good prices 1 
however this didnt make up for the fact that overall this was a tremendously boring movie 0 
i am going to have to be the first to negatively review this product 0 
one thing i hate is the mode set button at the side 0 
this place is pretty good nice little vibe in the restaurant 1 
very disappointing 0 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
this fixes all the problems 1 
worst foodservice ive had in a while 0 
im a bit disappointed 0 
seriously killer hot chai latte 1 
i have 23 bars on my cell phone when i am home but you cant not hear anything 0 
he is an amazing film artist one of the most important whoever lived 1 
the range is very decent ive been able to roam around my house with the phone in the living room with no receptionsound quality issues 1 
this is high adventure at its best 1 
there was so much hype over this phone that i assumed it was the best my mistake 0 
what makes this story different are the terrific production values faultless photography composition and editing the terrific casting the underappreciated brian keith playing a bully teddy and vivid history 1 
the movie is not completely perfect but titta di girolamo will stay with you for a long time after the vision of the movie 1 
the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach 0 
stay away from this store be careful 0 
it was a waste of my money 0 
i love it 1 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
fantastic earphones 1 
this place is awesome if you want something light and healthy during the summer 1 
perfect for the ps3 1 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
you cant beat the price on these 1 
its very attractive and appears to be of good quality 1 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
the ambiance isnt much better 0 
at a time when it seems that film animation has been dominated by disneypixars cgi masterpieces it is both refreshing and comforting to know that miyazaki is still relying on traditional handdrawn animation to tell his charming and enchanting stories 1 
not good enough for the price 0 
im not really sure how joeys was voted best hot dog in the valley by readers of phoenix magazine 0 
a great touch 1 
nicest chinese restaurant ive been in a while 1 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
it fits so securely that the ear hook does not even need to be used and the sound is better directed through your ear canal 1 
this is a beautiful phone 1 
phone now holds charge like it did when it was new 1 
if there was ever a movie that needed wordofmouth to promote this is it 1 
this is a stunning movie 1 
items stated as included from the description are not included 0 
down the drain because of a weak snap 0 
great product fast shipping 1 
these products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet 0
