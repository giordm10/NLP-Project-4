things that went wrong they burned the saganaki 0 
its a little geeky but i think thats its sex on toast and it rocks and oozes sex right down to its battery embedded sleek stylish leather case 1 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
very good product well made 1 
not enough volume 0 
but the duet between the astronaut and his doctor at the beginning of the movie is a perfect exchange if one considers that this movie was made well into the cold war and the astronauts biggest fear is that he has crashed in the ussr 1 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
dont buy this product it fails 0 
its a fresh subtle and rather sublime effect 1 
very good phone 1 
feelings thoughtsgabriels discomfort during the danceall these intangibles leap to life and come within the viewers grasp in hustons portrayal 1 
the only thing i did like was the prime rib and dessert section 1 
classywarm atmosphere fun and fresh appetizers succulent steaks baseball steak 1 
i didnt realize how wonderful the short really is until the last two scenes 1 
it is very educational for children 1 to 8 years old 1 
a fantastic neighborhood gem 1 
i mean in a realistic world she would never have gotten into that ballet repertory the whole thing was quite pathetic 0 
would not reccommend 0 
just as good as when i had it more than a year ago 1 
the acting was decidely wooden though no worse than a period universal b movie 0 
i always order from the vegetarian menu during dinner which has a wide array of options to choose from 1 
so absolutley fantastic 1 
needless to say i wont be going back anytime soon 0 
very bad experience 0 
the two main characters may be two of the most believable children i ever saw put on screen 1 
does not fit 0 
worthwhile 1 
the performances are not improved by improvisation because the actors now have twice as much to worry about not only whether theyre delivering the line well but whether the line itself is any good 0 
i think i was one of the people who found this another one of roths pearls 1 
audio quality is poor very poor 0 
delicious and i will absolutely be back 1 
perabo has a nice energy level and is obviously very comfortable in front of a camera 1 
the battery life is highly unacceptable 0 
this is by far the worst purchase ive made on amazon 0 
the explosion of the gas tanks at the end was just as awful 0 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
eclectic selection 1 
secondly hitchcock pretty much perfected the thriller and chase movie 1 
last time buying from you 0 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
i love all the features and form factor 1 
trumbull on i love lucy 1 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
works great 1 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
with the originality and freshness of the first movie now spent this remake had little else to offer 0 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
the ngage is still lacking in earbuds 0 
its kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly its embarrassing how childlike the company is 0 
unfortunately we must have hit the bakery on leftover day because everything we ordered was stale 0 
very bad performance plays angela bennett a computer expert who is at home all the time 0 
full of unconvincing cardboard characters it is blandly written by edward chodorov who also produced and is surprisingly directed by jean negulesco from whom one would expect a great deal more 0 
otherwise easy to install and use clear sound 1 
its too bad the food is so damn generic 0 
it is shameful 0 
i was particularly pleased with the acting ability of dwight schultz 1 
last night was my second time dining here and i was so happy i decided to go back 1 
spoilers whatever else can or cant be said about it surface is superbly crafted 1 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
service was exceptional and food was a good as all the reviews 1 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
the characters are interesting and you want to find out more about them the longer the movie goes on and i think people will be surprised by who does and doesnt make it 1 
the use of slowmotion needlessly repeats itself throughout the movie but is well backed up by bad acting and bad is a kind word here no continuity scenes that are thrown in for no reason whatsoever vehicles that looked like they were made from a corn flakes box and a directorial style that bordered on stupidity 0 
great bluetooth 1 
it didnt charge for me 0 
freezes frequently4 0 
a greasy unhealthy meal 0 
youd have to have the iq of particularly stupid mollusk not to see that one coming 0 
disappointing accessory from a good manufacturer 0 
probably not in a hurry to go back 0 
both of the egg rolls were fantastic 1 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
i have bought this nokia cell phone a few weeks ago and it was a nightmare 0 
i own 2 of these cases and would order another 1 
fantastic earphones 1 
the worst phone from samsungcrap this crappy samsung e715 is the worst i have ever seeen 0 
my headset works just peachykeen 1 
it just blew 0 
once you get inside youll be impressed with the place 1 
weve have gotten a much better service from the pizza place next door than the services we received from this restaurant 0 
while you dont yet hear mickey speak there are tons of sound effects and music throughout the filmsomething we take for granted now but which was a huge crowd pleaser in 1928 1 
what a mistake 0 
reception is terrible and full of static 0 
my 810 score is mostly for the plot 1 
so absolutley fantastic 1 
i even fully charged it before i went to bed and turned off blue tooth and wifi and noticed that it only had 20 left in the morning 0 
i have to mention this and it is a huge spoiler i loved the ending how all the characters of the three films were the remaining survivors of the ferry disaster with valentine and the young judge together and the old man watching it on her tv solidifying his happiness over the suffering which he dealt with for those many years 1 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
i love the look and feel of samsung flipphones 1 
ive had this for nearly 2 years and it has worked great for me 1 
i really loved the story line and the poler bear was kinda cutebut if anyone has a question about fort steele just ask away 1 
very disappointing 0 
i found the product to be easy to set up and use 1 
everything was fresh and delicious 1 
watching washing machine twirling around wouldnt hurt your eyes as much as this show 0 
horrible 0 
it is well made easy to access the phone and has a handy detachable belt clip 1 
one nice thing was that they added gratuity on the bill since our party was larger than 6 or 8 and they didnt expect more tip than that 1 
reversible plug works great 1 
and generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode 0 
theres really nothing bad i can say about this headset 0 
these are the central themes of the film and they are handled ineptly stereotypically and with no depth of imagination 0 
hes a national treasure 1 
i recommend this for everyone who loves film movies anythinga work of art 1 
ive owned this phone for 7 months now and can say that its the best mobile phone ive had 1 
an amazing finale to possibly the best trilogy of all time 1 
i guess it was supposed to be clever twist then shed some light on the situation but it was just stupid 0 
back to good bbq lighter fare reasonable pricing and tell the public they are back to the old ways 1 
nice design and quality 1 
the construction of the headsets is poor 0 
it was horrible 0 
i ordered this for sony ericsson w810i but i think it only worked once thats when i first used it 0 
the jabra eargels fit my ears very well 1 
poor quality 0 
i am very impressed with the job that motorola did on the sturdiness of this phone 1 
over rated 0 
this results in the phone being either stuck at max volume or mute 0 
it was that year however that reminded us that huston was still at the top of his game as evinced by his faithful adaptation of james joyces acclaimed novella the dead 1 
to summarize the food was incredible nay transcendant but nothing brings me joy quite like the memory of the pneumatic condiment dispenser 1 
i would have casted her in that role after ready the script 1 
it fits so securely that the ear hook does not even need to be used and the sound is better directed through your ear canal 1 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
not too screamy not to masculine but just right 1 
i found a six inch long piece of wire in my salsa 0 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
good beer drink selection and good food selection 1 
still waiting im sure this item would work well if i ever recieve it 0 
i had the chicken pho and it tasted very bland 0 
the sound is clear and the people i talk to on it are amazed at the quality too 1 
worked perfectly 1 
see both films if you can 1 
when achille and philippa beautifully sing a duet from don giovanni that perfectly describes their situation in the movie you appreciate the subtle layers of this excellent film 1 
there is a lot of beautiful places 1 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
it was also the right balance of war and love 1 
the explosion of the gas tanks at the end was just as awful 0 
i want my money back 0 
the reception has been generally good 1 
gets the job done 1 
well im satisfied 1 
the memories are murky but i can only say that i enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show 1 
this does not fit the palm tungsten e2 and it broke the first time i tried to plug it in 0 
i find wasting food to be despicable but this just wasnt food 0 
dont buy this product 0 
when my order arrived one of the gyros was missing 0 
started watching this but didnt believe in any of the characters 0 
low quality 0 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
the design is very good4 1 
dee snider just plain sucks 0 
the potatoes were like rubber and you could tell they had been made up ahead of time being kept under a warmer 0 
not only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic but it also managed to give away the entire movie and im not exaggerating every moment every plot point every joke is told in the trailer 0 
will order from them again 1 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
i advise everyone do not be fooled 0 
i ate there twice on my last visit and especially enjoyed the salmon salad 1 
jamie foxx absolutely is ray charles 1 
im returning them 0 
i like armand assante my cable companys summary sounded interesting so i watched it twice already and probably will again 1 
setup couldnt have been simpler 1 
i was amazed at the quick arrival of the two original lg cell phone batteries and and at a fraction of the price 1 
the staff is great the food is delish and they have an incredible beer selection 1 
so they performed 1 
frozen pucks of disgust with some of the worst people behind the register 0 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
very disappointing 0 
if she had not rolled the eyes we may have stayed not sure if we will go back and try it again 0 
alexander nevsky is a great film 1 
it lasts less than 3o minutes if i actually try to use the phonemy wife has the same phone with the same problem 0 
the good cinematography also makes her and monica bellucci look very beautiful 1 
watching washing machine twirling around wouldnt hurt your eyes as much as this show 0 
good show samsung 1 
very disappointed 0 
there is nothing privileged about workingeating there 0 
oh yeah and the storyline was pathetic too 0 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
of all the dishes the salmon was the best but all were great 1 
the 12 mega pixel camera being a part of a phone is reasonably good7 1 
poor talk time performance 0 
i have had mine for about a year and this christmas i bought some for the rest of the family 1 
delicious nyc bagels good selections of cream cheese real lox with capers even 1 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
they refuse to refund or replace 0 
this is so embarassing and also my ears hurt if i try to push the ear plug into my ear 0 
i came back today since they relocated and still not impressed 0 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
we sat another ten minutes and finally gave up and left 0 
my experience was terrible this was my fourth bluetooth headset and while it was much more comfortable than my last jabra which i hated 0 
reasonably priced also 1 
we asked for the bill to leave without eating and they didnt bring that either 0 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
food was great and so was the serivce 1 
it just blew 0 
very tough and very short on flavor 0 
the ear buds only play music in one ear 0 
if there was ever a movie that needed wordofmouth to promote this is it 1 
it was just not a fun experience 1 
the fries were not hot and neither was my burger 0 
the only possible way this movie could be redeemed would be as mst3k fodder 0 
but she is still a bad actress repeating her robotic face moves in each of her pictures 0 
this is definitely a cult classic well worth viewing and sharing with others 1 
for the price this was a great deal 1 
the structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema 1 
when i opened the sandwich i was impressed but not in a good way 0 
lordy the khao soi is a dish that is not to be missed for curry lovers 1 
sorry i will not be getting food from here anytime soon 0 
the only thing that i think could improve is the sound leaks out from the headset 0 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
john garfield ann revere lilli plmer william conrad canada leeand filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screenjames wong howe 1 
good works fine 1 
disappointing accessory from a good manufacturer 0 
razr battery good buy 1 
thanks good a movie like this was done and released 1 
bad fit way too big 0 
this is a chilly unremarkable movie about an author livingworking in a chilly abstruse culture 0 
here in the wind and the lion we see a wonderful rendering of americas own imperial age 1 
cant get the software to work with my computer 0 
best breakfast buffet 1 
very bad performance plays angela bennett a computer expert who is at home all the time 0 
after one bite i was hooked 1 
i thought it was bad 0 
they could be used as exemplars for any set designer 1 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
the food is very good for your typical bar food 1 
one nice thing was that they added gratuity on the bill since our party was larger than 6 or 8 and they didnt expect more tip than that 1 
service was exceptional and food was a good as all the reviews 1 
we got sitting fairly fast but ended up waiting 40 minutes just to place our order another 30 minutes before the food arrived 0 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
my wife had the lobster bisque soup which was lukewarm 0 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
i am a fan of his this movie sucked really bad 0 
we waited an hour for what was a breakfast i could have done 100 times better at home 0 
i left the theater with a lilt in my step joy in my heart and hope for the human race 1 
babie bop is very cute 1 
not good by any stretch of the imagination 0 
this place is way too overpriced for mediocre food 0 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
then theres the plot holes 0 
unfortunately inexperience of direction meant that scene after scene passed with little in the way of dramatic tension or conflict 0 
which is precisely why i am giving it such a bad review 0 
20th century foxs road house 1948 is not only quite a silly noir but is an implausible unmitigated bore of a movie 0 
greatno problems at all 1 
better than new 1 
the buffet at bellagio was far from what i anticipated 0 
iam very pleased with my purchase 1 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
very satisifed with that 1 
a good film by a great director 1 
the burger had absolutely no flavor the meat itself was totally bland the burger was overcooked and there was no charcoal flavor 0 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
i purcashed this for the car charger and it does not work 0 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
do not buy for d807wrongly advertised for d807 0 
im a big fan of this series mostly due to anne rices style sensitivities and treatments 1 
this movie totally grates on my nerves 0 
crust is not good 0 
linked to my phone without effort 1 
if you want a real scare rent this one 1 
it is a true classic 1 
very good product well made 1 
great sound and service 1 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
the meat was pretty dry i had the sliced brisket and pulled pork 0 
if you want a sandwich just go to any firehouse 1 
im translating movies for a living and this is the first movie in my 5year working experience that i found offensive to my intelligence 0 
a fantastic neighborhood gem 1 
i recommend this for everyone who loves film movies anythinga work of art 1 
this greedy corporation will never see another dime from me 0 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
the buffet at bellagio was far from what i anticipated 0 
then i had to continue pairing it periodically since it somehow kept dropping 0 
awesome selection of beer 1 
the speaker is of low quality so as making the ring tones sound very cheap 0 
not only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic but it also managed to give away the entire movie and im not exaggerating every moment every plot point every joke is told in the trailer 0 
do not make the same mistake as me 0 
it works 1 
this movie suffered because of the writing it needed more suspense 0 
very good quality though 1 
the sound quality is excellent as well 1 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
the soundtrack sucked 0 
im so sorry but i really cant recommend it to anyone 0 
for that its worth checking out 1 
i would recommend purchasing the jabra jx10 series 2 which works flawlessly with my moto q go figure 1 
we also ordered the spinach and avocado salad the ingredients were sad and the dressing literally had zero taste 0 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
the steaks are all well trimmed and also perfectly cooked 1 
my sister has one also and she loves it 1 
the building itself seems pretty neat the bathroom is pretty trippy but i wouldnt eat here again 0 
avoid this one if you can 0 
it was way over fried 0 
car charger as well as ac charger are included to make sure you never run out of juicehighy recommended 1 
disappointed with battery 0 
at least think to refill my water before i struggle to wave you over for 10 minutes 0 
my mother and brother had to do thiswhen i saw robert ryan portraying this type of man it was a very good imitation of this type of individual and i was impressed 1 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
this one works and was priced right 1 
an absolute must visit 1 
integrated seamlessly with the motorola razr phone 1 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
their rotating beers on tap is also a highlight of this place 1 
the service was a bit lacking 0 
my girlfriends veal was very bad 0 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
he came running after us when he realized my husband had left his sunglasses on the table 1 
the problem was the script 0 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
the only downside is the service 0 
what a mistake that was 0 
the use of slowmotion needlessly repeats itself throughout the movie but is well backed up by bad acting and bad is a kind word here no continuity scenes that are thrown in for no reason whatsoever vehicles that looked like they were made from a corn flakes box and a directorial style that bordered on stupidity 0 
i am so pleased to know such a modern day genius is out there letting is passion for art drive him and taking us as an audience with him 1 
i find this inexcusable and so will probably be returning this phone and perhaps changing carriers 0 
battery is terrible 0 
after the first charge kept going dead after 12 minutes 0 
seriously flavorful delights folks 1 
despite the pans of reviewers i liked this movie 1 
we had a group of 70 when we claimed we would only have 40 and they handled us beautifully 1 
our server was very nice and even though he looked a little overwhelmed with all of our needs he stayed professional and friendly until the end 1 
her lines seem to have been written by a fifteen year old though they are trying oh so so hard to sound like how a fifteen year old would really um you know well talk 0 
it was just too horrible 0 
i have had mine for about a year and this christmas i bought some for the rest of the family 1 
it never condescends all the characters have good genuine hearts and believable problems 1 
i saw it as a child on tv back in 1973 when it was the stranger and i loved it 1 
dee snider just plain sucks 0 
great value 1 
but this movie really got to me 1 
lastly the mozzarella sticks they were the best thing we ordered 1 
also if your phone is dropped this case is not going to save it specially when dropped face down 0 
people who like european films and art movies will like this movie 1 
i bought this battery with a coupon from amazon and im very happy with my purchase 1 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
would not reccommend 0 
the ngage is still lacking in earbuds 0 
do not buy do not buyit sucks 0 
in other words the content level of this film is enough to easily fill a dozen other films 1 
i guess maybe we went on an off night but it was disgraceful 0 
the bipolarity of the ruthless thug one minute a ruthless killer the next minute a luvs diaper commercial is completely unconvincing 0 
i let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this bad idea we both hated it 0 
the film gives meaning to the phrase never in the history of human conflict has so much been owed by so many to so few 1 
i am so pleased to know such a modern day genius is out there letting is passion for art drive him and taking us as an audience with him 1 
the movie is not completely perfect but titta di girolamo will stay with you for a long time after the vision of the movie 1 
w810i is just superb 1 
now this is a movie i really dislike 0 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
there still are good actors around 1 
comfort for our whole family 1 
i got the aluminum case for my new palm vx and it worked really wellit has protected my handheld perfectly so far 1 
good prices 1 
we thought youd have to venture further away to get good sushi but this place really hit the spot that night 1 
the menu had so much good stuff on it i could not decide 1 
i dont know what the big deal is about this place but i wont be back yaall 0 
i didnt know pulled pork could be soooo delicious 1 
this place is like chipotle but better 1 
loved the casting of jimmy buffet as the science teacher 1 
the screen does get smudged easily because it touches your ear and face 0 
seller shipped quickly and much cheaper than the competitors 1 
not too screamy not to masculine but just right 1 
nice sound 1 
big disappointment with calendar sync 0 
clear crisp sound 1 
the phone gets extremely hot 0 
very easy to use 1 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
the directing and the cinematography arent quite as good 0 
very bad performance plays angela bennett a computer expert who is at home all the time 0 
he owns the film just as spacek owned coal miners daughter and quaid owned great balls of fire 1 
now this is a movie i really dislike 0 
this place is amazing 1 
first off the reception sucks i have never had more than 2 bars ever 0 
sooooo good 1 
even allowing for poor production values for the time 1971 and the format some kind of miniseries this is baaaaaad 0 
the fried rice was dry as well 0 
but the duet between the astronaut and his doctor at the beginning of the movie is a perfect exchange if one considers that this movie was made well into the cold war and the astronauts biggest fear is that he has crashed in the ussr 1 
the biggest complaint i have is the battery drains superfast 0 
i am going to have to be the first to negatively review this product 0 
very good phone 1 
i had strawberry tea which was good 1 
we ordered some old classics and some new dishes after going there a few times and were sorely disappointed with everything 0 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
it was a good thing that the tickets only cost five dollars because i would be mad if id have paid 750 to see this crap 0 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
the restaurant is very clean and has a family restaurant feel to it 1 
excellent sound quality 1 
it didnt work people can not hear me when i talk 0 
you cant beat the price on these 1 
the text messaging feature is really tricky to use 0 
at least think to refill my water before i struggle to wave you over for 10 minutes 0 
i had the chicken pho and it tasted very bland 0 
i cannot believe that the actors agreed to do this film 0 
i tried the cape cod ravoli chickenwith cranberrymmmm 1 
im so happy to be here 1 
the ending is so so perfect youll shed a tear 1 
the earpiece on this is too large or too heavyit keeps falling out of my ear 0 
finally after three or four times the spring of the latch broke and i could not use it any longer on the visor 0 
greatno problems at all 1 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
the meat was pretty dry i had the sliced brisket and pulled pork 0 
great service and food 1 
were jerks on the phone 0 
the seller is very understanding and patient i would definitely buy from them again 1 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
thus far have only visited twice and the food was absolutely delicious each time 1 
the instruction manual is lacking 0 
extremely tasty 1 
warning do not buy 0 
if you havent choked in your own vomit by the end by all the cheap drama and worthless dialogue youve must have bored yourself to death with this waste of time 0 
great value 1 
if you love authentic mexican food and want a whole bunch of interesting yet delicious meats to choose from you need to try this place 1 
still its quite interesting and entertaining to follow 1 
those phones are working just fine now 1 
now i know that i made a wise decision 1 
and it was boring 0 
everything captain howdy says is either laughable or just plain stupid 0 
battery chargelife is quite long 1 
my friend did not like his bloody mary 0 
delicious nyc bagels good selections of cream cheese real lox with capers even 1 
i rate this movie 910 1 
and there wasnt a single sour note struck actingwise either some surprisingly solid casting here 1 
that was nice 1 
im not really sure how joeys was voted best hot dog in the valley by readers of phoenix magazine 0 
enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film 1 
any grandmother can make a roasted chicken better than this one 0 
its a feelgood film and thats how i felt when i came out of the cinema 1 
excellent service 1 
i was mortified 0 
this is simply the best bluetooth headset for sound quality 1 
i guess that nobody at the network that aired this dribble watched it before putting it on 0 
but above all the exquisite visual composition of each moment with inventive and elegant use of closeup camera angle and lighting including pointillistic faux home movie footage is a wonder and joy to behold 1 
in particular the relationship between the bakery assistant and the waitress just didnt work for me at all 0 
keep up the good work amazon 1 
the phone gets extremely hot 0 
the service was poor and thats being nice 0 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
so they performed 1 
i wear glasses and it fits fine with them 1 
ordered a double cheeseburger got a single patty that was falling apart picture uploaded yeah still sucks 0 
i thought errol flynn was brilliant as custer and has since become my favourite actor 1 
if there was ever an indication of a writer and a directors ability to meld two highly volatile temperaments into a seamless union of creativity then this is it 1 
but kevin spacey is an excellent verbal tsunami as buddy ackerman  and totally believable because he is a great actor 1 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
the only thing really worth watching was the scenery and the house because it is beautiful 1 
this film has no redeeming features 0 
definitely worth checking out 1 
and it was way to expensive 0 
this place is way too overpriced for mediocre food 0 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
great phone 1 
so anyone near you will hear part of your conversation 0 
in a word it is embarrassing 0

we have tried 2 units and they both failed within 2 months pros 0 
perhaps i caught them on an off night judging by the other reviews but im not inspired to go back 0 
just whatever you do avoid groove as its the antithesis of all that is good about human traffic 0 
even the squibs look awful 0

but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
it was just not a fun experience 1 
predictable but not a bad watch 1 
disappointed 0 
the chicken wings contained the driest chicken meat i have ever eaten 0 
just whatever you do avoid groove as its the antithesis of all that is good about human traffic 0 
a drive thru means you do not want to wait around for half an hour for your food but somehow when we end up going here they make us wait and wait 0 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
avoid this establishment 0 
its a little geeky but i think thats its sex on toast and it rocks and oozes sex right down to its battery embedded sleek stylish leather case 1 
i used bitpim a free program you can find on the internetto transfer data to the phonethe price of the cable was excellent 1

that company is a joke 0 
i love lane but ive never seen her in a movie this lousy 0 
and the sound quality is great 1 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
service was exceptional and food was a good as all the reviews 1 
dont make the same mistake that i did and please dont buy this phone 0 
she carries the movie well 1

a fantastic neighborhood gem 1 
i want to first say our server was great and we had perfect service 1 
the shrimp tender and moist 1 
the menu is always changing food quality is going down service is extremely slow 0 
i contacted the company and they told me that although the unit was still under warranty if i couldnt produce my receipt i was out of luck 0 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
so anyone near you will hear part of your conversation 0 
went for lunch service was slow 0 
this movie is excellentangel is beautiful and scamp is adorablehis little yelps when hes scaredand the funniest parts are whenscamp is caught under the curtain and when angel and scamp are singing ive never had this feeling beforei totally recommend this movieits coming out on special edition on june 20the cover has scamp on a garbage can and angel underneath the lid 1 
the films dialogue is natural real to life 1

not a weekly haunt but definitely a place to come back to every once in a while 1 
i own a jabra earset and was very happy with it but the sound quality especially outgoing on this is better 1 
a good film by a great director 1 
this movie is also revealing 1 
great choice 1 
anyways the food was definitely not filling at all and for the price you pay you should expect more 0 
sending it back 0 
the acting as youd expect from this cast is top notch 1 
looks great and is strong 1 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
there were too many close ups 0 
the scripting of the subtle comedy is unmatched by any movie in recent years 1 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
this frog phone charm is adorable and very eye catching 1 
however after about a year the fliptop started to get loose and wobbly and eventually my screen went black and i couldnt receive and place calls 0
