the plastic breaks really easy on this clip 0 
very good food great atmosphere1 1 
it features an outlandish array of memorable psychotic but lovable nuts 1 
ive had better not only from dedicated boba tea spots but even from jenni pho 0 
the company shipped my product very promptly and it works well 1 
not too screamy not to masculine but just right 1 
but if you liked movies like the matrix and better yet their sequels i think youll appreciate the thought provoking mindblowing experience this film will give you 1 
everything was perfect the night we were in 1 
this is cool because most cases are just open there allowing the screen to get all scratched up 1 
im not eating here 0 
dont buy this product 0 
doesnt last long 0 
if you want a sandwich just go to any firehouse 1 
the food is rich so order accordingly 1 
ive had better not only from dedicated boba tea spots but even from jenni pho 0 
just what i wanted 1 
how this piece of trash was ever released is beyond me the acting the story the characters the supposedly special effects etcits all wrong 0 
there is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again 0 
great phone 1 
cinematography noteworthy including fine views of barcelona and its famed gaudi towers 1 
i probably would not go here again 0 
delete this film from your mind 0 
his costars dont fare much better with people like morgan freeman jonah hill and ed helms just wasted 0 
it looks very nice 1 
what i really like there is the crepe station 1 
if the food isnt bad enough for you then enjoy dealing with the worlds worstannoying drunk people 0 
the servers are not pleasant to deal with and they dont always honor pizza hut coupons 0 
i was disgusted because i was pretty sure that was human hair 0 
delicious nyc bagels good selections of cream cheese real lox with capers even 1 
it was just too horrible 0 
total waste of time 0 
we have tried 2 units and they both failed within 2 months pros 0 
wow very spicy but delicious 1 
mishima is extremely uninteresting 0 
worst hour and a half of my lifeoh my gosh 0 
highquality chicken on the chicken caesar salad 1 
20th century foxs road house 1948 is not only quite a silly noir but is an implausible unmitigated bore of a movie 0 
you also cannot take pictures with it in the case because the lense is covered 0 
the malta settings are as dry and as barren as the dialogue 0 
the live music on fridays totally blows 0 
im glad i found this product on amazon it is hard to find it wasnt high priced 1 
dont buy it 0 
crisp and clear 1 
its just painful 0 
this is the phone to get for 2005 i just bought my s710a and all i can say is wow 1 
jabra ear gels r the best 1 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
this film highlights the fundamental flaws of the legal process that its not about discovering guilt or innocence but rather is about who presents better in court 1 
i believe the screenwriter did a good job of tying up the loose ends 1 
the ambiance isnt much better 0 
on the ground right next to our table was a large smeared beensteppedinandtrackedeverywhere pile of green bird poop 0 
it is not good 0 
the voice recognition thru the handset is excellent 1 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
then a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use 0 
the cast was great 1 
what a big waste of time 0 
i found a six inch long piece of wire in my salsa 0 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
the ear buds only play music in one ear 0 
the attempts at humor were pitiful and story is so awful it dosent bear thinking about which basically involves a vulcan stealing the enterprise to find god seriously i just didnt care about any of this film and oh not to mention uhura does a belly dance to distract male guards 0 
i love my 350 headset my jabra350 bluetooth headset is great the reception is very good and the ear piece is a comfortable fit 1 
the earpiece on this is too large or too heavyit keeps falling out of my ear 0 
never got it 0 
his performance as awarded was stunning 1 
the worst sappiest dialogue i could go on and on 0 
this convention never worked well in the past and certainly doesnt work here 0 
what on earth is irons doing in this film 0 
the pancake was also really good and pretty large at that 1 
the loudspeaker option is great the bumpers with the lights is very appealing 0 
the design is very odd as the ear clip is not very comfortable at all 0 
i love this place 1 
delete this film from your mind 0 
it looks very nice 1 
a great touch 1 
a great way to finish a great 1 
i waited and waited 0 
its like a really sexy party in your mouth where youre outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party 1 
weve tried to like this place but after 10 times i think were done with them 0 
i seriously cannot believe that the owner has so many unexperienced employees that all are running around like chickens with their heads cut off 0 
very disappointed and wondered how it could be in the oscar shortlist 0 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
definitely a bargain 1 
my friend did not like his bloody mary 0 
i got the car charger and not even after a week the charger was brokeni went to plug it in and it started smoking 0 
great price also 1 
penne vodka excellent 1 
all the actors give a wonderful performance especially jennifer rubin as jamie harris who changes from the nervous starlet in the beginning through the strange events she is part of to the cool star 1 
unfortunately it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees 0 
this is simply the best bluetooth headset for sound quality 1 
this greedy corporation will never see another dime from me 0 
this item worked great but it broke after 6 months of use 0 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
poor product 0 
but despite these few flaws this case is of exceptional quality and well worth the additional costs of owning an official oem product 1 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
it wasnt busy either also the building was freezing cold 0 
all the bread is made inhouse 1 
i go to far too many places and ive never seen any restaurant that serves a 1 egg breakfast especially for 400 0 
another thing i didnt really like is when a character got punched in the face a gallon of blood would spew forth soon after 0 
i saw this short film on hbo the other day and absolutely loved it 1 
i got it because it was so small and adorable 1 
it was a long time that i didnt see a so charismatic actor on screen 1 
it is an hour and half waste of time following a bunch of very pretty high schoolers whine and cry about life 0 
comfortable nice range good battery life 1 
now we were chosen to be tortured with this disgusting piece of blatant american propaganda 0 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
generally it just lacked imagination 0 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
yet plantronincs continues to use the same flawed charger design 0 
his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic 1 
the food is about on par with dennys which is to say not good at all 0 
it was clear that she had the range and ability to pull off this part 1 
i highly recommend this modest priced cellular phone 1 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
she carries the movie well 1 
highly recommended a 1 
this frog phone charm is adorable and very eye catching 1 
the lighting is just dark enough to set the mood 1 
the fact is this film is a wonderful heartwarming tale about two people chasing their dreams 1 
the volume for the ringer is real good you have choices how loud 1 
maybe there would be a reasonable explanation for this atrocity 0 
the football scenes at the end were perplexing 0 
i am not a filmmaker nor am i a director but i would hide my head in the sand if id spent whatever amount of money and time on this movie 0 
if you plan to use this in a car forget about it 0 
nice sound 1 
fantastic buy and will get again for whatever my next phone is 1 
i felt insulted and disrespected how could you talk and judge another human being like that 0 
youll love how thin it is 1 
i consider this theft 0 
pretty awesome place 1 
the design is very odd as the ear clip is not very comfortable at all 0 
having trouble with volume 0 
things happen characters personalities change plot twists occur for no real reason other than that script calls for it 0 
no shifting no bubbling no peeling not even a scratch nothingi couldnt be more happier with my new one for the droid 1 
i have read others reviews here but i havent had any problem with it 1 
i would not recommend this place 0 
his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic 1 
i definitly recommend 1 
kind of flops around 0 
service sucks 0 
the food was very good 1 
does not fit 0 
the film gives meaning to the phrase never in the history of human conflict has so much been owed by so many to so few 1 
soyo technology sucks 0 
waited 2 hours never got either of our pizzas as many other around us who came in later did 0 
the screen size is big key pad lit well enough and the camera quality is excellent for a camera phone 1 
a greasy unhealthy meal 0 
i dont recommend unless your car breaks down in front of it and you are starving 0 
its a piece of crap 0 
the waitress and manager are so friendly 1 
works great 1 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
also were served hot bread and butter and home made potato chips with bacon bits on topvery original and very good 1 
the jamaican mojitos are delicious 1 
the headset fulfills my requirements so i am happy with my purchase 1 
also difficult to put onid recommend avoiding this product 0 
looks great and is strong 1 
this film offers many delights and surprises 1 
dont bother go to the store 0 
i struggle to find anything bad to say about it 1 
which are small and not worth the price 0 
good beer drink selection and good food selection 1 
the scripting of the subtle comedy is unmatched by any movie in recent years 1 
it works fine on my motorola 325 cellphone and a lot better than the wornout battery did 1 
i checked out this place a couple years ago and was not impressed 0 
ive owned this phone for 7 months now and can say that its the best mobile phone ive had 1 
excellent 1 
does everything it should and more 1 
the food is good 1 
i saw this movie and i thought this is a stupid movie 0 
i didnt realize how wonderful the short really is until the last two scenes 1 
bland not a liking this place for a number of reasons and i dont want to waste time on bad reviewing ill leave it at that 0 
total letdown i would much rather just go to the camelback flower shop and cartel coffee 0 
i had a pretty satifying experience 1 
the service was a little slow considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace 0 
all in all its an insult to ones intelligence and a huge waste of money 0 
everything on the menu is terrific and we were also thrilled that they made amazing accommodations for our vegetarian daughter 1 
the sangria was about half of a glass wine full and was 12 ridiculous 0 
not a pleasant voyage of selfdiscovery 0 
omg i felt like i had never eaten thai food until this dish 1 
however i recently watched the whole thing again on dvd and i was completely struck by how extremely stupid the storyline was how it contained holes inconsistencies and frankly a whole lot of crap and how horrid the dancing was 0 
it was horrendous 0 
5 stars for the brick oven bread app 1 
the scallop dish is quite appalling for value as well 0 
i never walked out of a movie faster 0 
his costars dont fare much better with people like morgan freeman jonah hill and ed helms just wasted 0 
the pizza selections are good 1 
i great reception all the time 1 
the performances are real and gripping the crocdodile is extremely well done indeed if the black water website is to be believed thats because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous 1 
this one works and was priced right 1 
kris kristoffersen is good in this movie and really makes a difference 1 
everything was perfect the night we were in 1 
lately they have been extremely nice and helpful on the phone 1 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
why are these sad little vegetables so overcooked 0 
i had verizon 2 years ago and really liked their service 1 
of all the dishes the salmon was the best but all were great 1 
everything about it is fine and reasonable for the price ie 1 
these are the nicest restaurant owners ive ever come across 1 
very windresistant 1 
my husband and i ate lunch here and were very disappointed with the food and service 0 
the point is the journey a journey that touches every member of the family 1 
started watching this but didnt believe in any of the characters 0 
i enjoyed reading this book to my children when they were little 1 
he also came back to check on us regularly excellent service 1 
im so happy to be here 1 
updatewent back for a second time and it was still just as amazing 1 
dont buy it 0 
and then tragedy struck 0 
dont go here 0 
it presents a idyllic yet serious portrayal of the ups and downs of the characters lives 1 
the only thing really worth watching was the scenery and the house because it is beautiful 1 
after arguing with verizon regarding the dropped calls we returned the phones after two days 0 
no actress has been worse used that june allison in this movie 0 
trying to make a call on these is an exercise in frustration 0 
maybe if they werent cold they would have been somewhat edible 0 
it came free with a dvd player i bought but i still turned the thing off halfway through because i was embarrassed for howell 0 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
in a word it is embarrassing 0 
this was utterly confusing at first which caused me to lose a couple of very very important contacts 0 
a very good film indeed about great and unconditional love 1 
it was clear that she had the range and ability to pull off this part 1 
its one of the movies i need to see whenever it comes on tvnever mind the fact that i already have it memorized 1 
this pda rocks 1 
you could drive a semi truck into these holes 0 
i think this restaurant suffers from not trying hard enough 0 
ordered an appetizer and took 40 minutes and then the pizza another 10 minutes 0 
to sum the film up breeders is a terrible cheaply made horror movie that should be avoided like the ebola virus 0 
never again will i be dining at this place 0 
unless youre just out to visually collect all extant films of austens work you can skip this one 0 
the staff is always super friendly and helpful which is especially cool when you bring two small boys and a baby 1 
after 3 months screen just went black all of a sudden 0 
as i said abovepretty useless 0 
coming here is like experiencing an underwhelming relationship where both parties cant wait for the other person to ask to break up 0 
i always order from the vegetarian menu during dinner which has a wide array of options to choose from 1 
the phone was unusable and was not new 0 
i will continue to come here on ladies night andddd date night highly recommend this place to anyone who is in the area 1 
it also took her forever to bring us the check when we asked for it 0 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
headset works great was packaged nicely to avoid any damage 1 
dont go here 0 
at around 4 pm i bought it at around 8pm i started to watch at around 815pm i fast forwarded the remaining film to see if there was anything left watchable for a human being with a brain but there wasnt 0 
incredible 1 
crust is not good 0 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
dont buy it 0 
probably not in a hurry to go back 0 
i dont understand how this garbage got on the shelves of the movie store its not even a real movie 0 
nice spicy and tender 1 
it was a huge awkward 15lb piece of cow that was 34ths gristle and fat 0 
battery is terrible 0 
it rocked my world and is certainly a must see for anyone with no social or physical outlets 1 
at no point in the proceedings does it look remotely like america 0 
ps the only scene in the movie that was cool is when the central character finds her room blown up 1 
ive owned this phone for 7 months now and can say that its the best mobile phone ive had 1 
the shipping time was also very quick 1 
how stupid is that 0 
stay away from the q 0 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
the potato chip order was sad i could probably count how many chips were in that box and it was probably around 12 0 
just what i wanted 1 
my friend did not like his bloody mary 0 
very displeased 0 
i enjoyed reading this book to my children when they were little 1 
the best place in vegas for breakfast just check out a sat or sun 1 
i am very happy 1 
cinematography noteworthy including fine views of barcelona and its famed gaudi towers 1 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
first of all it doesnt wear well 0 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
the screen does get smudged easily because it touches your ear and face 0 
the sides are delish mixed mushrooms yukon gold puree white corn beateous 1 
lately they have been extremely nice and helpful on the phone 1 
i saw this short film on hbo the other day and absolutely loved it 1 
very good quality though 1 
i would highly recommend this 1 
the fries were great too 1 
dont bother go to the store 0 
however after finally watching this film i realized that not only had i had a closed mind to the brilliance it depicts i also found myself watching it over and over again 1 
the directing and the cinematography arent quite as good 0 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
point your finger at any item on the menu order it and you wont be disappointed 1 
barney is definitely super de duper 1 
not impressed 0 
great earpiece 1 
it was either too cold not enough flavor or just bad 0 
painful on the ear 0 
to those who find this movie intelligent or even masterful i can only say its your intelligence and your imagination you obviously used to try and make some sense of this pitiful attempt its in our human nature to try and make sense of things 0 
the accompanied software is almost brilliant 1 
this is a chilly unremarkable movie about an author livingworking in a chilly abstruse culture 0 
think of the film being like a dream 1 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
if you look for authentic thai food go else where 0 
worked great 1 
the only good thing was that it fits comfortably on small ears 1 
it looses connection to the phone even when it is within a couple feet between the two 0 
plantronics bluetooth excelent buy 1 
and the sound quality is great 1 
he deserves 5 stars 1 
i also didnt like the on button it felt like it would crack with use 0 
the story itself is just predictable and lazy 0 
the burger i got the gold standard a 17 burger and was kind of disappointed 0 
highly recommended 1 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
the foreigner is not worth one second of your time 0 
i must say i have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again 1 
youll love it 1 
the warmth it generates is in contrast to its austere backdrop 1 
a truly truly bad film 0 
the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach 0 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
the best scene in the movie was when gerardo is trying to find a song that keeps running through his head 1 
del taco is pretty nasty and should be avoided if possible 0 
worked very well paired with a treo 700w and as a skype headset on my pc using a usb bluetooth transceiver 1 
in fact i liked it better than interview with a vampire and i liked this lestat stuart townsend better than cruises attempt 1 
hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in 0 
i believe that pitch black was done well 1 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
pretty piece of junk 0 
otherwise easy to install and use clear sound 1 
people who like european films and art movies will like this movie 1 
go watch it 1 
it is a joy to use 1 
to those who find this movie intelligent or even masterful i can only say its your intelligence and your imagination you obviously used to try and make some sense of this pitiful attempt its in our human nature to try and make sense of things 0 
very displeased 0 
an hour and a half i wish i could bring back 0 
the scenes with the ohsomature neighbourgirl are a misplace 0 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
horrible dont waste your time and money 0 
reversible plug works great 1 
a world better than 95 of the garbage in the theatres today 1 
i love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it 1 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
i like the fact that it rests lightly against your ear rather than inside 1 
its pretty surprising that this wonderful film was made in 1949 as hollywood generally had its collective heads in the sand concerning black and white issues at that time 1 
i left the theater with a lilt in my step joy in my heart and hope for the human race 1 
this is definitely one of the better documentaries i have seen looking at family relationships and marriage 1 
oh yeah and the storyline was pathetic too 0 
the sangria was about half of a glass wine full and was 12 ridiculous 0 
this is so embarassing and also my ears hurt if i try to push the ear plug into my ear 0 
this wonderful experience made this place a muststop whenever we are in town again 1 
filmiing was less expansive 0 
this phone works great 1 
i tried the cape cod ravoli chickenwith cranberrymmmm 1 
so dont go there if you are looking for good food 0 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
this isnt a small family restaurant this is a fine dining establishment 1 
maybe there would be a reasonable explanation for this atrocity 0 
terrible management 0 
awful service 0 
buttons are too small 0 
kids pizza is always a hit too with lots of great side dish options for the kiddos 1 
the story is lame not interesting and never really explains the sinister origins of the puppets 0 
its a great tool for entertainment communication and data managementoh be sure to use activesync 42 for optimal data synchronization results 1 
very disappointing 0 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
the story is lame not interesting and never really explains the sinister origins of the puppets 0 
he surely doesnt know how to make a coherent action movie from the screenwriter of air force one who was only obliged to write the script just for a big sum of money 0 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
using all earpieces left or right this thing will not stay on my ear 0 
what the hell kind of crap is that 0 
i give it 2 thumbs down 0 
it is simple to use and i like it 1 
im a big fan of this series mostly due to anne rices style sensitivities and treatments 1 
pretty piece of junk 0 
it was horrendous 0 
then as if i hadnt wasted enough of my life there they poured salt in the wound by drawing out the time it took to bring the check 0 
by the time the film ended i not only disliked it i despised it 0 
tasted like dirt 0 
you will leave the theater wanting to go out and dance under the stars 1 
the headset fulfills my requirements so i am happy with my purchase 1 
they do not last forever but is not overly expensive to replaceeasy to operate and the sound is much better than others i have tried 1 
these products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet 0 
service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is vegas and located inside the crystals shopping mall by aria 1 
i think i was one of the people who found this another one of roths pearls 1 
battery life is also great 1 
the acting from all involved and that includes those like shatner and nimoy is bad and washed out and making them seem as old as they look in real life the special effects are tacky like when spock has to rescue kirk on a jet pack when he falls down from a mountain 0 
i really wanted the plantronics 510 to be the right one but it has too many issues for methe good 0 
an extensive menu provides lots of options for breakfast 1 
it felt too light and tinny 0 
hitchcock is a great director 1 
my fiancé and i came in the middle of the day and we were greeted and seated right away 1 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
it wasnt busy either also the building was freezing cold 0 
total brunch fail 0 
when i received my pita it was huge it did have a lot of meat in it so thumbs up there 1 
the waiter wasnt helpful or friendly and rarely checked on us 0 
i keep watching it over and over 1 
i love this phone it is very handy and has a lot of features 1 
it didnt work people can not hear me when i talk 0 
special mention should be made of the superb music score and sound effects which are an integral element in helping to make this such a memorable and enjoyable cartoon 1 
the whole experience was underwhelming and i think well just go to ninja sushi next time 0 
never got it 0 
great sound and service 1 
im not really sure how joeys was voted best hot dog in the valley by readers of phoenix magazine 0 
he is almost unbearable to watch on screen he has little to no charisma and terrible comedic timing 0 
the range is very decent ive been able to roam around my house with the phone in the living room with no receptionsound quality issues 1 
will never ever go back and have told many people what had happened 0 
this frog phone charm is adorable and very eye catching 1 
it really created a unique feeling though 1 
however bt headsets are currently not good for real time games like firstperson shooters since the audio delay messes me up 0 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
it is very educational for children 1 to 8 years old 1 
we had so much to say about the place before we walked in that he expected it to be amazing but was quickly disappointed 0 
host staff were for lack of a better word bitches 0 
what possesed me to get this junk i have no idea 0 
it deserves strong love 1 
the descriptions said yum yum sauce and another said eel sauce yet another said spicy mayowell none of the rolls had sauces on them 0 
i really loved the story line and the poler bear was kinda cutebut if anyone has a question about fort steele just ask away 1 
even when the women finally show up there is no sign of improvement the most expected things happen and by the time the film is over you might be far asleep 0 
great phone 1 
it was horrible 0 
and considering the two of us left there very full and happy for about 20 you just cant go wrong 1 
seriously its not worth wasting your or your kids time on 0 
four stars for the food the guy in the blue shirt for his great vibe still letting us in to eat 1 
the attractive set used throughout most of the film is an eyepleasing gem 1 
tonight i had the elk filet specialand it sucked 0 
very friendly staff 1 
so i am here to warn youdo not rent this movie it is the dumbest thing you have never seen 0 
great service and food 1 
great product 1 
i own 2 of these cases and would order another 1 
nice docking station for home or work 1 
the earpiece on this is too large or too heavyit keeps falling out of my ear 0 
item does not match picture 0 
love this place hits the spot when i want something healthy but not lacking in quantity or flavor 1 
the refried beans that came with my meal were dried out and crusty and the food was bland 0 
excellent product 1 
the battery works great 1 
they have a really nice atmosphere 1 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
sending it back 0 
the writer gorman bechard undoubtedly did his homework because all references are industry and characterage appropriate 1 
what makes this story different are the terrific production values faultless photography composition and editing the terrific casting the underappreciated brian keith playing a bully teddy and vivid history 1 
everything on the menu is terrific and we were also thrilled that they made amazing accommodations for our vegetarian daughter 1 
after two i felt disgusting 0 
tried to go here for lunch and it was a madhouse 0 
conclusion i loved it 1 
this battery is an excellent bargain 1 
the cinematography is simply stunning to say the least and the fx are nothing if not stateoftheart 1 
highly recommended a 1 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
the screen does get smudged easily because it touches your ear and face 0 
i still maintain that monkeys shouldnt make headphones we just obviously dont share enough dna to copy the design over to humans 0 
they could be used as exemplars for any set designer 1 
if the food isnt bad enough for you then enjoy dealing with the worlds worstannoying drunk people 0 
bluetooth range is good a few days ago i left my phone in the trunk got a call and carried the conversation without a hitch 1 
think of the film being like a dream 1 
the flair bartenders are absolutely amazing 1 
a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it 1 
we have tried 2 units and they both failed within 2 months pros 0 
after arguing with verizon regarding the dropped calls we returned the phones after two days 0 
and it was way to expensive 0 
but what really made it unwatchable was the direction 0

we recently witnessed her poor quality of management towards other guests as well 0 
dont waste your time here 0 
the directing seems too pretentious 0 
the sound quality is good and functionality is awesome 1 
later i found myself lost in the power of the film 1 
oh and i forgot to also mention the weird color effect it has on your phone 0 
service sucks 0 
this place is like chipotle but better 1 
dont waste your money and time 0 
today the graphics are crap 0 
i definitly recommend 1 
timely shipment and quality product 1 
level 5 spicy was perfect where spice didnt overwhelm the soup 1 
it is worth the drive 1 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
yeah the movie pretty much sucked 0 
gets a signal when other verizon phones wont 1 
it makes very strange ticking noises before it ends the call 0 
poor talk time performance 0 
the phone gets extremely hot 0 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
never heard of any of them except cole who was totally unbelievable in the part 0 
ray charles life provided excellent biographical material for the film which goes well beyond being just another movie about a musician 1 
its extremely slow and takes forever to do anything with it 0 
it clicks into place in a way that makes you wonder how long that mechanism would last 0 
i wasnt really impressed with strip steak 0 
by far the best cheesecurds we have ever had 1 
i have eaten here multiple times and each time the food was delicious 1 
wont go back 0 
really bad 0 
then i watched it again two sundays ago march 20th 2005 and i began to really enjoy it and this time i taped the entire thing 1 
this is definitely a cult classic well worth viewing and sharing with others 1 
its a long time since i was so entertained by a movie 1 
its a sad movie but very good 1 
great choice 1 
comfortable nice range good battery life 1 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
the sweet potato tots were good but the onion rings were perfection or as close as i have had 1 
i cannot believe that the actors agreed to do this film 0 
you have to hold the phone at a particular angle for the other party to hear you clearly 0 
the update procedure is difficult and cumbersome 0 
even when the women finally show up there is no sign of improvement the most expected things happen and by the time the film is over you might be far asleep 0 
it felt like a very gripping intelligent stage play but without the overly theatrical feeling one actually gets from watching people on a stage which plays on everyones terror of a white lie escalating to monstrous consequences 1 
in a word it is embarrassing 0 
the owners really really need to quit being soooooo cheap let them wrap my freaking sandwich in two papers not one 0 
i really wanted the plantronics 510 to be the right one but it has too many issues for methe good 0 
how can you call yourself a steakhouse if you cant properly cook a steak i dont understand 0 
though the wind and the lion is told largely through the eyes of the son every member of the family can identify with one of the characters whether it be sean connerys noble brigand candace bergens feisty heroine john hustons wily john hay or steve kanalys spiffy radiant ruthless cando lieutenant roosevelts big stick 1 
i had a salad with the wings and some ice cream for dessert and left feeling quite satisfied 1 
i hate those things as much as cheap quality black olives 0 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
lately they have been extremely nice and helpful on the phone 1 
you need two hands to operate the screenthis software interface is decade old and cannot compete with new software designs 0 
i get absolutely horrible reception in my apartment where with other phones i have not had this problem 0 
i could not stand to even watch it for very long for fear of losing iq 0 
used and dirty 0 
if you want a sandwich just go to any firehouse 1 
tasted like dirt 0 
i was particularly pleased with the acting ability of dwight schultz 1 
the burger had absolutely no flavor the meat itself was totally bland the burger was overcooked and there was no charcoal flavor 0 
the goat taco didnt skimp on the meat and wow what flavor 1 
the bipolarity of the ruthless thug one minute a ruthless killer the next minute a luvs diaper commercial is completely unconvincing 0 
my husband and i ate lunch here and were very disappointed with the food and service 0 
theres really nothing bad i can say about this headset 0 
you share general loewenhielms exquisite joy in his partaking of the cailles en sarcophage even though you are just watching a movie but you do wish for just a small sample to savor 1 
it failed to convey the broad sweep of landscapes that were a great part of the original 0 
unfortunately it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees 0 
im translating movies for a living and this is the first movie in my 5year working experience that i found offensive to my intelligence 0 
one of the best mexican movies ever and one of the less understood even by mexican themselves no matter how identified the should have felt with it 1 
totally believable 1 
good value great food great service 1 
theres barely a boring moment in the film and there are plenty of humorous parts 1 
what happened next was prettyoff putting 0 
i was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar not only because the quality is great but the service is fast and the food impeccable 1 
as a sushi lover avoid this place by all means 0 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
i believe the screenwriter did a good job of tying up the loose ends 1 
i have been very happy with the 510 and have had no complaints from any one regarding my sound quality on their end 1 
yeah the movie pretty much sucked 0 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
i waited and waited 0 
its a little geeky but i think thats its sex on toast and it rocks and oozes sex right down to its battery embedded sleek stylish leather case 1 
avoid at all cost 0 
i sat riveted to the tv screen 1 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
this is one of the best movies out there that shows such strong sibling bond for each other 1 
do not buy do not buyit sucks 0 
you cant beat the price on these 1 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
these were so good we ordered them twice 1 
i believe that this place is a great stop for those with a huge belly and hankering for sushi 1 
hell no will i go back 0 
i think this restaurant suffers from not trying hard enough 0 
it was a waste of my money 0 
item does not match picture 0 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
crash is a depressing little nothing that provokes emotion but teaches you nothing if you already know racism and prejudice are bad things 0 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
if good intentions made a film great then this film might be one of the greatest films ever made 1 
but if you liked movies like the matrix and better yet their sequels i think youll appreciate the thought provoking mindblowing experience this film will give you 1 
down the drain because of a weak snap 0 
the chips that came out were dripping with grease and mostly not edible 0 
the burger i got the gold standard a 17 burger and was kind of disappointed 0 
excellent bluetooth headset 1 
i believe the screenwriter did a good job of tying up the loose ends 1 
great bluetooth 1 
my girlfriends veal was very bad 0 
if you havent gone here go now 1 
the bus boy on the other hand was so rude 0 
the movie is littered with overt racial slurs towards the black cast members and in return the whites are depicted as morons and boobs 0 
from here on the widmark character turns unintentionally comical 0 
plus its only 8 bucks 1 
no ear loop needed its tiny and the sound is great 1 
insults profound deuchebaggery and had to go outside for a smoke break while serving just to solidify it 0 
the only thing worse than taylors acting was stanwycks singing 0 
a standout scene 1 
this movie now joins revenge of the boogeyman and zombiez as part of the hellish trinity of horror films 0 
if youre not familiar check it out 1 
i was bored throughout the whole damn thing 0 
disapointing results 0 
poor construction 0 
useless phone simply deaf 0 
he also came back to check on us regularly excellent service 1 
add betty white and jean smart and you have a great cast everyone played their parts really well 1 
its one of the movies i need to see whenever it comes on tvnever mind the fact that i already have it memorized 1 
i really dont see how anyone could enjoy this movie 0 
his losing his marbles so early in the proceedings is totally implausible and unconvincing 0 
duris has a wholesome appearance and gives a fine performance 1 
awesome device 1 
the acting is beyond abysmal 0 
my phone doesnt slide around my car now and the grip prevents my phone from slipping out of my hand 1 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
the real killer is the volume and of course it breaking 0 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
the scenes with the ohsomature neighbourgirl are a misplace 0 
works as described 1 
i will not be eating there again 0 
insults profound deuchebaggery and had to go outside for a smoke break while serving just to solidify it 0 
its a long time since i was so entertained by a movie 1 
the two main characters may be two of the most believable children i ever saw put on screen 1 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
bad script bad direction and horrible acting make this one plain bad 0 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
my only complaint is the standard sound volume is a little low even when turned up to 5of 5 0 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
it always cuts out and makes a beep beep beep sound then says signal failed 0 
what possesed me to get this junk i have no idea 0 
no ear loop needed its tiny and the sound is great 1 
her role was played well 1 
very good lunch spot 1 
we started with the tuna sashimi which was brownish in color and obviously wasnt fresh 0 
saw the movie today and thought it was a good effort good messages for kids 1 
for that price i can think of a few place i would have much rather gone 0 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
i hate those things as much as cheap quality black olives 0 
i mean this in a terrible way 0 
product is useless since it does not have enough charging current to charge the 2 cellphones i was planning to use it with 0 
the food was great as always compliments to the chef 1 
their research and development division obviously knows what theyre doing 1 
of all the dishes the salmon was the best but all were great 1 
the burger had absolutely no flavor the meat itself was totally bland the burger was overcooked and there was no charcoal flavor 0 
this is a stunning movie 1 
the reception is excellent 1 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
then theres the plot holes 0 
i dont think it would hold it too securly on your belt 0 
these headphones were a great find and i think they are perhaps the best purchase ive made in the last several years seriously 1 
totally different with loads of understatement and black comedy this is a film few get to see but those who do will remember it 1 
also were served hot bread and butter and home made potato chips with bacon bits on topvery original and very good 1 
very good lunch spot 1 
verizons bills however are difficult to understand even though their pricing plans are simple 0 
then the film just dropped the ball 0 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
i was very pleased to see that i could replace my well travled swivel holster for my blackberry flip 1 
on a positive note our server was very attentive and provided great service 1 
if the food isnt bad enough for you then enjoy dealing with the worlds worstannoying drunk people 0 
im pleased 1 
lange had become a great actress 1 
reaching for the bottom row is uncomfortable and the send and end keys are not where i expect them to be3 0 
definitely worth seeing its the sort of thought provoking film that forces you to question your own threshold of loneliness 1 
bad purchase 0 
great product 1 
however the ear pads come off easily and after only one week i lost one 0 
excellent starter wireless headset 0 
eclectic selection 1 
last time buying from you 0 
at no point in the proceedings does it look remotely like america 0 
i thought it was bad 0 
very clear quality sound and you dont have to mess with the sound on your ipod since you have the sound buttons on the headset 1
