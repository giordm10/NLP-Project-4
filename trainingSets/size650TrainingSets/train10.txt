really bad 0 
comes with a strong light that you can use to light up your camera shots and even flash sos signals seriously 1 
i love the camera its really pretty good quality 1 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
there was so much hype over this phone that i assumed it was the best my mistake 0 
the ngage is still lacking in earbuds 0 
very very disappointed ordered the 35 big bay plater 0 
i wont be back 0 
everything was good and tasty 1 
there is really nothing for me at postinos hope your experience is better 0 
needless to say we will never be back here again 0 
at least think to refill my water before i struggle to wave you over for 10 minutes 0 
the microphone also works well but according to people i have called it applifies everything 1 
weve have gotten a much better service from the pizza place next door than the services we received from this restaurant 0 
i believe every one should see this movie as i think few people outside of south africa understand its past and what is being attempted in the truth and reconciliation process 1 
the movie lacks visual interest drama expression of feeling and celebration of the very patriotism that underlines the narrative 0 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
a bit predictable 0 
it was not good 0 
its one of the most boring horror movies from the 90s mainly because it starts slow and centers in a boring atmosphere 0 
i could barely stomach the meal but didnt complain because it was a business lunch 0 
i only hear garbage for audio 0 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
the acting was decidely wooden though no worse than a period universal b movie 0 
ive only had my bluetooth for a few weeks but i really like it 1 
its just painful 0 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
when i opened the sandwich i was impressed but not in a good way 0 
absolutely great 1 
timely shipment and quality product 1 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
they could serve it with just the vinaigrette and it may make for a better overall dish but it was still very good 1 
i dont know what the big deal is about this place but i wont be back yaall 0 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
we enjoy their pizza and brunch 1 
i only hear garbage for audio 0 
ordered an appetizer and took 40 minutes and then the pizza another 10 minutes 0 
on the good side the staff was genuinely pleasant and enthusiastic a real treat 1 
at no point in the proceedings does it look remotely like america 0 
my friend loved the salmon tartar 1 
i found a six inch long piece of wire in my salsa 0 
strike 2 who wants to be rushed 0 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
its a fresh subtle and rather sublime effect 1 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
my drink was never empty and he made some really great menu suggestions 1 
all the pretty pictures in the world cannot make up for a piece of work that is flawed at the core 0 
service stinks here 0 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
i enjoyed it 1 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
i as well wouldve given godfathers zero stars if possible 0 
the tracfonewebsite is user friendly and makes it easy toactivate etc 1 
but in any case the best part is you can download these pictures to your laptop using ir or even send pictures from your laptop to the phone 1 
i have had tmobile service for 2 or 3 years now and i am pretty happy with it 1 
the only place good for this film is in the garbage 0 
the construction of the headsets is poor 0 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
this phone tries very hard to do everything but fails at its very ability to be a phone 0 
the film has great actors a master director a significant themeat least a wouldbe significant theme undertone of fifties existential worldweariness aerial scenes that ought to have thrilled both senses and imagination and characters about which one might deeply care 1 
but despite these few flaws this case is of exceptional quality and well worth the additional costs of owning an official oem product 1 
you wont be disappointed 1 
i would have given no star if i was able 0 
the poor actors 0 
oh yeah and the storyline was pathetic too 0 
the only thing really worth watching was the scenery and the house because it is beautiful 1 
a film not easily forgotten 1 
another note about this phones appearance is that it really looks rather bland especially in the all black model 0 
after a year the battery went completely dead on my headset 0 
i loved it 1 
the food was great as always compliments to the chef 1 
my drink was never empty and he made some really great menu suggestions 1 
the food was delicious our bartender was attentive and personable and we got a great deal 1 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
im not eating here 0 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
the voice recognition thru the handset is excellent 1 
everything about this film is simply incredible 1 
i liked it 1 
this was reflected not only in the cast but also in the belowpar script which borrowed much from the earlier classic 0 
i was left shattered from the experience of watching this film and i took a good two hours to fully recover 0 
avoid at all costs 0 
the color is even prettier than i thought it would be and the graphics are incredibly sharp 1 
i dont think there are any redeeming qualities in this remake 0 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
sam shepards portrayal of a gung ho marine was sobering 1 
2 thumbs up to this seller 1 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
went for lunch service was slow 0 
it doesnt make you look cool 0 
do not waste your time 0 
its a sad movie but very good 1 
but even the talented carrell cant save this 0 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
i was deeply impressed with the character he played 1 
using all earpieces left or right this thing will not stay on my ear 0 
i didnt know pulled pork could be soooo delicious 1 
recommend with confidence 1 
not nearly as good looking as the amazon picture makes it look 0 
we definately enjoyed ourselves 1 
20th century foxs road house 1948 is not only quite a silly noir but is an implausible unmitigated bore of a movie 0 
the tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu 0 
those burgers were amazing 1 
if there was ever an indication of a writer and a directors ability to meld two highly volatile temperaments into a seamless union of creativity then this is it 1 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
waitress was sweet and funny 1 
ryans bar is definitely one edinburgh establishment i wont be revisiting 0 
this battery is an excellent bargain 1 
juano hernandez an exceptional actor who played supporting roles in many films of the era is a proud black man who is accused of murdering a white man in the south 1 
but other than that the movie seemed to drag and the heroes didnt really work for their freedom 0 
too bad cause i know its family owned i really wanted to like this place 0 
will be back again 1 
classywarm atmosphere fun and fresh appetizers succulent steaks baseball steak 1 
poor product 0 
how this piece of trash was ever released is beyond me the acting the story the characters the supposedly special effects etcits all wrong 0 
beware this is not a trashy cult movie this is trash period 0 
my friend did not like his bloody mary 0 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
everything captain howdy says is either laughable or just plain stupid 0 
i saw this film over christmas and what a great film it was 1 
the food sucked which we expected but it sucked more than we could have imagined 0 
i dont think you will be disappointed 1 
the only thing really worth watching was the scenery and the house because it is beautiful 1 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
very good quality though 1 
the pizza tasted old super chewy in not a good way 0 
if this premise sound stupid thats because it is 0 
you get incredibly fresh fish prepared with care 1 
i dont know exactly what it is about this movie but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our familys memories 1 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
but kevin spacey is an excellent verbal tsunami as buddy ackerman  and totally believable because he is a great actor 1 
the kids are annoying 0 
the price is reasonable and the service is great 1 
this place is great 1 
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
no im going to eat the potato that i found some strangers hair in it 0 
it always cuts out and makes a beep beep beep sound then says signal failed 0 
his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic 1 
they do not last forever but is not overly expensive to replaceeasy to operate and the sound is much better than others i have tried 1 
sounds good reasonably priced and effective its that simple 1 
i have to use the smallest earpieces provided but it stays on pretty well 1 
this case has passed the one year mark and while it shows signs of wear it is 100 functional 1 
their steaks are 100 recommended 1 
best service and food ever maria our server was so good and friendly she made our day 1 
i can think of no other film where something vitally important occurs every other minute 1 
buttons are too small 0 
im glad i found this product on amazon it is hard to find it wasnt high priced 1 
good servicecheck 1 
thank you for such great service 1 
they were goldencrispy and delicious 1 
this phone works great 1 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
who in their right mind is gonna buy this battery 0 
the food is very good for your typical bar food 1 
the battery is completely useless to me 0 
its not what it says it is 0 
which has more depth and character than the man underneath it 0 
do not waste your money here 0 
go watch it 1 
nice docking station for home or work 1 
im pleased 1 
this is a good joint 1 
this movie was kind of long in length but i enjoyed every minute of it 1 
in other words the content level of this film is enough to easily fill a dozen other films 1 
pretty cool i would say 1 
the wind and the lion is well written and superbly acted 1 
these are the central themes of the film and they are handled ineptly stereotypically and with no depth of imagination 0 
i dont know exactly what it is about this movie but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our familys memories 1 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
other than that the leather is nice and soft the fit is very tight the cut out for the face is a good shape 1 
wont go back 0 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
there are massive levels massive unlockable characters its just a massive game 1 
special mention should be made of the superb music score and sound effects which are an integral element in helping to make this such a memorable and enjoyable cartoon 1 
for service i give them no stars 0 
ray charles is legendary 1 
i found a six inch long piece of wire in my salsa 0 
i dont think well be going back anytime soon 0 
probably never coming back and wouldnt recommend it 0 
generally it just lacked imagination 0 
i can assure you that you wont be disappointed 1 
it really created a unique feeling though 1 
the price was very good and with the free shipping and all it was a good purchase 1 
it is just the sort of pap that is screened in the afternoon to punish the unemployed for not having jobs 0 
linksys should have some way to exchange a bad phone for a refurb unit or something 0 
hes a national treasure 1 
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 
she ordered a toasted english muffin that came out untoasted 0 
service is friendly and inviting 1 
the potatoes were like rubber and you could tell they had been made up ahead of time being kept under a warmer 0 
we have gotten a lot of compliments on it 1 
dont waste your time here 0 
50 down the drain 0 
i did not bother contacting the company for few dollar product but i learned the lesson that i should not have bought this form online anyway 0 
dont make the same mistake i did 0 
good works fine 1 
very satisifed with that 1 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
i can think of no other film where something vitally important occurs every other minute 1 
howeverthe riingtones are not the best and neither are the games 0 
even the squibs look awful 0 
the attempts at humor were pitiful and story is so awful it dosent bear thinking about which basically involves a vulcan stealing the enterprise to find god seriously i just didnt care about any of this film and oh not to mention uhura does a belly dance to distract male guards 0 
tonight i had the elk filet specialand it sucked 0 
there was a warm feeling with the service and i felt like their guest for a special treat 1 
the phone is sturdy and waterproof 1 
the least said about the acting the better 0 
the food sucked which we expected but it sucked more than we could have imagined 0 
excellent short film 1 
went for lunch service was slow 0 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
i thought it was bad 0 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
piece of trash 0 
it is an hour and half waste of time following a bunch of very pretty high schoolers whine and cry about life 0 
director paul matthews who also wrotedirected the weak 1995 monster movie grim clearly doesnt know how to pace his films 0 
this place receives stars for their appetizers 1 
add betty white and jean smart and you have a great cast everyone played their parts really well 1 
i love the scream movies and all horror movies and this one ranks way up there 1 
check it out 1 
they have great dinners 1 
this mostly routine factbased tv drama gets a boost from the fine performance by cole 1 
that movie was bad 0 
design flaw 0 
if this premise sound stupid thats because it is 0 
best of all is the rotating feature very helpful 1 
then i watched it again two sundays ago march 20th 2005 and i began to really enjoy it and this time i taped the entire thing 1 
generally it just lacked imagination 0 
dont buy this product 0 
battery is terrible 0 
my order was not correct 0 
in fact its hard to remember that the part of ray charles is being acted and not played by the man himself 1 
special thanks to dylan t for the recommendation on what to order all yummy for my tummy 1 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
price is good too 1 
rating 010 grade z note the show is so bad that even mother of the cast pull her daughter out of the show 0 
go and see it 1 
poorly contstruct hinge 0 
in my house i was getting dropped coverage upstairs and no coverage in my basement 0 
nice headset priced right 1 
we sat another ten minutes and finally gave up and left 0 
my phone doesnt slide around my car now and the grip prevents my phone from slipping out of my hand 1 
i wont spoil it but the ending in pretty amazing 1 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
not good enough for the price 0 
worst hour and a half of my lifeoh my gosh 0 
the warm beer didnt help 0 
much more interesting more action more suspense and less of the unneeded controversy 1 
this movie does an excellent job of revealing the complexity of the task and the incredible challenges facing south africa 1 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
worked perfectly 1 
every thing on phone work perfectly she like it 1 
food was really good and i got full petty fast 1 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
however i needed some better instructions 0 
painful on the ear 0 
this company charge me a restocking fee and still not given me my refund back 0 
first of all there are enough racial stereotypes and racial jokes to offend everyone 0 
it was a bit too sweet not really spicy enough and lacked flavor 0 
i tried the cape cod ravoli chickenwith cranberrymmmm 1 
the worst piece of crap ever along with the verizon customer service 0 
it has everything i need and i couldnt ask for more 1 
this case seems well made 1 
there was a warm feeling with the service and i felt like their guest for a special treat 1 
and considering the two of us left there very full and happy for about 20 you just cant go wrong 1 
i own a jabra earset and was very happy with it but the sound quality especially outgoing on this is better 1 
so i am here to warn youdo not rent this movie it is the dumbest thing you have never seen 0 
really pleased with this product so far 1 
ive never been treated so bad 0 
i believe that this place is a great stop for those with a huge belly and hankering for sushi 1 
service was good and the company was better 1 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
last time buying from you 0 
the plot well i said id let that one go 0 
not recommended 0 
the servers are not pleasant to deal with and they dont always honor pizza hut coupons 0 
i would highly recommend this product 1 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
the phone loads super 1 
i really like this product over the motorola because it is allot clearer on the ear piece and the mic 1 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
the story unfolds in 18th century jutland and the use of period music played on period instruments is just one more fine touch 1 
if you want healthy authentic or ethic food try this place 1 
nonlinear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well 1 
reaching for the bottom row is uncomfortable and the send and end keys are not where i expect them to be3 0 
it wasnt busy at all and now we know why 0 
in a word it is embarrassing 0 
i was disgusted because i was pretty sure that was human hair 0 
tonight i had the elk filet specialand it sucked 0 
the best phone in market 1 
wont go back 0 
it was a great phone 1 
the worst sappiest dialogue i could go on and on 0 
the 12 mega pixel camera being a part of a phone is reasonably good7 1 
it felt like a very gripping intelligent stage play but without the overly theatrical feeling one actually gets from watching people on a stage which plays on everyones terror of a white lie escalating to monstrous consequences 1 
she carries the movie well 1 
magical help 1 
the chips and sals a here is amazing 1 
for sushi on the strip this is the place to go 1 
best tater tots in the southwest 1 
a truly truly bad film 0 
there are massive levels massive unlockable characters its just a massive game 1 
i was deeply impressed with the character he played 1 
this is infuriating 0 
it was way over fried 0 
one of the worst shows of all time 0 
great food and awesome service 1 
definitely will come back here again 1 
now this dish was quite flavourful 1 
im happy about this purchase good quality and low price 1 
at first i thought i was grtting a good deal at 744 until i plugged it into my phone v3c razr 0 
the structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema 1 
the film has great actors a master director a significant themeat least a wouldbe significant theme undertone of fifties existential worldweariness aerial scenes that ought to have thrilled both senses and imagination and characters about which one might deeply care 1 
a lot of websites have been rating this a very good phone and so do i 1 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
yes its that bad 0 
ill be looking for a new earpiece 0 
but when someone strives for greatness and poetry but delivers a muddled and often ridiculous story a bunch of disparate scenes pretentious dialogue then you get the worst kind of a movie that some other reviewer very accurately defined as pretentious crap 0 
all in all i give this one a resounding 9 out of 10 1 
awesome selection of beer 1 
lovely little thriller from hitchcock with lots of nice shenanigans surrounding a murdered spy a kidnapped child a nasty church a foreign plot and some random taxidermists 1 
its just painful 0 
good quality 1 
same evening him and i are both drastically sick 0 
what happened next was prettyoff putting 0 
how can that bethe audio quality is poor 0 
just really good so far probably the best bt headset i have ever had 1 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
i found a six inch long piece of wire in my salsa 0 
a week later after i activated it it suddenly died 0 
but this movie really got to me 1 
insults profound deuchebaggery and had to go outside for a smoke break while serving just to solidify it 0 
good works fine 1 
why are these sad little vegetables so overcooked 0 
excellent phone 1 
the battery runs down quickly 0 
the sound quality for the device is unacceptableunless you are in a really quiet area you almost hear nothing 0 
in fact this stinker smells like a directtovideo release 0 
if that bug never showed up i would have given a 4 for sure but on the other side of the wall where this bug was climbing was the kitchen 0 
awesome service and food 1 
not my thing 0 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
car charger as well as ac charger are included to make sure you never run out of juicehighy recommended 1 
is pretty funny 1 
on three different occasions i asked for well done or medium well and all three times i got the bloodiest piece of meat on my plate 0 
both do good jobs and are quite amusing 1 
i dont think it would hold it too securly on your belt 0 
the desserts were a bit strange 0 
i am also very happy with the price 1 
today the graphics are crap 0 
nargile i think you are great 1 
i was hoping for more 0 
i have had this phone for over a year now and i will tell you its not that great 0 
so bad 0 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
this is so embarassing and also my ears hurt if i try to push the ear plug into my ear 0 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
but she is still a bad actress repeating her robotic face moves in each of her pictures 0 
setup went very smoothly 1 
big disappointment with calendar sync 0 
food was good service was good prices were good 1 
i was very disappointed 0 
it failed to convey the broad sweep of landscapes that were a great part of the original 0 
this totally unfunny movie is so over the top and pathetic and unrealistic that throughout the whole 90 minutes of utter torture i probably looked at my watch about 70000 times 0 
this is a witty and delightful adaptation of the dr seuss book brilliantly animated by upas finest and thoroughly deserving of its academy award 1 
four stars for the food the guy in the blue shirt for his great vibe still letting us in to eat 1 
very dissapointing performance 0 
i will never forget it now 1 
total waste of time 0 
i could not stand to even watch it for very long for fear of losing iq 0 
the awful dialogue and hopeless overacting by everyone who gets shot top off a real waste of space and time 0 
bacon is hella salty 1 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
this short film certainly pulls no punches 0 
reasonably priced also 1 
excellent bluetooth headset 1 
its fits like a glove and is strong secure and durable 1 
a very very very slowmoving aimless movie about a distressed drifting young man 0 
but kevin spacey is an excellent verbal tsunami as buddy ackerman  and totally believable because he is a great actor 1 
i was very pleased to see that i could replace my well travled swivel holster for my blackberry flip 1 
the service here is fair at best 0 
i have purchased these for both family and friends and all enjoy their clarity and ease of use 1 
im not sure what he was trying to do with this film 0 
ordered burger rare came in well done 0 
the steaks are all well trimmed and also perfectly cooked 1 
go watch it 1 
an interesting premise and billy drago is always good as a dangerous nutbag side note id love to see drago stephen mchattie and lance hendrikson in a flick together talk about raging cheekbones 1 
were jerks on the phone 0 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
wont ever go here again 0 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
i still maintain that monkeys shouldnt make headphones we just obviously dont share enough dna to copy the design over to humans 0 
they are so easy to love but even more easy to identify with 1 
much less than the jawbone i was going to replace it with 1 
the design is very good4 1 
this place is disgusting 0 
not to mention the combination of pears almonds and bacon is a big winner 1 
i cannot make calls at certain places 0 
very disappointed 0 
very disappointing 0 
very convenient since we were staying at the mgm 1 
bad fit way too big 0 
service was very prompt 1 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
i am far from a sushi connoisseur but i can definitely tell the difference between good food and bad food and this was certainly bad food 0 
first time there and might just be the last 0 
i love this bluetooth 1 
it has a very good plot it holds your complete attention the acting is superb tom wilkinson was fantastic and emily watson was also very good 1 
disappointed with battery 0 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
battery is terrible 0 
its a gloriously fun fast paced and fairly accurate portrayal of the night of a raver 1 
excellent bluetooth headset 1 
this movie is possibly one of the most creative works of horror ever 1 
which is precisely why i am giving it such a bad review 0 
due to this happening on every call i was forced to stop using this headset 0 
watching washing machine twirling around wouldnt hurt your eyes as much as this show 0 
its pure brilliance 1 
we enjoy their pizza and brunch 1 
painful on the ear 0 
they know how to make them here 1 
it makes very strange ticking noises before it ends the call 0 
everything from acting to cinematography was solid 1 
poor sound quality 0 
ordered burger rare came in well done 0 
it showed exactly how the government and the scientist argued for humanity and the reasons of the gadget 1 
garbo who showed right off the bat that her talents could carry over from the silent era i wanted to see some of her silent work but netflix doesnt seem to be stocking them 1 
not my thing 0 
ive never been more insulted or felt disrespected 0 
so for our enjoyment we get to see them run around play games and be dangerous 1 
in my house i was getting dropped coverage upstairs and no coverage in my basement 0 
waited and waited and waited 0 
waste of money 0 
i found a six inch long piece of wire in my salsa 0 
great phone 1 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
all it took was one drop from about 6 inches above the kitchen counter and it was crackedi am not impressed and i am not laughing 0 
o my gosh the best phone i have ever had 1 
they brought a fresh batch of fries and i was thinking yay something warm but no 0 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
and there wasnt a single sour note struck actingwise either some surprisingly solid casting here 1 
mediocre food 0 
the cow tongue and cheek tacos are amazing 1 
if you see it you should probably just leave it on the shelf 0 
really awful 0 
ill definitely be in soon again 1 
this does not fit the palm tungsten e2 and it broke the first time i tried to plug it in 0 
in summary this was a largely disappointing dining experience 0 
ordered a double cheeseburger got a single patty that was falling apart picture uploaded yeah still sucks 0 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
however the keypads are so tinny that i sometimes reach the wrong buttons 0 
i dont think i will be back for a very long time 0 
their chow mein is so good 1 
it is indescribably the most annoying and idiotic show i have ever seen 0 
terrible product and waste of money 0 
i rate this movie 910 1 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
its one of the movies i need to see whenever it comes on tvnever mind the fact that i already have it memorized 1 
waste of money 0 
this fixes all the problems 1 
the bottowm lineanother worthless cheap gimmick from sprint 0 
i would avoid this place if you are staying in the mirage 0 
there are many continuity errors one other user commented on different cars in the garage joes glassesthe one that got to me the most was the fact joes facial hair configuration seemed to change from scene to scene 0 
they made this case too small and is very difficult to install 0 
i struggle to find anything bad to say about it 1 
it wasnt busy at all and now we know why 0 
coming here is like experiencing an underwhelming relationship where both parties cant wait for the other person to ask to break up 0 
this scene is very strong and unpleasant 0 
its this pandering to the audience that sabotages most of his films 0 
id like to return it 0 
this place deserves no stars 0 
very very disappointed ordered the 35 big bay plater 0 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
the transfers are very good 1 
im not impressed with the concept or the food 0 
service was fantastic 1 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
i find wasting food to be despicable but this just wasnt food 0 
the presentation of the food was awful 0 
id say that would be the hardest decision honestly all of ms dishes taste how they are supposed to taste amazing 1 
however paul schrader has indeed made a film about mishima that is both superb complex 1 
at no point in the proceedings does it look remotely like america 0 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
i thoroughly enjoyed it when christopher eccleston took control of the tardis and the continuation of the series 1 
wonderful lil tapas and the ambience made me feel all warm and fuzzy inside 1 
very clear quality sound and you dont have to mess with the sound on your ipod since you have the sound buttons on the headset 1 
i took back my money and got outta there 0 
if you want a real scare rent this one 1 
top line dont waste your time and money on this one its as bad as it comes 0 
but i definitely would not eat here again 0 
i had a pretty satifying experience 1 
i have had this phone for over a year now and i will tell you its not that great 0 
this company charge me a restocking fee and still not given me my refund back 0 
the movie is full of wonderful dancing hence the title 1 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
we received a white colored battery that goes dead after a couple hoursthe original used to last a week but still lasts longer than thereplacement 0 
i want to first say our server was great and we had perfect service 1 
i work in the hospitality industry in paradise valley and have refrained from recommending cibo any longer 0 
the black eyed peas and sweet potatoes unreal 1 
i dont think ill be running back to carlys anytime soon for food 0 
first time there and might just be the last 0 
we are sending it back 0 
mark my words this is one of those cult films like evil dead 2 or phantasm that people will still be discovering and falling in love with 20 30 40 years down the line 1 
disappointed 0 
the cashew cream sauce was bland and the vegetables were undercooked 0 
dont waste your time watching this rubbish nonresearched film 0 
the tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu 0 
do not waste your time 0 
we had 7 at our table and the service was pretty fast 1 
this movie contained an allstar cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i havent seen before 1 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
punishment park is a brilliant piece of cinema 1 
we recently witnessed her poor quality of management towards other guests as well 0 
this movie was kind of long in length but i enjoyed every minute of it 1 
dont buy it 0 
the cashew cream sauce was bland and the vegetables were undercooked 0 
i dont think there are any redeeming qualities in this remake 0 
echo problemvery unsatisfactory 0 
its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
the tracfonewebsite is user friendly and makes it easy toactivate etc 1 
john wayne did an incredible job for being so young in the movie industry 1 
great software for motorolas 1 
it was that loudglad to say that the plantronics 510 maintains a flawless connection to my cell and with no static during normal use 1 
they have a really nice atmosphere 1 
first time going but i think i will quickly become a regular 1 
but when i check voice mail at night the keypad backlight turns off a few seconds into the first message and then im lost 0 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
and it was boring 0 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
okay i like to consider myself a fair critic so ill give credit where credits duethe creature effects were actually pretty cool 1 
i will never forget it now 1 
works well 1 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
very true to shakespear and a must for all shakespear fans 1 
the story line is just awful 0 
good works fine 1 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
my experience was terrible this was my fourth bluetooth headset and while it was much more comfortable than my last jabra which i hated 0 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
the turkey and roast beef were bland 0 
the jerky camera movements were also annoying 0 
youll love how thin it is 1 
we recently witnessed her poor quality of management towards other guests as well 0 
we have gotten a lot of compliments on it 1 
i can think of no other film where something vitally important occurs every other minute 1 
i dont think ill be running back to carlys anytime soon for food 0 
design flaw 0 
the block was amazing 1 
sound quality on both end is excellent i use headset to call my wife and ask my wife to use headset to call me 2 1 
not good by any stretch of the imagination 0 
i was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar not only because the quality is great but the service is fast and the food impeccable 1 
the movie is full of wonderful dancing hence the title 1 
i really enjoyed eating here 1 
a great film by a great director 1 
eew this location needs a complete overhaul 0 
very funny 1 
at first glance it is a lovely bakery cafe nice ambiance clean friendly staff 1 
definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly will return next time im in vegas 1 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in 0 
took an hour to get our food only 4 tables in restaurant my food was luke warm our sever was running around like he was totally overwhelmed 0 
the entire audience applauded at the conclusion of the film 1 
i sat riveted to the tv screen 1 
i am so pleased to know such a modern day genius is out there letting is passion for art drive him and taking us as an audience with him 1 
have been going since 2007 and every meal has been awesome 1 
the management is rude 0 
the script is a big flawed mess 0 
both do good jobs and are quite amusing 1 
first time there and might just be the last 0 
the sides are delish mixed mushrooms yukon gold puree white corn beateous 1 
i love this cable it allows me to connect any miniusb device to my pc 1 
this movie is a good and humorous comment on life in 2006 1 
but the convoluted plot just didnt convince me and much of the film was watched with a weird questioning glance 0 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
the descriptions said yum yum sauce and another said eel sauce yet another said spicy mayowell none of the rolls had sauces on them 0 
but she is still a bad actress repeating her robotic face moves in each of her pictures 0 
couldnt figure it out 0 
plug was the wrong size 0 
delicious and i will absolutely be back 1 
i am very impressed with this headset from plantronics 1 
the only thing worse than taylors acting was stanwycks singing 0 
the reception is excellent 1 
there was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters 0 
improper description i had to return it 0 
the cg opening sequence in space looked like it could have been created on microsoft slideshow for gods sake 0 
best tacos in town by far 1 
i wasnt expecting oscar material but this 0 
plus its only 8 bucks 1 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
then i exchanged for the same phone even that had the same problem 0 
i received it quickly and it works great 1 
the staff was very attentive 1 
constantine gives everything the right intensity and seems to have a good understanding of the underlying psychological motivations 1 
if it was to turn my good day feeling into a night of disturbing memories than i guess he succeeded 0 
good item low price 1 
it fits my ear well and is comfortable on 1 
this place lacked style 0 
it lasts less than 3o minutes if i actually try to use the phonemy wife has the same phone with the same problem 0 
my only problem is i thought the actor playing the villain was a low rent michael ironside 0 
the film is well paced understated and one of the best courtroom documentaries ive seen 1 
cant say enough good things about this place 1 
its really easy 1 
i have had tmobile service for 2 or 3 years now and i am pretty happy with it 1 
ive had this for nearly 2 years and it has worked great for me 1 
he deserves 5 stars 1 
give this one a look 1 
great pocket pc phone combination 1 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
but even the talented carrell cant save this 0 
logitech bluetooth headset is a 10 1 
do not buy for d807wrongly advertised for d807 0 
for a self proclaimed coffee cafe i was wildly disappointed 0 
i was very disappointed 0 
new battery works great in phone 1 
i own 2 of these cases and would order another 1 
it was so cool 1 
buyer beware you could flush money right down the toilet 0 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
if i take a picture the battery drops a bar and starts beeping letting me know its dieing 0 
this is hands down the best phone ive ever had 1 
theres barely a boring moment in the film and there are plenty of humorous parts 1 
great phone 1 
always a great time at dos gringos 1 
then scene where they debated whether or not to sack the trumpeter who falsely was accused for the murder is pure horror really stupid 0 
excellent short film 1 
so i basically threw my money out the window for nothing 0 
hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in 0 
if only someone involved with it knew how to string together narrative 0 
the cocktails are all handmade and delicious 1 
i hate to disagree with my fellow yelpers but my husband and i were so disappointed with this place 0 
star trek v the final frontier is the worst in the series 0 
there was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters 0 
i promise they wont disappoint 1 
dont waste your money 0 
cant upload ringtones from a third party 0 
good protection and does not make phone too bulky 1 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
attempting artiness with black white and clever camera angles the movie disappointed became even more ridiculous as the acting was poor and the plot and lines almost nonexistent 0 
meredith m was better than all right 1 
initially the local sites in the film which was filmed here in buffalo intrigued me 1 
if you love authentic mexican food and want a whole bunch of interesting yet delicious meats to choose from you need to try this place 1
