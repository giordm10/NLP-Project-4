ordered a double cheeseburger got a single patty that was falling apart picture uploaded yeah still sucks 0 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
looks great and is strong 1 
it felt too light and tinny 0 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
the worst was the salmon sashimi 0 
i am so pleased to know such a modern day genius is out there letting is passion for art drive him and taking us as an audience with him 1 
poor voice clarity 0 
their steaks are 100 recommended 1 
sauce was tasteless 0 
wow what a bad film 0 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
i want to first say our server was great and we had perfect service 1 
it wasnt busy at all and now we know why 0 
instead we got a bore fest about a whiny spoiled brat babysitting 0 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
nothing at all to recommend 0 
worthwhile 1 
the incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film 1 
thanks good a movie like this was done and released 1 
trying to make a call on these is an exercise in frustration 0 
a bit predictable 0 
poor sound quality 0 
the vanilla ice cream was creamy and smooth while the profiterole choux pastry was fresh enough 1 
service is friendly and inviting 1 
but kevin spacey is an excellent verbal tsunami as buddy ackerman  and totally believable because he is a great actor 1 
highly recommended a 1 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
the goat taco didnt skimp on the meat and wow what flavor 1 
the instructions didnt explain that a microphone jack could be used 0 
i am going to have to be the first to negatively review this product 0 
similarly the delivery man did not say a word of apology when our food was 45 minutes late 0 
but this movie really got to me 1 
this early film from future goremeister lucio fulci is a very good addition to the giallo subgenre 1 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
despite how hard i rate businesses its actually rare for me to give a 1 star 0 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
who in their right mind is gonna buy this battery 0 
once you get inside youll be impressed with the place 1 
nonlinear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well 1 
the best electronics of the available fm transmitters 1 
this is an outstanding little restaurant with some of the best food i have ever tasted 1 
the story unfolds in 18th century jutland and the use of period music played on period instruments is just one more fine touch 1 
i really loved the story line and the poler bear was kinda cutebut if anyone has a question about fort steele just ask away 1 
the cast is good 1 
shrimp when i unwrapped it i live only 12 a mile from brushfire it was literally ice cold 0 
i great reception all the time 1 
perabo has a nice energy level and is obviously very comfortable in front of a camera 1 
great place to relax and have an awesome burger and beer 1 
during several different 2 minute calls i experienced 5 drops and it was in an area that had 5 bars 0 
he came running after us when he realized my husband had left his sunglasses on the table 1 
cinematography the film was shot in an interesting way 1 
they have a really nice atmosphere 1 
always a great time at dos gringos 1 
in conclusion i will not bother with this movie because a volcano in los angeles is nothing but nonsense 0 
conclusion very filling meals 1 
overall i am psyched to have a phone which has all my appointments and contacts in and gets great reception 1 
battery life is also great 1 
i exchanged the sony ericson z500a for this and im pretty happy with that decision 1 
it fits my ear well and is comfortable on 1 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
i can say that the desserts were yummy 1 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
do not purchase this phone 0 
very poor service 0 
lange had become a great actress 1 
there was hardly any meat 0 
i still maintain that monkeys shouldnt make headphones we just obviously dont share enough dna to copy the design over to humans 0 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
2 thumbs up 1 
babie bop is very cute 1 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
having trouble with volume 0 
bad purchase 0 
best ive found so far ive tried 2 other bluetooths and this one has the best quality for both me and the listener as well as ease of using 1 
avoid at all cost 0 
i dont know what the big deal is about this place but i wont be back yaall 0 
after trying many many handsfree gadgets this is the one that finally works well 1 
all in all i give this one a resounding 9 out of 10 1 
you truly take this journey through the eyes and soul of a child 1 
i tried talking real loud but shouting on the telephone gets old and i was still told it wasnt great 0 
ive had this for nearly 2 years and it has worked great for me 1 
the food was outstanding and the prices were very reasonable 1 
but the premise of the film was so ridiculous that the president of the us 0 
it is indescribably the most annoying and idiotic show i have ever seen 0 
i dont like this nokia either 0 
its also great to see that renowned silent screenwriter frances marion hasnt missed a step going from silent to sound 1 
will be back again 1 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
if it was to turn my good day feeling into a night of disturbing memories than i guess he succeeded 0 
my drink was never empty and he made some really great menu suggestions 1 
pretty awesome place 1 
you learn a lot about the real inside emotions of people in this movie and a lot about the movie business itself 1 
save your money ive had this item for 11 months now 0 
this is a beautiful phone 1 
hot dishes are not hot cold dishes are close to room tempi watched staff prepare food with bare hands no gloveseverything is deep fried in oil 0 
a must study for anyone interested in the worst sins of industrial design 0 
the film is well paced understated and one of the best courtroom documentaries ive seen 1 
there is no real plot 0 
bad purchase 0 
i think it was robert ryans best film because he portrayed someone like my father and he was a schizophrenic in real lifemy father although he never murdered anyone but was affected more so during the second world war which made him worse 1 
they were excellent 1 
she ordered a toasted english muffin that came out untoasted 0 
for a product that costs as much as this one does i expect it to work far better and with greater ease than this thing does 0 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
the characters are fleshed out surprisingly well particularly grimes and blake and all the actors deliver their sharply scripted lines with just the right amount of deadpan tongue in cheek to make the dialogue both hilarious and realistic 1 
it just blew 0 
the films sole bright spot was jonah hill who will look almost unrecognizable to fans of the recent superbad due to the amount of weight he lost in the interim 1 
omg i felt like i had never eaten thai food until this dish 1 
waste of money 0 
the fries were great too 1 
i was very disappointed in the movie 0 
unfortunately the ability to actually know you are receiving a call is a rather important feature and this phone is pitiful in that respect 0 
ive had no trouble accessing the internet downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions 1 
the worst phone from samsungcrap this crappy samsung e715 is the worst i have ever seeen 0 
this was like the final blow 0 
you wont regret it 1 
ill even say it again  this is torture 0 
they have great dinners 1 
this phone is pretty sturdy and ive never had any large problems with it 1 
really pleased with this product so far 1 
the result is a powerhouse achievement made more timely now perhaps because of our cultures disturbing fascination with celebrity and its distorted interpretations of fame 1 
highly recommended a 1 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
probably not in a hurry to go back 0 
reversible plug works great 1 
a very charming film with wonderful sentiment and heart 1 
they could be used as exemplars for any set designer 1 
after trying many many handsfree gadgets this is the one that finally works well 1 
weve tried to like this place but after 10 times i think were done with them 0 
this case has passed the one year mark and while it shows signs of wear it is 100 functional 1 
useless phone simply deaf 0 
there is so much good food in vegas that i feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to rice and company 0 
we enjoy their pizza and brunch 1 
i received my orders well within the shipping timeframe everything was in good working order and overall i am very excited to have this source 1 
ill put this gem up against any movie in terms of screenplay cinematography acting postproduction editing directing or any other aspect of filmmaking 1 
the plot well i said id let that one go 0 
i had the chicken pho and it tasted very bland 0 
every thing on phone work perfectly she like it 1 
a good film by a great director 1 
very very sad 0 
there are the usual hitchcock logic flaws 0 
i saw mirrormask last night and it was an unsatisfactory experience 0 
the potatoes were like rubber and you could tell they had been made up ahead of time being kept under a warmer 0 
sooooo good 1 
it was way over fried 0 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
but when someone strives for greatness and poetry but delivers a muddled and often ridiculous story a bunch of disparate scenes pretentious dialogue then you get the worst kind of a movie that some other reviewer very accurately defined as pretentious crap 0 
big disappointment with calendar sync 0 
this is an excellent film 1 
having to humour him just to get by and get through the day was so apt 1 
i always order from the vegetarian menu during dinner which has a wide array of options to choose from 1 
if it were possible to give them zero stars theyd have it 0 
the bathrooms are clean and the place itself is well decorated 1 
thats how id describe this painfully dreary timewaster of a film 0 
they could be used as exemplars for any set designer 1 
very funny 1 
pretty cool i would say 1 
but whatever it was that cost them so much it didnt translate to quality thats for sure 0 
the buttons for on and off are bad 0 
the only downside is the service 0 
both of them were truly unbelievably good and i am so glad we went back 1 
thats how id describe this painfully dreary timewaster of a film 0 
the headsets are easy to use and everyone loves them 1 
itll be a regular stop on my trips to phoenix 1 
however after finally watching this film i realized that not only had i had a closed mind to the brilliance it depicts i also found myself watching it over and over again 1 
tried to go here for lunch and it was a madhouse 0 
car charger as well as ac charger are included to make sure you never run out of juicehighy recommended 1 
it is simple to use and i like it 1 
yes this film does require a rather significant amount of puzzlesolving but the pieces fit together to create a beautiful picture 1 
it sure does beat the nachos at the movies but i would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant 0 
anne heche was utterly convincing 1 
i highly recommend this device to everyone 1 
there were too many close ups 0 
talk about great customer service of course we will be back 1 
this company charge me a restocking fee and still not given me my refund back 0 
terrible my car will not accept this cassette 0 
it has all the features i want 1 
not even good for camp value 0 
bad fit way too big 0 
see both films if you can 1 
its so bad its actually worth seeing just for that reason 0 
this place deserves no stars 0 
the real killer is the volume and of course it breaking 0 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
she ordered a toasted english muffin that came out untoasted 0 
another note about this phones appearance is that it really looks rather bland especially in the all black model 0 
call me a nut but i think this is one of the best movies ever 1 
i highly recommend these and encourage people to give them a try 1 
very much disappointed with this company 0 
some may say this buffet is pricey but i think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot 1 
i just dont know how this place managed to served the blandest food i have ever eaten when they are preparing indian cuisine 0 
this is a great product sure beats using your fingers 1 
call me a nut but i think this is one of the best movies ever 1 
razr battery good buy 1 
the plastic breaks really easy on this clip 0 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
i guess i should have known that this place would suck because it is inside of the excalibur but i didnt use my common sense 0 
its a gloriously fun fast paced and fairly accurate portrayal of the night of a raver 1 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
the worst was the salmon sashimi 0 
the acting as youd expect from this cast is top notch 1 
yet i enjoy watching it 1 
now we were chosen to be tortured with this disgusting piece of blatant american propaganda 0 
waste of 13 bucks 0 
but the duet between the astronaut and his doctor at the beginning of the movie is a perfect exchange if one considers that this movie was made well into the cold war and the astronauts biggest fear is that he has crashed in the ussr 1 
a lot of websites have been rating this a very good phone and so do i 1 
the films dialogue is natural real to life 1 
i had ordered a motorola data cable got a very well finished and working product 1 
lightweight and works well 1 
razr battery good buy 1 
it is unusable in a moving car at freeway speed 0 
if you havent gone here go now 1 
this is just a great movie 1 
very happy with this product 1 
youd have to have the iq of particularly stupid mollusk not to see that one coming 0 
i wont be back 0 
however after about a year the fliptop started to get loose and wobbly and eventually my screen went black and i couldnt receive and place calls 0 
i only hear garbage for audio 0 
dont waste your money 0 
good service very clean and inexpensive to boot 1 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
however after about a year the fliptop started to get loose and wobbly and eventually my screen went black and i couldnt receive and place calls 0 
third the cheese on my friends burger was cold 0 
excellent hands free tool 1 
of all the dishes the salmon was the best but all were great 1 
cumbersome design 0 
del taco is pretty nasty and should be avoided if possible 0 
we also ordered the spinach and avocado salad the ingredients were sad and the dressing literally had zero taste 0 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
its kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly its embarrassing how childlike the company is 0 
worst hour and a half of my lifeoh my gosh 0 
black water is a thriller that manages to completely transcend its limitations its an indie flick by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience 1 
anyways the food was definitely not filling at all and for the price you pay you should expect more 0 
the food was great as always compliments to the chef 1 
a piece of cinematic garbage captured on celluloid 0 
but whatever it was that cost them so much it didnt translate to quality thats for sure 0 
it was probably dirt 0 
the holster that arrived did not match the photo in the ad 0 
this is a witty and delightful adaptation of the dr seuss book brilliantly animated by upas finest and thoroughly deserving of its academy award 1 
an amazing finale to possibly the best trilogy of all time 1 
those burgers were amazing 1 
this really is how vegas fine dining used to be right down to the menus handed to the ladies that have no prices listed 1 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
this is so embarassing and also my ears hurt if i try to push the ear plug into my ear 0 
i was not happy with this item 0 
this greedy corporation will never see another dime from me 0 
great food 1 
i did not expect this to be so good 1 
this results in the phone being either stuck at max volume or mute 0 
i really dont see how anyone could enjoy this movie 0 
the building itself seems pretty neat the bathroom is pretty trippy but i wouldnt eat here again 0 
great for ipods too 1 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
theres also enough hypocrisy in this film to make me vomit 0 
otherwise dont even waste your time on this 0 
the soundtrack sucked 0 
the service was meh 0 
it didnt make me scared horrified or make me sympathetic towards the characters it was simply annoying 0 
would not recommend to others 0 
the ri style calamari was a joke 0 
lucy bell is so much higher than this crap and for her to sink this low is quite depressing 0 
its very slow 0 
service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is vegas and located inside the crystals shopping mall by aria 1 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
she carries the movie well 1 
mic doesnt work 0 
a greasy unhealthy meal 0 
this movie creates its own universe and is fascinating in every way 1 
this is such a fun and funny movie 1 
if she had not rolled the eyes we may have stayed not sure if we will go back and try it again 0 
back to good bbq lighter fare reasonable pricing and tell the public they are back to the old ways 1 
this early film from future goremeister lucio fulci is a very good addition to the giallo subgenre 1 
ill put this gem up against any movie in terms of screenplay cinematography acting postproduction editing directing or any other aspect of filmmaking 1 
excellent hands free tool 1 
dont waste your money 0 
its a sad movie but very good 1 
i will not return 0 
best tacos in town by far 1 
the chicken dishes are ok the beef is like shoe leather 0 
a truly truly bad film 0 
we walked away stuffed and happy about our first vegas buffet experience 1 
as for the mains also uninspired 0 
a very very very slowmoving aimless movie about a distressed drifting young man 0 
beware this is not a trashy cult movie this is trash period 0 
this short film certainly pulls no punches 0 
this was my first time and i cant wait until the next 1 
this movie is so awesome 1 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
raw and sublimely moving 1 
i wasnt expecting oscar material but this 0 
absolutely great 1 
total brunch fail 0 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
they could be used as exemplars for any set designer 1 
you share general loewenhielms exquisite joy in his partaking of the cailles en sarcophage even though you are just watching a movie but you do wish for just a small sample to savor 1 
i also decided not to send it back because our waitress looked like she was on the verge of having a heart attack 0 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
its this pandering to the audience that sabotages most of his films 0 
one of the best mexican movies ever and one of the less understood even by mexican themselves no matter how identified the should have felt with it 1 
it looks very nice 1 
the film is way too long 0 
i gave it a 10 1 
i really loved the story line and the poler bear was kinda cutebut if anyone has a question about fort steele just ask away 1 
the delivery was on time 1 
i have yet to run this new battery below two bars and thats three days without charging 1 
this is my new fav vegas buffet spot 1 
the service was outshining i definitely recommend the halibut 1 
the warmth it generates is in contrast to its austere backdrop 1 
now this dish was quite flavourful 1 
i gave it a 10 1 
perhaps i caught them on an off night judging by the other reviews but im not inspired to go back 0 
thats how id describe this painfully dreary timewaster of a film 0 
2 thumbs up to this seller 1 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
this is was due to the fact that it took 20 minutes to be acknowledged then another 35 minutes to get our foodand they kept forgetting things 0 
regardless the film fails on most levels 0 
the acting is like watching wooden puppets moving around and reading from a book thats how bad it is 0 
the desserts were a bit strange 0 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is vegas and located inside the crystals shopping mall by aria 1 
logitech bluetooth headset is a 10 1 
schrader has made a resume full of lousy amateurish films 0 
exceptionally bad 0 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
sending it back 0 
the service was a bit lacking 0 
magical help 1 
hes a national treasure 1 
price is good too 1 
after watching this film i wanted to learn more about the works of this artist 1 
not recommended 0 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
the service was terrible food was mediocre 0 
terrible management 0 
they know how to make them here 1 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
it is simple to use and i like it 1 
if you do watch it however there are small consolations the actresses playing annes sisters each do a wonderful job with their roles 1 
i dont think you will be disappointed 1 
the worst piece of crap ever along with the verizon customer service 0 
definitely worth checking out 1 
so good i am going to have to review this place twice once hereas a tribute to the place and once as a tribute to an event held here last night 1 
he deserves 5 stars 1 
a usable keyboard actually turns a pda into a realworld useful machine instead of just a neat gadget 1 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
works great 1 
avoid at all cost 0 
woa talk about awful 0 
but other than that the movie seemed to drag and the heroes didnt really work for their freedom 0 
this movie totally grates on my nerves 0 
instead we got a bore fest about a whiny spoiled brat babysitting 0 
lasted one day and then blew up 0 
its a total package 1 
to summarize the food was incredible nay transcendant but nothing brings me joy quite like the memory of the pneumatic condiment dispenser 1 
no actress has been worse used that june allison in this movie 0 
good quality 1 
worst ever 0 
it has kept up very well 1 
total letdown i would much rather just go to the camelback flower shop and cartel coffee 0 
there is simply no excuse for something this poorly done 0 
i give it 2 thumbs down 0 
this one works and was priced right 1 
we ordered some old classics and some new dishes after going there a few times and were sorely disappointed with everything 0 
im not sure how long we stood there but it was long enough for me to begin to feel awkwardly out of place 0 
see both films if you can 1 
i love the ringtones because they are so upbeat 1 
also the phone doesnt seem to accept anything except cbr mp3s preferably ripped by windows media player 0 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
this product had a strong rubberpetroleum smell that was unbearable after a while and caused me to return it 0 
it is cheap and it feel and look just as cheap 0 
after my phone got to be about a year old its been slowly breaking despite much care on my part 0 
the lead man is charismafree 0 
never going back 0 
the things that the four kids get themselves into is absolutely hilarious to watch 1 
the acting helps the writing along very well maybe the idiotsavant sister could have been played better and it is a real joy to watch 1 
easy to pair with my samsung cell 1 
a piece of cinematic garbage captured on celluloid 0 
the pairing of the two devices was so easy it barely took a couple minutes before i started making calls with the voice dialing feature 1 
easy to pair with my samsung cell 1 
i loved it 1 
your brain will attempt to shutdown as part of a primal impulse of selfpreservation 0 
the films dialogue is natural real to life 1 
does not fit 0 
i immediately said i wanted to talk to the manager but i did not want to talk to the guy who was doing shots of fireball behind the bar 0 
doesnt hold charge 0 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
you wont be disappointed 1 
food is way overpriced and portions are fucking small 0 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
if there were zero stars i would give it zero stars 0 
the headset fulfills my requirements so i am happy with my purchase 1 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
it was probably dirt 0 
i am so pleased to know such a modern day genius is out there letting is passion for art drive him and taking us as an audience with him 1 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
seriously its not worth wasting your or your kids time on 0 
furthermore you cant even find hours of operation on the website 0 
good show samsung 1 
tonight i had the elk filet specialand it sucked 0 
at first glance it is a lovely bakery cafe nice ambiance clean friendly staff 1 
their steaks are 100 recommended 1 
absolutel junk 0 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
this allows the possibility of double booking for the same date and time after the first 0 
you need at least 3 mins to get to your phone book from the time you first turn on the phonebattery life is short 0 
not good for the money 0 
ill be looking for a new earpiece 0 
this is a great little item 1 
the construction of the headsets is poor 0 
dont do it 0 
bad characters bad story and bad acting 0 
also notable is john baileys fine crisp beautifully colored cinematography and the great production design costumes by eiko ishioka who went on to do the memorable costumes for coppolas dracula for which she received a well deserved oscar 1 
there is simply no excuse for something this poorly done 0 
comes with a strong light that you can use to light up your camera shots and even flash sos signals seriously 1 
food was good service was good prices were good 1 
his performance is simply genius 1 
very good lunch spot 1 
you wont regret it 1 
i recommend igo to anyone with different brand cell phonesmp3 players in the family 1 
it was forced like everything in this movie 0 
clever and a real crowdpleaserthis film still ranks among mickeys best films even after 80 wonderful years 1 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
the steaks are all well trimmed and also perfectly cooked 1 
which are small and not worth the price 0 
this really is how vegas fine dining used to be right down to the menus handed to the ladies that have no prices listed 1 
i bought two of them and neither will charge 0 
waste of money 0 
the opening sequence of this gem is a classic and the cat n mouse games that follow are a delight to watch 1 
imdb ratings only go as low 1 for awful its time to get some negative numbers in there for cases such as these 0 
very disappointed 0 
highly unrecommended 0 
this is an unbelievable bargain 1 
i guess i should have known that this place would suck because it is inside of the excalibur but i didnt use my common sense 0 
product was excellent and works better than the verizon one and boy was it cheaper 1 
a piece of junk that broke after being on my phone for 2 days 0 
it quit working after id used it for about 18 months so i just purchased another one because this is the best headset ive ever owned 1 
i had a salad with the wings and some ice cream for dessert and left feeling quite satisfied 1 
it was just too horrible 0 
i have read others reviews here but i havent had any problem with it 1 
i think i was one of the people who found this another one of roths pearls 1 
the plot well i said id let that one go 0 
i want my money back 0 
hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in 0 
first off the reception sucks i have never had more than 2 bars ever 0 
trying to make a call on these is an exercise in frustration 0 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
everything was perfect the night we were in 1 
nothing new there 0 
full of unconvincing cardboard characters it is blandly written by edward chodorov who also produced and is surprisingly directed by jean negulesco from whom one would expect a great deal more 0 
the only thing really worth watching was the scenery and the house because it is beautiful 1 
i took back my money and got outta there 0 
waiter was a jerk 0 
cooked to perfection and the service was impeccable 1 
i love this cable it allows me to connect any miniusb device to my pc 1 
my boyfriend tried the mediterranean chicken salad and fell in love 1 
so flavorful and has just the perfect amount of heat 1 
there is nothing privileged about workingeating there 0 
the story which was told so eloquently by francis ford coppola 25 years earlier really unfolds gradually and leaves room for the characters to develop 1 
integrated seamlessly with the motorola razr phone 1 
great phone 1 
battery life is also great 1 
i went to bachi burger on a friends recommendation and was not disappointed 1 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
the bathrooms are clean and the place itself is well decorated 1 
anne heche was utterly convincing 1 
the range is very decent ive been able to roam around my house with the phone in the living room with no receptionsound quality issues 1 
but it is great i would really recommend it 1 
great food and awesome service 1 
this was my first time and i cant wait until the next 1 
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
his losing his marbles so early in the proceedings is totally implausible and unconvincing 0 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
warning stay away 0 
they could serve it with just the vinaigrette and it may make for a better overall dish but it was still very good 1 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
the atmosphere is modern and hip while maintaining a touch of coziness 1 
the results well are a shame 0 
there is a lot of beautiful places 1 
well im satisfied 1 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
the problem was the script 0 
i would highly recommend this product 1 
the fries were not hot and neither was my burger 0 
i had a seriously solid breakfast here 1 
warning do not buy 0 
i thought errol flynn was brilliant as custer and has since become my favourite actor 1 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
highly recommended 1 
one of my favorite purchases ever 1 
the cinematographyif it can be called thatsucked 0 
im really disappointed all i have now is a charger that doesnt work 0 
the food is very good for your typical bar food 1 
avoid at any and all costs 0 
it quit working after id used it for about 18 months so i just purchased another one because this is the best headset ive ever owned 1 
there still are good actors around 1 
i contacted the company and they told me that although the unit was still under warranty if i couldnt produce my receipt i was out of luck 0 
my boyfriend tried the mediterranean chicken salad and fell in love 1 
if i take a picture the battery drops a bar and starts beeping letting me know its dieing 0

poor quality 0 
the cashier had no care what so ever on what i had to say it still ended up being wayyy overpriced 0 
gave up trying to eat any of the crust teeth still sore 0 
total brunch fail 0 
i have two more years left in this contract and i hate this phone 0 
great phone 1 
the bipolarity of the ruthless thug one minute a ruthless killer the next minute a luvs diaper commercial is completely unconvincing 0 
the seller is very understanding and patient i would definitely buy from them again 1 
the plot simply rumbles on like a machine desperately depending on the addition of new scenes 0 
this place is great 1 
i paid the bill but did not tip because i felt the server did a terrible job 0 
the reception is excellent 1 
it wasnt busy either also the building was freezing cold 0 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
i wear glasses and it fits fine with them 1 
cant say enough good things about this place 1 
would come back again if i had a sushi craving while in vegas 1 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
the worst phone from samsungcrap this crappy samsung e715 is the worst i have ever seeen 0 
four stars for the food the guy in the blue shirt for his great vibe still letting us in to eat 1 
this is definitely a cult classic well worth viewing and sharing with others 1 
very unreliable service from tmobile 0 
10 out of 10 for both the movie and trilogy 1 
the ngage is still lacking in earbuds 0 
point your finger at any item on the menu order it and you wont be disappointed 1 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
fast service 1 
terrible my car will not accept this cassette 0 
worked great 1 
you get what you pay for i guess 0 
the headsets are easy to use and everyone loves them 1 
i have had mine for about a year and this christmas i bought some for the rest of the family 1 
the range is very decent ive been able to roam around my house with the phone in the living room with no receptionsound quality issues 1 
the descriptions said yum yum sauce and another said eel sauce yet another said spicy mayowell none of the rolls had sauces on them 0 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
not recommended 0 
the cashier had no care what so ever on what i had to say it still ended up being wayyy overpriced 0 
i highly recommend this movie for anyone interested in art poetry theater politics or japanese history 1 
however i recently watched the whole thing again on dvd and i was completely struck by how extremely stupid the storyline was how it contained holes inconsistencies and frankly a whole lot of crap and how horrid the dancing was 0 
delicious nyc bagels good selections of cream cheese real lox with capers even 1 
i was sitting in my vehicle with the cradle on my belt and the headset lost signal 0 
the hockey scenes are terrible defensemen playing like theyre 5 years old goalies diving at shots that are 10 feet wide of the net etc 0 
it has been a winner for us 1 
disappointed 0 
made very sturdy 1 
i immediately said i wanted to talk to the manager but i did not want to talk to the guy who was doing shots of fireball behind the bar 0 
if you are looking for a good quality motorola headset keep looking this isnt it 0 
problem is that the ear loops are made of weak material and break easily 0 
if you want a real scare rent this one 1 
the scenes with the ohsomature neighbourgirl are a misplace 0 
my boyfriend and i sat at the bar and had a completely delightful experience 1 
much less than the jawbone i was going to replace it with 1 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
at first glance it is a lovely bakery cafe nice ambiance clean friendly staff 1 
very poor service 0 
extremely tasty 1 
the design is very good4 1 
well im satisfied 1 
i never come again 0 
i dont think ive ever gone to a movie and disliked it as much 0 
the building itself seems pretty neat the bathroom is pretty trippy but i wouldnt eat here again 0 
overall i am psyched to have a phone which has all my appointments and contacts in and gets great reception 1 
then as if i hadnt wasted enough of my life there they poured salt in the wound by drawing out the time it took to bring the check 0 
needless to say i wont be going back anytime soon 0 
also the phone doesnt seem to accept anything except cbr mp3s preferably ripped by windows media player 0 
terrible product and waste of money 0 
this movie suffered because of the writing it needed more suspense 0 
very funny 1 
it is light has plenty of battery capacity and is very confortable to wear for somewhat extended periods of time 1 
the worst phone ive ever had only had it for a few months 0 
does not fit 0 
i cant use this case because the smell is disgusting 0 
shes poised and amazing 1 
sam shepards portrayal of a gung ho marine was sobering 1 
it has all the features i want 1 
i love the scream movies and all horror movies and this one ranks way up there 1 
which is precisely why i am giving it such a bad review 0 
summary the witticisms werent witty 0 
never going back 0 
i get absolutely horrible reception in my apartment where with other phones i have not had this problem 0 
you get extra minutes so that you can carry out the call and not get cut off 1 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
the opening sequence of this gem is a classic and the cat n mouse games that follow are a delight to watch 1 
terrible service 0 
waitress was good though 1 
unfortunately it did not work 0 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
the sangria was about half of a glass wine full and was 12 ridiculous 0 
i really like this product over the motorola because it is allot clearer on the ear piece and the mic 1 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
it just blew 0 
battery life is also great 1 
dont waste your money and time 0 
how can you call yourself a steakhouse if you cant properly cook a steak i dont understand 0 
but it does get better reception and clarity than any phone ive had before 1 
overall i wasnt very impressed with noca 0 
ive dropped my phone more times than i can say even on concrete and my phone is still great knock on wood 1 
weve have gotten a much better service from the pizza place next door than the services we received from this restaurant 0 
ordered burger rare came in well done 0 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
perfect for the ps3 1 
if you want a real scare rent this one 1 
good protection and does not make phone too bulky 1 
there was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters 0 
id rather eat airline food seriously 0 
i find wasting food to be despicable but this just wasnt food 0 
there is a totally unnecessary trainroller coaster scene 0 
i thoroughly enjoyed it when christopher eccleston took control of the tardis and the continuation of the series 1 
a very charming film with wonderful sentiment and heart 1 
the story is lame not interesting and never really explains the sinister origins of the puppets 0 
often the dialogue doesnt really follow from one line to another or fit the surroundings 0 
good servicecheck 1 
it just blew 0 
would not go back 0 
the calls drop the phone comes on and off at will the screen goes black and the worst of all it stops ringing intermittently 0 
phenomenal food service and ambiance 1 
if you havent choked in your own vomit by the end by all the cheap drama and worthless dialogue youve must have bored yourself to death with this waste of time 0 
we enjoy their pizza and brunch 1 
overall the film is interesting and thoughtprovoking 1 
made very sturdy 1 
the nachos are a must have 1 
this place is disgusting 0 
highly recommended a 1 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
this was like the final blow 0 
ill even say it again  this is torture 0 
what a disappointment 0 
the only downside is the service 0 
love this headset 1 
very true to shakespear and a must for all shakespear fans 1 
it presents a idyllic yet serious portrayal of the ups and downs of the characters lives 1 
i recommend igo to anyone with different brand cell phonesmp3 players in the family 1 
it showed exactly how the government and the scientist argued for humanity and the reasons of the gadget 1 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
horrible phone 0 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
setup couldnt have been simpler 1 
awesome service and food 1 
i recently tried caballeros and i have been back every week since 1 
the nachos are a must have 1 
weve tried to like this place but after 10 times i think were done with them 0 
this phone is slim and light and the display is beautiful 1 
case was more or less an extra that i originally put on but later discarded because it scratched my ear 0 
id say that would be the hardest decision honestly all of ms dishes taste how they are supposed to taste amazing 1 
i have never had such bland food which surprised me considering the article we read focused so much on their spices and flavor 0
