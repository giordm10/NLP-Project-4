here in the wind and the lion we see a wonderful rendering of americas own imperial age 1 
i have been very happy with the 510 and have had no complaints from any one regarding my sound quality on their end 1 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
however the keypads are so tinny that i sometimes reach the wrong buttons 0 
cant store anything but phone numbers to sim 0 
i know he was a contract player with little control over his scripts but the acting was as bad as the script 0 
it worked very well 1 
this phone is very fast with sending any kind of messages and web browsing is significantly faster than previous phones i have used 1 
ive owned this phone for 7 months now and can say that its the best mobile phone ive had 1 
plus it was wellpaced and suited its relatively short run time 1 
there are so many problems i dont know where to start 0 
what happened next was prettyoff putting 0 
the noise shield is incrediable 1 
this place is like chipotle but better 1 
it is a true classic 1 
i have had mine for about a year and this christmas i bought some for the rest of the family 1 
this is hands down the best phone ive ever had 1 
the shower area is outside so you can only rinse not take a full shower unless you dont mind being nude for everyone to see 0 
excellent product for the price 1 
thus far have only visited twice and the food was absolutely delicious each time 1 
is it possible for a movie to get any worse than this 0 
they have horrible attitudes towards customers and talk down to each one when customers dont enjoy their food 0 
so dont go there if you are looking for good food 0 
it works 1 
incredible 1 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
i ordered the lemon raspberry ice cocktail which was also incredible 1 
ive had no trouble accessing the internet downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions 1 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
does not fit 0 
the movie lacks visual interest drama expression of feeling and celebration of the very patriotism that underlines the narrative 0 
i get absolutely horrible reception in my apartment where with other phones i have not had this problem 0 
one of my favorite purchases ever 1 
the macarons here are insanely good 1 
i have two more years left in this contract and i hate this phone 0 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
the only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port irda 0 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
you can find better movies at youtube 0 
total brunch fail 0 
nevertheless yet another wonderful film from the great masters stable 1 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
none of them are engaging or exciting 0 
the range is very decent ive been able to roam around my house with the phone in the living room with no receptionsound quality issues 1 
food was so gooodd 1 
i probably wont be coming back here 0 
i could barely stomach the meal but didnt complain because it was a business lunch 0 
what i really like there is the crepe station 1 
the film has an ultracheap look to it 0 
i have been in more than a few bars in vegas and do not ever recall being charged for tap water 0 
not as good as i had hoped 0 
i mean in a realistic world she would never have gotten into that ballet repertory the whole thing was quite pathetic 0 
this game rocks 1 
well just if you keep thinking how bad it is 0 
voice quality signal strength dropped calls 0 
cooked to perfection and the service was impeccable 1 
and his subtle connections between the three films are awesome 1 
the battery life is highly unacceptable 0 
this is one of the best italian thrillers of the early 70s 1 
they know how to make them here 1 
it is an hour and half waste of time following a bunch of very pretty high schoolers whine and cry about life 0 
not to mention the combination of pears almonds and bacon is a big winner 1 
the pan cakes everyone are raving about taste like a sugary disaster tailored to the palate of a six year old 0 
brilliance indeed 1 
now the pizza itself was good the peanut sauce was very tasty 1 
the worst piece of crap ever along with the verizon customer service 0 
the service here is fair at best 0 
what is even more stupid is that who had thought an idea that there should be a volcano in los angeles 0 
great phone 1 
best tacos in town by far 1 
even the squibs look awful 0 
i could eat their bruschetta all day it is devine 1 
it is an hour and half waste of time following a bunch of very pretty high schoolers whine and cry about life 0 
the only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive 1 
the fried rice was dry as well 0 
makes it easier to keep up with my bluetooth when im not wearing it 0 
cute quaint simple honest 1 
voice recognition is tremendous 1 
this is a simple little phone to use but the breakage is unacceptible 0 
i wouldnt return 0 
i got this phone on reccomendation from a relative and im glad i did 1 
mediocre food 0 
good quality 1 
seriously its not worth wasting your or your kids time on 0 
i highly recommend this device to everyone 1 
bland not a liking this place for a number of reasons and i dont want to waste time on bad reviewing ill leave it at that 0 
everything about it is fine and reasonable for the price ie 1 
i have bought this nokia cell phone a few weeks ago and it was a nightmare 0 
you can find better movies at youtube 0 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
i enjoyed it 1 
how awful she is 0 
think of the film being like a dream 1 
this place is awesome if you want something light and healthy during the summer 1 
the plot such as it is is so derivative and predictable that the ending is like a mercy killing 0 
there was so much hype over this phone that i assumed it was the best my mistake 0 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
if that bug never showed up i would have given a 4 for sure but on the other side of the wall where this bug was climbing was the kitchen 0 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
very good product well made 1 
we had a group of 70 when we claimed we would only have 40 and they handled us beautifully 1 
no shifting no bubbling no peeling not even a scratch nothingi couldnt be more happier with my new one for the droid 1 
they could serve it with just the vinaigrette and it may make for a better overall dish but it was still very good 1 
the service was extremely slow 0 
the chicken wings contained the driest chicken meat i have ever eaten 0 
very disappointed in accessoryone 0 
either way it sucks 0 
this is an excellent tool especially when paired with your phones autoanswer 1 
i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
i saw this short film on hbo the other day and absolutely loved it 1 
very nice and relaxing late night viewing 1 
and if that isnt enough of a mess of a movie for you the picture is also marred with a constant use of studio sets and indoor exteriors 0 
ive seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie 0 
the story is lame not interesting and never really explains the sinister origins of the puppets 0 
20th century foxs road house 1948 is not only quite a silly noir but is an implausible unmitigated bore of a movie 0 
unfortunately it was not good 0 
the problem was the script 0 
eew this location needs a complete overhaul 0 
i recommend this for everyone who loves film movies anythinga work of art 1 
now imagine that every single one of those decisions was made wrong 0 
if you dont find it too bad as again the unit comes with one earpad onlyi would not recommend this to anyone 0 
weve tried to like this place but after 10 times i think were done with them 0 
the design is very odd as the ear clip is not very comfortable at all 0 
very happy with this product 1 
the classic maine lobster roll was fantastic 1 
love this phone 1 
i was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar not only because the quality is great but the service is fast and the food impeccable 1 
its a total package 1 
later i found myself lost in the power of the film 1 
i saw it as a child on tv back in 1973 when it was the stranger and i loved it 1 
the opening sequence of this gem is a classic and the cat n mouse games that follow are a delight to watch 1 
not loud enough and doesnt turn on like it should 0 
nonlinear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well 1 
does not fit 0 
i do think tom hanks is a good actor 1 
alexander nevsky is a great film 1 
item does not match picture 0 
the only possible way this movie could be redeemed would be as mst3k fodder 0 
this was utterly confusing at first which caused me to lose a couple of very very important contacts 0 
i recommend igo to anyone with different brand cell phonesmp3 players in the family 1 
these are the central themes of the film and they are handled ineptly stereotypically and with no depth of imagination 0 
the headsets are easy to use and everyone loves them 1 
schrader has made a resume full of lousy amateurish films 0 
the most annoying thing about cover girl is the way in which rita hayworth is put up on a pedestal 0 
disappointing 0 
it has all the features i want 1 
good servicecheck 1 
the point is the journey a journey that touches every member of the family 1 
the fries were not hot and neither was my burger 0 
the only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive 1 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
but when i check voice mail at night the keypad backlight turns off a few seconds into the first message and then im lost 0 
w810i is just superb 1 
definitely worth checking out 1 
the selection of food was not the best 0 
avoid at all cost 0 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
damn good steak 1 
i wont be back 0 
the guys all had steaks and our steak loving son who has had steak at the best and worst places said it was the best steak hes ever eaten 1 
jamie foxx absolutely is ray charles 1 
our server was very nice and even though he looked a little overwhelmed with all of our needs he stayed professional and friendly until the end 1 
the food is not tasty at all not to say its real traditional hunan style 0 
we waited for forty five minutes in vain 0 
only pros large seating area nice bar area great simple drink menu the best brick oven pizza with homemade dough 1 
this is a witty and delightful adaptation of the dr seuss book brilliantly animated by upas finest and thoroughly deserving of its academy award 1 
rip off over charge shipping 0 
excellent sound quality 1 
its hard not to fall headoverheels in love with that girl 1 
as for the mains also uninspired 0 
its a great item 1 
when im on this side of town this will definitely be a spot ill hit up again 1 
im not eating here 0 
i must say i have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again 1 
i am so pleased to know such a modern day genius is out there letting is passion for art drive him and taking us as an audience with him 1 
one of the worst shows of all time 0 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
while you dont yet hear mickey speak there are tons of sound effects and music throughout the filmsomething we take for granted now but which was a huge crowd pleaser in 1928 1 
will not be back 0 
this movie now joins revenge of the boogeyman and zombiez as part of the hellish trinity of horror films 0 
its been my choice headset for yearsgreat sound good volume good noise cancellation 1 
everything was perfect the night we were in 1 
and finally after all that we get to an ending that wouldve been great had it been handled by competent people and not jerry falwell 0 
so bad 0 
however bt headsets are currently not good for real time games like firstperson shooters since the audio delay messes me up 0 
everything on the menu is terrific and we were also thrilled that they made amazing accommodations for our vegetarian daughter 1 
you need two hands to operate the screenthis software interface is decade old and cannot compete with new software designs 0 
the nokia ca42 usb cable did not work with my phone 0 
i loved it 1 
the earpiece on this is too large or too heavyit keeps falling out of my ear 0 
does not fit 0 
highly unprofessional and rude to a loyal patron 0 
you will leave the theater wanting to go out and dance under the stars 1 
soyo technology sucks 0 
very bad performance plays angela bennett a computer expert who is at home all the time 0 
i received it quickly and it works great 1 
its uncomfortable and the sound quality is quite poor compared with the phone razr or with my previous wired headset that plugged into an lg 0 
wont work right or atleast for me 0 
the cinematography is simply stunning to say the least and the fx are nothing if not stateoftheart 1 
great hands free device 1 
so good i am going to have to review this place twice once hereas a tribute to the place and once as a tribute to an event held here last night 1 
nice docking station for home or work 1 
lasted one day and then blew up 0 
this if the first movie ive given a 10 to in years 1 
took an hour to get our food only 4 tables in restaurant my food was luke warm our sever was running around like he was totally overwhelmed 0 
i guess it was supposed to be clever twist then shed some light on the situation but it was just stupid 0 
unfortunately this is a bad movie that is just plain bad 0 
this review is long overdue since i consider a tale of two sisters to be the single greatest film ever made 1 
i think this restaurant suffers from not trying hard enough 0 
we started with the tuna sashimi which was brownish in color and obviously wasnt fresh 0 
steamboat willie is an amazingly important film to our cinema history 1 
one of the most disappointing aspects is the lack of notable gore 0 
worthless product 0 
the pizza selections are good 1 
this is definitely a cult classic well worth viewing and sharing with others 1 
an excellent new restaurant by an experienced frenchman 1 
very happy with this product 1 
shrimp when i unwrapped it i live only 12 a mile from brushfire it was literally ice cold 0 
the waiter wasnt helpful or friendly and rarely checked on us 0 
i cant use this case because the smell is disgusting 0 
the potato chip order was sad i could probably count how many chips were in that box and it was probably around 12 0 
worst hour and a half of my lifeoh my gosh 0 
a very charming film with wonderful sentiment and heart 1 
this place is way too overpriced for mediocre food 0 
however the ear pads come off easily and after only one week i lost one 0 
battery life is real good 1 
my salad had a bland vinegrette on the baby greens and hearts of palm 0 
i heart this place 1 
my 810 score is mostly for the plot 1 
cooked to perfection and the service was impeccable 1 
as always the evening was wonderful and the food delicious 1 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
this was such an awesome movie that i bought it off of ebay 1 
they could be used as exemplars for any set designer 1 
a disappointment 0 
john wayne did an incredible job for being so young in the movie industry 1 
the inside is really quite nice and very clean 1 
one nice thing was that they added gratuity on the bill since our party was larger than 6 or 8 and they didnt expect more tip than that 1 
we would recommend these to others 1 
i have always used corded headsets and the freedom from the wireless is very helpful 1 
i wouldnt return 0 
the story which was told so eloquently by francis ford coppola 25 years earlier really unfolds gradually and leaves room for the characters to develop 1 
so i had to take the battery out of the phone put it all back together and then restart it 0 
the problem i have is that they charge 1199 for a sandwich that is no bigger than a subway sub which offers better and more amount of vegetables 0 
car charger as well as ac charger are included to make sure you never run out of juicehighy recommended 1 
poor product 0 
the price is reasonable and the service is great 1 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
improper description i had to return it 0 
the plot simply rumbles on like a machine desperately depending on the addition of new scenes 0 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
avoid this one if you can 0 
the fries were not hot and neither was my burger 0 
disappointed with battery 0 
this movie is so awesome 1 
you will leave the theater wanting to go out and dance under the stars 1 
about 30 minutes of footage is wasted to show mediocre elderly actors awkwardly babbling overwrought pseudosatanic gibberish corny enough to make a teen goth blush almost always in olde english and sometimes in latin that may or may not be made up words 0 
i really hope the team behind this movie makes more movies and that they will continue to do so in their own some kinda weird style 1 
and then tragedy struck 0 
has been working great 1 
love this product 1 
very disappointed in accessoryone 0 
an instant classic with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits 1 
i was shocked because no signs indicate cash only 0 
im very disappointed with my decision 0 
the performances are real and gripping the crocdodile is extremely well done indeed if the black water website is to be believed thats because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous 1 
duris has a wholesome appearance and gives a fine performance 1 
it is a true classic 1 
treo and tmobile refused to replace it again and forced me to buy another phone without any kind of upgrade discount 0 
buyerbe very careful 0 
the story is also both funny and poignant at times 1 
every thing on phone work perfectly she like it 1 
great earpiece 1 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
i must say i have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again 1 
not loud enough and doesnt turn on like it should 0 
coming here is like experiencing an underwhelming relationship where both parties cant wait for the other person to ask to break up 0 
this place is handsdown one of the best places to eat in the phoenix metro area 1 
very poor service 0 
that was done in the second movie 0 
the poor actors 0 
it is very comfortable to wear as well which is probably the most important aspect about using a case 1 
this is high adventure at its best 1 
ambience is perfect 1 
perhaps i caught them on an off night judging by the other reviews but im not inspired to go back 0 
this is an excellent tool especially when paired with your phones autoanswer 1 
i wont be back 0 
there is a totally unnecessary trainroller coaster scene 0 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
the malta settings are as dry and as barren as the dialogue 0 
i highly recommend this device to everyone 1 
i had absolutely no problem with this headset linking to my 8530 blackberry curve 1 
not recommended 0 
it is just the sort of pap that is screened in the afternoon to punish the unemployed for not having jobs 0 
maybe if they werent cold they would have been somewhat edible 0 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
2 thumbs up to this seller 1 
1010 1 
i wear glasses and it fits fine with them 1 
these were so good we ordered them twice 1 
even if you love bad movies do not watch this movie 0 
both rickman and stowe play their roles to the hilt in this tale of a childrens book writer who maybe has written a subversive tract 1 
unfortunately any virtue in this films production work was lost on a regrettable script 0 
i as well wouldve given godfathers zero stars if possible 0 
the acting is fantastic the stories are seamlessly woven together and the dogs are splendid a must rent view or see 1 
the staff are great the ambiance is great 1 
i was disgusted because i was pretty sure that was human hair 0 
his performance as awarded was stunning 1 
its one of the movies i need to see whenever it comes on tvnever mind the fact that i already have it memorized 1 
small sleek impressive looking practical setup with ample storage in place 1 
nevertheless yet another wonderful film from the great masters stable 1 
the first time i ever came here i had an amazing experience i still tell people how awesome the duck was 1 
director paul matthews who also wrotedirected the weak 1995 monster movie grim clearly doesnt know how to pace his films 0 
i would recommend this 1 
bad fit way too big 0 
what a mistake that was 0 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
all in all an excellent restaurant highlighted by great service a unique menu and a beautiful setting 1 
dont waste your money 0 
lucy bell is so much higher than this crap and for her to sink this low is quite depressing 0 
poor talk time performance 0 
my boyfriend and i sat at the bar and had a completely delightful experience 1 
i have yet to run this new battery below two bars and thats three days without charging 1 
i love being able to use one headset for both by landline and cell 1 
i was mortified 0 
works well 1 
as always the evening was wonderful and the food delicious 1 
this is a great place to eat 1 
everything was perfect the night we were in 1 
all things considered a job very well done 1 
at least think to refill my water before i struggle to wave you over for 10 minutes 0 
would not recommend to others 0 
item arrived quickly and works great with my metro pcs samsung schr450 slider phone and sony premium sound in ear plugs 1 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
as a courtroom drama its compelling as an indictment on the american justice system its frightening 1 
this movie contained an allstar cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i havent seen before 1 
there is no plot here to keep you going in the first place 0 
very bad experience 0 
i had absolutely no problem with this headset linking to my 8530 blackberry curve 1 
garbo who showed right off the bat that her talents could carry over from the silent era i wanted to see some of her silent work but netflix doesnt seem to be stocking them 1 
we walked away stuffed and happy about our first vegas buffet experience 1 
the first time i ever came here i had an amazing experience i still tell people how awesome the duck was 1 
the only place good for this film is in the garbage 0 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
i was very disappointed 0 
the chains which im no fan of beat this place easily 0 
honeslty it didnt taste that fresh 0 
comfortable fit you need your headset to be comfortable for at least an hour at a time if not for an entire day 1 
poor voice clarity 0 
this item worked great but it broke after 6 months of use 0 
its one of the movies i need to see whenever it comes on tvnever mind the fact that i already have it memorized 1 
phone now holds charge like it did when it was new 1 
being a 90s child i truly enjoyed this show and i can proudly say that i enjoyed it big time and even more than the classical wb cartoons 1 
if you are looking for a good quality motorola headset keep looking this isnt it 0 
saw the movie today and thought it was a good effort good messages for kids 1 
it was awesome 1 
it was so funny 1 
it deserves strong love 1 
the handsfree part works fine but then the car tries to download the address book and the treo rebootsoverall i still rate this device high 1 
i love the camera its really pretty good quality 1 
great food and awesome service 1 
however this didnt make up for the fact that overall this was a tremendously boring movie 0 
gets the job done 1 
the instructions didnt explain that a microphone jack could be used 0 
not worth it 0 
how can you call yourself a steakhouse if you cant properly cook a steak i dont understand 0 
this place is way too overpriced for mediocre food 0 
i got to enjoy the seafood salad with a fabulous vinegrette 1 
i bought two of them and neither will charge 0 
avoid this one if you can 0 
worst customer service 0 
ill be looking for a new earpiece 0 
will be back again 1 
i believe that pitch black was done well 1 
great product fast shipping 1 
arrived quickly and much less expensive than others being sold 1 
the reception has been generally good 1 
better than new 1 
its aggravating 0 
you wont regret it 1 
ive only had my bluetooth for a few weeks but i really like it 1 
i think that it is a must see older john wayne film 1 
its a gloriously fun fast paced and fairly accurate portrayal of the night of a raver 1 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
we are so glad we found this place 1 
this is such a fun and funny movie 1 
dont waste your money 0 
it has all the features i want 1 
for a self proclaimed coffee cafe i was wildly disappointed 0 
it came free with a dvd player i bought but i still turned the thing off halfway through because i was embarrassed for howell 0 
i will continue to come here on ladies night andddd date night highly recommend this place to anyone who is in the area 1 
i received it quickly and it works great 1 
we watched our waiter pay a lot more attention to other tables and ignore us 0 
the buffet at bellagio was far from what i anticipated 0 
today was my first taste of a buldogis gourmet hot dog and i have to tell you it was more than i ever thought possible 1 
you cant beat that 1 
wont work right or atleast for me 0 
an excellent new restaurant by an experienced frenchman 1 
i highly recommend this device to everyone 1 
it was delicious 1 
the plantains were the worst ive ever tasted 0 
there still are good actors around 1 
dont make the same mistake i did 0 
this was such an awesome movie that i bought it off of ebay 1 
it was delicious 1 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
try them in the airport to experience some tasty food and speedy friendly service 1 
think it over when you plan to own this onethis sure is the last moto phone for me 0 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
this movie suffered because of the writing it needed more suspense 0 
this short film certainly pulls no punches 0 
during several different 2 minute calls i experienced 5 drops and it was in an area that had 5 bars 0 
the football scenes at the end were perplexing 0 
i tried the cape cod ravoli chickenwith cranberrymmmm 1 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
the lighting is just dark enough to set the mood 1 
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 
a standout scene 1 
generally it just lacked imagination 0 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
i wont be back 0 
sorry i will not be getting food from here anytime soon 0 
because both ears are occupied background is not distracting at all 1 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
very much disappointed with this company 0 
this product had a strong rubberpetroleum smell that was unbearable after a while and caused me to return it 0 
i left the theater with a lilt in my step joy in my heart and hope for the human race 1 
bad reception 0 
its still wild stuff though and is highly recommended to fans of giallo cinema 1 
but when i check voice mail at night the keypad backlight turns off a few seconds into the first message and then im lost 0 
very displeased 0 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
the reception is excellent 1 
poor sound quality 0 
im returning them 0 
go to place for gyros 1 
the instruction manual is lacking 0 
muddy low quality sound and the casing around the wires insert was poorly super glued and slid off 0 
the volume for the ringer is real good you have choices how loud 1 
it shouldnt take 30 min for pancakes and eggs 0 
elias koteasjack palance play good roles angelina is hot and gets nakedbilly drago appears in this and is cool as usual a cameo by sven ole thorsen helps make this a very enjoyable movie with good acting and a decent budget 1 
great character actors telly savalas and peter boyle 1 
worked very well paired with a treo 700w and as a skype headset on my pc using a usb bluetooth transceiver 1 
so flavorful and has just the perfect amount of heat 1 
we have tried 2 units and they both failed within 2 months pros 0 
but even the talented carrell cant save this 0 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
best of all is the rotating feature very helpful 1 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
dont waste your time here 0 
works like a charm it work the same as the one i got with the phone 1 
the han nan chicken was also very tasty 1 
i guess i liked the details of his dysfunctionhe was believable 1 
the lines the cuts the audio everything is wrong 0 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
wow what a bad film 0 
filmiing was less expansive 0 
i have 23 bars on my cell phone when i am home but you cant not hear anything 0 
in other words the content level of this film is enough to easily fill a dozen other films 1 
i dont think there are any redeeming qualities in this remake 0 
his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic 1 
ive dropped my phone more times than i can say even on concrete and my phone is still great knock on wood 1 
it was a drive to get there 0 
whatever prompted such a documentary is beyond me 0 
this film tries to be a serious and sophisticated thrillerhorror flick and it fails miserably 0 
first off the reception sucks i have never had more than 2 bars ever 0 
fast service 1 
i ended up sliding it on the edge of my pants or back pockets instead 1 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
it definitely was not as good as my s11 1 
i guess it was supposed to be clever twist then shed some light on the situation but it was just stupid 0 
this movie is terrible 0 
performed awful muffled tinny incoming sound and severe echo for those on the other end of the call 0 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
this is a good joint 1 
i just dont know how this place managed to served the blandest food i have ever eaten when they are preparing indian cuisine 0 
wont ever go here again 0 
very much disappointed with this company 0 
this review is long overdue since i consider a tale of two sisters to be the single greatest film ever made 1 
best fish ive ever had in my life 1 
like the other reviewer said you couldnt pay me to eat at this place again 0 
i hate those things as much as cheap quality black olives 0 
if you hate earbugs avoid this phone by all means 0 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
the reception has been generally good 1 
the stories were as unbelievable as the actors 0 
it dit not work most of the time with my nokia 5320 0 
to call this movie a drama is ridiculous 0 
everything was good and tasty 1 
this movie is excellentangel is beautiful and scamp is adorablehis little yelps when hes scaredand the funniest parts are whenscamp is caught under the curtain and when angel and scamp are singing ive never had this feeling beforei totally recommend this movieits coming out on special edition on june 20the cover has scamp on a garbage can and angel underneath the lid 1 
their daily specials are always a hit with my group 1 
however after about a year the fliptop started to get loose and wobbly and eventually my screen went black and i couldnt receive and place calls 0 
works great 1 
id rather eat airline food seriously 0 
this place is not worth your time let alone vegas 0 
its very slow 0 
the movie is full of wonderful dancing hence the title 1 
i had the mac salad and it was pretty bland so i will not be getting that again 0 
black water is a thriller that manages to completely transcend its limitations its an indie flick by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience 1 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
an hour and a half i wish i could bring back 0 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
punishment park is a brilliant piece of cinema 1 
the fried rice was dry as well 0 
these are certainly very comfortable and functionality is decent 1 
i checked out this place a couple years ago and was not impressed 0 
if it were possible to give them zero stars theyd have it 0 
i found this move beautiful enjoyable and uplifting 1 
i cant use this case because the smell is disgusting 0 
the earpiece on this is too large or too heavyit keeps falling out of my ear 0 
the presentation of the food was awful 0 
you cant beat the price on these 1 
thank you for such great service 1 
we walked away stuffed and happy about our first vegas buffet experience 1 
used and dirty 0 
rating 010 grade z note the show is so bad that even mother of the cast pull her daughter out of the show 0 
these are certainly very comfortable and functionality is decent 1 
the mic there is a joke and the volume is quite low 0 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
poor sound quality 0 
as many people complained i found this headsets microphone was very weak 0 
i wish i could enter negative values admins 0 
nice solid keyboard 1 
youll love how thin it is 1 
dont waste your money 0 
this item is fantastic and works perfectly 1 
these were so good we ordered them twice 1 
cinematography noteworthy including fine views of barcelona and its famed gaudi towers 1 
as for the mains also uninspired 0 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
it showed exactly how the government and the scientist argued for humanity and the reasons of the gadget 1 
hated it 0 
im very disappointed with my decision 0 
the service here is fair at best 0 
i am very impressed with this headset from plantronics 1 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
very well made and fits my surefire gx2 perfectly 1 
ordered burger rare came in well done 0 
highly unrecommended 0 
regardless the film fails on most levels 0 
it does everything the description said it would 1 
think it over when you plan to own this onethis sure is the last moto phone for me 0 
this pda rocks 1 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
i hate writing bad reviews about films especially those in which i really like the star but this film is so bad i dont believe for one second that anyone could have been proud of it 0 
and the sound quality is great 1 
the good cinematography also makes her and monica bellucci look very beautiful 1 
if you want healthy authentic or ethic food try this place 1 
if you stay in vegas you must get breakfast here at least once 1 
i love the look and feel of samsung flipphones 1 
if you look for authentic thai food go else where 0 
poor product 0 
excellent hands free tool 1 
ill definitely be in soon again 1 
the staff is friendly and the joint is always clean 1 
the story is lame not interesting and never really explains the sinister origins of the puppets 0 
we wont be returning 0 
i definitly recommend 1 
the plot doesnt hang together at all and the acting is absolutely appalling 0 
now the pizza itself was good the peanut sauce was very tasty 1 
it ranks highly as a great noircrimedrama incredible performances by belmondo and lino ventura 1 
this movie suffered because of the writing it needed more suspense 0 
how stupid is that 0 
you could only take 2 videos at a time and the quality was very poor 0 
reception is terrible and full of static 0 
i saw this short film on hbo the other day and absolutely loved it 1 
i was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar not only because the quality is great but the service is fast and the food impeccable 1 
special mention should be made of the superb music score and sound effects which are an integral element in helping to make this such a memorable and enjoyable cartoon 1 
i dont recommend unless your car breaks down in front of it and you are starving 0 
one more thing i can tolerate political incorrectness very well im all for artistic freedom and suspension of disbelief but the slavic female character was just too much 0 
everything about this product is wrongfirst 0 
of all the dishes the salmon was the best but all were great 1 
warning do not buy 0 
i even fully charged it before i went to bed and turned off blue tooth and wifi and noticed that it only had 20 left in the morning 0 
all in all im quite satisfied with this purchase 1 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
main thing i didnt enjoy is that the crowd is of older crowd around mid 30s and up 0 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
no ear loop needed its tiny and the sound is great 1 
really really good rice all the time 1 
im using it with an iriver spinn with case and it fits fine 1 
his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic 1 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
this was like the final blow 0 
the speaker is of low quality so as making the ring tones sound very cheap 0 
this was like the final blow 0 
this was such an awesome movie that i bought it off of ebay 1 
its really easy 1 
a piece of cinematic garbage captured on celluloid 0 
this is a great deal 1 
i dont know what the big deal is about this place but i wont be back yaall 0 
this is a very average phone with bad battery life that operates on a weak network 0 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
garbo who showed right off the bat that her talents could carry over from the silent era i wanted to see some of her silent work but netflix doesnt seem to be stocking them 1 
there is simply no excuse for something this poorly done 0 
never got it 0 
his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic 1 
so absolutley fantastic 1 
reasonably priced also 1 
she carries the movie well 1 
a usable keyboard actually turns a pda into a realworld useful machine instead of just a neat gadget 1 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
great product 1 
this movie is terrible 0 
but it wasnt anything at all just one big yawn 0 
i did not bother contacting the company for few dollar product but i learned the lesson that i should not have bought this form online anyway 0 
none of the new ones have ever quite worked properly 0 
well just if you keep thinking how bad it is 0 
the burger is good beef cooked just right 1 
excellent sound quality 1 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
the burger had absolutely no flavor the meat itself was totally bland the burger was overcooked and there was no charcoal flavor 0 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
it plays louder than any other speaker of this size the price is so low that most would think the quality is lacking however its not 1 
the characters are fleshed out surprisingly well particularly grimes and blake and all the actors deliver their sharply scripted lines with just the right amount of deadpan tongue in cheek to make the dialogue both hilarious and realistic 1 
the plot such as it is is so derivative and predictable that the ending is like a mercy killing 0 
other than that the leather is nice and soft the fit is very tight the cut out for the face is a good shape 1 
i am a fan of his this movie sucked really bad 0 
only had this a month but its worked flawlessly so far 1 
it is very comfortable to wear as well which is probably the most important aspect about using a case 1 
which is precisely why i am giving it such a bad review 0 
we are so glad we found this place 1 
id rather eat airline food seriously 0 
i wasted my little money with this earpiece 0 
they work about 2 weeks then break 0 
10 out of 10 stars 1 
i have two more years left in this contract and i hate this phone 0 
it is just the sort of pap that is screened in the afternoon to punish the unemployed for not having jobs 0 
and there wasnt a single sour note struck actingwise either some surprisingly solid casting here 1 
the real disappointment was our waiter 0 
wow loved this place 1 
im not eating here 0 
these headphones were a great find and i think they are perhaps the best purchase ive made in the last several years seriously 1 
totally believable 1 
it is perfect for a sitdown family meal or get together with a few friends 1 
its a great item 1 
i really recommend this faceplates since it looks very nice elegant and cool 1 
i exchanged the sony ericson z500a for this and im pretty happy with that decision 1 
i was not happy with this item 0 
both actors truly understand and become their particular character delivering a convincing sincere performance 1 
i love this cable it allows me to connect any miniusb device to my pc 1 
the use of slowmotion needlessly repeats itself throughout the movie but is well backed up by bad acting and bad is a kind word here no continuity scenes that are thrown in for no reason whatsoever vehicles that looked like they were made from a corn flakes box and a directorial style that bordered on stupidity 0 
reasonably priced also 1 
now this is a movie i really dislike 0 
i cant believe theres even a sequel to this 0 
the service was terrible food was mediocre 0
