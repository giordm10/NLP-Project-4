as for the service im a fan because its quick and youre being served by some nice folks 1 
never got it 0 
definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly will return next time im in vegas 1 
another thing i didnt really like is when a character got punched in the face a gallon of blood would spew forth soon after 0 
improper description i had to return it 0 
its quite simply the highest most superlative form of cinema imaginable 1 
cooked to perfection and the service was impeccable 1 
has been working great 1 
food was good service was good prices were good 1 
service was good and the company was better 1 
the only good thing was that it fits comfortably on small ears 1 
filmiing was less expansive 0 
10 out of 10 stars 1 
lightweight and works well 1 
avoid this film at all costs 0 
ryans bar is definitely one edinburgh establishment i wont be revisiting 0 
i immediately said i wanted to talk to the manager but i did not want to talk to the guy who was doing shots of fireball behind the bar 0 
do not waste your money here 0 
in fact i liked it better than interview with a vampire and i liked this lestat stuart townsend better than cruises attempt 1 
frankly after cotton club and unfaithful it was kind of embarrassing to watch lane and gere in this film because it is bad 0 
their chow mein is so good 1 
if you look for authentic thai food go else where 0 
we are sending it back 0 
all in all an excellent restaurant highlighted by great service a unique menu and a beautiful setting 1 
he cant act one of the least scary villains i have ever seen he cant write did he write this damn movie in his sleep 0 
unreliable im giving up 0 
it was too predictable even for a chick flick 0 
the story is lame not interesting and never really explains the sinister origins of the puppets 0 
what a waste of time 0 
there was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth but it didnt really work into the rest of the plot 0 
the cast is always entertaining as usual 1 
great price also 1 
exactly what i wanted 1 
be sure to order dessert even if you need to pack it togo the tiramisu and cannoli are both to die for 1 
this short film certainly pulls no punches 0 
i tried talking real loud but shouting on the telephone gets old and i was still told it wasnt great 0 
i will be back many times soon 1 
i give wirefly 1 stari will contact cingularatt and inform them of this practice 0 
the directing seems too pretentious 0 
everything about it is fine and reasonable for the price ie 1 
the scallop dish is quite appalling for value as well 0 
ambience is perfect 1 
this phone is slim and light and the display is beautiful 1 
one of the most disappointing aspects is the lack of notable gore 0 
all i have to say is the food was amazing 1 
the plot such as it is is so derivative and predictable that the ending is like a mercy killing 0 
john wayne did an incredible job for being so young in the movie industry 1 
we started with the tuna sashimi which was brownish in color and obviously wasnt fresh 0 
you cant beat that 1 
disapointing results 0 
great place fo take out or eat in 1 
works well 1 
this place is handsdown one of the best places to eat in the phoenix metro area 1 
server did a great job handling our large rowdy table 1 
i exchanged the sony ericson z500a for this and im pretty happy with that decision 1 
the phone loads super 1 
in the summer you can dine in a charming outdoor patio so very delightful 1 
best of luck to the rude and noncustomer service focused new management 0 
i do love sushi but i found kabuki to be overpriced overhip and underservices 0 
it dit not work most of the time with my nokia 5320 0 
returned 8 hours later 0 
my headset works just peachykeen 1 
conclusion very filling meals 1 
the cashier had no care what so ever on what i had to say it still ended up being wayyy overpriced 0 
best headset ever 1 
10 out of 10 stars 1 
whatever prompted such a documentary is beyond me 0 
excellent sound quality 1 
i think not again 0 
that being said for a phone the camera is very nice many cool effects to play with and video is decent as well 1 
painful on the ear 0 
very clear quality sound and you dont have to mess with the sound on your ipod since you have the sound buttons on the headset 1 
excellent sound quality 1 
i was mortified 0 
however my girl was complain that some time the phone doesnt wake up like normal phone does 0 
okay i like to consider myself a fair critic so ill give credit where credits duethe creature effects were actually pretty cool 1 
both films are terrible but to the credit of the 1986 version it was watchable 0 
appears to actually outperform the original battery from china that came with my v325i 1 
the movie showed a lot of florida at its best made it look very appealing 1 
the owners are super friendly and the staff is courteous 1 
lousy product 0 
it is rare when a filmmaker takes the time to tell a worthy moral tale with care and love that doesnt fall into the trap of being overly syrupy or over indulgent 1 
as an earlier review noted plug in this charger and nothing happens 0 
i didnt realize how wonderful the short really is until the last two scenes 1 
its a feelgood film and thats how i felt when i came out of the cinema 1 
if it was to turn my good day feeling into a night of disturbing memories than i guess he succeeded 0 
there is nothing privileged about workingeating there 0 
the atmosphere was great with a lovely duo of violinists playing songs we requested 1 
this is such a fun and funny movie 1 
my only complaint is the standard sound volume is a little low even when turned up to 5of 5 0 
its a long time since i was so entertained by a movie 1 
i bought this to use with my kindle fire and absolutely loved it 1 
the scripting of the subtle comedy is unmatched by any movie in recent years 1 
the budget was evidently very limited 0 
to summarize the food was incredible nay transcendant but nothing brings me joy quite like the memory of the pneumatic condiment dispenser 1 
i love my 350 headset my jabra350 bluetooth headset is great the reception is very good and the ear piece is a comfortable fit 1 
i was bored throughout the whole damn thing 0 
not much dialogue not much music the whole film was shot as elaborately and aesthetically like a sculpture 1 
seems like a good quick place to grab a bite of some familiar pub food but do yourself a favor and look elsewhere 0 
i would recommend saving room for this 1 
everything captain howdy says is either laughable or just plain stupid 0 
the battery life is highly unacceptable 0 
this movie is bad 0 
i know that sounds funny but to me it seemed like sketchy technology that wouldnt work wellwell this one works great 1 
it was a huge awkward 15lb piece of cow that was 34ths gristle and fat 0 
the service was poor and thats being nice 0 
2 thumbs up to this seller 1 
the result is a powerhouse achievement made more timely now perhaps because of our cultures disturbing fascination with celebrity and its distorted interpretations of fame 1 
jawbone era is awesome too 1 
the cow tongue and cheek tacos are amazing 1 
heres where the movie really pied me off 0 
if you want a sandwich just go to any firehouse 1 
this is infuriating 0 
rip off over charge shipping 0 
all in all i think it was a good investment 1 
yes i am simplifying things here for the sake of brevity for this really is at the core of the problems with this film it has too much going on without any real fulfilling explanation 0 
the nano stated itmy son was dissapointed 0 
the mic is great 1 
however the ear pads come off easily and after only one week i lost one 0 
his use of the colours of the french flag in the three films was nothing short of incredible every shot every scene was like a work of art 1 
the selection of food was not the best 0 
this second appearance of mickey mouse following the silent plane crazy earlier that year is probably his most famous filmmostly because it was so groundbreaking 1 
overall the film is interesting and thoughtprovoking 1 
50 down the drain 0 
the good cinematography also makes her and monica bellucci look very beautiful 1 
my husband and i ate lunch here and were very disappointed with the food and service 0 
the fried rice was dry as well 0 
well im satisfied 1 
at any rate this film stinks its not funny and fulci should have stayed with giallo and supernatural zombie movies 0 
the good cinematography also makes her and monica bellucci look very beautiful 1 
reversible plug works great 1 
the nokia ca42 usb cable did not work with my phone 0 
they could serve it with just the vinaigrette and it may make for a better overall dish but it was still very good 1 
frozen pucks of disgust with some of the worst people behind the register 0 
left very frustrated 0 
i still maintain that monkeys shouldnt make headphones we just obviously dont share enough dna to copy the design over to humans 0 
i could not understand what kind of idiot would produce this mess in the first place not to mention several season 0 
a great film by a great director 1 
my rating just 3 out of 10 0 
however after about a year the fliptop started to get loose and wobbly and eventually my screen went black and i couldnt receive and place calls 0 
regardless the film fails on most levels 0 
this movie contained an allstar cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i havent seen before 1 
these headphones were a great find and i think they are perhaps the best purchase ive made in the last several years seriously 1 
id love to go back 1 
enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film 1 
its just adorable seeing mickey playing turkey in the straw in a highly imaginative if occasionally cruel way 1 
call me a nut but i think this is one of the best movies ever 1 
the instruction manual is lacking 0 
i knew when i saw the film that more great things were to come from this gifted actor 1 
the charger arrived within the promised timeframe but it did not work 0 
it was a long time that i didnt see a so charismatic actor on screen 1 
however bt headsets are currently not good for real time games like firstperson shooters since the audio delay messes me up 0 
is it possible for a movie to get any worse than this 0 
it was horrendous 0 
back to good bbq lighter fare reasonable pricing and tell the public they are back to the old ways 1 
it doesnt work in europe or asia 0 
ive never been more insulted or felt disrespected 0 
this blueant supertooth handsfree phone speaker is awesome 1 
to summarize the food was incredible nay transcendant but nothing brings me joy quite like the memory of the pneumatic condiment dispenser 1 
both films are terrible but to the credit of the 1986 version it was watchable 0 
there is no real plot 0 
we would recommend these to others 1 
just spicy enough perfect actually 1 
a piece of cinematic garbage captured on celluloid 0 
works well 1 
rip off over charge shipping 0 
well im satisfied 1 
small sleek impressive looking practical setup with ample storage in place 1 
he is one of my favourite directors and one of the most talented directors in the history of cinema 1 
nonlinear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well 1 
avoid this establishment 0 
i dont have to be an accountant to know im getting screwed 0 
what a waste 0 
for people who are first timers in film making i think they did an excellent job 1 
the keyboard is a nice compromise between a full qwerty and the basic cell phone number keypad 1 
excellent phone 1 
it showed exactly how the government and the scientist argued for humanity and the reasons of the gadget 1 
there is a lot of beautiful places 1 
total letdown i would much rather just go to the camelback flower shop and cartel coffee 0 
this item is fantastic and works perfectly 1 
only pros large seating area nice bar area great simple drink menu the best brick oven pizza with homemade dough 1 
due to this happening on every call i was forced to stop using this headset 0 
very convenient since we were staying at the mgm 1 
anne heche was utterly convincing 1 
this is cool because most cases are just open there allowing the screen to get all scratched up 1 
overall a delight 1 
however this didnt make up for the fact that overall this was a tremendously boring movie 0 
just whatever you do avoid groove as its the antithesis of all that is good about human traffic 0 
i found the product to be easy to set up and use 1 
i also decided not to send it back because our waitress looked like she was on the verge of having a heart attack 0 
gets a signal when other verizon phones wont 1 
bought mainly for the charger which broke soon after purchasing 0 
the service here is fair at best 0 
never been to hard rock casino before will never ever step forward in it again 0 
which is precisely why i am giving it such a bad review 0 
great phone 1 
this early film from future goremeister lucio fulci is a very good addition to the giallo subgenre 1 
avoid this establishment 0 
the lines the cuts the audio everything is wrong 0 
the seasonal fruit was fresh white peach puree 1 
exceptionally bad 0 
food was delicious 1 
all it took was one drop from about 6 inches above the kitchen counter and it was crackedi am not impressed and i am not laughing 0 
the bose noise cancelling is amazing which is very important for a nyc commuter 1 
bluetooth does not work phone locks up screens just flash up and now it just makes calls randomly while in my pocket locked 0 
the ending is so so perfect youll shed a tear 1 
this pair of headphones is the worst that i have ever had soundwise 0 
i have seen many movies starring jaclyn smith but my god this was one of her best though it came out 12 years ago 1 
the phone loads super 1 
also the area where my unit broke im not too fond of the magnetic strap 0 
attempting artiness with black white and clever camera angles the movie disappointed became even more ridiculous as the acting was poor and the plot and lines almost nonexistent 0 
ive dropped my phone more times than i can say even on concrete and my phone is still great knock on wood 1 
the best phone in market 1 
what a waste of money and time 0 
saw the movie today and thought it was a good effort good messages for kids 1 
and i really did find them funny 1 
this place is overpriced not consistent with their boba and it really is overpriced 0 
i mean really how do you get so famous for your fish and chips when its so terrible 0 
i bought this battery with a coupon from amazon and im very happy with my purchase 1 
awsome device works great 1 
the sound quality for the device is unacceptableunless you are in a really quiet area you almost hear nothing 0 
this is an outstanding little restaurant with some of the best food i have ever tasted 1 
as many people complained i found this headsets microphone was very weak 0 
add betty white and jean smart and you have a great cast everyone played their parts really well 1 
good service very clean and inexpensive to boot 1 
watching washing machine twirling around wouldnt hurt your eyes as much as this show 0 
battery lasts only a few hours 0 
we sat another ten minutes and finally gave up and left 0 
john wayne did an incredible job for being so young in the movie industry 1 
a good time 1 
cheap but hey it works was pleasantly suprised given the low cost of this item 1 
i cannot believe that the actors agreed to do this film 0 
it is zillion times away from reality 0 
by far the best cheesecurds we have ever had 1 
i love that they put their food in nice plastic containers as opposed to cramming it in little paper takeout boxes 1 
and i just love the colors 1 
the movie in movie situations in the beginning and through the game that is played with her by the acting coach are fascinating 1 
fast service 1 
favorite place in town for shawarrrrrrma 1 
fits comfortably came with three sizes of earbud tips 1 
this place was such a nice surprise 1 
everything was gross 0 
for that its worth checking out 1 
the camera on the phone may be used as a dustpan when indoors id rather be using a disposable then this 0 
the server was very negligent of our needs and made us feel very unwelcome i would not suggest this place 0 
what should have been a hilarious yummy christmas eve dinner to remember was the biggest fail of the entire trip for us 0 
disappointing 0 
the owner used to work at nobu so this place is really similar for half the price 1 
waste of money 0 
this movie is possibly one of the most creative works of horror ever 1 
i give wirefly 1 stari will contact cingularatt and inform them of this practice 0 
the script is was there a script 0 
it was packed 0 
we asked for the bill to leave without eating and they didnt bring that either 0 
the directing seems too pretentious 0 
save your money ive had this item for 11 months now 0 
i immediately said i wanted to talk to the manager but i did not want to talk to the guy who was doing shots of fireball behind the bar 0 
i had high hopes for this place since the burgers are cooked over a charcoal grill but unfortunately the taste fell flat way flat 0 
i used bitpim a free program you can find on the internetto transfer data to the phonethe price of the cable was excellent 1 
unless youre just out to visually collect all extant films of austens work you can skip this one 0 
seriously flavorful delights folks 1 
a pretty good product 1 
i give it 2 thumbs down 0 
of course the acting is blah 0 
the reception is excellent 1 
back to good bbq lighter fare reasonable pricing and tell the public they are back to the old ways 1 
dont waste your money 0 
but the convoluted plot just didnt convince me and much of the film was watched with a weird questioning glance 0 
the sets especially designed to work with the camera are amazingstylized beautiful and effective 1 
weve have gotten a much better service from the pizza place next door than the services we received from this restaurant 0 
call me a nut but i think this is one of the best movies ever 1 
about ten minutes into this film i started having second thoughts 0 
i was bored throughout the whole damn thing 0 
the story is also both funny and poignant at times 1 
reaching for the bottom row is uncomfortable and the send and end keys are not where i expect them to be3 0 
problem is that the ear loops are made of weak material and break easily 0 
great case and price 1 
this is one of the best italian thrillers of the early 70s 1 
the movie was very interesting from beginning to the end 1 
it is the best charger i have seen on the market yet 1 
the awful dialogue and hopeless overacting by everyone who gets shot top off a real waste of space and time 0 
i love the pho and the spring rolls oh so yummy you have to try 1 
in fact this stinker smells like a directtovideo release 0 
the service was great even the manager came and helped with our table 1 
our server was super nice and checked on us many times 1 
i was very excited to get this headset because i thought it was really cute 1 
also if your phone is dropped this case is not going to save it specially when dropped face down 0 
excellent performance 1 
excellent service 1 
at first glance it is a lovely bakery cafe nice ambiance clean friendly staff 1 
walked in and the place smelled like an old grease trap and only 2 others there eating 0 
unfortunately inexperience of direction meant that scene after scene passed with little in the way of dramatic tension or conflict 0 
we loved the place 1 
strike 2 who wants to be rushed 0 
great earpiece 1 
steve martin delivers a really funny performance of a middleaged upper class uptight white guy 1 
the food was great as always compliments to the chef 1 
the film is well paced understated and one of the best courtroom documentaries ive seen 1 
my first visit to hiro was a delight 1 
i cant see how this movie can be an inspiration to anyone to come out or overcome fear and rejection 0 
the story line is totally predictable 0 
the manager was the worst 0 
dont buy this product 0 
by this time our side of the restaurant was almost empty so there was no excuse 0 
food was average at best 0 
if you are looking for a good quality motorola headset keep looking this isnt it 0 
also notable is john baileys fine crisp beautifully colored cinematography and the great production design costumes by eiko ishioka who went on to do the memorable costumes for coppolas dracula for which she received a well deserved oscar 1 
very comfortable 1 
its fits like a glove and is strong secure and durable 1 
what on earth is irons doing in this film 0 
punishment park is a brilliant piece of cinema 1 
it was clear that she had the range and ability to pull off this part 1 
ive dropped my phone more times than i can say even on concrete and my phone is still great knock on wood 1 
i even dropped this phone into a stream and it was submerged for 15 seconds and it still works great 1 
that was done in the second movie 0 
the story line is totally predictable 0 
also were served hot bread and butter and home made potato chips with bacon bits on topvery original and very good 1 
they work about 2 weeks then break 0 
works great when my cat attacked the phone he scratched the protective strip instead of destroying the screen 1 
the cashier had no care what so ever on what i had to say it still ended up being wayyy overpriced 0 
actually the graphics were good at the time 1 
this place is way too overpriced for mediocre food 0 
everything about this movie is stupid 0 
this little device has transformed my organizational capability and made my life a whole lot easier 1 
i checked everywhere and there is no feature for it which is really disappointing 0 
this wonderful experience made this place a muststop whenever we are in town again 1 
delete this film from your mind 0 
even allowing for poor production values for the time 1971 and the format some kind of miniseries this is baaaaaad 0 
seller shipped quickly and much cheaper than the competitors 1 
the price is reasonable and the service is great 1 
first off the reception sucks i have never had more than 2 bars ever 0 
disapointing results 0 
this company charge me a restocking fee and still not given me my refund back 0 
same evening him and i are both drastically sick 0 
lots of holes in the script 0 
highly entertaining at all angles 1 
it probably would have been better if the director hadnt spent most of the movie showcasing his own art work which really isnt that noteworthy 0 
very well made and fits my surefire gx2 perfectly 1 
i sat riveted to the tv screen 1 
there was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters 0 
nice sound 1 
finally after three or four times the spring of the latch broke and i could not use it any longer on the visor 0 
unreliable im giving up 0 
my experience was terrible this was my fourth bluetooth headset and while it was much more comfortable than my last jabra which i hated 0 
some applause should be given to the prelude however 1 
i like steiners because its dark and it feels like a bar 1 
okay i like to consider myself a fair critic so ill give credit where credits duethe creature effects were actually pretty cool 1 
never again will i be dining at this place 0 
delicious nyc bagels good selections of cream cheese real lox with capers even 1 
food was great and so was the serivce 1 
i have had tmobile service for 2 or 3 years now and i am pretty happy with it 1 
my husband said she was very rude did not even apologize for the bad food or anything 0 
great character actors telly savalas and peter boyle 1 
this place is not quality sushi it is not a quality restaurant 0 
the worst was the salmon sashimi 0 
do not make the same mistake as me 0 
great food and great service in a clean and friendly setting 1 
special thanks to dylan t for the recommendation on what to order all yummy for my tummy 1 
ordered an appetizer and took 40 minutes and then the pizza another 10 minutes 0 
it showed exactly how the government and the scientist argued for humanity and the reasons of the gadget 1 
looks great and is strong 1 
it worked very well 1 
the volume switch rocketed out of the unit to a destination unknown 0 
the only good thing was our waiter he was very helpful and kept the bloddy marys coming 1 
the script is bad very bad  it contains both cheesiness and unethical joke that you normally see in rated r or nc17 movie 0 
the entire audience applauded at the conclusion of the film 1 
this is a masterful piece of filmmaking with many themes simmering and occasionally boiling over in this warts and all study of the poets bohemian selfindulgent wartime years that span the aerial bombardments of london and the outward tranquillity of a welsh coastal retreat the borderlines between friendship lust and love dedication to art and experience versus practical concerns jealousy rivalry cowardice and egotism versus heroism and selfsacrifice and more 1 
before i go in to why i gave a 1 star rating please know that this was my third time eating at bachi burger before writing a review 0 
both films are terrible but to the credit of the 1986 version it was watchable 0 
id say that would be the hardest decision honestly all of ms dishes taste how they are supposed to taste amazing 1 
i recommend igo to anyone with different brand cell phonesmp3 players in the family 1 
i ordered the lemon raspberry ice cocktail which was also incredible 1 
there are massive levels massive unlockable characters its just a massive game 1 
the greek dressing was very creamy and flavorful 1 
this is a chilly unremarkable movie about an author livingworking in a chilly abstruse culture 0 
it deserves strong love 1 
item does not match picture 0 
their research and development division obviously knows what theyre doing 1 
internet is excrutiatingly slow 0 
im not really sure how joeys was voted best hot dog in the valley by readers of phoenix magazine 0 
however i recently watched the whole thing again on dvd and i was completely struck by how extremely stupid the storyline was how it contained holes inconsistencies and frankly a whole lot of crap and how horrid the dancing was 0 
this film has no redeeming features 0 
and the sound quality is great 1 
battery life is real good 1 
hackneyed writing certainly but made even worse by the bad directing 0 
all the other cases ive tried normally fall apart after a few months but this one seems to be in for the long haul 1 
i love the ringtones because they are so upbeat 1 
great product 1 
this mostly routine factbased tv drama gets a boost from the fine performance by cole 1 
this item is great installed it let it charged up overnite and it has been working good every since with no problems 1 
1010 1 
pretty piece of junk 0 
the transfers are very good 1 
when i placed my treo into the case not only was it not snug but there was a lot of extra room on the sides 0 
great pocket pc phone combination 1 
the volume for the ringer is real good you have choices how loud 1 
the acting was decidely wooden though no worse than a period universal b movie 0 
plantronics bluetooth excelent buy 1 
steve martin delivers a really funny performance of a middleaged upper class uptight white guy 1 
i got to enjoy the seafood salad with a fabulous vinegrette 1 
all the other cases ive tried normally fall apart after a few months but this one seems to be in for the long haul 1 
the only downside is the service 0 
even in my bmw 3 series which is fairly quiet i have trouble hearing what the other person is saying 0 
it holds a charge for a long time is reasonably comfortable under longwearing conditions and the quality of sound is tremendous 1 
works good 1 
i cant use this case because the smell is disgusting 0 
what happened next was prettyoff putting 0 
classywarm atmosphere fun and fresh appetizers succulent steaks baseball steak 1 
it plays louder than any other speaker of this size the price is so low that most would think the quality is lacking however its not 1 
a very good film indeed about great and unconditional love 1 
as always the evening was wonderful and the food delicious 1 
a film not easily forgotten 1 
excellent performance 1 
the scallop dish is quite appalling for value as well 0 
the selection of food was not the best 0 
furthermore you cant even find hours of operation on the website 0 
hence the whole story lacks a certain energy 0 
so badwellits just bad 0 
do not purchase this phone 0 
what a great double cheeseburger 1 
we watched our waiter pay a lot more attention to other tables and ignore us 0 
very cheap plastic creaks like an old wooden floor 0 
i had ordered a motorola data cable got a very well finished and working product 1 
the cast was great 1 
weve have gotten a much better service from the pizza place next door than the services we received from this restaurant 0 
i searched the internet and found this one to be the best value 1 
would not reccommend 0 
highquality chicken on the chicken caesar salad 1 
damn good steak 1 
even in my bmw 3 series which is fairly quiet i have trouble hearing what the other person is saying 0 
poorly contstruct hinge 0 
do not buy if you want to use the holster 0 
lame would be the best way to describe it 0 
so just beware 0 
this company charge me a restocking fee and still not given me my refund back 0 
the cashier had no care what so ever on what i had to say it still ended up being wayyy overpriced 0 
theres barely a boring moment in the film and there are plenty of humorous parts 1 
the ambiance isnt much better 0 
who in their right mind is gonna buy this battery 0 
its pure brilliance 1 
great service and food 1 
could not get strong enough signal 0 
too bad you have to pay up to a month for the service 0 
oh the charger seems to work fine 1 
it was also the right balance of war and love 1 
one more thing i can tolerate political incorrectness very well im all for artistic freedom and suspension of disbelief but the slavic female character was just too much 0 
it just blew 0 
trouble is the writing and directing make it impossible to establish those things that make a movie watchable like character story theme and so on 0 
brilliance indeed 1 
having to humour him just to get by and get through the day was so apt 1 
youd have to have the iq of particularly stupid mollusk not to see that one coming 0 
razr battery good buy 1 
i have to mention this and it is a huge spoiler i loved the ending how all the characters of the three films were the remaining survivors of the ferry disaster with valentine and the young judge together and the old man watching it on her tv solidifying his happiness over the suffering which he dealt with for those many years 1 
i highly recommend this device to everyone 1 
its a feelgood film and thats how i felt when i came out of the cinema 1 
always a great time at dos gringos 1 
integrated seamlessly with the motorola razr phone 1 
my friend loved the salmon tartar 1 
the movie is full of wonderful dancing hence the title 1 
now you know why i gave it a 10 1 
it was a very superficial movie and it gave me the feeling that i was watching play rather than a film 0 
it was not good 0 
im not impressed with the concept or the food 0 
first of all it doesnt wear well 0 
also great directing and photography 1 
the only suspense i was feeling was the frustration at just how retarded the girls were 0 
this place deserves one star and 90 has to do with the food 0 
i received my orders well within the shipping timeframe everything was in good working order and overall i am very excited to have this source 1 
and those baby owls were adorable 1 
the story unfolds in 18th century jutland and the use of period music played on period instruments is just one more fine touch 1 
but despite these few flaws this case is of exceptional quality and well worth the additional costs of owning an official oem product 1 
this is simply the best bluetooth headset for sound quality 1 
it lasts less than 3o minutes if i actually try to use the phonemy wife has the same phone with the same problem 0 
i bought this phone as a replacement for my startac and have regretted it since 0 
ive seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie 0 
this film and i use that word loosely is an insult to the moviegoing public 0 
this scene is very strong and unpleasant 0 
it holds a charge for a long time is reasonably comfortable under longwearing conditions and the quality of sound is tremendous 1 
cheap but hey it works was pleasantly suprised given the low cost of this item 1 
they were excellent 1 
very good lunch spot 1 
actually the graphics were good at the time 1 
secondly hitchcock pretty much perfected the thriller and chase movie 1 
i wish i could return the unit and get back my money 0 
the yellowtail carpaccio was melt in your mouth fresh 1 
the owners are super friendly and the staff is courteous 1 
i kept looking at the time and it had soon become 35 minutes yet still no food 0 
about half way through this film i started to dislike it 0 
the phone is sturdy and waterproof 1 
as many people complained i found this headsets microphone was very weak 0 
first off the reception sucks i have never had more than 2 bars ever 0 
if you are razr owneryou must have this 1 
very much disappointed with this company 0 
disapointing results 0 
logitech bluetooth headset is a 10 1 
i am sorry i made this purchase 0 
summary the witticisms werent witty 0 
i would highly recommend this 1 
i liked it 1 
i really hope the team behind this movie makes more movies and that they will continue to do so in their own some kinda weird style 1 
service is friendly and inviting 1 
your staff spends more time talking to themselves than me 0 
their monster chicken fried steak and eggs is my all time favorite 1 
good value works fine power via usb car or wall outlet 1 
just what i wanted 1 
i love the scream movies and all horror movies and this one ranks way up there 1 
its a case of so bad it is laughable 0 
this battery is an excellent bargain 1 
the burrittos blah 0 
camera color balance is awful 0 
gets a signal when other verizon phones wont 1 
the story starts too fast with absolutely no suspense or buildup in the slightest 0 
the attention given to every character and complex psychological portrayals detailing loyalty treachery love and hope are tremendous 1 
but the service was beyond bad 0 
food quality has been horrible 0 
great case and price 1 
hence the whole story lacks a certain energy 0 
special mention should be made of the superb music score and sound effects which are an integral element in helping to make this such a memorable and enjoyable cartoon 1 
id love to go back 1 
well packaged arrived on time and works as intended 1 
i ordered albondigas soup which was just warm and tasted like tomato soup with frozen meatballs 0 
the servers went back and forth several times not even so much as an are you being helped 0 
only had this a month but its worked flawlessly so far 1 
someone shouldve invented this sooner 1 
the phone is sturdy and waterproof 1 
all it took was one drop from about 6 inches above the kitchen counter and it was crackedi am not impressed and i am not laughing 0 
worst customer service ever 0 
doesnt do the job 0 
putting the race card aside lets look at the major flaw in the film they destroy latifas character 0 
the update procedure is difficult and cumbersome 0 
the show would begin with smart ass ed comments to each other that would be totally off the wall and uncalled for 0 
pricing is a bit of a concern at mellow mushroom 0 
im a bit disappointed 0 
often the dialogue doesnt really follow from one line to another or fit the surroundings 0 
my husband said she was very rude did not even apologize for the bad food or anything 0 
the tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu 0 
wow loved this place 1 
the art style has the appearance of crayonpencil drawings and is wonderfully colorful and fanciful 1 
an hour seriously 0 
also great directing and photography 1 
the worst experience ever 0 
you share general loewenhielms exquisite joy in his partaking of the cailles en sarcophage even though you are just watching a movie but you do wish for just a small sample to savor 1 
disappointing accessory from a good manufacturer 0 
i would not recommend this place 0 
unfortunately we must have hit the bakery on leftover day because everything we ordered was stale 0 
but the premise of the film was so ridiculous that the president of the us 0 
i bought this battery with a coupon from amazon and im very happy with my purchase 1 
it was so cool 1 
if this premise sound stupid thats because it is 0 
20th century foxs road house 1948 is not only quite a silly noir but is an implausible unmitigated bore of a movie 0 
the story which was told so eloquently by francis ford coppola 25 years earlier really unfolds gradually and leaves room for the characters to develop 1 
i love all the features and form factor 1 
great price too 1 
this isnt a small family restaurant this is a fine dining establishment 1 
lot of holes in the plot theres nothing about how he became the emperor nothing about where he spend 20 years between his childhood and mature age 0 
cooked to perfection and the service was impeccable 1 
if you check the directors filmography on this site you will see why this film didnt have a chance 0 
not much seafood and like 5 strings of pasta at the bottom 0 
i hate writing bad reviews about films especially those in which i really like the star but this film is so bad i dont believe for one second that anyone could have been proud of it 0 
but what really made it unwatchable was the direction 0 
my boyfriend tried the mediterranean chicken salad and fell in love 1 
i gave it 5 stars because of the sound quality 1 
there is a totally unnecessary trainroller coaster scene 0 
see both films if you can 1 
the only thing i wasnt too crazy about was their guacamole as i dont like it puréed 0 
doesnt work 0 
as for the killer dont expect anything original or even remotely frightening 0 
the film gives meaning to the phrase never in the history of human conflict has so much been owed by so many to so few 1 
the pancake was also really good and pretty large at that 1 
server did a great job handling our large rowdy table 1 
the food sucked which we expected but it sucked more than we could have imagined 0 
it was a pale color instead of nice and char and has no flavor 0 
it deserves strong love 1 
some great music and terrific scenery 1 
the chips that came out were dripping with grease and mostly not edible 0 
even worse than ticker 0 
i couldnt think of a better way to end the film but a smile on my face great way to wrap up an amazing film and trilogy 1 
didnt laugh or even smile once 0 
that was done in the second movie 0 
ray charles life provided excellent biographical material for the film which goes well beyond being just another movie about a musician 1 
all the characters in this film are tremendously well played 1 
lewis blacks considerable talent is wasted here too as he is at his most incendiary when he is unrestrained which the pg13 rating certainly wont allow 0 
battery is terrible 0 
even when the women finally show up there is no sign of improvement the most expected things happen and by the time the film is over you might be far asleep 0 
the only suspense i was feeling was the frustration at just how retarded the girls were 0 
well just if you keep thinking how bad it is 0 
very dissapointing performance 0 
ive seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie 0 
this is hands down the best phone ive ever had 1 
product was excellent and works better than the verizon one and boy was it cheaper 1 
phenomenal food service and ambiance 1 
worst service to boot but that is the least of their worries 0 
that just screams legit in my booksomethats also pretty rare here in vegas 1 
people who like european films and art movies will like this movie 1 
for service i give them no stars 0 
when my order arrived one of the gyros was missing 0 
i have been to very few places to eat that under no circumstances would i ever return to and this tops the list 0 
krussel always good 1 
i was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar not only because the quality is great but the service is fast and the food impeccable 1 
the food is not tasty at all not to say its real traditional hunan style 0 
why are these sad little vegetables so overcooked 0 
but storm trooper is not even bad enough to make it to the list of wonderfully terrible movies 0 
everything about it is just bad 0 
that company is a joke 0 
its a campy sort of film thats a joy to watch 1 
its a shame to see good actors like thomerson and james make a living in a mess like this 0 
the script is a big flawed mess 0 
muddy low quality sound and the casing around the wires insert was poorly super glued and slid off 0 
see both films if you can 1 
the potato chip order was sad i could probably count how many chips were in that box and it was probably around 12 0 
crostini that came with the salad was stale 0 
i dont think well be going back anytime soon 0 
everyone is very attentive providing excellent customer service 1 
now this dish was quite flavourful 1 
i ordered this for sony ericsson w810i but i think it only worked once thats when i first used it 0 
the plot was the same as pretty much every other cheap horror 0 
as a courtroom drama its compelling as an indictment on the american justice system its frightening 1 
a good quality bargain i bought this after i bought a cheapy from big lots that sounded awful and people on the other end couldnt hear me 1 
i put the latest os on it v115g and it now likes to slow to a crawl and lock up every once in a while 0 
it deserves strong love 1 
very clear quality sound and you dont have to mess with the sound on your ipod since you have the sound buttons on the headset 1 
highly unrecommended 0 
the directing and the cinematography arent quite as good 0 
this movie does an excellent job of revealing the complexity of the task and the incredible challenges facing south africa 1 
i tried the cape cod ravoli chickenwith cranberrymmmm 1 
the entire audience applauded at the conclusion of the film 1 
this was a poor remake of my best friends wedding 0 
not worth it 0 
its welldesigned and very sharp the blue is a very nice color 1 
i still maintain that monkeys shouldnt make headphones we just obviously dont share enough dna to copy the design over to humans 0 
hackneyed writing certainly but made even worse by the bad directing 0 
the scenes with the ohsomature neighbourgirl are a misplace 0 
why was this film made 0 
verizons bills however are difficult to understand even though their pricing plans are simple 0 
however paul schrader has indeed made a film about mishima that is both superb complex 1 
the cast of veteran actors are more than just a nostalgia trip 1 
returned 8 hours later 0 
i like the fact that it rests lightly against your ear rather than inside 1 
couldnt use the unit with sunglasses not good in texas 0 
i hope this place sticks around 1 
yes its shiny on front side and i love it 1 
you need at least 3 mins to get to your phone book from the time you first turn on the phonebattery life is short 0 
this is definitely one of the better documentaries i have seen looking at family relationships and marriage 1 
which are small and not worth the price 0 
i go to far too many places and ive never seen any restaurant that serves a 1 egg breakfast especially for 400 0 
lets start with all the problemsthe acting especially from the lead professor was very very bad 0 
very good quality though 1 
lordy the khao soi is a dish that is not to be missed for curry lovers 1 
this place is pretty good nice little vibe in the restaurant 1 
horrible horrible protector 0
