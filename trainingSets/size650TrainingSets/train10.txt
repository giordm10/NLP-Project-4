great price too 1 
battery life is real good 1 
too bad cause i know its family owned i really wanted to like this place 0 
its like a bad two hour tv movie 0 
overall a delight 1 
after two i felt disgusting 0 
the steak was amazingrge fillet relleno was the best seafood plate i have ever had 1 
best tater tots in the southwest 1 
the ambiance was incredible 1 
ordered burger rare came in well done 0 
loved the casting of jimmy buffet as the science teacher 1 
bad purchase 0 
i think this restaurant suffers from not trying hard enough 0 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
the menu is always changing food quality is going down service is extremely slow 0 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
the design is very odd as the ear clip is not very comfortable at all 0 
delete this film from your mind 0 
once your food arrives its meh 0 
an awesome new look for fall 2000 1 
the decor is nice and the piano music soundtrack is pleasant 1 
there are so many problems i dont know where to start 0 
its very slow 0 
this was such an awesome movie that i bought it off of ebay 1 
updatewent back for a second time and it was still just as amazing 1 
lucy bell is so much higher than this crap and for her to sink this low is quite depressing 0 
i love the camera its really pretty good quality 1 
it was a pale color instead of nice and char and has no flavor 0 
beware this is not a trashy cult movie this is trash period 0 
great earpiece 1 
i rather enjoyed it 1 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
who in their right mind is gonna buy this battery 0 
good beer drink selection and good food selection 1 
camera color balance is awful 0 
it was a drive to get there 0 
i dont have very many words to say about this place but it does everything pretty well 1 
wonderful lil tapas and the ambience made me feel all warm and fuzzy inside 1 
glad i didnt pay to see it 0 
the chains which im no fan of beat this place easily 0 
im trying to return it for a refund 0 
i purcashed this for the car charger and it does not work 0 
has been working great 1 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
all in all ha long bay was a bit of a flop 0 
the accompanied software is almost brilliant 1 
cinematography the film was shot in an interesting way 1 
plug was the wrong size 0 
i would not recommend this place 0 
i go to far too many places and ive never seen any restaurant that serves a 1 egg breakfast especially for 400 0 
if there were zero stars i would give it zero stars 0 
the best place in vegas for breakfast just check out a sat or sun 1 
the sergeant pepper beef sandwich with auju sauce is an excellent sandwich as well 1 
no ear loop needed its tiny and the sound is great 1 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
cheap but hey it works was pleasantly suprised given the low cost of this item 1 
bluetooth range is good a few days ago i left my phone in the trunk got a call and carried the conversation without a hitch 1 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
but whatever it was that cost them so much it didnt translate to quality thats for sure 0 
awful 0 
sweetest phone 1 
so they performed 1 
brilliant 1 
now i know that i made a wise decision 1 
buyerbe very careful 0 
very disappointing 0 
this game rocks 1 
dont waste your money 0 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
nothing special 0 
paolo sorrentino has written a wonderful story about loneliness and tony has built one of the most unforgettable characters seen in movies in recent years 1 
her role was played well 1 
love this product 1 
there was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth but it didnt really work into the rest of the plot 0 
the fries were great too 1 
big disappointment with calendar sync 0 
fast service 1 
the mic there is a joke and the volume is quite low 0 
went for lunch service was slow 0 
aside from its terrible lead this film has loads of other debits 0 
this is cool because most cases are just open there allowing the screen to get all scratched up 1 
the stories were powerful explorations of the nature of man and of art 1 
you cant beat that 1 
hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in 0 
lame would be the best way to describe it 0 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
no plot whatsoever 0 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
the camera although rated at an impressive 13 megapixels renders images that fall well below expectations of such a relatively high resolution 0 
none of it works just dont buy it 0 
i did not bother contacting the company for few dollar product but i learned the lesson that i should not have bought this form online anyway 0 
this movie is excellentangel is beautiful and scamp is adorablehis little yelps when hes scaredand the funniest parts are whenscamp is caught under the curtain and when angel and scamp are singing ive never had this feeling beforei totally recommend this movieits coming out on special edition on june 20the cover has scamp on a garbage can and angel underneath the lid 1 
this place deserves one star and 90 has to do with the food 0 
i had the chicken pho and it tasted very bland 0 
your staff spends more time talking to themselves than me 0 
i was particularly pleased with the acting ability of dwight schultz 1 
her role was played well 1 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
but it wasnt until i watched this film that i realised how great he actually was 1 
good product incredible value 1 
unless youre just out to visually collect all extant films of austens work you can skip this one 0 
ive had no trouble accessing the internet downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions 1 
brilliant 1 
did not like at all 0 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
oh this is such a thing of beauty this restaurant 1 
and considering the two of us left there very full and happy for about 20 you just cant go wrong 1 
the sound is clear and the people i talk to on it are amazed at the quality too 1 
the awful dialogue and hopeless overacting by everyone who gets shot top off a real waste of space and time 0 
i had absolutely no problem with this headset linking to my 8530 blackberry curve 1 
doesnt last long 0 
i would recommend it 1 
i paid too much 0 
you also cannot take pictures with it in the case because the lense is covered 0 
verizons bills however are difficult to understand even though their pricing plans are simple 0 
waiter was a jerk 0 
best breakfast buffet 1 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly will return next time im in vegas 1 
i came back today since they relocated and still not impressed 0 
rude inconsiderate management 0 
they dropped more than the ball 0 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
garbo who showed right off the bat that her talents could carry over from the silent era i wanted to see some of her silent work but netflix doesnt seem to be stocking them 1 
seriously flavorful delights folks 1 
overall i like there food and the service 1 
it was a very superficial movie and it gave me the feeling that i was watching play rather than a film 0 
omg i felt like i had never eaten thai food until this dish 1 
the potatoes were great and so was the biscuit 1 
im in az all the time and now have my new spot 1 
this is one of the best movies out there that shows such strong sibling bond for each other 1 
bad purchase 0 
imdb ratings only go as low 1 for awful its time to get some negative numbers in there for cases such as these 0 
i believe that pitch black was done well 1 
overall i would recommend this phone over the new walkman 1 
best fish ive ever had in my life 1 
her lines seem to have been written by a fifteen year old though they are trying oh so so hard to sound like how a fifteen year old would really um you know well talk 0 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
this movie suffered because of the writing it needed more suspense 0 
i tried talking real loud but shouting on the telephone gets old and i was still told it wasnt great 0 
theres barely a boring moment in the film and there are plenty of humorous parts 1 
from what my dinner companions told meeverything was very fresh with nice texture and taste 1 
the voice recognition thru the handset is excellent 1 
which is precisely why i am giving it such a bad review 0 
still waiting im sure this item would work well if i ever recieve it 0 
this place has it 1 
however bt headsets are currently not good for real time games like firstperson shooters since the audio delay messes me up 0 
this is a great deal 1 
happy so far 1 
the design is very odd as the ear clip is not very comfortable at all 0 
star trek v the final frontier is the worst in the series 0 
the waiter wasnt helpful or friendly and rarely checked on us 0 
helen baxendale is a very credible lady macbeth who can be very cheerfull at times and sometimes she just looks like a naughty girl but deadly in her taste for blood and evil 1 
other than that the leather is nice and soft the fit is very tight the cut out for the face is a good shape 1 
its just painful 0 
clever and a real crowdpleaserthis film still ranks among mickeys best films even after 80 wonderful years 1 
great for the jawbone 1 
ive never been treated so bad 0 
the writer gorman bechard undoubtedly did his homework because all references are industry and characterage appropriate 1 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
the nachos are a must have 1 
this movie is also revealing 1 
i was not impressed by this product 0 
five star plus plus 1 
after all the rave reviews i couldnt wait to eat herewhat a disappointment 0 
there are so many problems i dont know where to start 0 
now this is a movie i really dislike 0 
this was my first and only vegas buffet and it did not disappoint 1 
terrible service 0 
id advise anyone to go and see it 1 
all i have to say is the food was amazing 1 
i love being able to use one headset for both by landline and cell 1 
rip off over charge shipping 0 
the camera really likes her in this movie 1 
i purcashed this for the car charger and it does not work 0 
this place is pretty good nice little vibe in the restaurant 1 
awesome device 1 
at a time when it seems that film animation has been dominated by disneypixars cgi masterpieces it is both refreshing and comforting to know that miyazaki is still relying on traditional handdrawn animation to tell his charming and enchanting stories 1 
i have tried these cables with my computer and my ipod and it works just fine 1 
it really is impressive that the place hasnt closed down 0 
he was extremely rude and really there are so many other restaurants i would love to dine at during a weekend in vegas 0 
the acting as youd expect from this cast is top notch 1 
kris kristoffersen is good in this movie and really makes a difference 1 
i really loved the story line and the poler bear was kinda cutebut if anyone has a question about fort steele just ask away 1 
to be honest with you this is unbelievable nonsense and very foolish 0 
my breakfast was perpared great with a beautiful presentation of 3 giant slices of toast lightly dusted with powdered sugar 1 
feelings thoughtsgabriels discomfort during the danceall these intangibles leap to life and come within the viewers grasp in hustons portrayal 1 
third the cheese on my friends burger was cold 0 
we enjoy their pizza and brunch 1 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
but it does get better reception and clarity than any phone ive had before 1 
and those baby owls were adorable 1 
i struggle to find anything bad to say about it 1 
this place is not worth your time let alone vegas 0 
steamboat willie is an amazingly important film to our cinema history 1 
you get extra minutes so that you can carry out the call and not get cut off 1 
one of my favorite purchases ever 1 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
voice recognition is tremendous 1 
then scene where they debated whether or not to sack the trumpeter who falsely was accused for the murder is pure horror really stupid 0 
now this is a movie i really dislike 0 
service is also cute 1 
very bad performance plays angela bennett a computer expert who is at home all the time 0 
then scene where they debated whether or not to sack the trumpeter who falsely was accused for the murder is pure horror really stupid 0 
the attempts at humor were pitiful and story is so awful it dosent bear thinking about which basically involves a vulcan stealing the enterprise to find god seriously i just didnt care about any of this film and oh not to mention uhura does a belly dance to distract male guards 0 
the feel of the dining room was more college cooking course than high class dining and the service was slow at best 0 
after watching this film i wanted to learn more about the works of this artist 1 
bela lugosi was totally extraneous intoning odd lines 0 
the acting as youd expect from this cast is top notch 1 
it is not good 0 
timely shipment and quality product 1 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
sending it back 0 
returned 8 hours later 0 
im not really sure how joeys was voted best hot dog in the valley by readers of phoenix magazine 0 
he owns the film just as spacek owned coal miners daughter and quaid owned great balls of fire 1 
the films dialogue is natural real to life 1 
the sound is clear and the people i talk to on it are amazed at the quality too 1 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
he is an amazing film artist one of the most important whoever lived 1 
the seasonal fruit was fresh white peach puree 1 
the sound is clear and the people i talk to on it are amazed at the quality too 1 
good case excellent value 1 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
but this movie is definitely a below average rent 0 
babie bop is very cute 1 
her role was played well 1 
i love the ringtones because they are so upbeat 1 
no actress has been worse used that june allison in this movie 0 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
the awful dialogue and hopeless overacting by everyone who gets shot top off a real waste of space and time 0 
i have never had such bland food which surprised me considering the article we read focused so much on their spices and flavor 0 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
i dont recommend unless your car breaks down in front of it and you are starving 0 
an hour seriously 0 
defective crap 0 
this pair of headphones is the worst that i have ever had soundwise 0 
will not be back 0 
krussel always good 1 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
really ugly 0 
rip off over charge shipping 0 
i probably would not go here again 0 
the guys all had steaks and our steak loving son who has had steak at the best and worst places said it was the best steak hes ever eaten 1 
so far so good 1 
the scallop dish is quite appalling for value as well 0 
as for the mains also uninspired 0 
food is way overpriced and portions are fucking small 0 
the problem i have is that they charge 1199 for a sandwich that is no bigger than a subway sub which offers better and more amount of vegetables 0 
motorola finally got the voice quality of a bluetooth headset right 1 
it was packed 0 
how can you call yourself a steakhouse if you cant properly cook a steak i dont understand 0 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
on three different occasions i asked for well done or medium well and all three times i got the bloodiest piece of meat on my plate 0 
too bad you have to pay up to a month for the service 0 
if you check the directors filmography on this site you will see why this film didnt have a chance 0 
best tacos in town by far 1 
if there was ever a movie that needed wordofmouth to promote this is it 1 
its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
one of the worst shows of all time 0 
the entire audience applauded at the conclusion of the film 1 
i received my supposedly new motorola 375 and apparently there was not a match between the phone and the charger 0 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
and it was boring 0 
not good when wearing a hat or sunglasses 0 
i have read others reviews here but i havent had any problem with it 1 
the color is even prettier than i thought it would be and the graphics are incredibly sharp 1 
it always cuts out and makes a beep beep beep sound then says signal failed 0 
it is zillion times away from reality 0 
an absolute must visit 1 
due to this happening on every call i was forced to stop using this headset 0 
unfortunately it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees 0 
but it does get better reception and clarity than any phone ive had before 1 
i struggle to find anything bad to say about it 1 
as for the mains also uninspired 0 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
when it opens the battery connection is broken and the device is turned off 0 
i cant use this case because the smell is disgusting 0 
disappointing 0 
in conclusion i will not bother with this movie because a volcano in los angeles is nothing but nonsense 0 
reaching for the bottom row is uncomfortable and the send and end keys are not where i expect them to be3 0 
as i said abovepretty useless 0 
dessert panna cotta was amazing 1 
he came running after us when he realized my husband had left his sunglasses on the table 1 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
what i really like there is the crepe station 1 
i might have gotten a defect but i would not risk buying it again because of the built quality alone 0 
perabo has a nice energy level and is obviously very comfortable in front of a camera 1 
audio quality is poor very poor 0 
after my phone got to be about a year old its been slowly breaking despite much care on my part 0 
best tater tots in the southwest 1 
this product is clearly not ready for prime time i dont care how cool it looks if you cant tell a call is coming in its worthless 0 
later i found myself lost in the power of the film 1 
imdb ratings only go as low 1 for awful its time to get some negative numbers in there for cases such as these 0 
there is a brilliant twist ending 1 
there arent death scenes like in previous movies and the fx are terrible 0 
not much flavor to them and very poorly constructed 0 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
lordy the khao soi is a dish that is not to be missed for curry lovers 1 
it had some average acting from the main person and it was a low budget as you clearly can see 0 
i got home to see the driest damn wings ever 0 
very good product well made 1 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
its like a bad two hour tv movie 0 
i cannot believe that the actors agreed to do this film 0 
there is so much good food in vegas that i feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to rice and company 0 
there was no chemistry between ben affleck and sandra bullock in this film and i couldnt understand why he would consider even leaving his wifetobe for this chick that he supposedly was knocked out by 0 
and i really did find them funny 1 
o my gosh the best phone i have ever had 1 
it deserves strong love 1 
food was really good and i got full petty fast 1 
best fish ive ever had in my life 1 
things happen characters personalities change plot twists occur for no real reason other than that script calls for it 0 
dont go here 0 
nobody identifies with these characters because theyre all cardboard cutouts and stereotypes or predictably reversestereotypes 0 
and the sound quality is great 1 
the most annoying thing about cover girl is the way in which rita hayworth is put up on a pedestal 0 
however i recently watched the whole thing again on dvd and i was completely struck by how extremely stupid the storyline was how it contained holes inconsistencies and frankly a whole lot of crap and how horrid the dancing was 0 
i would have given no star if i was able 0 
dont buy it 0 
it has all the features i want 1 
magical help 1 
it is light has plenty of battery capacity and is very confortable to wear for somewhat extended periods of time 1 
its been my choice headset for yearsgreat sound good volume good noise cancellation 1 
for that its worth checking out 1 
this place is handsdown one of the best places to eat in the phoenix metro area 1 
after my phone got to be about a year old its been slowly breaking despite much care on my part 0 
ive dropped my phone more times than i can say even on concrete and my phone is still great knock on wood 1 
not only did the software do a great job of this i could also make my own ringtones form my existing cds without an internet connection 1 
i know that sounds funny but to me it seemed like sketchy technology that wouldnt work wellwell this one works great 1 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
yes its that bad 0 
id rather eat airline food seriously 0 
horrible phone 0 
the desserts were a bit strange 0 
the whole experience was underwhelming and i think well just go to ninja sushi next time 0 
gotta love those closeups of slimy drooling teeth 1 
i got it because it was so small and adorable 1 
internet is excrutiatingly slow 0 
also the fries are without a doubt the worst fries ive ever had 0 
product is useless since it does not have enough charging current to charge the 2 cellphones i was planning to use it with 0 
a very charming film with wonderful sentiment and heart 1 
excellent product 1 
the attention given to every character and complex psychological portrayals detailing loyalty treachery love and hope are tremendous 1 
does everything it should and more 1 
dont buy it 0 
by far the best cheesecurds we have ever had 1 
i went on motorolas website and followed all directions but could not get it to pair again 0 
will not be back 0 
it was pretty gross 0 
i am far from a sushi connoisseur but i can definitely tell the difference between good food and bad food and this was certainly bad food 0 
always a great time at dos gringos 1 
i gave it 5 stars then and im giving it 5 stars now 1 
dont bother coming here 0 
he owns the film just as spacek owned coal miners daughter and quaid owned great balls of fire 1 
does not work 0 
its a piece of crap 0 
bought mainly for the charger which broke soon after purchasing 0 
the attempts at humor were pitiful and story is so awful it dosent bear thinking about which basically involves a vulcan stealing the enterprise to find god seriously i just didnt care about any of this film and oh not to mention uhura does a belly dance to distract male guards 0 
that one didnt work either 0 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
i literally vomited while watching this film 0 
the building itself seems pretty neat the bathroom is pretty trippy but i wouldnt eat here again 0 
the story is beyond stupid 0 
an instant classic with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits 1 
the instruction manual is lacking 0 
i had to go to a store and bought a new nokia phone which is working great 1 
the visual effects were awful 0 
nonlinear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well 1 
logitech bluetooth headset is a 10 1 
awesome service and food 1 
went for lunch service was slow 0 
if you have not seen this movie i definitely recommend it 1 
very bad performance plays angela bennett a computer expert who is at home all the time 0 
sooooo good 1 
i wasnt expecting oscar material but this 0 
tied to charger for conversations lasting more than 45 minutesmajor problems 0 
i did not expect this to be so good 1 
this is one of peter watkins most accessible films 1 
spend your money and time some place else 0 
each track commands sentiment actually contributing to the scenes and characters 1 
i exchanged the sony ericson z500a for this and im pretty happy with that decision 1 
its a sad movie but very good 1 
editing the editing of this film was phenomenal in my opinion 1 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
we got the food and apparently they have never heard of salt and the batter on the fish was chewy 0 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
in fact its hard to remember that the part of ray charles is being acted and not played by the man himself 1 
nine out of ten for a truly lovely film 1 
there is nothing privileged about workingeating there 0 
nothing special 0 
before i go in to why i gave a 1 star rating please know that this was my third time eating at bachi burger before writing a review 0 
worst ever 0 
the service here leaves a lot to be desired 0 
i guess that nobody at the network that aired this dribble watched it before putting it on 0 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
soggy and not good 0 
all of the main players are mesmerising 1 
service is also cute 1 
both actors truly understand and become their particular character delivering a convincing sincere performance 1 
great food and great service in a clean and friendly setting 1 
voice recognition is tremendous 1 
i work in the hospitality industry in paradise valley and have refrained from recommending cibo any longer 0 
i am far from a sushi connoisseur but i can definitely tell the difference between good food and bad food and this was certainly bad food 0 
great phone 1 
waste of 13 bucks 0 
the first time i ever came here i had an amazing experience i still tell people how awesome the duck was 1 
it doesnt make you look cool 0 
this was a different cut than the piece the other day but still wonderful and tender s well as well flavored 1 
the only thing really worth watching was the scenery and the house because it is beautiful 1 
this would not even be good as a made for tv flick 0 
its just lame 0 
fits comfortably came with three sizes of earbud tips 1 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
but i definitely would not eat here again 0 
i rather enjoyed it 1 
i will come back here every time im in vegas 1 
poorly contstruct hinge 0 
it is indescribably the most annoying and idiotic show i have ever seen 0 
again no plot at all 0 
i dont have very many words to say about this place but it does everything pretty well 1 
to be honest with you this is unbelievable nonsense and very foolish 0 
your staff spends more time talking to themselves than me 0 
instead we got a bore fest about a whiny spoiled brat babysitting 0 
this film and i use that word loosely is an insult to the moviegoing public 0 
if you dont find it too bad as again the unit comes with one earpad onlyi would not recommend this to anyone 0 
so i am here to warn youdo not rent this movie it is the dumbest thing you have never seen 0 
we had a group of 70 when we claimed we would only have 40 and they handled us beautifully 1 
i asked multiple times for the wine list and after some time of being ignored i went to the hostess and got one myself 0 
i paid the bill but did not tip because i felt the server did a terrible job 0 
my order was not correct 0 
loved itfriendly servers great food wonderful and imaginative menu 1 
returned 8 hours later 0 
i asked multiple times for the wine list and after some time of being ignored i went to the hostess and got one myself 0 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
it felt too light and tinny 0 
later i found myself lost in the power of the film 1 
i thought it was bad 0 
you can watch them preparing the delicious food 1 
much more interesting more action more suspense and less of the unneeded controversy 1 
the only place good for this film is in the garbage 0 
if you stay in vegas you must get breakfast here at least once 1 
this fixes all the problems 1 
my salad had a bland vinegrette on the baby greens and hearts of palm 0 
not a good item it worked for a while then started having problems in my auto reverse tape player 0 
this place is great 1 
the macarons here are insanely good 1 
the first thing that happened was that the tracking was off 0 
i wouldnt return 0 
this movie is a good and humorous comment on life in 2006 1 
great movie 1 
the sets especially designed to work with the camera are amazingstylized beautiful and effective 1 
the whole experience was underwhelming and i think well just go to ninja sushi next time 0 
service is quick and friendly 1 
excellent dualpurpose headset 1 
im a big fan of this series mostly due to anne rices style sensitivities and treatments 1 
but whatever it was that cost them so much it didnt translate to quality thats for sure 0 
i only hear garbage for audio 0 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
unfortunately it will not recharge my iphone 4s despite connecting it from multiple power sources imac external battery wall outlet etc 0 
if she had not rolled the eyes we may have stayed not sure if we will go back and try it again 0 
price is good too 1 
what happened next was prettyoff putting 0 
warning do not buy 0 
the characters are interesting and you really care for them 1 
what i really like there is the crepe station 1 
if there is a wind it is completely useless 0 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
total brunch fail 0 
ambience is perfect 1 
it deserves strong love 1 
its this pandering to the audience that sabotages most of his films 0 
wed definitely go back here again 1 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
the movie is not completely perfect but titta di girolamo will stay with you for a long time after the vision of the movie 1 
the shower area is outside so you can only rinse not take a full shower unless you dont mind being nude for everyone to see 0 
great product 1 
the acting as youd expect from this cast is top notch 1 
i still maintain that monkeys shouldnt make headphones we just obviously dont share enough dna to copy the design over to humans 0 
the seller is very understanding and patient i would definitely buy from them again 1 
think it over when you plan to own this onethis sure is the last moto phone for me 0 
if you see it you should probably just leave it on the shelf 0 
do not purchase this phone 0 
a great way to finish a great 1 
its hard not to fall headoverheels in love with that girl 1 
i was very disappointed in the movie 0 
the volume switch rocketed out of the unit to a destination unknown 0 
the best electronics of the available fm transmitters 1 
as for the service im a fan because its quick and youre being served by some nice folks 1 
this place receives stars for their appetizers 1 
made very sturdy 1 
as for the mains also uninspired 0 
this may be the only bad film he ever made 0 
reversible plug works great 1 
the food amazing 1 
omg i felt like i had never eaten thai food until this dish 1 
i paid the bill but did not tip because i felt the server did a terrible job 0 
then theres the plot holes 0 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
this place is overpriced not consistent with their boba and it really is overpriced 0 
everything from acting to cinematography was solid 1 
and the accents are absolutely abysmal 0 
it was that year however that reminded us that huston was still at the top of his game as evinced by his faithful adaptation of james joyces acclaimed novella the dead 1 
i wasnt really impressed with strip steak 0 
i guess i liked the details of his dysfunctionhe was believable 1 
but despite these few flaws this case is of exceptional quality and well worth the additional costs of owning an official oem product 1 
i had heard good things about this place but it exceeding every hope i could have dreamed of 1 
hackneyed writing certainly but made even worse by the bad directing 0 
i will not return 0 
rip off over charge shipping 0 
omg i felt like i had never eaten thai food until this dish 1 
i really enjoyed eating here 1 
avoid at any and all costs 0 
but now i was completely grossed out 0 
i got the car charger and not even after a week the charger was brokeni went to plug it in and it started smoking 0 
i am a fan of his this movie sucked really bad 0 
but other than that the movie seemed to drag and the heroes didnt really work for their freedom 0 
nice ambiance 1 
good case 1 
due to this happening on every call i was forced to stop using this headset 0 
i also didnt like the on button it felt like it would crack with use 0 
the sound quality is good and functionality is awesome 1 
easy to use 1 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
this movie is greatespecially if you enjoy visual arts 1 
not much seafood and like 5 strings of pasta at the bottom 0 
trouble is the writing and directing make it impossible to establish those things that make a movie watchable like character story theme and so on 0 
the servers went back and forth several times not even so much as an are you being helped 0 
the staff are also very friendly and efficient 1 
oh yeah and the storyline was pathetic too 0 
the dialogue is composed of things that make little sense 0 
insults profound deuchebaggery and had to go outside for a smoke break while serving just to solidify it 0 
worthwhile 1 
perhaps i caught them on an off night judging by the other reviews but im not inspired to go back 0 
the puppets look really cheesy not in a good way like in the puppet master 80s flicks 0 
service is quick and even to go orders are just like we like it 1 
highly recommended a 1 
if you are razr owneryou must have this 1 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
was not happy 0 
excellent short film 1 
the ending is so so perfect youll shed a tear 1 
awesome service and food 1 
yet plantronincs continues to use the same flawed charger design 0 
the films sole bright spot was jonah hill who will look almost unrecognizable to fans of the recent superbad due to the amount of weight he lost in the interim 1 
i had verizon 2 years ago and really liked their service 1 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
i was not happy with this item 0 
there are so many problems i dont know where to start 0 
omg i felt like i had never eaten thai food until this dish 1 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
the structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema 1 
we have gotten a lot of compliments on it 1 
this is cool because most cases are just open there allowing the screen to get all scratched up 1 
very good quality though 1 
lucy bell is so much higher than this crap and for her to sink this low is quite depressing 0 
the scallop dish is quite appalling for value as well 0 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
good show samsung 1 
later i found myself lost in the power of the film 1 
perabo has a nice energy level and is obviously very comfortable in front of a camera 1 
the only thing i wasnt too crazy about was their guacamole as i dont like it puréed 0 
we would recommend these to others 1 
but if you liked movies like the matrix and better yet their sequels i think youll appreciate the thought provoking mindblowing experience this film will give you 1 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
its so bad its actually worth seeing just for that reason 0 
i find wasting food to be despicable but this just wasnt food 0 
this is by far the worst purchase ive made on amazon 0 
lastly the mozzarella sticks they were the best thing we ordered 1 
call me a nut but i think this is one of the best movies ever 1 
its a piece of crap 0 
i received my supposedly new motorola 375 and apparently there was not a match between the phone and the charger 0 
the pan cakes everyone are raving about taste like a sugary disaster tailored to the palate of a six year old 0 
mediocre food 0 
babie bop is very cute 1 
the film has great actors a master director a significant themeat least a wouldbe significant theme undertone of fifties existential worldweariness aerial scenes that ought to have thrilled both senses and imagination and characters about which one might deeply care 1 
it looked like a wonderful story 1 
with great sound effects and impressive special effects i cant recommend this movie enough 1 
this results in the phone being either stuck at max volume or mute 0 
i exchanged the sony ericson z500a for this and im pretty happy with that decision 1 
this product had a strong rubberpetroleum smell that was unbearable after a while and caused me to return it 0 
so i basically threw my money out the window for nothing 0 
finally after three or four times the spring of the latch broke and i could not use it any longer on the visor 0 
i would give this television series a 10 plus if i could 1 
it is light easy to use and has very clear reception and transmission 1 
very disappointed 0 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
things happen characters personalities change plot twists occur for no real reason other than that script calls for it 0 
i received my orders well within the shipping timeframe everything was in good working order and overall i am very excited to have this source 1 
gotta love those closeups of slimy drooling teeth 1 
the pizza selections are good 1 
it has been a winner for us 1 
i hate movies like that 0 
bad script bad direction and horrible acting make this one plain bad 0 
its quite simply the highest most superlative form of cinema imaginable 1 
the ambiance was incredible 1 
very very fun chef 1 
my brother in law who works at the mall ate here same day and guess what he was sick all night too 0 
good value works fine power via usb car or wall outlet 1 
the earpiece on this is too large or too heavyit keeps falling out of my ear 0 
it is worth the drive 1 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
tied to charger for conversations lasting more than 45 minutesmajor problems 0 
it was just too horrible 0 
the design might be ergonomic in theory but i could not stand having these in my ear 0 
that said our mouths and bellies were still quite pleased 1 
best fish ive ever had in my life 1 
ordered a double cheeseburger got a single patty that was falling apart picture uploaded yeah still sucks 0 
it fits so securely that the ear hook does not even need to be used and the sound is better directed through your ear canal 1 
worst customer service ever 0 
the attention given to every character and complex psychological portrayals detailing loyalty treachery love and hope are tremendous 1 
ive had this bluetoooth headset for some time now and still not comfortable with the way it fits on the ear 0 
wow what a bad film 0 
i got home to see the driest damn wings ever 0 
it was clear that she had the range and ability to pull off this part 1 
items stated as included from the description are not included 0 
im big fan of rpg games too but this movie its a disgrace to any selfrespecting rpger there is 0 
the story is also both funny and poignant at times 1 
lot of holes in the plot theres nothing about how he became the emperor nothing about where he spend 20 years between his childhood and mature age 0 
the burger had absolutely no flavor the meat itself was totally bland the burger was overcooked and there was no charcoal flavor 0 
the cable looks so thin and flimsy it is scary 0 
when my order arrived one of the gyros was missing 0 
thank you for such great service 1 
as many people complained i found this headsets microphone was very weak 0 
predictable but not a bad watch 1 
the voice recognition thru the handset is excellent 1 
the only thing that i think could improve is the sound leaks out from the headset 0 
excellent sound quality 1 
the best example of how dumb the writing is when its established that you can turn the zombiestudents back into humans by removing a necklace containing a piece of the meteorite 0 
both rickman and stowe play their roles to the hilt in this tale of a childrens book writer who maybe has written a subversive tract 1 
they are so easy to love but even more easy to identify with 1 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
trouble is the writing and directing make it impossible to establish those things that make a movie watchable like character story theme and so on 0 
it was a bit too sweet not really spicy enough and lacked flavor 0 
lifetime does not air it enough so if anyone knows what store sells it let me know because this is a musthave 1 
then a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use 0 
it is worth the drive 1 
the spaghetti is nothing special whatsoever 0 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
a happy wonderful feel good ending 1 
wasted two hours 0 
the noise shield is incrediable 1 
the characters are interesting even if a bit predictable 1 
go watch it 1 
the worst piece of crap ever along with the verizon customer service 0 
appetite instantly gone 0
