now you know why i gave it a 10 1 
i could care less the interior is just beautiful 1 
the steak and the shrimp are in my opinion the best entrees at gc 1 
not as good as i had hoped 0 
i let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this bad idea we both hated it 0 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
that being said for a phone the camera is very nice many cool effects to play with and video is decent as well 1 
the only suspense i was feeling was the frustration at just how retarded the girls were 0 
theres also enough hypocrisy in this film to make me vomit 0 
the pizza selections are good 1 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
characters are onedimensional even the good guys and especially the bad guys 0 
at a time when it seems that film animation has been dominated by disneypixars cgi masterpieces it is both refreshing and comforting to know that miyazaki is still relying on traditional handdrawn animation to tell his charming and enchanting stories 1 
the servers went back and forth several times not even so much as an are you being helped 0 
you wont be disappointed 1 
gets a signal when other verizon phones wont 1 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
tied to charger for conversations lasting more than 45 minutesmajor problems 0 
worst customer service ever 0 
the plastic breaks really easy on this clip 0 
an hour seriously 0 
the screen size is big key pad lit well enough and the camera quality is excellent for a camera phone 1 
awsome device works great 1 
i was particularly pleased with the acting ability of dwight schultz 1 
the classic maine lobster roll was fantastic 1 
essentially you can forget microsofts tech support 0 
it looked like a wonderful story 1 
it rocked my world and is certainly a must see for anyone with no social or physical outlets 1 
the results well are a shame 0 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
best tater tots in the southwest 1 
at any rate this film stinks its not funny and fulci should have stayed with giallo and supernatural zombie movies 0 
youll love it 1 
the potato chip order was sad i could probably count how many chips were in that box and it was probably around 12 0 
the seasonal fruit was fresh white peach puree 1 
i have had tmobile service for 2 or 3 years now and i am pretty happy with it 1 
cool phone 1 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
damian is so talented and versatile in so many ways of writing and portraying different characters on screen 1 
i think i was one of the people who found this another one of roths pearls 1 
no one at the table thought the food was above average or worth the wait that we had for it 0 
it really is impressive that the place hasnt closed down 0 
so i bought about 10 of these and saved alot of money 1 
i saw this short film on hbo the other day and absolutely loved it 1 
i loved it it was really scary 1 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
oh the charger seems to work fine 1 
perhaps i caught them on an off night judging by the other reviews but im not inspired to go back 0 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
as a sushi lover avoid this place by all means 0 
i am very impressed with the job that motorola did on the sturdiness of this phone 1 
they refuse to refund or replace 0 
it is the best charger i have seen on the market yet 1 
i paid the bill but did not tip because i felt the server did a terrible job 0 
will order from them again 1 
i love lane but ive never seen her in a movie this lousy 0 
but in terms of the writing its very fresh and bold 1 
unfortunately inexperience of direction meant that scene after scene passed with little in the way of dramatic tension or conflict 0 
but this movie is definitely a below average rent 0 
i do love sushi but i found kabuki to be overpriced overhip and underservices 0 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
the jabra eargels fit my ears very well 1 
i guess that nobody at the network that aired this dribble watched it before putting it on 0 
it was not good 0 
i really wanted the plantronics 510 to be the right one but it has too many issues for methe good 0 
all i have to say is the food was amazing 1 
in addition it feels amp looks as if the phone is all lightweight cheap plastic 0 
also the fries are without a doubt the worst fries ive ever had 0 
its pretty surprising that this wonderful film was made in 1949 as hollywood generally had its collective heads in the sand concerning black and white issues at that time 1 
the ambiance was incredible 1 
i am not a filmmaker nor am i a director but i would hide my head in the sand if id spent whatever amount of money and time on this movie 0 
i vomited in the bathroom mid lunch 0 
awesome device 1 
after all the rave reviews i couldnt wait to eat herewhat a disappointment 0 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
this movie does an excellent job of revealing the complexity of the task and the incredible challenges facing south africa 1 
he really didnt seem to want to be hosting his voiceovers were monotonous didnt get involved with the guests 0 
i think the most wonderful parts literally full of wonder are the excerpts from his works 1 
ive had no trouble accessing the internet downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions 1 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
a good time 1 
but despite these few flaws this case is of exceptional quality and well worth the additional costs of owning an official oem product 1 
this second appearance of mickey mouse following the silent plane crazy earlier that year is probably his most famous filmmostly because it was so groundbreaking 1 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
i love that they put their food in nice plastic containers as opposed to cramming it in little paper takeout boxes 1 
but then they came back cold 0 
i was disgusted because i was pretty sure that was human hair 0 
this may be the only bad film he ever made 0 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
worst ever 0 
its fits like a glove and is strong secure and durable 1 
i probably wont be coming back here 0 
this isnt a small family restaurant this is a fine dining establishment 1 
the movie showed a lot of florida at its best made it look very appealing 1 
it was a great phone 1 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
what did bother me was the slow service 0 
i enjoyed reading this book to my children when they were little 1 
it was a pale color instead of nice and char and has no flavor 0 
a very good film indeed about great and unconditional love 1 
that one didnt work either 0 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
the 12 mega pixel camera being a part of a phone is reasonably good7 1 
useless phone simply deaf 0 
this isnt a small family restaurant this is a fine dining establishment 1 
it is light easy to use and has very clear reception and transmission 1 
great pizza and salads 1 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
not good for the money 0 
works great 1 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
the performances are real and gripping the crocdodile is extremely well done indeed if the black water website is to be believed thats because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous 1 
i let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this bad idea we both hated it 0 
horrible 0 
works fine 1 
this is a good joint 1 
a fly was in my apple juice a fly 0 
but the movie makes a lot of serious mistakes 0 
but the duet between the astronaut and his doctor at the beginning of the movie is a perfect exchange if one considers that this movie was made well into the cold war and the astronauts biggest fear is that he has crashed in the ussr 1 
the mic is great 1 
i have had problems wit hit dropping signal and more 0 
very good quality though 1 
this place lacked style 0 
i highly recommend this case 1 
pretty good beer selection too 1 
constantine gives everything the right intensity and seems to have a good understanding of the underlying psychological motivations 1 
the price is reasonable and the service is great 1 
service sucks 0 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
i really do recommend this place you can go wrong with this donut place 1 
well packaged arrived on time and works as intended 1 
performed awful muffled tinny incoming sound and severe echo for those on the other end of the call 0 
i highly recommend this device to everyone 1 
great service and food 1 
dont bother go to the store 0 
disappointing 0 
due to this happening on every call i was forced to stop using this headset 0 
the manager was the worst 0 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
be sure to order dessert even if you need to pack it togo the tiramisu and cannoli are both to die for 1 
it is just the sort of pap that is screened in the afternoon to punish the unemployed for not having jobs 0 
i love the look and feel of samsung flipphones 1 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
his performance is simply genius 1 
as a courtroom drama its compelling as an indictment on the american justice system its frightening 1 
it isnt even an achievement as a sobaditsgood or sobaditsmemorable movie 0 
the descriptions said yum yum sauce and another said eel sauce yet another said spicy mayowell none of the rolls had sauces on them 0 
do not buy if you want to use the holster 0 
they have great dinners 1 
poor sound quality 0 
i would advise to not purchase this item it never worked very well 0 
this place is like chipotle but better 1 
but the actingeven that of such professionals as drago and debbie rochonwas terrible the directing worse perhaps contributory to the former the dialog chimplike and the camera work barely tolerable 0 
service was very prompt 1 
2 thumbs up 1 
the attention given to every character and complex psychological portrayals detailing loyalty treachery love and hope are tremendous 1 
well im satisfied 1 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
you wont regret it 1 
another note about this phones appearance is that it really looks rather bland especially in the all black model 0 
the food wasnt good 0 
the scenes are often funny and occasionally touching as the characters evaluate their lives and where they are going 1 
everyone is very attentive providing excellent customer service 1 
the memories are murky but i can only say that i enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show 1 
it is not good 0 
plug was the wrong size 0 
the scallop dish is quite appalling for value as well 0 
always a great time at dos gringos 1 
the price was very good and with the free shipping and all it was a good purchase 1 
in other words the content level of this film is enough to easily fill a dozen other films 1 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
del taco is pretty nasty and should be avoided if possible 0 
and finally after all that we get to an ending that wouldve been great had it been handled by competent people and not jerry falwell 0 
john garfield ann revere lilli plmer william conrad canada leeand filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screenjames wong howe 1 
i was not impressed by this product 0 
now this is a movie i really dislike 0 
better than new 1 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
good item low price 1 
long whiny and pointless 0 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
to summarize the food was incredible nay transcendant but nothing brings me joy quite like the memory of the pneumatic condiment dispenser 1 
its an empty hollow shell of a movie 0 
this movie is possibly one of the most creative works of horror ever 1 
but in terms of the writing its very fresh and bold 1 
it was not good 0 
im using it with an iriver spinn with case and it fits fine 1 
as i said abovepretty useless 0 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
the warm beer didnt help 0 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
the pizza selections are good 1 
you never know if you pushed it hard enough or the right number of times for the function you want or not 0 
2 thumbs up 1 
would recommend this item 1 
talk about useless customer service 0 
there are many continuity errors one other user commented on different cars in the garage joes glassesthe one that got to me the most was the fact joes facial hair configuration seemed to change from scene to scene 0 
nevertheless yet another wonderful film from the great masters stable 1 
this gets a 1 out of 10 simply because theres nothing lower 0 
bt50 battery junk 0 
its pretty easy 1 
lasted one day and then blew up 0 
i loved their mussels cooked in this wine reduction the duck was tender and their potato dishes were delicious 1 
the incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film 1 
as for the service i thought it was good 1 
however paul schrader has indeed made a film about mishima that is both superb complex 1 
very disappointed in accessoryone 0 
never got it 0 
the crêpe was delicate and thin and moist 1 
but storm trooper is not even bad enough to make it to the list of wonderfully terrible movies 0 
brilliance indeed 1 
this is definitely a cult classic well worth viewing and sharing with others 1 
highly recommended 1 
i am so pleased to know such a modern day genius is out there letting is passion for art drive him and taking us as an audience with him 1 
the food is very good for your typical bar food 1 
at first glance it is a lovely bakery cafe nice ambiance clean friendly staff 1 
this one works and was priced right 1 
will definitely be back 1 
item does not match picture 0 
happy so far 1 
you wont regret it 1 
i had ordered a motorola data cable got a very well finished and working product 1 
bluetooth range is good a few days ago i left my phone in the trunk got a call and carried the conversation without a hitch 1 
i promise they wont disappoint 1 
the seasonal fruit was fresh white peach puree 1 
it is so small and you dont even realize that it is there after a while of getting used to it 1 
absolutel junk 0 
this is a really fantastic thai restaurant which is definitely worth a visit 1 
cooked to perfection and the service was impeccable 1 
i was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar not only because the quality is great but the service is fast and the food impeccable 1 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
i had the mac salad and it was pretty bland so i will not be getting that again 0 
this is not moviemaking 0 
all i can do is whine on the internet so here it goesthe more i use the thing the less i like it 0 
my friend did not like his bloody mary 0 
very dissapointing performance 0 
food was delicious 1 
the service was meh 0 
my ribeye steak was cooked perfectly and had great mesquite flavor 1 
so far so good 1 
the acting is like watching wooden puppets moving around and reading from a book thats how bad it is 0 
plus its only 8 bucks 1 
the plot such as it is is so derivative and predictable that the ending is like a mercy killing 0 
hot dishes are not hot cold dishes are close to room tempi watched staff prepare food with bare hands no gloveseverything is deep fried in oil 0 
my only problem is i thought the actor playing the villain was a low rent michael ironside 0 
this is one of the better buffets that i have been to 1 
so they performed 1 
the script is bad very bad  it contains both cheesiness and unethical joke that you normally see in rated r or nc17 movie 0 
the basic premise is wasted since it is sidelined by the inexplicable focus on the documentary crew 0 
my first visit to hiro was a delight 1 
the only thing worse than taylors acting was stanwycks singing 0 
great software for motorolas 1 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
the camera on the phone may be used as a dustpan when indoors id rather be using a disposable then this 0 
i had to go to a store and bought a new nokia phone which is working great 1 
i wish i could enter negative values admins 0 
i really like this product over the motorola because it is allot clearer on the ear piece and the mic 1 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
the worst piece of crap ever along with the verizon customer service 0 
it was horrible 0 
do not buy do not buyit sucks 0 
imdb ratings only go as low 1 for awful its time to get some negative numbers in there for cases such as these 0 
the most annoying thing about cover girl is the way in which rita hayworth is put up on a pedestal 0 
the characters are fleshed out surprisingly well particularly grimes and blake and all the actors deliver their sharply scripted lines with just the right amount of deadpan tongue in cheek to make the dialogue both hilarious and realistic 1 
worked great 1 
great software for motorolas 1 
it probably would have been better if the director hadnt spent most of the movie showcasing his own art work which really isnt that noteworthy 0 
i really loved the story line and the poler bear was kinda cutebut if anyone has a question about fort steele just ask away 1 
i totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is 1 
utterly without merit on any level this is akin to torture 0 
very friendly staff 1 
i have to mention this and it is a huge spoiler i loved the ending how all the characters of the three films were the remaining survivors of the ferry disaster with valentine and the young judge together and the old man watching it on her tv solidifying his happiness over the suffering which he dealt with for those many years 1 
i will not return 0 
and the beans and rice were mediocre at best 0 
i would definitely recommend the jabra bt250v for those who are looking for comfort clarity and a great price 1 
it even has its sweet moments 1 
just spicy enough perfect actually 1 
ive missed numerous calls because of this reason 0 
that being said for a phone the camera is very nice many cool effects to play with and video is decent as well 1 
1 hour 54 minutes of sheer tedium melodrama and horrible acting a mess of a script and a sinking feeling of good lord what were they thinking 0 
plug was the wrong size 0 
i ate there twice on my last visit and especially enjoyed the salmon salad 1 
we literally sat there for 20 minutes with no one asking to take our order 0 
the mic there is a joke and the volume is quite low 0 
i tried the cape cod ravoli chickenwith cranberrymmmm 1 
its a gloriously fun fast paced and fairly accurate portrayal of the night of a raver 1 
worked great 1 
both of the egg rolls were fantastic 1 
trying to make a call on these is an exercise in frustration 0 
everything about this product is wrongfirst 0 
unreliable im giving up 0 
the concert sequences just sucked 0 
do not waste your time 0 
still waiting im sure this item would work well if i ever recieve it 0 
we wont be going back anytime soon 0 
the characters are interesting and you want to find out more about them the longer the movie goes on and i think people will be surprised by who does and doesnt make it 1 
you get incredibly fresh fish prepared with care 1 
see it with your kids if you have a chanceit will open up some amazing dialog about how far race relations have come in the last 50 years 1 
the scenes are often funny and occasionally touching as the characters evaluate their lives and where they are going 1 
if that bug never showed up i would have given a 4 for sure but on the other side of the wall where this bug was climbing was the kitchen 0 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
im so happy to be here 1 
wed definitely go back here again 1 
the acting was bad 0 
will go back next trip out 1 
hackneyed writing certainly but made even worse by the bad directing 0 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
this is probably one of the least effective and utterly unoriginal films i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
unless youre just out to visually collect all extant films of austens work you can skip this one 0 
disappointing accessory from a good manufacturer 0 
there is a totally unnecessary trainroller coaster scene 0 
poor construction 0 
see it 1 
waitress was good though 1 
but above all the exquisite visual composition of each moment with inventive and elegant use of closeup camera angle and lighting including pointillistic faux home movie footage is a wonder and joy to behold 1 
i really like this product over the motorola because it is allot clearer on the ear piece and the mic 1 
very very fun chef 1 
great phone 1 
now we were chosen to be tortured with this disgusting piece of blatant american propaganda 0 
i guess it was supposed to be clever twist then shed some light on the situation but it was just stupid 0 
to call this movie a drama is ridiculous 0 
during several different 2 minute calls i experienced 5 drops and it was in an area that had 5 bars 0 
this is an excellent film 1 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
i searched the internet and found this one to be the best value 1 
not a pleasant voyage of selfdiscovery 0 
i could eat their bruschetta all day it is devine 1 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
this phone might well be the worst ive ever had in any brand 0 
the restaurant atmosphere was exquisite 1 
i wasted my little money with this earpiece 0 
the potatoes were like rubber and you could tell they had been made up ahead of time being kept under a warmer 0 
well packaged arrived on time and works as intended 1 
not only did the software do a great job of this i could also make my own ringtones form my existing cds without an internet connection 1 
the music in the film is really nice too 1 
of course the footage from the 70s was grainy but that only enhanced the film 1 
conclusion i loved it 1 
this place is great 1 
it was way over fried 0 
the ri style calamari was a joke 0 
very nice and relaxing late night viewing 1 
summary the witticisms werent witty 0 
this is a great product sure beats using your fingers 1 
i took back my money and got outta there 0 
has been working great 1 
this is truly an art movieit actually has a lot of art in it 1 
i have always used corded headsets and the freedom from the wireless is very helpful 1 
the phone was unusable and was not new 0 
the puppets look really cheesy not in a good way like in the puppet master 80s flicks 0 
his costars dont fare much better with people like morgan freeman jonah hill and ed helms just wasted 0 
the only thing i wasnt too crazy about was their guacamole as i dont like it puréed 0 
i heart this place 1 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
this is the place where i first had pho and it was amazing 1 
does everything it should and more 1 
brilliance indeed 1 
this place should honestly be blown up 0 
very disappointed 0 
sounds good reasonably priced and effective its that simple 1 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
the pizza selections are good 1 
waited and waited and waited 0 
youd have to have the iq of particularly stupid mollusk not to see that one coming 0 
i am very impressed with this headset from plantronics 1 
even in my bmw 3 series which is fairly quiet i have trouble hearing what the other person is saying 0 
this early film from future goremeister lucio fulci is a very good addition to the giallo subgenre 1 
one thing i hate is the mode set button at the side 0 
hot dishes are not hot cold dishes are close to room tempi watched staff prepare food with bare hands no gloveseverything is deep fried in oil 0 
the phone loads super 1 
about ten minutes into this film i started having second thoughts 0 
i had the mac salad and it was pretty bland so i will not be getting that again 0 
the steak and the shrimp are in my opinion the best entrees at gc 1 
my phone doesnt slide around my car now and the grip prevents my phone from slipping out of my hand 1 
the script is a big flawed mess 0 
the nachos are a must have 1 
you can even take self portraits with the outside exterior display very cool 1 
the incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film 1 
i love this device 1 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
motorola finally got the voice quality of a bluetooth headset right 1 
furthermore you cant even find hours of operation on the website 0 
waste of money 0 
absolutel junk 0 
i have never had such bland food which surprised me considering the article we read focused so much on their spices and flavor 0 
item arrived quickly and works great with my metro pcs samsung schr450 slider phone and sony premium sound in ear plugs 1 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
you truly take this journey through the eyes and soul of a child 1 
great pizza and salads 1 
sucked most of the stuff does not work with my phone 0 
this is infuriating 0 
used and dirty 0 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
the sound is clear and the people i talk to on it are amazed at the quality too 1 
great audio 1 
their chow mein is so good 1 
for those that havent seen it dont waste your time 0 
we had so much to say about the place before we walked in that he expected it to be amazing but was quickly disappointed 0 
the plot well i said id let that one go 0 
this is not moviemaking 0 
design flaw 0 
ill give this film 10 out of 10 1 
so for our enjoyment we get to see them run around play games and be dangerous 1 
the movie was very interesting from beginning to the end 1 
i would give this television series a 10 plus if i could 1 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
i received my headset in good time and was happy with it 1 
this does not fit the palm tungsten e2 and it broke the first time i tried to plug it in 0 
at no point in the proceedings does it look remotely like america 0 
just whatever you do avoid groove as its the antithesis of all that is good about human traffic 0 
very bad performance plays angela bennett a computer expert who is at home all the time 0 
we had so much to say about the place before we walked in that he expected it to be amazing but was quickly disappointed 0 
in particular the relationship between the bakery assistant and the waitress just didnt work for me at all 0 
special thanks to dylan t for the recommendation on what to order all yummy for my tummy 1 
left very frustrated 0 
its just lame 0 
the sweet potato fries were very good and seasoned well 1 
great food and great service in a clean and friendly setting 1 
i think i was one of the people who found this another one of roths pearls 1 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
best tater tots in the southwest 1 
on the negative its insipid enough to cause regret for another 2 hours of life wasted in front of the screen 0 
which is precisely why i am giving it such a bad review 0 
in fact im going to round up to 4 stars just because she was so awesome 1 
the cast was great 1 
we sat another ten minutes and finally gave up and left 0 
horrible had to switch 3 times 0 
the nano stated itmy son was dissapointed 0 
my only complaint is the standard sound volume is a little low even when turned up to 5of 5 0 
camerawork again bad 0 
thanks again to amazon for having the things i need for a good price 1 
our server was super nice and checked on us many times 1 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
a pretty good product 1 
there still are good actors around 1 
warning stay away 0 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
come hungry leave happy and stuffed 1 
useless phone simply deaf 0 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
the story starts too fast with absolutely no suspense or buildup in the slightest 0 
the instructions didnt explain that a microphone jack could be used 0 
they do not last forever but is not overly expensive to replaceeasy to operate and the sound is much better than others i have tried 1 
using all earpieces left or right this thing will not stay on my ear 0 
bad day or not i have a very low tolerance for rude customer service people it is your job to be nice and polite wash dishes otherwise 0 
third the cheese on my friends burger was cold 0 
good servicecheck 1 
the entire audience applauded at the conclusion of the film 1 
the seller is very understanding and patient i would definitely buy from them again 1 
best ive found so far ive tried 2 other bluetooths and this one has the best quality for both me and the listener as well as ease of using 1 
i highly recommend this modest priced cellular phone 1 
the seasonal fruit was fresh white peach puree 1 
waste your money on this game 1 
eew this location needs a complete overhaul 0 
ive never been more insulted or felt disrespected 0 
defective crap 0 
i would recommend saving room for this 1 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
this is so embarassing and also my ears hurt if i try to push the ear plug into my ear 0 
definitely worth checking out 1 
horrible dont waste your time and money 0 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
very good phone 1 
easy to use 1 
very satisifed with that 1 
i love this cable it allows me to connect any miniusb device to my pc 1 
i had strawberry tea which was good 1 
finally after three or four times the spring of the latch broke and i could not use it any longer on the visor 0 
my only problem is i thought the actor playing the villain was a low rent michael ironside 0 
this hole in the wall has great mexican street tacos and friendly staff 1 
and his subtle connections between the three films are awesome 1 
it is shameful 0 
if you want a real scare rent this one 1 
it deserves strong love 1 
wonderful lil tapas and the ambience made me feel all warm and fuzzy inside 1 
i gave it 5 stars because of the sound quality 1 
the majority of the logitech earbud headsets failed 0 
the mic is great 1 
the poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying 0 
for that price i can think of a few place i would have much rather gone 0 
not loud enough and doesnt turn on like it should 0 
i love their fries and their beans 1 
item arrived quickly and works great with my metro pcs samsung schr450 slider phone and sony premium sound in ear plugs 1 
my breakfast was perpared great with a beautiful presentation of 3 giant slices of toast lightly dusted with powdered sugar 1 
omelets are to die for 1 
spoilers whatever else can or cant be said about it surface is superbly crafted 1 
i have had problems wit hit dropping signal and more 0 
at any rate this film stinks its not funny and fulci should have stayed with giallo and supernatural zombie movies 0 
nice spicy and tender 1 
i went on motorolas website and followed all directions but could not get it to pair again 0 
but this movie is definitely a below average rent 0 
i believe that pitch black was done well 1 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
my sister has one also and she loves it 1 
the pleather case doesnt fit 0 
i had strawberry tea which was good 1 
disapointing results 0 
i cant wait to go back 1 
i think that it is a must see older john wayne film 1 
the only suspense i was feeling was the frustration at just how retarded the girls were 0 
very funny 1 
but when someone strives for greatness and poetry but delivers a muddled and often ridiculous story a bunch of disparate scenes pretentious dialogue then you get the worst kind of a movie that some other reviewer very accurately defined as pretentious crap 0 
when i placed my treo into the case not only was it not snug but there was a lot of extra room on the sides 0 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
item does not match picture 0 
very pleased with this headset 1 
easily none other cartoon made me laugh in a tender way before getting into dark sitcoms oriented for teenagers 1 
aside from its terrible lead this film has loads of other debits 0 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
it failed to convey the broad sweep of landscapes that were a great part of the original 0 
my breakfast was perpared great with a beautiful presentation of 3 giant slices of toast lightly dusted with powdered sugar 1 
the reception is excellent 1 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
in addition it feels amp looks as if the phone is all lightweight cheap plastic 0 
the pairing of the two devices was so easy it barely took a couple minutes before i started making calls with the voice dialing feature 1 
in a word it is embarrassing 0 
hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in 0 
steamboat willie is an amazingly important film to our cinema history 1 
but she is still a bad actress repeating her robotic face moves in each of her pictures 0 
went for lunch service was slow 0 
definitely worth checking out 1 
once your food arrives its meh 0 
headset works great was packaged nicely to avoid any damage 1 
today was my first taste of a buldogis gourmet hot dog and i have to tell you it was more than i ever thought possible 1 
duris has a wholesome appearance and gives a fine performance 1 
this is a great deal 1 
the phone takes forever to charge like 2 to 5 hours literally 0 
doesnt work 0 
we ordered some old classics and some new dishes after going there a few times and were sorely disappointed with everything 0 
having to humour him just to get by and get through the day was so apt 1 
not loud enough and doesnt turn on like it should 0 
it doesnt work in europe or asia 0 
also the phone doesnt seem to accept anything except cbr mp3s preferably ripped by windows media player 0 
all this movie does is make you sick watching all these slackers make excuses for their stupid actions for 90 minutes 0 
waaaaaayyyyyyyyyy over rated is all i am saying 0 
it was way over fried 0 
i have yet to run this new battery below two bars and thats three days without charging 1 
the very idea of it was lame take a minor character from a mediocre pg13 film and make a complete nonsequel while changing its tone to a pgrated family movie 0 
if there was ever a movie that needed wordofmouth to promote this is it 1 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
one character is totally annoying with a voice that gives me the feeling of fingernails on a chalkboard 0 
we ordered some old classics and some new dishes after going there a few times and were sorely disappointed with everything 0 
again no plot at all 0 
the only thing i did like was the prime rib and dessert section 1 
everything about it is just bad 0 
great price too 1 
service was exceptional and food was a good as all the reviews 1 
i love the ownerchef his one authentic japanese cool dude 1 
it also had a new problem 0 
the server was very negligent of our needs and made us feel very unwelcome i would not suggest this place 0 
see it 1 
but this movie is definitely a below average rent 0 
this place is not worth your time let alone vegas 0 
i want my money back 0 
conclusion i loved it 1 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
on the good side the staff was genuinely pleasant and enthusiastic a real treat 1 
it was also the right balance of war and love 1 
this is one of peter watkins most accessible films 1 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
nothing new there 0 
very happy with this product 1 
yes i am simplifying things here for the sake of brevity for this really is at the core of the problems with this film it has too much going on without any real fulfilling explanation 0 
now this is a movie i really dislike 0 
the best scene in the movie was when gerardo is trying to find a song that keeps running through his head 1 
while i managed to bend the leaf spring back in place the metal now has enough stress that it will break on the next drop 0 
tied to charger for conversations lasting more than 45 minutesmajor problems 0 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
the service was outshining i definitely recommend the halibut 1 
sending it back 0 
bad reception 0 
this was one of the worst films i have ever seen 0 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
worthless product 0 
youd have to have the iq of particularly stupid mollusk not to see that one coming 0 
my fiancé and i came in the middle of the day and we were greeted and seated right away 1 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
i might have gotten a defect but i would not risk buying it again because of the built quality alone 0 
in my house i was getting dropped coverage upstairs and no coverage in my basement 0 
on the up side their cafe serves really good food 1 
its the one movie that never ceases to interest me simply because it keeps me alert as i try to attempt to decipher its meanings 1 
this really is how vegas fine dining used to be right down to the menus handed to the ladies that have no prices listed 1 
before i go in to why i gave a 1 star rating please know that this was my third time eating at bachi burger before writing a review 0 
so flavorful and has just the perfect amount of heat 1 
meredith m was better than all right 1 
went in for happy hour great list of wines 1 
the lead man is charismafree 0 
i wish i could return the unit and get back my money 0 
will definitely be back 1 
the foreigner is not worth one second of your time 0 
this item is fantastic and works perfectly 1 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
even if you love bad movies do not watch this movie 0 
after the first charge kept going dead after 12 minutes 0 
anyways the food was definitely not filling at all and for the price you pay you should expect more 0 
the buffet at bellagio was far from what i anticipated 0 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
nine out of ten for a truly lovely film 1 
highly recommend for any one who has a blue tooth phone 1 
overall i rate this movie a 10 out of a 110 scale 1 
clear skype calls long battery life long range 1 
its like a really sexy party in your mouth where youre outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party 1 
best headset ever 1 
omg i felt like i had never eaten thai food until this dish 1 
you can even take self portraits with the outside exterior display very cool 1 
fast service 1 
the seasonal fruit was fresh white peach puree 1 
my headset works just peachykeen 1 
i agree with jessica this movie is pretty bad 0 
its a sad movie but very good 1 
food was good service was good prices were good 1 
if you plan to use this in a car forget about it 0 
im using it with an iriver spinn with case and it fits fine 1 
this movie contained an allstar cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i havent seen before 1 
but it picked up speed and got right to the point 1 
there is nothing authentic about this place 0 
by the time the film ended i not only disliked it i despised it 0 
good price 1 
first off the reception sucks i have never had more than 2 bars ever 0 
love the margaritas too 1 
the only very disappointing thing was there was no speakerphone 0 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
the only thing that i think could improve is the sound leaks out from the headset 0 
the majority of the logitech earbud headsets failed 0 
nothing new there 0 
in an interesting part of town this place is amazing 1 
i was not impressed by this product 0 
the stories were powerful explorations of the nature of man and of art 1 
he was very impressed when going from the original battery to the extended battery 1 
stay away from the q 0 
another note about this phones appearance is that it really looks rather bland especially in the all black model 0 
now this dish was quite flavourful 1 
the movie is littered with overt racial slurs towards the black cast members and in return the whites are depicted as morons and boobs 0 
works like a charm it work the same as the one i got with the phone 1 
also difficult to put onid recommend avoiding this product 0 
saw the movie today and thought it was a good effort good messages for kids 1 
if that bug never showed up i would have given a 4 for sure but on the other side of the wall where this bug was climbing was the kitchen 0 
i did not bother contacting the company for few dollar product but i learned the lesson that i should not have bought this form online anyway 0 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
the awful dialogue and hopeless overacting by everyone who gets shot top off a real waste of space and time 0 
and there wasnt a single sour note struck actingwise either some surprisingly solid casting here 1 
if you are razr owneryou must have this 1
