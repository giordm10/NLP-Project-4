this would not even be good as a made for tv flick 0 
the service was outshining i definitely recommend the halibut 1 
all the pretty pictures in the world cannot make up for a piece of work that is flawed at the core 0 
also difficult to put onid recommend avoiding this product 0 
these are fabulous 1 
i liked it 1 
my order was not correct 0 
i really loved the story line and the poler bear was kinda cutebut if anyone has a question about fort steele just ask away 1 
great phone 1 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
in a word it is embarrassing 0 
so far it has worked like a charm 1 
i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
i liked the patio and the service was outstanding 1 
they have a plethora of salads and sandwiches and everything ive tried gets my seal of approval 1 
works great 1 
the camera on the phone may be used as a dustpan when indoors id rather be using a disposable then this 0 
its just lame 0 
it never condescends all the characters have good genuine hearts and believable problems 1 
plus its only 8 bucks 1 
nice case feels good in your hands 1 
the dialogue sucked 0 
and finally after all that we get to an ending that wouldve been great had it been handled by competent people and not jerry falwell 0 
stay away from the q 0 
it is practically useless and did not add any kind of boost to my reception after i bought it 0 
plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job 1 
a must study for anyone interested in the worst sins of industrial design 0 
the only thing that i think could improve is the sound leaks out from the headset 0 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
i want to first say our server was great and we had perfect service 1 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
the story line is totally predictable 0 
dont waste your time here 0 
love this headset 1 
it is practically useless and did not add any kind of boost to my reception after i bought it 0 
if you dont find it too bad as again the unit comes with one earpad onlyi would not recommend this to anyone 0 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
i cant believe theres even a sequel to this 0 
this is one of peter watkins most accessible films 1 
it is cheap and it feel and look just as cheap 0 
the very idea of it was lame take a minor character from a mediocre pg13 film and make a complete nonsequel while changing its tone to a pgrated family movie 0 
appears to actually outperform the original battery from china that came with my v325i 1 
so just beware 0 
my boyfriend tried the mediterranean chicken salad and fell in love 1 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
sounds good reasonably priced and effective its that simple 1 
this place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver 0 
started watching this but didnt believe in any of the characters 0 
it was equally awful 0 
it was too predictable even for a chick flick 0 
i love this phone it is very handy and has a lot of features 1 
the live music on fridays totally blows 0 
i was hoping for more 0 
conclusion very filling meals 1 
last time buying from you 0 
personally i think it shows that people should learn to find a compromise them self without involving other people into issue 1 
but its just not funny 0 
this place is handsdown one of the best places to eat in the phoenix metro area 1 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
id say that would be the hardest decision honestly all of ms dishes taste how they are supposed to taste amazing 1 
doesnt last long 0 
the plot doesnt hang together at all and the acting is absolutely appalling 0 
call me a nut but i think this is one of the best movies ever 1 
the atmosphere is modern and hip while maintaining a touch of coziness 1 
this movie has a cutting edge to it 1 
it is super charged up for use as a small hybrid palmtopcameracellphone and excels in those roles 1 
del taco is pretty nasty and should be avoided if possible 0 
for that its worth checking out 1 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
generally it just lacked imagination 0 
what i really like there is the crepe station 1 
does not work for listening to music with the cingular 8125 0 
frankly after cotton club and unfaithful it was kind of embarrassing to watch lane and gere in this film because it is bad 0 
i love all the features and form factor 1 
all i have to say is the food was amazing 1 
everything captain howdy says is either laughable or just plain stupid 0 
i felt as though her going to ireland did absolutely nothing whatsoever 0 
i didnt know pulled pork could be soooo delicious 1 
works well 1 
great place to relax and have an awesome burger and beer 1 
it is an excellent drama an excellent thriller and an excellent film 1 
i am very happy 1 
sorry i will not be getting food from here anytime soon 0 
unfortunately inexperience of direction meant that scene after scene passed with little in the way of dramatic tension or conflict 0 
the acting by the whole cast could be put on a scale and balanced perfectly between overacting and underacting 0 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
recommend with confidence 1 
you share general loewenhielms exquisite joy in his partaking of the cailles en sarcophage even though you are just watching a movie but you do wish for just a small sample to savor 1 
i had absolutely no problem with this headset linking to my 8530 blackberry curve 1 
excellent dualpurpose headset 1 
too politically correct 0 
it is an excellent drama an excellent thriller and an excellent film 1 
the file browser offers all the options that one needshandsfree is great 1 
in fact i liked it better than interview with a vampire and i liked this lestat stuart townsend better than cruises attempt 1 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
would come back again if i had a sushi craving while in vegas 1 
i ordered albondigas soup which was just warm and tasted like tomato soup with frozen meatballs 0 
everyone is treated equally special 1 
magical help 1 
w810i is just superb 1 
the battery works great 1 
i dont have very many words to say about this place but it does everything pretty well 1 
nothing at all to recommend 0 
every time he opened his mouth you expect to hear you see kids pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show 0 
it was probably dirt 0 
great product and price 1 
their steaks are 100 recommended 1 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 
i found this move beautiful enjoyable and uplifting 1 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
i was shocked because no signs indicate cash only 0 
it looked like a wonderful story 1 
the food was excellent and service was very good 1 
the bathroom is just next door and very nice 1 
ive only had my bluetooth for a few weeks but i really like it 1 
i love all the features and form factor 1 
i knew when i saw the film that more great things were to come from this gifted actor 1 
restored my phone to like new performance 1 
after my phone got to be about a year old its been slowly breaking despite much care on my part 0 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
ive had this bluetoooth headset for some time now and still not comfortable with the way it fits on the ear 0 
they have horrible attitudes towards customers and talk down to each one when customers dont enjoy their food 0 
the stories were as unbelievable as the actors 0 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
i do not know if this was emilio estevezs directorial debut but the pacing the interplay and development of the characters as well as some clever camera work surrounding the character estevez plays all suggest a natural eye 1 
worst service to boot but that is the least of their worries 0 
and finally after all that we get to an ending that wouldve been great had it been handled by competent people and not jerry falwell 0 
now this is a movie i really dislike 0 
dont waste your time 0 
i guess i liked the details of his dysfunctionhe was believable 1 
this is a great deal 1 
my only complaint is the standard sound volume is a little low even when turned up to 5of 5 0 
they have been around for years and carries the highest quality of antiglare screen protector that i have found to date 1 
his performance as awarded was stunning 1 
the seasonal fruit was fresh white peach puree 1 
do not purchase this phone 0 
after 20 minutes wait i got a table 0 
i was deeply impressed with the character he played 1 
very funny 1 
another note about this phones appearance is that it really looks rather bland especially in the all black model 0 
the reception has been generally good 1 
truly awful 0 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
any ring toneoverall good phone to buy 1 
defective crap 0 
the film has great actors a master director a significant themeat least a wouldbe significant theme undertone of fifties existential worldweariness aerial scenes that ought to have thrilled both senses and imagination and characters about which one might deeply care 1 
the plot doesnt hang together at all and the acting is absolutely appalling 0 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
for the price on amazon it is an excellent product which i would highly recommend 1 
all i can do is whine on the internet so here it goesthe more i use the thing the less i like it 0 
the company shipped my product very promptly and it works well 1 
i love lane but ive never seen her in a movie this lousy 0 
as for the service im a fan because its quick and youre being served by some nice folks 1 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
woa talk about awful 0 
never been to hard rock casino before will never ever step forward in it again 0 
the movie is terribly boring in places 0 
battery lasts only a few hours 0 
after i pulled up my car i waited for another 15 minutes before being acknowledged 0 
either way it sucks 0 
i have been very happy with the 510 and have had no complaints from any one regarding my sound quality on their end 1 
will never ever go back and have told many people what had happened 0 
the story line is just awful 0 
best ive found so far ive tried 2 other bluetooths and this one has the best quality for both me and the listener as well as ease of using 1 
it really created a unique feeling though 1 
this is an outstanding little restaurant with some of the best food i have ever tasted 1 
the igo chargers and tips are really great 1 
i love this phone 1 
i really wanted the plantronics 510 to be the right one but it has too many issues for methe good 0 
lifetime does not air it enough so if anyone knows what store sells it let me know because this is a musthave 1 
waited and waited and waited 0 
not a good item it worked for a while then started having problems in my auto reverse tape player 0 
on the negative its insipid enough to cause regret for another 2 hours of life wasted in front of the screen 0 
wow what a bad film 0 
i have been in more than a few bars in vegas and do not ever recall being charged for tap water 0 
ive dropped my phone more times than i can say even on concrete and my phone is still great knock on wood 1 
this film highlights the fundamental flaws of the legal process that its not about discovering guilt or innocence but rather is about who presents better in court 1 
it was a great phone 1 
so good i am going to have to review this place twice once hereas a tribute to the place and once as a tribute to an event held here last night 1 
awesome selection of beer 1 
kris kristoffersen is good in this movie and really makes a difference 1 
waiter was a jerk 0 
it deserves strong love 1 
the design is very good4 1 
each day of the week they have a different deal and its all so delicious 1 
this is high adventure at its best 1 
plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job 1 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
if you dont find it too bad as again the unit comes with one earpad onlyi would not recommend this to anyone 0 
the acting by the whole cast could be put on a scale and balanced perfectly between overacting and underacting 0 
comfortable in my hand 1 
his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic 1 
the first thing that happened was that the tracking was off 0 
i love this place 1 
this movie is greatespecially if you enjoy visual arts 1 
the plot was the same as pretty much every other cheap horror 0 
wont work right or atleast for me 0 
the dialogue sucked 0 
this mostly routine factbased tv drama gets a boost from the fine performance by cole 1 
best service and food ever maria our server was so good and friendly she made our day 1 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
but in any case the best part is you can download these pictures to your laptop using ir or even send pictures from your laptop to the phone 1 
one of the most disappointing aspects is the lack of notable gore 0 
it looses connection to the phone even when it is within a couple feet between the two 0 
id advise anyone to go and see it 1 
waiter was a jerk 0 
ray charles is legendary 1 
steamboat willie is an amazingly important film to our cinema history 1 
a drive thru means you do not want to wait around for half an hour for your food but somehow when we end up going here they make us wait and wait 0 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
totally different with loads of understatement and black comedy this is a film few get to see but those who do will remember it 1 
every time he opened his mouth you expect to hear you see kids pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show 0 
however after seeing the short again after about 25 years i was amazed at how timeless the film actually is 1 
i would advise to not purchase this item it never worked very well 0 
also difficult to put onid recommend avoiding this product 0 
it was either too cold not enough flavor or just bad 0 
after trying many many handsfree gadgets this is the one that finally works well 1 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
which has more depth and character than the man underneath it 0 
worthless product 0 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
will be back again 1 
terrible product and waste of money 0 
after all the rave reviews i couldnt wait to eat herewhat a disappointment 0 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
the stories were as unbelievable as the actors 0 
it sure does beat the nachos at the movies but i would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant 0 
point your finger at any item on the menu order it and you wont be disappointed 1 
this is a really fantastic thai restaurant which is definitely worth a visit 1 
i seriously cannot believe that the owner has so many unexperienced employees that all are running around like chickens with their heads cut off 0 
we also ordered the spinach and avocado salad the ingredients were sad and the dressing literally had zero taste 0 
i have bought this nokia cell phone a few weeks ago and it was a nightmare 0 
disappointing accessory from a good manufacturer 0 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
will not be back 0 
not a good item it worked for a while then started having problems in my auto reverse tape player 0 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
it holds a charge for a long time is reasonably comfortable under longwearing conditions and the quality of sound is tremendous 1 
im trying to return it for a refund 0 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
the things that the four kids get themselves into is absolutely hilarious to watch 1 
sucked most of the stuff does not work with my phone 0 
however after about a year the fliptop started to get loose and wobbly and eventually my screen went black and i couldnt receive and place calls 0 
i even fully charged it before i went to bed and turned off blue tooth and wifi and noticed that it only had 20 left in the morning 0 
i had a pretty satifying experience 1 
on the ground right next to our table was a large smeared beensteppedinandtrackedeverywhere pile of green bird poop 0 
echo problemvery unsatisfactory 0 
phone is sturdy as all nokia bar phones are 1 
new battery works great in phone 1 
constantine gives everything the right intensity and seems to have a good understanding of the underlying psychological motivations 1 
service was exceptional and food was a good as all the reviews 1 
like the other reviewer said you couldnt pay me to eat at this place again 0 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
sooooo good 1 
barney is definitely super de duper 1 
the bartender was also nice 1 
great charger 1 
the acting from all involved and that includes those like shatner and nimoy is bad and washed out and making them seem as old as they look in real life the special effects are tacky like when spock has to rescue kirk on a jet pack when he falls down from a mountain 0 
the ending is so so perfect youll shed a tear 1 
all the characters in this film are tremendously well played 1 
nice headset priced right 1 
rip off over charge shipping 0 
my boyfriend and i came here for the first time on a recent trip to vegas and could not have been more pleased with the quality of food and service 1 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
i was deeply impressed with the character he played 1 
this was my first time and i cant wait until the next 1 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
nice headphones for the price and they work great 1 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
great product 1 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
it was a good thing that the tickets only cost five dollars because i would be mad if id have paid 750 to see this crap 0 
the incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film 1 
the movie had you on the edge of your seat and made you somewhat afraid to go to your car at the end of the night 1 
plus its only 8 bucks 1 
the scripting of the subtle comedy is unmatched by any movie in recent years 1 
what happened next was prettyoff putting 0 
it is light has plenty of battery capacity and is very confortable to wear for somewhat extended periods of time 1 
this review is long overdue since i consider a tale of two sisters to be the single greatest film ever made 1 
i literally vomited while watching this film 0 
and the chef was generous with his time even came around twice so we can take pictures with him 1 
the food is rich so order accordingly 1 
here in the wind and the lion we see a wonderful rendering of americas own imperial age 1 
this place is like chipotle but better 1 
conclusion very filling meals 1 
he came running after us when he realized my husband had left his sunglasses on the table 1 
there is nothing authentic about this place 0 
very funny 1 
it is super charged up for use as a small hybrid palmtopcameracellphone and excels in those roles 1 
the portion was huge 1 
and his subtle connections between the three films are awesome 1 
the film deserves strong kudos for taking this stand for having exceptional acting from its mostly lesserknown cast and for the superintelligent script that doesnt insult the audience or take the easy way out when it comes to white racism 1 
this phone is very fast with sending any kind of messages and web browsing is significantly faster than previous phones i have used 1 
my breakfast was perpared great with a beautiful presentation of 3 giant slices of toast lightly dusted with powdered sugar 1 
i dont understand how this garbage got on the shelves of the movie store its not even a real movie 0 
poor construction 0 
both of them were truly unbelievably good and i am so glad we went back 1 
big disappointment with calendar sync 0 
the only good thing was our waiter he was very helpful and kept the bloddy marys coming 1 
excellent phone 1 
lot of holes in the plot theres nothing about how he became the emperor nothing about where he spend 20 years between his childhood and mature age 0 
always a great time at dos gringos 1 
the scenery that the two daughters paint and photograph are beautiful 1 
also notable is john baileys fine crisp beautifully colored cinematography and the great production design costumes by eiko ishioka who went on to do the memorable costumes for coppolas dracula for which she received a well deserved oscar 1 
aailiyah was pretty good as akasha in places compelling her first entrance and mini dance scene 1 
some may say this buffet is pricey but i think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot 1 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
it was just not a fun experience 1 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
the reception has been generally good 1 
i had the chicken pho and it tasted very bland 0 
will order from them again 1 
how awesome is that 1 
it is the best charger i have seen on the market yet 1 
better than youd expect 1 
i am far from a sushi connoisseur but i can definitely tell the difference between good food and bad food and this was certainly bad food 0 
characters are onedimensional even the good guys and especially the bad guys 0 
but now that it is out of warranty the same problems reoccurebottom line put your money somewhere else cingular will not support it 0 
the warmth it generates is in contrast to its austere backdrop 1 
the acting is fantastic the stories are seamlessly woven together and the dogs are splendid a must rent view or see 1 
worse theres an incredibly weak subplot thrown in that follows a little band of latterday mansonites as they go after a reporter whos working on a story on the anniversary of the killings 0 
i have eaten here multiple times and each time the food was delicious 1 
i was mortified 0 
id say that would be the hardest decision honestly all of ms dishes taste how they are supposed to taste amazing 1 
product was excellent and works better than the verizon one and boy was it cheaper 1 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
design flaw 0 
so i bought about 10 of these and saved alot of money 1 
i ordered this for sony ericsson w810i but i think it only worked once thats when i first used it 0 
i will not return 0 
it is light has plenty of battery capacity and is very confortable to wear for somewhat extended periods of time 1 
did not like at all 0 
i keep watching it over and over 1 
50 down the drain 0 
unfortunately this is a bad movie that is just plain bad 0 
this was a different cut than the piece the other day but still wonderful and tender s well as well flavored 1 
comfortable nice range good battery life 1 
nicest chinese restaurant ive been in a while 1 
both of them were truly unbelievably good and i am so glad we went back 1 
but now i was completely grossed out 0 
i would recommend it 1 
for a self proclaimed coffee cafe i was wildly disappointed 0 
they could serve it with just the vinaigrette and it may make for a better overall dish but it was still very good 1 
not as good as i had hoped 0 
do not buy do not buyit sucks 0 
i find wasting food to be despicable but this just wasnt food 0 
his performance is simply genius 1 
this is a great little item 1 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
phone falls out easily 0 
so absolutley fantastic 1 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
what on earth is irons doing in this film 0 
service is quick and even to go orders are just like we like it 1 
his use of the colours of the french flag in the three films was nothing short of incredible every shot every scene was like a work of art 1 
you wont forget this movie 1 
do not buy do not buyit sucks 0 
needless to say we will never be back here again 0 
there is simply no excuse for something this poorly done 0 
by the time the film ended i not only disliked it i despised it 0 
the accompanied software is almost brilliant 1 
this movie is terrible 0 
if you stay in vegas you must get breakfast here at least once 1 
add betty white and jean smart and you have a great cast everyone played their parts really well 1 
the real killer is the volume and of course it breaking 0 
i hate those things as much as cheap quality black olives 0 
none of it works just dont buy it 0 
yes i am simplifying things here for the sake of brevity for this really is at the core of the problems with this film it has too much going on without any real fulfilling explanation 0 
i literally vomited while watching this film 0 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
the telephone repair man was really funny and his reactions to the nuts and bitchy boss were truly genuine 1 
its a great item 1 
these are the nicest restaurant owners ive ever come across 1 
if there were zero stars i would give it zero stars 0 
it is an excellent drama an excellent thriller and an excellent film 1 
tried to go here for lunch and it was a madhouse 0 
dont waste your money 0 
the camera really likes her in this movie 1 
the cast is always entertaining as usual 1 
the cow tongue and cheek tacos are amazing 1 
just dont know why they were so slow 0 
it was a good thing that the tickets only cost five dollars because i would be mad if id have paid 750 to see this crap 0 
the chicken i got was definitely reheated and was only ok the wedges were cold and soggy 0 
nice docking station for home or work 1 
a very very very slowmoving aimless movie about a distressed drifting young man 0 
but this movie is definitely a below average rent 0 
there is no plot here to keep you going in the first place 0 
i did not have any problem with this item and would order it again if needed 1 
the eargels channel the sound directly into your ear and seem to increase the sound volume and clarity 1 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
all i have to say is the food was amazing 1 
very prompt service 1 
if you hate earbugs avoid this phone by all means 0 
i left the theater with a lilt in my step joy in my heart and hope for the human race 1 
bluetooth range is good a few days ago i left my phone in the trunk got a call and carried the conversation without a hitch 1 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
will definitely be back 1 
for service i give them no stars 0 
their chow mein is so good 1 
will definitely be back 1 
it was delicious 1 
ive tried several different earpieces for my cell phone and this jabra one is the first one ive found that fits my ear comfortably 1 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
it was an inexpensive piece but i would still have expected better quality 0 
very good product well made 1 
for those that havent seen it dont waste your time 0 
and the red curry had so much bamboo shoots and wasnt very tasty to me 0 
started watching this but didnt believe in any of the characters 0 
that was nice 1 
o my gosh the best phone i have ever had 1 
i have yet to run this new battery below two bars and thats three days without charging 1 
delicious and i will absolutely be back 1 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
he really didnt seem to want to be hosting his voiceovers were monotonous didnt get involved with the guests 0 
and considering the two of us left there very full and happy for about 20 you just cant go wrong 1 
but it is great i would really recommend it 1 
the acting was bad the dialogs were extremely shallow and insincere 0 
jabra ear gels r the best 1 
its practically perfect in all of them  a true masterpiece in a sea of faux masterpieces 1 
the script is horrendously stupid 0 
it was probably dirt 0 
it was just too horrible 0 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
an absolute must visit 1 
definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly will return next time im in vegas 1 
it has a very good plot it holds your complete attention the acting is superb tom wilkinson was fantastic and emily watson was also very good 1 
lot of holes in the plot theres nothing about how he became the emperor nothing about where he spend 20 years between his childhood and mature age 0 
i definitly recommend 1 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
what should have been a hilarious yummy christmas eve dinner to remember was the biggest fail of the entire trip for us 0 
it did not work in my cell phone plug i am very up set with the charger 0 
i was able to do voice dialing in the car with no problem 1 
the story itself is just predictable and lazy 0 
victor mclaglen was even bad and brian donlevy was almost unrecognizable 0 
call me a nut but i think this is one of the best movies ever 1 
i seriously cannot believe that the owner has so many unexperienced employees that all are running around like chickens with their heads cut off 0 
the price was very good and with the free shipping and all it was a good purchase 1 
actually the graphics were good at the time 1 
you can find better movies at youtube 0 
victor mclaglen was even bad and brian donlevy was almost unrecognizable 0 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
i hope this place sticks around 1 
enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film 1 
the new characters werent all that memorable and i found myself forgetting who was who 0 
i did not have any problem with this item and would order it again if needed 1 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
nevertheless yet another wonderful film from the great masters stable 1 
a very good film indeed about great and unconditional love 1 
worst service to boot but that is the least of their worries 0 
anyway the plot flowed smoothly and the malebonding scenes were a hoot 1 
the fries were not hot and neither was my burger 0 
up there with the best of melville 1 
poorly contstruct hinge 0 
appears to actually outperform the original battery from china that came with my v325i 1 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
the plot was the same as pretty much every other cheap horror 0 
small sleek impressive looking practical setup with ample storage in place 1 
i received my headset in good time and was happy with it 1 
lifetime does not air it enough so if anyone knows what store sells it let me know because this is a musthave 1 
nice blanket of moz over top but i feel like this was done to cover up the subpar food 1 
coming here is like experiencing an underwhelming relationship where both parties cant wait for the other person to ask to break up 0 
will not be back 0 
lifetime does not air it enough so if anyone knows what store sells it let me know because this is a musthave 1 
it looses connection to the phone even when it is within a couple feet between the two 0 
looks great and is strong 1 
the shipping time was also very quick 1 
service is also cute 1 
it lasts less than 3o minutes if i actually try to use the phonemy wife has the same phone with the same problem 0 
the headset fulfills my requirements so i am happy with my purchase 1 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
do not waste your money here 0 
schrader has made a resume full of lousy amateurish films 0 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
the only good thing was that it fits comfortably on small ears 1 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
and the accents are absolutely abysmal 0 
i was very excited to get this headset because i thought it was really cute 1 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
iam very pleased with my purchase 1 
it was either too cold not enough flavor or just bad 0 
the presentation of the food was awful 0 
i can think of no other film where something vitally important occurs every other minute 1 
the phone takes forever to charge like 2 to 5 hours literally 0 
the story line is just awful 0 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
this place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver 0 
the tracfonewebsite is user friendly and makes it easy toactivate etc 1 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
this frog phone charm is adorable and very eye catching 1 
this movie now joins revenge of the boogeyman and zombiez as part of the hellish trinity of horror films 0 
i give it 2 thumbs down 0 
i received my headset in good time and was happy with it 1 
great food and service huge portions and they give a military discount 1 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
i give wirefly 1 stari will contact cingularatt and inform them of this practice 0 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
service is perfect and the family atmosphere is nice to see 1 
the staff is friendly and the joint is always clean 1 
do not waste your time 0 
im a bit disappointed 0 
comfortable nice range good battery life 1 
the food is about on par with dennys which is to say not good at all 0 
all this movie does is make you sick watching all these slackers make excuses for their stupid actions for 90 minutes 0 
the structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema 1 
and the rest of it just sits there being awful with soldiers singing songs about the masculinity they pledge themselves to hairsplitting about purity the admiration of swords etc 0 
i received it quickly and it works great 1 
the worst sappiest dialogue i could go on and on 0 
i was particularly pleased with the acting ability of dwight schultz 1 
i can say that the desserts were yummy 1 
bacon is hella salty 1 
but now i was completely grossed out 0 
i love the scream movies and all horror movies and this one ranks way up there 1 
end of days is one of the worst bigbudget action movies ive ever seen 0 
he was terrible 0 
painful on the ear 0 
the phone loads super 1 
battery life is real good 1 
and generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode 0 
they were excellent 1 
the staff is always super friendly and helpful which is especially cool when you bring two small boys and a baby 1 
i really recommend this faceplates since it looks very nice elegant and cool 1 
crust is not good 0 
juano hernandez an exceptional actor who played supporting roles in many films of the era is a proud black man who is accused of murdering a white man in the south 1 
love this product 1 
i even fully charged it before i went to bed and turned off blue tooth and wifi and noticed that it only had 20 left in the morning 0 
please dont waste your money 0 
ive owned this phone for 7 months now and can say that its the best mobile phone ive had 1 
the warmth it generates is in contrast to its austere backdrop 1 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
beware this is not a trashy cult movie this is trash period 0 
the sound quality is excellent as well 1 
not a good item it worked for a while then started having problems in my auto reverse tape player 0 
it was pretty gross 0 
some applause should be given to the prelude however 1 
the dining space is tiny but elegantly decorated and comfortable 1 
it was a bit too sweet not really spicy enough and lacked flavor 0 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
i guess that nobody at the network that aired this dribble watched it before putting it on 0 
if you want healthy authentic or ethic food try this place 1 
dont make the same mistake that i did and please dont buy this phone 0 
battery chargelife is quite long 1 
the movie was so boring that i sometimes found myself occupied peaking in the paper instead of watching never happened during a columbo movie before 0 
what a big waste of time 0 
its a mediocre miserable hollow laughable and predictable piece of garbage 0 
the instruction manual is lacking 0 
id rather eat airline food seriously 0 
the script is was there a script 0 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
disappointing 0 
for service i give them no stars 0 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
he really didnt seem to want to be hosting his voiceovers were monotonous didnt get involved with the guests 0 
defective crap 0 
poorly contstruct hinge 0 
his costars dont fare much better with people like morgan freeman jonah hill and ed helms just wasted 0 
i promise they wont disappoint 1 
would come back again if i had a sushi craving while in vegas 1 
kieslowski never ceases to amaze me 1 
not only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic but it also managed to give away the entire movie and im not exaggerating every moment every plot point every joke is told in the trailer 0 
a fantastic neighborhood gem 1 
im glad i found this product on amazon it is hard to find it wasnt high priced 1 
and the accents are absolutely abysmal 0 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
similarly the delivery man did not say a word of apology when our food was 45 minutes late 0 
i work in the hospitality industry in paradise valley and have refrained from recommending cibo any longer 0 
the lighting is awful 0 
will order from them again 1 
this is one of the best italian thrillers of the early 70s 1 
ambience is perfect 1 
excellent 1 
i am pairing this with my iphone and i could not be happier with it so far 1 
in fact im going to round up to 4 stars just because she was so awesome 1 
why are these sad little vegetables so overcooked 0 
its a fresh subtle and rather sublime effect 1 
we have gotten a lot of compliments on it 1 
the movie in movie situations in the beginning and through the game that is played with her by the acting coach are fascinating 1 
generous portions and great taste 1 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
see both films if you can 1 
the potato chip order was sad i could probably count how many chips were in that box and it was probably around 12 0 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
id say that would be the hardest decision honestly all of ms dishes taste how they are supposed to taste amazing 1 
my friend did not like his bloody mary 0 
the movie in movie situations in the beginning and through the game that is played with her by the acting coach are fascinating 1 
will not be back 0 
i vomited in the bathroom mid lunch 0 
it features an outlandish array of memorable psychotic but lovable nuts 1 
everything on the menu is terrific and we were also thrilled that they made amazing accommodations for our vegetarian daughter 1 
interesting decor 1 
it was horrendous 0 
there is nothing privileged about workingeating there 0 
car charger as well as ac charger are included to make sure you never run out of juicehighy recommended 1 
i love this bluetooth 1 
i immediately said i wanted to talk to the manager but i did not want to talk to the guy who was doing shots of fireball behind the bar 0 
i love the ringtones because they are so upbeat 1 
the attractive set used throughout most of the film is an eyepleasing gem 1 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
good item low price 1 
absolutel junk 0 
audio quality is poor very poor 0 
theres really nothing bad i can say about this headset 0 
audio quality is poor very poor 0 
spoilers whatever else can or cant be said about it surface is superbly crafted 1 
owners are really great people 1 
i would not recommend this place 0 
when achille and philippa beautifully sing a duet from don giovanni that perfectly describes their situation in the movie you appreciate the subtle layers of this excellent film 1 
then as if i hadnt wasted enough of my life there they poured salt in the wound by drawing out the time it took to bring the check 0 
really good product 1 
itll be a regular stop on my trips to phoenix 1 
worked very well paired with a treo 700w and as a skype headset on my pc using a usb bluetooth transceiver 1 
ive missed numerous calls because of this reason 0 
food was really good and i got full petty fast 1 
i left with a stomach ache and felt sick the rest of the day 0 
great time family dinner on a sunday night 1 
and considering the two of us left there very full and happy for about 20 you just cant go wrong 1 
great place fo take out or eat in 1 
nice design and quality 1 
they are so cool 1 
the transfers are very good 1 
these headphones were a great find and i think they are perhaps the best purchase ive made in the last several years seriously 1 
much better than the other ayce sushi place i went to in vegas 1 
sending it back 0 
the poor actors 0 
1010 1 
very comfortable 1 
highly recommended a 1 
i have been very happy with the 510 and have had no complaints from any one regarding my sound quality on their end 1 
she ordered a toasted english muffin that came out untoasted 0 
ill give this film 10 out of 10 1 
do not buy for d807wrongly advertised for d807 0 
when a song could explain the emotions of the subjects better such as when jay adams unfortunate life was a subject of talk the song old man by neil young was played which evokes many emotions 1 
the feel of the dining room was more college cooking course than high class dining and the service was slow at best 0 
this is so embarassing and also my ears hurt if i try to push the ear plug into my ear 0 
later i found myself lost in the power of the film 1 
i have yet to run this new battery below two bars and thats three days without charging 1 
i really wanted the plantronics 510 to be the right one but it has too many issues for methe good 0 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
i got it because it was so small and adorable 1 
the plot was the same as pretty much every other cheap horror 0 
very very disappointed ordered the 35 big bay plater 0 
you share general loewenhielms exquisite joy in his partaking of the cailles en sarcophage even though you are just watching a movie but you do wish for just a small sample to savor 1 
the atmosphere here is fun 1
