dont miss it 1 
a great touch 1 
never again will i be dining at this place 0 
do not purchase this phone 0 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
the soundtrack wasnt terrible either 1 
this is essentially a communications tool that does not communicate 0 
because both ears are occupied background is not distracting at all 1 
its a total package 1 
you cant go wrong with any of the food here 1 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
poor reliability 0 
i have tried these cables with my computer and my ipod and it works just fine 1 
that movie was bad 0 
the noise shield is incrediable 1 
i bought this battery with a coupon from amazon and im very happy with my purchase 1 
which has more depth and character than the man underneath it 0 
last time buying from you 0 
it sure does beat the nachos at the movies but i would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant 0 
this is a great product sure beats using your fingers 1 
it was a waste of my money 0 
and if that isnt enough of a mess of a movie for you the picture is also marred with a constant use of studio sets and indoor exteriors 0 
it just blew 0 
the last 15 minutes of movie are also not bad as well 1 
greatno problems at all 1 
this case has passed the one year mark and while it shows signs of wear it is 100 functional 1 
love this place hits the spot when i want something healthy but not lacking in quantity or flavor 1 
dont buy this product 0 
ordered an appetizer and took 40 minutes and then the pizza another 10 minutes 0 
definitely will come back here again 1 
krussel always good 1 
ive had this bluetoooth headset for some time now and still not comfortable with the way it fits on the ear 0 
im probably one of the few people to ever go to ians and not like it 0 
then our food came out disappointment ensued 0 
plus it was wellpaced and suited its relatively short run time 1 
call me a nut but i think this is one of the best movies ever 1 
this pda rocks 1 
he also came back to check on us regularly excellent service 1 
highquality chicken on the chicken caesar salad 1 
i had a salad with the wings and some ice cream for dessert and left feeling quite satisfied 1 
the handsfree part works fine but then the car tries to download the address book and the treo rebootsoverall i still rate this device high 1 
and the accents are absolutely abysmal 0 
fantastic earphones 1 
although i very much liked the look and sound of this place the actual experience was a bit disappointing 0 
the phone takes forever to charge like 2 to 5 hours literally 0 
it is practically useless and did not add any kind of boost to my reception after i bought it 0 
stay away from the q 0 
about ten minutes into this film i started having second thoughts 0 
uncomfortable in the ear dont use with lg vx9900 env 0 
oh the charger seems to work fine 1 
i would not recommend this place 0 
and generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode 0 
returned 8 hours later 0 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
please dont waste your money 0 
the food was excellent and service was very good 1 
i went on motorolas website and followed all directions but could not get it to pair again 0 
im happy about this purchase good quality and low price 1 
service is perfect and the family atmosphere is nice to see 1 
comfortable in my hand 1 
worked very well paired with a treo 700w and as a skype headset on my pc using a usb bluetooth transceiver 1 
i dont know exactly what it is about this movie but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our familys memories 1 
my rating just 3 out of 10 0 
very bad experience 0 
it is practically useless and did not add any kind of boost to my reception after i bought it 0 
after arguing with verizon regarding the dropped calls we returned the phones after two days 0 
easily none other cartoon made me laugh in a tender way before getting into dark sitcoms oriented for teenagers 1 
mark my words this is one of those cult films like evil dead 2 or phantasm that people will still be discovering and falling in love with 20 30 40 years down the line 1 
i am going to have to be the first to negatively review this product 0 
the desserts were a bit strange 0 
we also ordered the spinach and avocado salad the ingredients were sad and the dressing literally had zero taste 0 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
they made this case too small and is very difficult to install 0 
the cast is always entertaining as usual 1 
this movie has a cutting edge to it 1 
we asked for the bill to leave without eating and they didnt bring that either 0 
this phone works great 1 
but it wasnt anything at all just one big yawn 0 
both great 1 
disappointing 0 
these are fabulous 1 
although i very much liked the look and sound of this place the actual experience was a bit disappointing 0 
i am very impressed with this headset from plantronics 1 
this was my first and only vegas buffet and it did not disappoint 1 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
i had the mac salad and it was pretty bland so i will not be getting that again 0 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
i thought it was bad 0 
piece of junk 0 
even when the women finally show up there is no sign of improvement the most expected things happen and by the time the film is over you might be far asleep 0 
the dialogue is composed of things that make little sense 0 
worked very well paired with a treo 700w and as a skype headset on my pc using a usb bluetooth transceiver 1 
the plot well i said id let that one go 0 
comes with a strong light that you can use to light up your camera shots and even flash sos signals seriously 1 
i was seated immediately 1 
overall i rate this movie a 10 out of a 110 scale 1 
it is worth the drive 1 
love this phone 1 
it was attached to a gas station and that is rarely a good sign 0 
the bathrooms are clean and the place itself is well decorated 1 
it clicks into place in a way that makes you wonder how long that mechanism would last 0 
my salad had a bland vinegrette on the baby greens and hearts of palm 0 
the best place in vegas for breakfast just check out a sat or sun 1 
there is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again 0 
i wasted my little money with this earpiece 0 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
as for the killer dont expect anything original or even remotely frightening 0 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
the keyboard is a nice compromise between a full qwerty and the basic cell phone number keypad 1 
an excellent new restaurant by an experienced frenchman 1 
rating 1 out of 10 0 
i liked this movie way too much 1 
this device is great in several situations1 1 
this movie has a cutting edge to it 1 
a great way to finish a great 1 
i could not stand to even watch it for very long for fear of losing iq 0 
did not like at all 0 
the phone gets extremely hot 0 
the ambiance isnt much better 0 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
the best electronics of the available fm transmitters 1 
that company is a joke 0 
dont buy it 0 
my only complaint is the standard sound volume is a little low even when turned up to 5of 5 0 
the chips and salsa were really good the salsa was very fresh 1 
these products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet 0 
ill put this gem up against any movie in terms of screenplay cinematography acting postproduction editing directing or any other aspect of filmmaking 1 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
and the chef was generous with his time even came around twice so we can take pictures with him 1 
they will customize your order any way youd like my usual is eggplant with green bean stir fry love it 1 
50 down the drain 0 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
i especially liked the noncliche choices with the parents in other movies i could predict the dialog verbatim but the writing in this movie made better selections 1 
awesome device 1 
the acting as youd expect from this cast is top notch 1 
buttons are too small 0 
youll love how thin it is 1 
full of unconvincing cardboard characters it is blandly written by edward chodorov who also produced and is surprisingly directed by jean negulesco from whom one would expect a great deal more 0 
once you get inside youll be impressed with the place 1 
a good commentary of todays love and undoubtedly a film worth seeing 1 
youll love it 1 
mic doesnt work 0 
so they performed 1 
the movie had you on the edge of your seat and made you somewhat afraid to go to your car at the end of the night 1 
strike 2 who wants to be rushed 0 
there is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again 0 
excellent short film 1 
i believe that pitch black was done well 1 
i am very impressed with the job that motorola did on the sturdiness of this phone 1 
thanks again to amazon for having the things i need for a good price 1 
this place is disgusting 0 
people who like european films and art movies will like this movie 1 
regardless the film fails on most levels 0 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
the design is very good4 1 
the story line is totally predictable 0 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurv√•g being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
nice solid keyboard 1 
the best scene in the movie was when gerardo is trying to find a song that keeps running through his head 1 
characters are onedimensional even the good guys and especially the bad guys 0 
recommend with confidence 1 
this is a great place to eat 1 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
also its a real treat to see anthony quinn playing crazy horse 1 
i keep watching it over and over 1 
probably never coming back and wouldnt recommend it 0 
i am very happy 1 
also makes it easier to hold on to 1 
now this is a movie i really dislike 0 
come hungry leave happy and stuffed 1 
food was really boring 0 
after charging overnight these batteries work great 1 
not even a hello we will be right with you 0 
its fits like a glove and is strong secure and durable 1 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
the two main characters may be two of the most believable children i ever saw put on screen 1 
this was such an awesome movie that i bought it off of ebay 1 
tom wilkinson broke my heart at the end and everyone elses judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike 1 
ray charles is legendary 1 
i wasted my little money with this earpiece 0 
if you look for authentic thai food go else where 0 
highly entertaining at all angles 1 
ive had better not only from dedicated boba tea spots but even from jenni pho 0 
which is precisely why i am giving it such a bad review 0 
nothing short of magnificent photographycinematography in this film 1 
the phone crashed completely and now i have to get it replaced 0 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
rip off over charge shipping 0 
the plantains were the worst ive ever tasted 0 
i struggle to find anything bad to say about it 1 
overall i was not impressed and would not go back 0 
doesnt work at all i bougth it for my l7c and its not working 0 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
its too bad the food is so damn generic 0 
today was my first taste of a buldogis gourmet hot dog and i have to tell you it was more than i ever thought possible 1 
i got the aluminum case for my new palm vx and it worked really wellit has protected my handheld perfectly so far 1 
come hungry leave happy and stuffed 1 
both great 1 
i have never had such bland food which surprised me considering the article we read focused so much on their spices and flavor 0 
the only thing i wasnt too crazy about was their guacamole as i dont like it pur√©ed 0 
excellent performance 1 
you get incredibly fresh fish prepared with care 1 
the pizza selections are good 1 
exactly what i wanted 1 
well im satisfied 1 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
i received my orders well within the shipping timeframe everything was in good working order and overall i am very excited to have this source 1 
you could only take 2 videos at a time and the quality was very poor 0 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
i wouldnt see this movie again for free 0 
do not waste your time 0 
again no plot at all 0 
kind of flops around 0 
i left with a stomach ache and felt sick the rest of the day 0 
this is an extraordinary film 1 
the first time i ever came here i had an amazing experience i still tell people how awesome the duck was 1 
do not buy if you want to use the holster 0 
this is a great deal 1 
but what really made it unwatchable was the direction 0 
it was a good thing that the tickets only cost five dollars because i would be mad if id have paid 750 to see this crap 0 
couldnt ask for a more satisfying meal 1 
this is a great place to eat 1 
this is actually a very smart movie 1 
furthermore you cant even find hours of operation on the website 0 
this film offers many delights and surprises 1 
i immediately said i wanted to talk to the manager but i did not want to talk to the guy who was doing shots of fireball behind the bar 0 
lasted one day and then blew up 0 
as for the service i thought it was good 1 
the chicken i got was definitely reheated and was only ok the wedges were cold and soggy 0 
maybe its just their vegetarian fare but ive been twice and i thought it was average at best 0 
probably not in a hurry to go back 0 
service is friendly and inviting 1 
its so stupid to have to keep buying new chargers car chargers cradles headphones and car kits every time a new phone comes out 0 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
comes with a strong light that you can use to light up your camera shots and even flash sos signals seriously 1 
i saw this film over christmas and what a great film it was 1 
dont make the same mistake that i did and please dont buy this phone 0 
i dont have to be an accountant to know im getting screwed 0 
the meat was pretty dry i had the sliced brisket and pulled pork 0 
dont waste your money and time 0 
the shower area is outside so you can only rinse not take a full shower unless you dont mind being nude for everyone to see 0 
mark my words this is one of those cult films like evil dead 2 or phantasm that people will still be discovering and falling in love with 20 30 40 years down the line 1 
great steak great sides great wine amazing desserts 1 
i had the chicken pho and it tasted very bland 0 
appears to actually outperform the original battery from china that came with my v325i 1 
the plot simply rumbles on like a machine desperately depending on the addition of new scenes 0 
the waitress and manager are so friendly 1 
you share general loewenhielms exquisite joy in his partaking of the cailles en sarcophage even though you are just watching a movie but you do wish for just a small sample to savor 1 
waited 2 hours never got either of our pizzas as many other around us who came in later did 0 
we had 7 at our table and the service was pretty fast 1 
my side greek salad with the greek dressing was so tasty and the pita and hummus was very refreshing 1 
this phone is slim and light and the display is beautiful 1 
its uncomfortable and the sound quality is quite poor compared with the phone razr or with my previous wired headset that plugged into an lg 0 
i was amazed at the quick arrival of the two original lg cell phone batteries and and at a fraction of the price 1 
not sure who was more lost the flat characters or the audience nearly half of whom walked out 0 
what happened next was prettyoff putting 0 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
one of the most disappointing aspects is the lack of notable gore 0 
if you are looking for a good quality motorola headset keep looking this isnt it 0 
the pizza selections are good 1 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
worst ever 0 
i love lane but ive never seen her in a movie this lousy 0 
i work in the hospitality industry in paradise valley and have refrained from recommending cibo any longer 0 
the service here leaves a lot to be desired 0 
it was clear that she had the range and ability to pull off this part 1 
excellent short film 1 
whatever prompted such a documentary is beyond me 0 
i ordered the voodoo pasta and it was the first time id had really excellent pasta since going gluten free several years ago 1 
i exchanged the sony ericson z500a for this and im pretty happy with that decision 1 
50 down the drain 0 
i really like this product over the motorola because it is allot clearer on the ear piece and the mic 1 
very easy to use 1 
yet plantronincs continues to use the same flawed charger design 0 
his performance is simply genius 1 
i saw mirrormask last night and it was an unsatisfactory experience 0 
but storm trooper is not even bad enough to make it to the list of wonderfully terrible movies 0 
bt50 battery junk 0 
the acting was decidely wooden though no worse than a period universal b movie 0 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
this is a great place to eat 1 
omit watching this 0 
it wasnt busy at all and now we know why 0 
this is essentially a communications tool that does not communicate 0 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
thats how id describe this painfully dreary timewaster of a film 0 
everything was good and tasty 1 
works good 1 
great for the jawbone 1 
the aerial scenes were welldone 1 
then theres the plot holes 0 
totally believable 1 
the turkey and roast beef were bland 0 
eclectic selection 1 
the story starts too fast with absolutely no suspense or buildup in the slightest 0 
i am so pleased to know such a modern day genius is out there letting is passion for art drive him and taking us as an audience with him 1 
also were served hot bread and butter and home made potato chips with bacon bits on topvery original and very good 1 
soggy and not good 0 
so i am here to warn youdo not rent this movie it is the dumbest thing you have never seen 0 
great place to eat reminds me of the little mom and pop shops in the san francisco bay area 1 
i purchased this and within 2 days it was no longer working 0 
it shouldnt take 30 min for pancakes and eggs 0 
i have read others reviews here but i havent had any problem with it 1 
the sets especially designed to work with the camera are amazingstylized beautiful and effective 1 
very bad performance plays angela bennett a computer expert who is at home all the time 0 
ive never been treated so bad 0 
very true to shakespear and a must for all shakespear fans 1 
did not like at all 0 
its so bad its actually worth seeing just for that reason 0 
i enjoyed it 1 
i was disgusted because i was pretty sure that was human hair 0 
the lighting is awful 0 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
when my order arrived one of the gyros was missing 0 
updatewent back for a second time and it was still just as amazing 1 
plus it was wellpaced and suited its relatively short run time 1 
the point is the journey a journey that touches every member of the family 1 
great phone 1 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
not only did the software do a great job of this i could also make my own ringtones form my existing cds without an internet connection 1 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
you learn a lot about the real inside emotions of people in this movie and a lot about the movie business itself 1 
nothing special 0 
its like a really sexy party in your mouth where youre outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party 1 
item arrived quickly and works great with my metro pcs samsung schr450 slider phone and sony premium sound in ear plugs 1 
again lame 0 
im so sorry but i really cant recommend it to anyone 0 
the ambiance was incredible 1 
if you want healthy authentic or ethic food try this place 1 
some may say this buffet is pricey but i think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot 1 
the battery is completely useless to me 0 
the real disappointment was our waiter 0 
it seems completely secure both holding on to my belt and keeping the iphone inside 1 
clear skype calls long battery life long range 1 
not a good item it worked for a while then started having problems in my auto reverse tape player 0 
definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly will return next time im in vegas 1 
they could be used as exemplars for any set designer 1 
fans of the genre will be in heaven 1 
the first time i ever came here i had an amazing experience i still tell people how awesome the duck was 1 
service is also cute 1 
the movie showed a lot of florida at its best made it look very appealing 1 
after 3 months screen just went black all of a sudden 0 
an italian reviewer called this a small great film and thats right 1 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
the characters are fleshed out surprisingly well particularly grimes and blake and all the actors deliver their sharply scripted lines with just the right amount of deadpan tongue in cheek to make the dialogue both hilarious and realistic 1 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
ps the only scene in the movie that was cool is when the central character finds her room blown up 1 
i thoroughly enjoyed it when christopher eccleston took control of the tardis and the continuation of the series 1 
this may be the only bad film he ever made 0 
the directing seems too pretentious 0 
weird vibe from owners 0 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
i was left shattered from the experience of watching this film and i took a good two hours to fully recover 0 
the food was terrible 0 
it sure does beat the nachos at the movies but i would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant 0 
worked great 1 
i am so tired of clich√©s that is just lazy writing and here they come in thick and fast 0 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
started watching this but didnt believe in any of the characters 0 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
the waitresses are very friendly 1 
that one didnt work either 0 
bacon is hella salty 1 
i received my orders well within the shipping timeframe everything was in good working order and overall i am very excited to have this source 1 
it holds a charge for a long time is reasonably comfortable under longwearing conditions and the quality of sound is tremendous 1 
the sound quality for the device is unacceptableunless you are in a really quiet area you almost hear nothing 0 
the structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema 1 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
happy so far 1 
i paid the bill but did not tip because i felt the server did a terrible job 0 
the ri style calamari was a joke 0 
no shifting no bubbling no peeling not even a scratch nothingi couldnt be more happier with my new one for the droid 1 
this item is fantastic and works perfectly 1 
the construction of the headsets is poor 0 
totally different with loads of understatement and black comedy this is a film few get to see but those who do will remember it 1 
you wont be disappointed 1 
my mother and brother had to do thiswhen i saw robert ryan portraying this type of man it was a very good imitation of this type of individual and i was impressed 1 
i dont think there are any redeeming qualities in this remake 0 
it came free with a dvd player i bought but i still turned the thing off halfway through because i was embarrassed for howell 0 
i saw this movie and i thought this is a stupid movie 0 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
freezes frequently4 0 
the cow tongue and cheek tacos are amazing 1 
they were goldencrispy and delicious 1 
for 40 bucks a head i really expect better food 0 
superb phone on a great network 1 
the speaker is of low quality so as making the ring tones sound very cheap 0 
also the story and acting were weak 0 
who in their right mind is gonna buy this battery 0 
there was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters 0 
well never go again 0 
i rate this movie 910 1 
its really easy 1 
star trek v the final frontier is the worst in the series 0 
mishima is extremely uninteresting 0 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
does not fit 0 
in addition it feels amp looks as if the phone is all lightweight cheap plastic 0 
i wouldnt see this movie again for free 0 
about ten minutes into this film i started having second thoughts 0 
def coming back to bowl next time 1 
not my thing 0 
it is zillion times away from reality 0 
lot of holes in the plot theres nothing about how he became the emperor nothing about where he spend 20 years between his childhood and mature age 0 
it was packed 0 
this particular model would not work with my motorola q smartphone 0 
the songs were the best and the muppets were so hilarious 1 
it was way over fried 0 
the plug did not work very well 0 
i dont think it would hold it too securly on your belt 0 
the cashier was friendly and even brought the food out to me 1 
nothing special 0 
food was really good and i got full petty fast 1 
no shifting no bubbling no peeling not even a scratch nothingi couldnt be more happier with my new one for the droid 1 
the roast beef sandwich tasted really good 1 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
we wont be going back anytime soon 0 
i would highly recommend this product 1 
i went to bachi burger on a friends recommendation and was not disappointed 1 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
that was done in the second movie 0 
their regular toasted bread was equally satisfying with the occasional pats of butter mmmm 1 
best of all is the rotating feature very helpful 1 
they work about 2 weeks then break 0 
the lighting is awful 0 
if you want a sandwich just go to any firehouse 1 
lordy the khao soi is a dish that is not to be missed for curry lovers 1 
clear skype calls long battery life long range 1 
best ive found so far ive tried 2 other bluetooths and this one has the best quality for both me and the listener as well as ease of using 1 
the jabra eargels fit my ears very well 1 
i hate writing bad reviews about films especially those in which i really like the star but this film is so bad i dont believe for one second that anyone could have been proud of it 0 
yes its that bad 0 
dont buy it 0 
this movie totally grates on my nerves 0 
it was a riot to see hugo weaving play a sexobsessed gay real estate salesman who uses his clients houses for his trysts with the flaming darren tom hollander 1 
very clear quality sound and you dont have to mess with the sound on your ipod since you have the sound buttons on the headset 1 
battery is holding up well 1 
there was hardly any meat 0 
try them in the airport to experience some tasty food and speedy friendly service 1 
while you dont yet hear mickey speak there are tons of sound effects and music throughout the filmsomething we take for granted now but which was a huge crowd pleaser in 1928 1 
i definitly recommend 1 
her role was played well 1 
the explosion of the gas tanks at the end was just as awful 0 
i really liked that 1 
do not buy for d807wrongly advertised for d807 0 
my side greek salad with the greek dressing was so tasty and the pita and hummus was very refreshing 1 
i wasnt really impressed with strip steak 0 
the food was delicious our bartender was attentive and personable and we got a great deal 1 
very very disappointed ordered the 35 big bay plater 0 
i will come back here every time im in vegas 1 
now the pizza itself was good the peanut sauce was very tasty 1 
this is a really fantastic thai restaurant which is definitely worth a visit 1 
ive had no trouble accessing the internet downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions 1 
total brunch fail 0 
ray charles life provided excellent biographical material for the film which goes well beyond being just another movie about a musician 1 
i think i was one of the people who found this another one of roths pearls 1 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
my boyfriend tried the mediterranean chicken salad and fell in love 1 
regardless the film fails on most levels 0 
utterly without merit on any level this is akin to torture 0 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
the pizza tasted old super chewy in not a good way 0 
it was a long time that i didnt see a so charismatic actor on screen 1 
mishima is extremely uninteresting 0 
im not really sure how joeys was voted best hot dog in the valley by readers of phoenix magazine 0 
generous portions and great taste 1 
the majority of the logitech earbud headsets failed 0 
as always the evening was wonderful and the food delicious 1 
beautiful styling though 1 
this battery is an excellent bargain 1 
great pizza and salads 1 
i was sitting in my vehicle with the cradle on my belt and the headset lost signal 0 
by the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant i was bored and didnt care what happened next and so i switched off 0 
im really disappointed all i have now is a charger that doesnt work 0 
even worse than ticker 0 
it came free with a dvd player i bought but i still turned the thing off halfway through because i was embarrassed for howell 0 
his performance as awarded was stunning 1 
the veggitarian platter is out of this world 1 
my boyfriend and i came here for the first time on a recent trip to vegas and could not have been more pleased with the quality of food and service 1 
well just if you keep thinking how bad it is 0 
the food was terrible 0 
they will customize your order any way youd like my usual is eggplant with green bean stir fry love it 1 
everyone is very attentive providing excellent customer service 1 
an instant classic with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits 1 
it showed exactly how the government and the scientist argued for humanity and the reasons of the gadget 1 
does not work for listening to music with the cingular 8125 0 
very windresistant 1 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
the battery life is highly unacceptable 0 
sauce was tasteless 0 
battery has no life 0 
a world better than 95 of the garbage in the theatres today 1 
reception is terrible and full of static 0 
ive owned this phone for 7 months now and can say that its the best mobile phone ive had 1 
host staff were for lack of a better word bitches 0 
dee snider just plain sucks 0 
the presentation of the food was awful 0 
if you check the directors filmography on this site you will see why this film didnt have a chance 0 
if you havent choked in your own vomit by the end by all the cheap drama and worthless dialogue youve must have bored yourself to death with this waste of time 0 
i am so pleased to know such a modern day genius is out there letting is passion for art drive him and taking us as an audience with him 1 
overall i like there food and the service 1 
the results well are a shame 0 
do not buy do not buyit sucks 0 
i highly recommend this device to everyone 1 
meredith m was better than all right 1 
great place to eat reminds me of the little mom and pop shops in the san francisco bay area 1 
a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it 1 
i recently had problems where i could not stay connected for more than 10 minutes before being disconnected 0 
by far the best cheesecurds we have ever had 1 
an awesome new look for fall 2000 1 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
down the drain because of a weak snap 0 
overall the film is interesting and thoughtprovoking 1 
there is simply no excuse for something this poorly done 0 
now this is a movie i really dislike 0 
they are so easy to love but even more easy to identify with 1 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
delicious and i will absolutely be back 1 
i would highly recommend this 1 
the new characters werent all that memorable and i found myself forgetting who was who 0 
i connected my wifes bluetoothmotorola hs850 to my phone and it worked like a charm whether the phone was in my pocket or the case 1 
however after finally watching this film i realized that not only had i had a closed mind to the brilliance it depicts i also found myself watching it over and over again 1 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in 0 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
otherwise easy to install and use clear sound 1 
how can you call yourself a steakhouse if you cant properly cook a steak i dont understand 0 
regardless the film fails on most levels 0 
the cow tongue and cheek tacos are amazing 1 
this is high adventure at its best 1 
restored my phone to like new performance 1 
the burger had absolutely no flavor the meat itself was totally bland the burger was overcooked and there was no charcoal flavor 0 
the earpiece on this is too large or too heavyit keeps falling out of my ear 0 
but the convoluted plot just didnt convince me and much of the film was watched with a weird questioning glance 0 
the chicken wings contained the driest chicken meat i have ever eaten 0 
not impressed 0 
so i basically threw my money out the window for nothing 0 
everything was good and tasty 1 
logitech bluetooth headset is a 10 1 
during several different 2 minute calls i experienced 5 drops and it was in an area that had 5 bars 0 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
i have two more years left in this contract and i hate this phone 0 
server did a great job handling our large rowdy table 1 
the food was barely lukewarm so it must have been sitting waiting for the server to bring it out to us 0 
good quality 1 
what a great double cheeseburger 1 
i loved it it was really scary 1 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
having to humour him just to get by and get through the day was so apt 1 
characters are onedimensional even the good guys and especially the bad guys 0 
it was probably dirt 0 
that was done in the second movie 0 
i wish i could return the unit and get back my money 0 
each day of the week they have a different deal and its all so delicious 1 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
a must study for anyone interested in the worst sins of industrial design 0 
anyways the food was definitely not filling at all and for the price you pay you should expect more 0 
tasted like dirt 0 
what a mistake 0 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
food is way overpriced and portions are fucking small 0 
when my mom and i got home she immediately got sick and she only had a few bites of salad 0 
buttons are too small 0 
very very fun chef 1 
this is an extraordinary film 1 
great software for motorolas 1 
and it was boring 0 
while i managed to bend the leaf spring back in place the metal now has enough stress that it will break on the next drop 0 
good value works fine power via usb car or wall outlet 1 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
i didnt want the clip going over the top of my ear causing discomfort 0 
the movie is not completely perfect but titta di girolamo will stay with you for a long time after the vision of the movie 1 
at no point in the proceedings does it look remotely like america 0 
item arrived quickly and works great with my metro pcs samsung schr450 slider phone and sony premium sound in ear plugs 1 
you can find better movies at youtube 0 
excellent sound battery life and inconspicuous to boot 1 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
now you know why i gave it a 10 1 
i received it quickly and it works great 1 
the flair bartenders are absolutely amazing 1 
i used bitpim a free program you can find on the internetto transfer data to the phonethe price of the cable was excellent 1 
we ordered the duck rare and it was pink and tender on the inside with a nice char on the outside 1 
this phone is pretty sturdy and ive never had any large problems with it 1 
they do not care about the consumer one bit 0 
what a big waste of time 0 
his costars dont fare much better with people like morgan freeman jonah hill and ed helms just wasted 0 
unfortunately this is a bad movie that is just plain bad 0 
the battery runs down quickly 0 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
the characters are interesting even if a bit predictable 1 
i was able to do voice dialing in the car with no problem 1 
we wont be returning 0 
the ambiance isnt much better 0 
what happened next was prettyoff putting 0 
the ri style calamari was a joke 0 
the food sucked which we expected but it sucked more than we could have imagined 0 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
great food and awesome service 1 
works for me 1 
the place was fairly clean but the food simply wasnt worth it 0 
which are small and not worth the price 0 
worst foodservice ive had in a while 0 
their regular toasted bread was equally satisfying with the occasional pats of butter mmmm 1 
definitely a bargain 1 
first of all there are enough racial stereotypes and racial jokes to offend everyone 0 
you wont regret it 1 
i wont be back 0 
as for the killer dont expect anything original or even remotely frightening 0 
it is an excellent drama an excellent thriller and an excellent film 1 
the cashier had no care what so ever on what i had to say it still ended up being wayyy overpriced 0 
it was delicious 1 
bt50 battery junk 0 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
the sound is clear and the people i talk to on it are amazed at the quality too 1 
very disappointed 0 
people couldnt hear me talk and i had to pull out the earphone and talk on the phone 0 
it is not good 0 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
my husband said she was very rude did not even apologize for the bad food or anything 0 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
this is not moviemaking 0 
the aerial scenes were welldone 1 
not what i wanted 0 
it was that loudglad to say that the plantronics 510 maintains a flawless connection to my cell and with no static during normal use 1 
highly recommended for all ages although the younger set will probably not appreciate some of the more subtle references they will certainly appreciate one galley scene in particular 1 
the visual effects were awful 0 
it defeats the purpose of a bluetooth headset 0 
but i definitely would not eat here again 0 
all things considered a job very well done 1 
i got home to see the driest damn wings ever 0 
director paul matthews who also wrotedirected the weak 1995 monster movie grim clearly doesnt know how to pace his films 0 
yes i am simplifying things here for the sake of brevity for this really is at the core of the problems with this film it has too much going on without any real fulfilling explanation 0 
although i very much liked the look and sound of this place the actual experience was a bit disappointing 0 
favorite place in town for shawarrrrrrma 1 
the lighting is awful 0 
in addition to having one of the most lovely songs ever written french cancan also boasts one of the cutest leading ladies ever to grace the screen 1 
everyone is very attentive providing excellent customer service 1 
i wouldnt return 0 
its not user friendly 0 
the phone was unusable and was not new 0 
mobile phone tools are a must have 1 
love this product 1 
this is an excellent tool especially when paired with your phones autoanswer 1 
lately they have been extremely nice and helpful on the phone 1 
it was packed 0 
this is not moviemaking 0 
a fantastic neighborhood gem 1
