the acting by the whole cast could be put on a scale and balanced perfectly between overacting and underacting 0 
the worst phone from samsungcrap this crappy samsung e715 is the worst i have ever seeen 0 
meredith m was better than all right 1 
we started with the tuna sashimi which was brownish in color and obviously wasnt fresh 0 
this phone is very fast with sending any kind of messages and web browsing is significantly faster than previous phones i have used 1 
all the actors give a wonderful performance especially jennifer rubin as jamie harris who changes from the nervous starlet in the beginning through the strange events she is part of to the cool star 1 
the construction of the headsets is poor 0 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
how awesome is that 1 
the sweet potato tots were good but the onion rings were perfection or as close as i have had 1 
i am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this 1 
i love the ringtones because they are so upbeat 1 
yet i enjoy watching it 1 
go watch it 1 
if good intentions made a film great then this film might be one of the greatest films ever made 1 
its very slow 0 
all the other cases ive tried normally fall apart after a few months but this one seems to be in for the long haul 1 
very bad experience 0 
no actress has been worse used that june allison in this movie 0 
good show samsung 1 
highly entertaining at all angles 1 
it works 1 
this is a good battery and it got here really fast 1 
the characters are interesting and you really care for them 1 
excellent dualpurpose headset 1 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
i am very impressed with the job that motorola did on the sturdiness of this phone 1 
took an hour to get our food only 4 tables in restaurant my food was luke warm our sever was running around like he was totally overwhelmed 0 
the structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema 1 
predictable but not a bad watch 1 
its not what it says it is 0 
the ripped banana was not only ripped but petrified and tasteless 0 
he really didnt seem to want to be hosting his voiceovers were monotonous didnt get involved with the guests 0 
of course the acting is blah 0 
i have recommended it to friends 1 
i loved it it was really scary 1 
there is a lot of beautiful places 1 
they have a plethora of salads and sandwiches and everything ive tried gets my seal of approval 1 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
it was a long time that i didnt see a so charismatic actor on screen 1 
very disappointing 0 
the chips that came out were dripping with grease and mostly not edible 0 
magical help 1 
wasted two hours 0 
i left with a stomach ache and felt sick the rest of the day 0 
this is a witty and delightful adaptation of the dr seuss book brilliantly animated by upas finest and thoroughly deserving of its academy award 1 
we walked away stuffed and happy about our first vegas buffet experience 1 
we recently witnessed her poor quality of management towards other guests as well 0 
avoid at all costs 0 
overall i like this place a lot 1 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
but now i was completely grossed out 0 
i had to wait over 30 minutes to get my drink and longer to get 2 arepas 0 
insults profound deuchebaggery and had to go outside for a smoke break while serving just to solidify it 0 
i had a seriously solid breakfast here 1 
reception is terrible and full of static 0 
awsome device works great 1 
definitely worth checking out 1 
how awesome is that 1 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
the only consistent thread holding the series together were the amazing performances of leni parker and anita laselva as the two taelons in quiet idealogical conflict 0 
john wayne did an incredible job for being so young in the movie industry 1 
i think i was one of the people who found this another one of roths pearls 1 
gave up trying to eat any of the crust teeth still sore 0 
the movie in movie situations in the beginning and through the game that is played with her by the acting coach are fascinating 1 
the story is beyond stupid 0 
the bipolarity of the ruthless thug one minute a ruthless killer the next minute a luvs diaper commercial is completely unconvincing 0 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
no ear loop needed its tiny and the sound is great 1 
due to this happening on every call i was forced to stop using this headset 0 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurv√•g being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
delete this film from your mind 0 
all of the main players are mesmerising 1 
it dit not work most of the time with my nokia 5320 0 
the classic maine lobster roll was fantastic 1 
the chips that came out were dripping with grease and mostly not edible 0 
dont waste your time watching this rubbish nonresearched film 0 
the steak and the shrimp are in my opinion the best entrees at gc 1 
the owners are super friendly and the staff is courteous 1 
he deserves 5 stars 1 
poor product 0 
the best place in vegas for breakfast just check out a sat or sun 1 
i kept looking at the time and it had soon become 35 minutes yet still no food 0 
it is very comfortable to wear as well which is probably the most important aspect about using a case 1 
theres really nothing bad i can say about this headset 0 
you cant relate with them hell you barely can understand them 0 
an instant classic with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits 1 
this was a different cut than the piece the other day but still wonderful and tender s well as well flavored 1 
very cheap plastic creaks like an old wooden floor 0 
here in the wind and the lion we see a wonderful rendering of americas own imperial age 1 
the roast beef sandwich tasted really good 1 
in fact its hard to remember that the part of ray charles is being acted and not played by the man himself 1 
sorry i will not be getting food from here anytime soon 0 
thus far have only visited twice and the food was absolutely delicious each time 1 
i wear it everyday and it holds up very well 1 
nobody identifies with these characters because theyre all cardboard cutouts and stereotypes or predictably reversestereotypes 0 
it felt too light and tinny 0 
i work in the hospitality industry in paradise valley and have refrained from recommending cibo any longer 0 
this item is great installed it let it charged up overnite and it has been working good every since with no problems 1 
we waited an hour for what was a breakfast i could have done 100 times better at home 0 
dont do it 0 
that was nice 1 
i love this phone 1 
enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film 1 
doesnt hold charge 0 
the real disappointment was our waiter 0 
this is one of the best italian thrillers of the early 70s 1 
i really hope the team behind this movie makes more movies and that they will continue to do so in their own some kinda weird style 1 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
the food wasnt good 0 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
i loved it it was really scary 1 
another note about this phones appearance is that it really looks rather bland especially in the all black model 0 
i as well wouldve given godfathers zero stars if possible 0 
they never brought a salad we asked for 0 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
wow what a bad film 0 
i checked out this place a couple years ago and was not impressed 0 
i really wanted the plantronics 510 to be the right one but it has too many issues for methe good 0 
characters are onedimensional even the good guys and especially the bad guys 0 
the cast is always entertaining as usual 1 
both of the egg rolls were fantastic 1 
seems like a good quick place to grab a bite of some familiar pub food but do yourself a favor and look elsewhere 0 
i wont be back 0 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
sorry i will not be getting food from here anytime soon 0 
its pure brilliance 1 
this was like the final blow 0 
it has been a winner for us 1 
add betty white and jean smart and you have a great cast everyone played their parts really well 1 
there is nothing privileged about workingeating there 0 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
also if your phone is dropped this case is not going to save it specially when dropped face down 0 
the restaurant atmosphere was exquisite 1 
aside from its terrible lead this film has loads of other debits 0 
the cow tongue and cheek tacos are amazing 1 
this is not moviemaking 0 
you cant go wrong with any of the food here 1 
you truly take this journey through the eyes and soul of a child 1 
the success of the film depends on the casting of sydney greenstreet as the alexander yardley character 1 
very disappointing 0 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
if you love death and decay and shakespears lyrics this is the one 1 
but this movie is definitely a below average rent 0 
the atmosphere was great with a lovely duo of violinists playing songs we requested 1 
i have seen many movies starring jaclyn smith but my god this was one of her best though it came out 12 years ago 1 
great for ipods too 1 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
clear skype calls long battery life long range 1 
i wouldnt see this movie again for free 0 
it has northern humour and positive about the community it represents 1 
setup couldnt have been simpler 1 
wont ever go here again 0 
you wont be disappointed 1 
what i really like there is the crepe station 1 
i started this review with two stars but im editing it to give it only one 0 
nice headset priced right 1 
its this pandering to the audience that sabotages most of his films 0 
i came back today since they relocated and still not impressed 0 
the fries were not hot and neither was my burger 0 
leopard print is wonderfully wild 1 
the mic there is a joke and the volume is quite low 0 
the screen size is big key pad lit well enough and the camera quality is excellent for a camera phone 1 
its so bad its actually worth seeing just for that reason 0 
will be back again 1 
linked to my phone without effort 1 
i cannot make calls at certain places 0 
the bipolarity of the ruthless thug one minute a ruthless killer the next minute a luvs diaper commercial is completely unconvincing 0 
these are the nicest restaurant owners ive ever come across 1 
started watching this but didnt believe in any of the characters 0 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
third the cheese on my friends burger was cold 0 
this is an excellent film 1 
freezes frequently4 0 
i have eaten here multiple times and each time the food was delicious 1 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
if you dont find it too bad as again the unit comes with one earpad onlyi would not recommend this to anyone 0 
the acting helps the writing along very well maybe the idiotsavant sister could have been played better and it is a real joy to watch 1 
this place is not worth your time let alone vegas 0 
omit watching this 0 
i totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is 1 
couldnt use the unit with sunglasses not good in texas 0 
not sure who was more lost the flat characters or the audience nearly half of whom walked out 0 
for the price on amazon it is an excellent product which i would highly recommend 1 
very windresistant 1 
i give wirefly 1 stari will contact cingularatt and inform them of this practice 0 
everything captain howdy says is either laughable or just plain stupid 0 
the servers went back and forth several times not even so much as an are you being helped 0 
what a mistake that was 0 
nice ambiance 1 
very windresistant 1 
the steak and the shrimp are in my opinion the best entrees at gc 1 
one of the worst shows of all time 0 
needless to say i wont be going back anytime soon 0 
though the wind and the lion is told largely through the eyes of the son every member of the family can identify with one of the characters whether it be sean connerys noble brigand candace bergens feisty heroine john hustons wily john hay or steve kanalys spiffy radiant ruthless cando lieutenant roosevelts big stick 1 
but despite these few flaws this case is of exceptional quality and well worth the additional costs of owning an official oem product 1 
the spaghetti is nothing special whatsoever 0 
if you simply want a small flip phone look elsewhere as the extra bells whistles are mediocre 0 
babie bop is very cute 1 
dont buy this product 0 
terrible management 0 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
the memories are murky but i can only say that i enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show 1 
dont waste your time watching this rubbish nonresearched film 0 
the scenes are often funny and occasionally touching as the characters evaluate their lives and where they are going 1 
the structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema 1 
its aggravating 0 
i literally vomited while watching this film 0 
the range is very decent ive been able to roam around my house with the phone in the living room with no receptionsound quality issues 1 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
their research and development division obviously knows what theyre doing 1 
2 thumbs up to this seller 1 
great product fast shipping 1 
imdb ratings only go as low 1 for awful its time to get some negative numbers in there for cases such as these 0 
how can you call yourself a steakhouse if you cant properly cook a steak i dont understand 0 
the good cinematography also makes her and monica bellucci look very beautiful 1 
excellent sound quality 1 
its a campy sort of film thats a joy to watch 1 
his costars dont fare much better with people like morgan freeman jonah hill and ed helms just wasted 0 
shrimp when i unwrapped it i live only 12 a mile from brushfire it was literally ice cold 0 
i would give this television series a 10 plus if i could 1 
nice blanket of moz over top but i feel like this was done to cover up the subpar food 1 
highquality chicken on the chicken caesar salad 1 
audio quality is poor very poor 0 
the buttons for on and off are bad 0 
the potatoes were great and so was the biscuit 1 
he deserves 5 stars 1 
garbo who showed right off the bat that her talents could carry over from the silent era i wanted to see some of her silent work but netflix doesnt seem to be stocking them 1 
this place is like chipotle but better 1 
this film offers many delights and surprises 1 
loved itfriendly servers great food wonderful and imaginative menu 1 
ive owned this phone for 7 months now and can say that its the best mobile phone ive had 1 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
during several different 2 minute calls i experienced 5 drops and it was in an area that had 5 bars 0 
the camera really likes her in this movie 1 
you get incredibly fresh fish prepared with care 1 
nice headset priced right 1 
i particularly remember my senses being assaulted by strident cords of music that would blare out with very little warning and even less meaning 0 
it was pretty gross 0 
later i found myself lost in the power of the film 1 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
the cocktails are all handmade and delicious 1 
if you hate earbugs avoid this phone by all means 0 
service sucks 0 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
you get what you pay for i guess 0 
motorola finally got the voice quality of a bluetooth headset right 1 
im probably one of the few people to ever go to ians and not like it 0 
ive had no trouble accessing the internet downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions 1 
highly unprofessional and rude to a loyal patron 0 
the characters are fleshed out surprisingly well particularly grimes and blake and all the actors deliver their sharply scripted lines with just the right amount of deadpan tongue in cheek to make the dialogue both hilarious and realistic 1 
terrible phone holder 0 
great software for motorolas 1 
this second appearance of mickey mouse following the silent plane crazy earlier that year is probably his most famous filmmostly because it was so groundbreaking 1 
easily none other cartoon made me laugh in a tender way before getting into dark sitcoms oriented for teenagers 1 
none of the new ones have ever quite worked properly 0 
weve tried to like this place but after 10 times i think were done with them 0 
very clear quality sound and you dont have to mess with the sound on your ipod since you have the sound buttons on the headset 1 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
strike 2 who wants to be rushed 0 
for that price i can think of a few place i would have much rather gone 0 
my 5year old nokia 2160 from tracfone holds the charge a lot better than this 0 
never got it 0 
the attention given to every character and complex psychological portrayals detailing loyalty treachery love and hope are tremendous 1 
highly unrecommended 0 
lovely little thriller from hitchcock with lots of nice shenanigans surrounding a murdered spy a kidnapped child a nasty church a foreign plot and some random taxidermists 1 
not sure who was more lost the flat characters or the audience nearly half of whom walked out 0 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
to summarize the food was incredible nay transcendant but nothing brings me joy quite like the memory of the pneumatic condiment dispenser 1 
warning stay away 0 
the only thing i wasnt too crazy about was their guacamole as i dont like it pur√©ed 0 
his performance is simply genius 1 
i am a fan of his this movie sucked really bad 0 
both do good jobs and are quite amusing 1 
but it wasnt until i watched this film that i realised how great he actually was 1 
just what i wanted 1 
shrimp when i unwrapped it i live only 12 a mile from brushfire it was literally ice cold 0 
this is a great little item 1 
down the drain because of a weak snap 0 
the plot has more holes than a pair of fishnet stockings and the direction and editing is astonishingly ham fisted 0 
the menu is always changing food quality is going down service is extremely slow 0 
fantastic earphones 1 
this little device has transformed my organizational capability and made my life a whole lot easier 1 
awesome service and food 1 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
to my disbelief each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods i have ever tasted 0 
couldnt ask for a more satisfying meal 1 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
this place deserves one star and 90 has to do with the food 0 
it was too predictable even for a chick flick 0 
the loudspeaker option is great the bumpers with the lights is very appealing 0 
all in all an excellent restaurant highlighted by great service a unique menu and a beautiful setting 1 
i am so pleased to know such a modern day genius is out there letting is passion for art drive him and taking us as an audience with him 1 
i find this inexcusable and so will probably be returning this phone and perhaps changing carriers 0 
walked in and the place smelled like an old grease trap and only 2 others there eating 0 
i gave it 5 stars then and im giving it 5 stars now 1 
the whole experience was underwhelming and i think well just go to ninja sushi next time 0 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
the only thing really worth watching was the scenery and the house because it is beautiful 1 
instead we got a bore fest about a whiny spoiled brat babysitting 0 
ive bought 5 wired headphones that sound better than these 0 
great brunch spot 1 
thus far have only visited twice and the food was absolutely delicious each time 1 
the microphone also works well but according to people i have called it applifies everything 1 
it never condescends all the characters have good genuine hearts and believable problems 1 
this phone is very fast with sending any kind of messages and web browsing is significantly faster than previous phones i have used 1 
appears to actually outperform the original battery from china that came with my v325i 1 
the meat was pretty dry i had the sliced brisket and pulled pork 0 
the vanilla ice cream was creamy and smooth while the profiterole choux pastry was fresh enough 1 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
the worst one of the series 0 
i think i was one of the people who found this another one of roths pearls 1 
delicious nyc bagels good selections of cream cheese real lox with capers even 1 
used and dirty 0 
the headset fulfills my requirements so i am happy with my purchase 1 
the black eyed peas and sweet potatoes unreal 1 
but kevin spacey is an excellent verbal tsunami as buddy ackerman ¬ñ and totally believable because he is a great actor 1 
the greek dressing was very creamy and flavorful 1 
the soundtrack sucked 0 
i will be back many times soon 1 
they know how to make them here 1 
for a product that costs as much as this one does i expect it to work far better and with greater ease than this thing does 0 
the result is a powerhouse achievement made more timely now perhaps because of our cultures disturbing fascination with celebrity and its distorted interpretations of fame 1 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
really awful 0 
the movie is terribly boring in places 0 
it came free with a dvd player i bought but i still turned the thing off halfway through because i was embarrassed for howell 0 
level 5 spicy was perfect where spice didnt overwhelm the soup 1 
it is very comfortable to wear as well which is probably the most important aspect about using a case 1 
i have tried these cables with my computer and my ipod and it works just fine 1 
a truly truly bad film 0 
not good when wearing a hat or sunglasses 0 
this film highlights the fundamental flaws of the legal process that its not about discovering guilt or innocence but rather is about who presents better in court 1 
this review is long overdue since i consider a tale of two sisters to be the single greatest film ever made 1 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
2 times very bad customer service 0 
wed definitely go back here again 1 
i dont know exactly what it is about this movie but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our familys memories 1 
dont buy it 0 
the story is also both funny and poignant at times 1 
i love this bluetooth 1 
i had a pretty satifying experience 1 
i guess it was supposed to be clever twist then shed some light on the situation but it was just stupid 0 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
this movie is a good and humorous comment on life in 2006 1 
it is zillion times away from reality 0 
the secondary plot line is incomprehensible and its relation to the primary plot line is mystifying 0 
this is the kind of money that is wasted properly 1 
this was reflected not only in the cast but also in the belowpar script which borrowed much from the earlier classic 0 
i recently had problems where i could not stay connected for more than 10 minutes before being disconnected 0 
i advise you to look out for it 1 
good case 1 
the ngage is still lacking in earbuds 0 
anne heche was utterly convincing 1 
very dissapointing performance 0 
just reading on the specs alone makes you say wow 1 
battery life is also great 1 
nice spicy and tender 1 
not a good bargain 0 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
this place is good 1 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
my salad had a bland vinegrette on the baby greens and hearts of palm 0 
sam shepards portrayal of a gung ho marine was sobering 1 
ambience is perfect 1 
i have tried these cables with my computer and my ipod and it works just fine 1 
the buffet at bellagio was far from what i anticipated 0 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
i was bored throughout the whole damn thing 0 
the fries were not hot and neither was my burger 0 
worst thai ever 0 
i love all the features and form factor 1 
unfortunately the ability to actually know you are receiving a call is a rather important feature and this phone is pitiful in that respect 0 
due to this happening on every call i was forced to stop using this headset 0 
i totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is 1 
very funny 1 
couldnt figure it out 0 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
couldnt use the unit with sunglasses not good in texas 0 
ambience is perfect 1 
thanks again to amazon for having the things i need for a good price 1 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
it was so funny 1 
after two i felt disgusting 0 
the cast is always entertaining as usual 1 
bad script bad direction and horrible acting make this one plain bad 0 
its aggravating 0 
the script is a big flawed mess 0 
the script is was there a script 0 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
great phone 1 
i struggle to find anything bad to say about it 1 
why was this film made 0 
camera color balance is awful 0 
everything captain howdy says is either laughable or just plain stupid 0 
setup couldnt have been simpler 1 
a lot of websites have been rating this a very good phone and so do i 1 
i as well wouldve given godfathers zero stars if possible 0 
thats how id describe this painfully dreary timewaster of a film 0 
crisp and clear 1 
it is light has plenty of battery capacity and is very confortable to wear for somewhat extended periods of time 1 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
i love this device 1 
pretty awesome place 1 
too bad you have to pay up to a month for the service 0 
waaaaaayyyyyyyyyy over rated is all i am saying 0 
this place is way too overpriced for mediocre food 0 
we had 7 at our table and the service was pretty fast 1 
the noise shield is incrediable 1 
it has all the features i want 1 
unfortunately it will not recharge my iphone 4s despite connecting it from multiple power sources imac external battery wall outlet etc 0 
couldnt ask for a more satisfying meal 1 
the worst one of the series 0 
the basic premise is wasted since it is sidelined by the inexplicable focus on the documentary crew 0 
my salad had a bland vinegrette on the baby greens and hearts of palm 0 
he also came back to check on us regularly excellent service 1 
dont waste your money 0 
trying to make a call on these is an exercise in frustration 0 
im big fan of rpg games too but this movie its a disgrace to any selfrespecting rpger there is 0 
graphics is far from the best part of the game 0 
the goat taco didnt skimp on the meat and wow what flavor 1 
third the cheese on my friends burger was cold 0 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
the voice recognition thru the handset is excellent 1 
i sat riveted to the tv screen 1 
the inside is really quite nice and very clean 1 
garbo who showed right off the bat that her talents could carry over from the silent era i wanted to see some of her silent work but netflix doesnt seem to be stocking them 1 
bad fit way too big 0 
i have recommended it to friends 1 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
definitely not worth the 3 i paid 0 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
new battery works great in phone 1 
schrader has made a resume full of lousy amateurish films 0 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
works good 1 
every time he opened his mouth you expect to hear you see kids pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show 0 
i wont be back 0 
not good enough for the price 0 
they never brought a salad we asked for 0 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
crisp and clear 1 
its like a bad two hour tv movie 0 
his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic 1 
everything is appalling 0 
all i can do is whine on the internet so here it goesthe more i use the thing the less i like it 0 
this movie contained an allstar cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i havent seen before 1 
it is a true classic 1 
i highly recommend this device to everyone 1 
it was just too horrible 0 
funny clever hip just like prays previous film hype 1 
it was so bad i had lost the heart to finish it 0 
as many people complained i found this headsets microphone was very weak 0 
great food 1 
is it possible for a movie to get any worse than this 0 
now imagine that every single one of those decisions was made wrong 0 
saggy floppy piece of junk 0 
they know how to make them here 1 
for the price on amazon it is an excellent product which i would highly recommend 1 
cooked to perfection and the service was impeccable 1 
trying to make a call on these is an exercise in frustration 0 
bt50 battery junk 0 
and dont even get me started on the jerky camerawork 0 
the macarons here are insanely good 1 
terrible phone holder 0 
other than that the leather is nice and soft the fit is very tight the cut out for the face is a good shape 1 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of qu√©bec 0 
i found this place by accident and i could not be happier 1 
frankly after cotton club and unfaithful it was kind of embarrassing to watch lane and gere in this film because it is bad 0 
total brunch fail 0 
now the pizza itself was good the peanut sauce was very tasty 1 
he is one of my favourite directors and one of the most talented directors in the history of cinema 1 
it finds my cell phone right away when i enter the car 1 
plug was the wrong size 0 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
really ugly 0 
great food and great service in a clean and friendly setting 1 
the steaks are all well trimmed and also perfectly cooked 1 
kind of hard to mess up a steak but they did 0 
service is quick and friendly 1 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
there is no plot or storyline 0 
not as good as i had hoped 0 
the wind and the lion is well written and superbly acted 1 
i do think tom hanks is a good actor 1 
food was so gooodd 1 
this movie is terrible 0 
and finally after all that we get to an ending that wouldve been great had it been handled by competent people and not jerry falwell 0 
piece of junk 0 
i bought this phone as a replacement for my startac and have regretted it since 0 
they have a plethora of salads and sandwiches and everything ive tried gets my seal of approval 1 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
i will not be eating there again 0 
reaching for the bottom row is uncomfortable and the send and end keys are not where i expect them to be3 0 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
a good commentary of todays love and undoubtedly a film worth seeing 1 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
restaurant is always full but never a wait 1 
while you dont yet hear mickey speak there are tons of sound effects and music throughout the filmsomething we take for granted now but which was a huge crowd pleaser in 1928 1 
from here on the widmark character turns unintentionally comical 0 
it plays louder than any other speaker of this size the price is so low that most would think the quality is lacking however its not 1 
later i found myself lost in the power of the film 1 
i left the theater with a lilt in my step joy in my heart and hope for the human race 1 
didnt laugh or even smile once 0 
highly recommended a 1 
but i thought his acting was skilled 1 
youd have to have the iq of particularly stupid mollusk not to see that one coming 0 
god and i can never get that 90 minutes back 0 
i dont each much pasta but i love the homemade hand made pastas and thin pizzas here 1 
nothing short of magnificent photographycinematography in this film 1 
i was left shattered from the experience of watching this film and i took a good two hours to fully recover 0 
what should have been a hilarious yummy christmas eve dinner to remember was the biggest fail of the entire trip for us 0 
everything is appalling 0 
the battery life is highly unacceptable 0 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
the pan cakes everyone are raving about taste like a sugary disaster tailored to the palate of a six year old 0 
one of the best mexican movies ever and one of the less understood even by mexican themselves no matter how identified the should have felt with it 1 
but whatever it was that cost them so much it didnt translate to quality thats for sure 0 
the worst experience ever 0 
crust is not good 0 
its a great item 1 
setup couldnt have been simpler 1 
one character is totally annoying with a voice that gives me the feeling of fingernails on a chalkboard 0 
i love this device 1 
a greasy unhealthy meal 0 
a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it 1 
the concert sequences just sucked 0 
this movie was kind of long in length but i enjoyed every minute of it 1 
this movie does an excellent job of revealing the complexity of the task and the incredible challenges facing south africa 1 
everything on the menu is terrific and we were also thrilled that they made amazing accommodations for our vegetarian daughter 1 
i especially love the long battery life 1 
barney is definitely super de duper 1 
it crackles with an unpredictable youthful energy but honestly i found it hard to follow and concentrate on it meanders so badly 0 
i still maintain that monkeys shouldnt make headphones we just obviously dont share enough dna to copy the design over to humans 0 
the service was not up to par either 0 
only like 3 or 4 buildings used a couple of locations maybe poor hummh 0 
putting the race card aside lets look at the major flaw in the film they destroy latifas character 0 
for a self proclaimed coffee cafe i was wildly disappointed 0 
as an earlier review noted plug in this charger and nothing happens 0 
i have seen many movies starring jaclyn smith but my god this was one of her best though it came out 12 years ago 1 
finally after three or four times the spring of the latch broke and i could not use it any longer on the visor 0 
the service was a little slow considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace 0 
one of the worst shows of all time 0 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
i dont think ill be running back to carlys anytime soon for food 0 
in a word it is embarrassing 0 
it was a riot to see hugo weaving play a sexobsessed gay real estate salesman who uses his clients houses for his trysts with the flaming darren tom hollander 1 
all the bread is made inhouse 1 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
how can you call yourself a steakhouse if you cant properly cook a steak i dont understand 0 
the staff was very attentive 1 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
this item worked great but it broke after 6 months of use 0

great bluetooth 1 
i was seated immediately 1 
i always order from the vegetarian menu during dinner which has a wide array of options to choose from 1 
i would recommend it 1 
dessert panna cotta was amazing 1 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
what a mistake that was 0 
the only thing really worth watching was the scenery and the house because it is beautiful 1 
i love this place 1 
it is indescribably the most annoying and idiotic show i have ever seen 0 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
in fact its hard to remember that the part of ray charles is being acted and not played by the man himself 1 
what on earth is irons doing in this film 0 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
im returning them 0 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
i was deeply impressed with the character he played 1 
very tough and very short on flavor 0 
you share general loewenhielms exquisite joy in his partaking of the cailles en sarcophage even though you are just watching a movie but you do wish for just a small sample to savor 1 
i have had tmobile service for 2 or 3 years now and i am pretty happy with it 1 
omg the food was delicioso 1 
so far so good 1 
disapointing results 0 
awesome selection of beer 1 
in particular the relationship between the bakery assistant and the waitress just didnt work for me at all 0 
verizon tech support walked my through a few procedures none of which worked and i ended up having to do a hard reset wiping out all my data 0

tried to go here for lunch and it was a madhouse 0 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
im not impressed with the concept or the food 0 
the instruction manual is lacking 0 
frankly after cotton club and unfaithful it was kind of embarrassing to watch lane and gere in this film because it is bad 0 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
this film has no redeeming features 0 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
the nano stated itmy son was dissapointed 0 
each track commands sentiment actually contributing to the scenes and characters 1 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
after my phone got to be about a year old its been slowly breaking despite much care on my part 0 
the salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop which was perfectly cooked 1 
it was either too cold not enough flavor or just bad 0 
great pork sandwich 1 
coming here is like experiencing an underwhelming relationship where both parties cant wait for the other person to ask to break up 0 
i gave it 5 stars then and im giving it 5 stars now 1 
okay i like to consider myself a fair critic so ill give credit where credits duethe creature effects were actually pretty cool 1 
the plot well i said id let that one go 0 
great pork sandwich 1 
babie bop is very cute 1 
do not buy if you want to use the holster 0 
today was my first taste of a buldogis gourmet hot dog and i have to tell you it was more than i ever thought possible 1 
it is rare when a filmmaker takes the time to tell a worthy moral tale with care and love that doesnt fall into the trap of being overly syrupy or over indulgent 1 
elias koteasjack palance play good roles angelina is hot and gets nakedbilly drago appears in this and is cool as usual a cameo by sven ole thorsen helps make this a very enjoyable movie with good acting and a decent budget 1 
there are massive levels massive unlockable characters its just a massive game 1 
it has a great camera thats 2mp and the pics are nice and clear with great picture quality 1 
this film highlights the fundamental flaws of the legal process that its not about discovering guilt or innocence but rather is about who presents better in court 1 
this mostly routine factbased tv drama gets a boost from the fine performance by cole 1 
this is a great place to eat 1 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
the steak was amazingrge fillet relleno was the best seafood plate i have ever had 1 
would not recommend to others 0 
cooked to perfection and the service was impeccable 1 
they do not last forever but is not overly expensive to replaceeasy to operate and the sound is much better than others i have tried 1 
a week later after i activated it it suddenly died 0 
the service was terrible though 0 
my only problem is i thought the actor playing the villain was a low rent michael ironside 0

predictable but not a bad watch 1 
the chicken i got was definitely reheated and was only ok the wedges were cold and soggy 0 
the sangria was about half of a glass wine full and was 12 ridiculous 0 
there are so many problems i dont know where to start 0
