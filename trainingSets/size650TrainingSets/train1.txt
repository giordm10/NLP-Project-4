if you havent gone here go now 1 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
it kept getting worse and worse so now im officially done 0 
the kids are very cool too 1 
the food was excellent and service was very good 1 
sorry i will not be getting food from here anytime soon 0 
it quit working after id used it for about 18 months so i just purchased another one because this is the best headset ive ever owned 1 
i saw it as a child on tv back in 1973 when it was the stranger and i loved it 1 
so anyone near you will hear part of your conversation 0 
however bt headsets are currently not good for real time games like firstperson shooters since the audio delay messes me up 0 
the acting was bad the dialogs were extremely shallow and insincere 0 
it wasnt busy at all and now we know why 0 
it will drive you barking mad 0 
hated it 0 
everything about this movie is stupid 0 
the things that the four kids get themselves into is absolutely hilarious to watch 1 
i gave it 5 stars then and im giving it 5 stars now 1 
lets start with all the problemsthe acting especially from the lead professor was very very bad 0 
no one at the table thought the food was above average or worth the wait that we had for it 0 
dont bother go to the store 0 
juano hernandez an exceptional actor who played supporting roles in many films of the era is a proud black man who is accused of murdering a white man in the south 1 
buyerbe very careful 0 
and then tragedy struck 0 
we had so much to say about the place before we walked in that he expected it to be amazing but was quickly disappointed 0 
the movie showed a lot of florida at its best made it look very appealing 1 
it is not good 0 
this is truly an art movieit actually has a lot of art in it 1 
great place to relax and have an awesome burger and beer 1 
an instant classic with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits 1 
he is one of my favourite directors and one of the most talented directors in the history of cinema 1 
howeverthe riingtones are not the best and neither are the games 0 
this phone is pretty sturdy and ive never had any large problems with it 1 
they know how to make them here 1 
the service was poor and thats being nice 0 
the success of the film depends on the casting of sydney greenstreet as the alexander yardley character 1 
will order from them again 1 
the first time i ever came here i had an amazing experience i still tell people how awesome the duck was 1 
the handsfree part works fine but then the car tries to download the address book and the treo rebootsoverall i still rate this device high 1 
the performances are real and gripping the crocdodile is extremely well done indeed if the black water website is to be believed thats because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous 1 
pretty cool i would say 1 
its just lame 0 
great price too 1 
the refried beans that came with my meal were dried out and crusty and the food was bland 0 
gets the job done 1 
coming here is like experiencing an underwhelming relationship where both parties cant wait for the other person to ask to break up 0 
we asked for the bill to leave without eating and they didnt bring that either 0 
there are massive levels massive unlockable characters its just a massive game 1 
your brain will attempt to shutdown as part of a primal impulse of selfpreservation 0 
the film is way too long 0 
first off the reception sucks i have never had more than 2 bars ever 0 
overall the film is interesting and thoughtprovoking 1 
i always order from the vegetarian menu during dinner which has a wide array of options to choose from 1 
my rating just 3 out of 10 0 
you will leave the theater wanting to go out and dance under the stars 1 
the fact is this film is a wonderful heartwarming tale about two people chasing their dreams 1 
i love the scream movies and all horror movies and this one ranks way up there 1 
kieslowski never ceases to amaze me 1 
much less than the jawbone i was going to replace it with 1 
very bad experience 0 
good case excellent value 1 
this is a simple little phone to use but the breakage is unacceptible 0 
disappointment i hate anything that goes in my ear 0 
this is one of peter watkins most accessible films 1 
for that its worth checking out 1 
there is a lot of beautiful places 1 
customer service was terrible 0 
not recommended 0 
the descriptions said yum yum sauce and another said eel sauce yet another said spicy mayowell none of the rolls had sauces on them 0 
lifetime does not air it enough so if anyone knows what store sells it let me know because this is a musthave 1 
i can say that the desserts were yummy 1 
very good stuff for the price 1 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
it presents a idyllic yet serious portrayal of the ups and downs of the characters lives 1 
the steak and the shrimp are in my opinion the best entrees at gc 1 
i had about two bites and refused to eat anymore 0 
the potato chip order was sad i could probably count how many chips were in that box and it was probably around 12 0 
this place is handsdown one of the best places to eat in the phoenix metro area 1 
the use of slowmotion needlessly repeats itself throughout the movie but is well backed up by bad acting and bad is a kind word here no continuity scenes that are thrown in for no reason whatsoever vehicles that looked like they were made from a corn flakes box and a directorial style that bordered on stupidity 0 
heres where the movie really pied me off 0 
it plays louder than any other speaker of this size the price is so low that most would think the quality is lacking however its not 1 
sound quality on both end is excellent i use headset to call my wife and ask my wife to use headset to call me 2 1 
mic doesnt work 0 
the incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film 1 
food is way overpriced and portions are fucking small 0 
the acting helps the writing along very well maybe the idiotsavant sister could have been played better and it is a real joy to watch 1 
very good stuff for the price 1 
lightweight and works well 1 
after 3 months screen just went black all of a sudden 0 
were jerks on the phone 0 
it fits so securely that the ear hook does not even need to be used and the sound is better directed through your ear canal 1 
the fries were great too 1 
the burger i got the gold standard a 17 burger and was kind of disappointed 0 
maybe its just their vegetarian fare but ive been twice and i thought it was average at best 0 
it has kept up very well 1 
jawbone era is awesome too 1 
if you want a real scare rent this one 1 
like the other reviewer said you couldnt pay me to eat at this place again 0 
the concert sequences just sucked 0 
for that price i can think of a few place i would have much rather gone 0 
also makes it easier to hold on to 1 
very funny 1 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
not much dialogue not much music the whole film was shot as elaborately and aesthetically like a sculpture 1 
you need at least 3 mins to get to your phone book from the time you first turn on the phonebattery life is short 0 
i will not return 0 
ill definitely be in soon again 1 
great product for the price 1 
food is way overpriced and portions are fucking small 0 
it was a drive to get there 0 
also the area where my unit broke im not too fond of the magnetic strap 0 
awsome device works great 1 
its so stupid to have to keep buying new chargers car chargers cradles headphones and car kits every time a new phone comes out 0 
battery is holding up well 1 
total waste of time 0 
i cannot make calls at certain places 0 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
a piece of cinematic garbage captured on celluloid 0 
it rocked my world and is certainly a must see for anyone with no social or physical outlets 1 
the file browser offers all the options that one needshandsfree is great 1 
fantastic food 1 
we waited for forty five minutes in vain 0 
seller shipped quickly and much cheaper than the competitors 1 
gets a signal when other verizon phones wont 1 
disappointment i hate anything that goes in my ear 0 
i am going to have to be the first to negatively review this product 0 
im pleased 1 
it was pretty gross 0 
and it was way to expensive 0 
these were so good we ordered them twice 1 
it looks very nice 1 
i must say i have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again 1 
director paul matthews who also wrotedirected the weak 1995 monster movie grim clearly doesnt know how to pace his films 0 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
the vegetables are so fresh and the sauce feels like authentic thai 1 
if you are looking for a good quality motorola headset keep looking this isnt it 0 
the goat taco didnt skimp on the meat and wow what flavor 1 
food was average at best 0 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
still i do like this movie for its empowerment of women theres not enough movies out there like this one 1 
rude inconsiderate management 0 
the wind and the lion is well written and superbly acted 1 
the film gives meaning to the phrase never in the history of human conflict has so much been owed by so many to so few 1 
i got it because it was so small and adorable 1 
the dining space is tiny but elegantly decorated and comfortable 1 
attempting artiness with black white and clever camera angles the movie disappointed became even more ridiculous as the acting was poor and the plot and lines almost nonexistent 0 
yes its that bad 0 
i also decided not to send it back because our waitress looked like she was on the verge of having a heart attack 0 
i cant tell you how disappointed i was 0 
i had strawberry tea which was good 1 
that was done in the second movie 0 
after 20 minutes wait i got a table 0 
wed definitely go back here again 1 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
characters are onedimensional even the good guys and especially the bad guys 0 
dont bother coming here 0 
it finds my cell phone right away when i enter the car 1 
it fits so securely that the ear hook does not even need to be used and the sound is better directed through your ear canal 1 
walked in and the place smelled like an old grease trap and only 2 others there eating 0 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
made very sturdy 1 
the directing seems too pretentious 0 
is pretty funny 1 
waitress was a little slow in service 0 
it was equally awful 0 
i know that sounds funny but to me it seemed like sketchy technology that wouldnt work wellwell this one works great 1 
the chains which im no fan of beat this place easily 0 
im big fan of rpg games too but this movie its a disgrace to any selfrespecting rpger there is 0 
what did bother me was the slow service 0 
i mean in a realistic world she would never have gotten into that ballet repertory the whole thing was quite pathetic 0 
terrible product and waste of money 0 
the sergeant pepper beef sandwich with auju sauce is an excellent sandwich as well 1 
i promise they wont disappoint 1 
the acting was decidely wooden though no worse than a period universal b movie 0 
its a great item 1 
was not happy 0 
the feel of the dining room was more college cooking course than high class dining and the service was slow at best 0 
its hard not to fall headoverheels in love with that girl 1 
the presentation of the food was awful 0 
also the fries are without a doubt the worst fries ive ever had 0 
i also didnt like the on button it felt like it would crack with use 0 
tonight i had the elk filet specialand it sucked 0 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
again no plot at all 0 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
ive dropped my phone more times than i can say even on concrete and my phone is still great knock on wood 1 
nothing special 0 
very poor service 0 
it is shameful 0 
i had strawberry tea which was good 1 
we were promptly greeted and seated 1 
with great sound effects and impressive special effects i cant recommend this movie enough 1 
shrimp when i unwrapped it i live only 12 a mile from brushfire it was literally ice cold 0 
if you check the directors filmography on this site you will see why this film didnt have a chance 0 
the things that the four kids get themselves into is absolutely hilarious to watch 1 
i thoroughly enjoyed it when christopher eccleston took control of the tardis and the continuation of the series 1 
the company shipped my product very promptly and it works well 1 
great food and awesome service 1 
their frozen margaritas are way too sugary for my taste 0 
omg i felt like i had never eaten thai food until this dish 1 
this is not moviemaking 0 
but the duet between the astronaut and his doctor at the beginning of the movie is a perfect exchange if one considers that this movie was made well into the cold war and the astronauts biggest fear is that he has crashed in the ussr 1 
i like armand assante my cable companys summary sounded interesting so i watched it twice already and probably will again 1 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
i put the latest os on it v115g and it now likes to slow to a crawl and lock up every once in a while 0 
i bought two of them and neither will charge 0 
poor quality 0 
he is one of my favourite directors and one of the most talented directors in the history of cinema 1 
lot of holes in the plot theres nothing about how he became the emperor nothing about where he spend 20 years between his childhood and mature age 0 
heres where the movie really pied me off 0 
i have yet to run this new battery below two bars and thats three days without charging 1 
now this dish was quite flavourful 1 
fits comfortably came with three sizes of earbud tips 1 
reversible plug works great 1 
clear skype calls long battery life long range 1 
i connected my wifes bluetoothmotorola hs850 to my phone and it worked like a charm whether the phone was in my pocket or the case 1 
the potato chip order was sad i could probably count how many chips were in that box and it was probably around 12 0 
best tacos in town by far 1 
i ordered this for sony ericsson w810i but i think it only worked once thats when i first used it 0 
it failed to convey the broad sweep of landscapes that were a great part of the original 0 
in fact im going to round up to 4 stars just because she was so awesome 1 
i own 2 of these cases and would order another 1 
and sometimes it was so embarrassing that i had to look away 0 
good servicecheck 1 
it sure does beat the nachos at the movies but i would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant 0 
will order from them again 1 
service is perfect and the family atmosphere is nice to see 1 
putting the race card aside lets look at the major flaw in the film they destroy latifas character 0 
all in all its an insult to ones intelligence and a huge waste of money 0 
nice headset priced right 1 
it was delicious 1 
i give it 2 thumbs down 0 
the presentation of the food was awful 0 
i recommend this for everyone who loves film movies anythinga work of art 1 
it clicks into place in a way that makes you wonder how long that mechanism would last 0 
spend your money and time some place else 0 
it was either too cold not enough flavor or just bad 0 
nothing new there 0 
unfortunately it did not work 0 
i dont like this nokia either 0 
very easy to use 1 
in addition to having one of the most lovely songs ever written french cancan also boasts one of the cutest leading ladies ever to grace the screen 1 
the waitress and manager are so friendly 1 
how can that bethe audio quality is poor 0 
just as good as when i had it more than a year ago 1 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
seriously flavorful delights folks 1 
bluetooth range is good a few days ago i left my phone in the trunk got a call and carried the conversation without a hitch 1 
drinks took close to 30 minutes to come out at one point 0 
having to humour him just to get by and get through the day was so apt 1 
regrettably the film fails 0 
the steak and the shrimp are in my opinion the best entrees at gc 1 
brilliant 1 
really good product 1 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
very good phone 1 
this is a simple little phone to use but the breakage is unacceptible 0 
the acting sucks the music sucks the script sucks the pacing sucks the special fx suck the directing sucks basically this movie sucks 0 
we ordered some old classics and some new dishes after going there a few times and were sorely disappointed with everything 0 
works fine 1 
i think that it is a must see older john wayne film 1 
horrible dont waste your time and money 0 
bought mainly for the charger which broke soon after purchasing 0 
john garfield ann revere lilli plmer william conrad canada leeand filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screenjames wong howe 1 
almost everyone involved must be return to school acting is utterly predictable and bad script is pile of garbage all round 0 
crisp and clear 1 
it is unusable in a moving car at freeway speed 0 
its too bad that everyone else involved didnt share crowes level of dedication to quality for if they did wed have a far better film on our hands than this subpar mess 0 
not much seafood and like 5 strings of pasta at the bottom 0 
after my phone got to be about a year old its been slowly breaking despite much care on my part 0 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
this film highlights the fundamental flaws of the legal process that its not about discovering guilt or innocence but rather is about who presents better in court 1 
i cannot make calls at certain places 0 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
i am so pleased to know such a modern day genius is out there letting is passion for art drive him and taking us as an audience with him 1 
ill be looking for a new earpiece 0 
a very good film indeed about great and unconditional love 1 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
ive dropped my phone more times than i can say even on concrete and my phone is still great knock on wood 1 
oh yeah and the storyline was pathetic too 0 
you need at least 3 mins to get to your phone book from the time you first turn on the phonebattery life is short 0 
it was so bad i had lost the heart to finish it 0 
worst ever 0 
lot of holes in the plot theres nothing about how he became the emperor nothing about where he spend 20 years between his childhood and mature age 0 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
good transmit audio 1 
simply beautiful 1 
it didnt work people can not hear me when i talk 0 
i rate this movie 910 1 
this game rocks 1 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
im trying to return it for a refund 0 
if you plan to use this in a car forget about it 0 
john garfield ann revere lilli plmer william conrad canada leeand filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screenjames wong howe 1 
we waited an hour for what was a breakfast i could have done 100 times better at home 0 
waiter was a jerk 0 
as many people complained i found this headsets microphone was very weak 0 
this is probably the most irritating show i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
the food was terrible 0 
the service was great even the manager came and helped with our table 1 
my experience was terrible this was my fourth bluetooth headset and while it was much more comfortable than my last jabra which i hated 0 
this place receives stars for their appetizers 1 
battery chargelife is quite long 1 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
kieslowski never ceases to amaze me 1 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
very disappointed 0 
i believe the screenwriter did a good job of tying up the loose ends 1 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
also the story and acting were weak 0 
if you are looking for a good quality motorola headset keep looking this isnt it 0 
the aerial scenes were welldone 1 
im big fan of rpg games too but this movie its a disgrace to any selfrespecting rpger there is 0 
i wasted my little money with this earpiece 0 
i ended up sliding it on the edge of my pants or back pockets instead 1 
this is one of the better buffets that i have been to 1 
and sometimes it was so embarrassing that i had to look away 0 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
very well made and fits my surefire gx2 perfectly 1 
ordered an appetizer and took 40 minutes and then the pizza another 10 minutes 0 
i really recommend this faceplates since it looks very nice elegant and cool 1 
ive had this bluetoooth headset for some time now and still not comfortable with the way it fits on the ear 0 
the best phone in market 1 
after 3 months screen just went black all of a sudden 0 
i rather enjoyed it 1 
in addition it feels amp looks as if the phone is all lightweight cheap plastic 0 
camera color balance is awful 0 
this one wants to surf on the small wave of space movies in 1998 deep impact and armageddon and this one fails everywhere 0 
so flavorful and has just the perfect amount of heat 1 
when i placed my treo into the case not only was it not snug but there was a lot of extra room on the sides 0 
its this pandering to the audience that sabotages most of his films 0 
this was a different cut than the piece the other day but still wonderful and tender s well as well flavored 1 
how can anyone in their right mind ask for anything more from a movie than this 1 
from here on the widmark character turns unintentionally comical 0 
i guess i liked the details of his dysfunctionhe was believable 1 
i could eat their bruschetta all day it is devine 1 
im glad i found this product on amazon it is hard to find it wasnt high priced 1 
what is even more stupid is that who had thought an idea that there should be a volcano in los angeles 0 
just what i wanted 1 
unfortunately this is a bad movie that is just plain bad 0 
its a total package 1 
and his subtle connections between the three films are awesome 1 
this was like the final blow 0 
almost all of the songs in cover girl are oldfashioned and not very tuneful 0 
ive had no trouble accessing the internet downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions 1 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
aside from its terrible lead this film has loads of other debits 0 
there is nothing privileged about workingeating there 0 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
the battery is completely useless to me 0 
its reception is very very poor 0 
great case and price 1 
yes its that bad 0 
i have bought this nokia cell phone a few weeks ago and it was a nightmare 0 
this is definitely a cult classic well worth viewing and sharing with others 1 
i love it 1 
what this film lacks is a convincing script 0 
stay away from this store be careful 0 
the malta settings are as dry and as barren as the dialogue 0 
food is way overpriced and portions are fucking small 0 
perfect for the ps3 1 
you can even take self portraits with the outside exterior display very cool 1 
as for the killer dont expect anything original or even remotely frightening 0 
its not hard to make a decent hamburger 0 
what on earth is irons doing in this film 0 
motorola finally got the voice quality of a bluetooth headset right 1 
if you havent gone here go now 1 
however i recently watched the whole thing again on dvd and i was completely struck by how extremely stupid the storyline was how it contained holes inconsistencies and frankly a whole lot of crap and how horrid the dancing was 0 
of course the acting is blah 0 
amazon sucks 0 
the buffet at bellagio was far from what i anticipated 0 
it is a really good show to watch 1 
the entire audience applauded at the conclusion of the film 1 
they are so cool 1 
i never walked out of a movie faster 0 
seriously killer hot chai latte 1 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
i purcashed this for the car charger and it does not work 0 
i wont be back 0 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
it was either too cold not enough flavor or just bad 0 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
and i just love the colors 1 
an hour and a half i wish i could bring back 0 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
i was amazed at the quick arrival of the two original lg cell phone batteries and and at a fraction of the price 1 
beware this is not a trashy cult movie this is trash period 0 
sorry i will not be getting food from here anytime soon 0 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
however my girl was complain that some time the phone doesnt wake up like normal phone does 0 
think it over when you plan to own this onethis sure is the last moto phone for me 0 
its this pandering to the audience that sabotages most of his films 0 
we watched our waiter pay a lot more attention to other tables and ignore us 0 
there is so much good food in vegas that i feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to rice and company 0 
2 thumbs up to this seller 1 
okay i like to consider myself a fair critic so ill give credit where credits duethe creature effects were actually pretty cool 1 
this is a great phone 1 
it kept getting worse and worse so now im officially done 0 
i mean in a realistic world she would never have gotten into that ballet repertory the whole thing was quite pathetic 0 
finally after three or four times the spring of the latch broke and i could not use it any longer on the visor 0 
i highly recommend these and encourage people to give them a try 1 
their frozen margaritas are way too sugary for my taste 0 
superb phone on a great network 1 
youll love how thin it is 1 
love this headset 1 
i saw it as a child on tv back in 1973 when it was the stranger and i loved it 1 
i wear it everyday and it holds up very well 1 
nargile i think you are great 1 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
ive had better not only from dedicated boba tea spots but even from jenni pho 0 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
she ordered a toasted english muffin that came out untoasted 0 
the restaurant atmosphere was exquisite 1 
now you know why i gave it a 10 1 
best tacos in town by far 1 
in fact im going to round up to 4 stars just because she was so awesome 1 
the bottowm lineanother worthless cheap gimmick from sprint 0 
phone now holds charge like it did when it was new 1 
this is an excellent tool especially when paired with your phones autoanswer 1 
its so bad its actually worth seeing just for that reason 0 
attempting artiness with black white and clever camera angles the movie disappointed became even more ridiculous as the acting was poor and the plot and lines almost nonexistent 0 
the interplay between martin and emilio contains the same wonderful chemistry we saw in wall street with martin and charlie 1 
we waited an hour for what was a breakfast i could have done 100 times better at home 0 
i bought this battery with a coupon from amazon and im very happy with my purchase 1 
nothing special 0 
dessert panna cotta was amazing 1 
really bad 0 
the goat taco didnt skimp on the meat and wow what flavor 1 
kids pizza is always a hit too with lots of great side dish options for the kiddos 1 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
i left with a stomach ache and felt sick the rest of the day 0 
saw the movie today and thought it was a good effort good messages for kids 1 
the songs were the best and the muppets were so hilarious 1 
much less than the jawbone i was going to replace it with 1 
it is indescribably the most annoying and idiotic show i have ever seen 0 
1 hour 54 minutes of sheer tedium melodrama and horrible acting a mess of a script and a sinking feeling of good lord what were they thinking 0 
helen baxendale is a very credible lady macbeth who can be very cheerfull at times and sometimes she just looks like a naughty girl but deadly in her taste for blood and evil 1 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
this wonderful experience made this place a muststop whenever we are in town again 1 
i was very disappointed 0 
an awesome new look for fall 2000 1 
it definitely was not as good as my s11 1 
the jalapeno bacon is soooo good 1 
the food is very good for your typical bar food 1 
i wasnt the least bit interested 0 
the turkey and roast beef were bland 0 
it is light has plenty of battery capacity and is very confortable to wear for somewhat extended periods of time 1 
i really recommend this faceplates since it looks very nice elegant and cool 1 
even in my bmw 3 series which is fairly quiet i have trouble hearing what the other person is saying 0 
the first thing that happened was that the tracking was off 0 
it is worth the drive 1 
i cant use this case because the smell is disgusting 0 
i gave it a 10 1 
it was also the right balance of war and love 1 
i thoroughly enjoyed it when christopher eccleston took control of the tardis and the continuation of the series 1 
good transmit audio 1 
the instructions didnt explain that a microphone jack could be used 0 
really bad 0 
the potato chip order was sad i could probably count how many chips were in that box and it was probably around 12 0 
nice ambiance 1 
waitress was good though 1 
small sleek impressive looking practical setup with ample storage in place 1 
everything was perfect the night we were in 1 
at first glance it is a lovely bakery cafe nice ambiance clean friendly staff 1 
i understand that its supposed to be a cheap popcorn comedy but that doesnt mean that it has to completely insult our intelligence and have writing so incredibly hackneyed that it borders on offensive 0 
not good when wearing a hat or sunglasses 0 
and the rest of it just sits there being awful with soldiers singing songs about the masculinity they pledge themselves to hairsplitting about purity the admiration of swords etc 0 
the lead man is charismafree 0 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
i guess that nobody at the network that aired this dribble watched it before putting it on 0 
if that bug never showed up i would have given a 4 for sure but on the other side of the wall where this bug was climbing was the kitchen 0 
it really created a unique feeling though 1 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
this blueant supertooth handsfree phone speaker is awesome 1 
first time going but i think i will quickly become a regular 1 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
this is cool because most cases are just open there allowing the screen to get all scratched up 1 
nice ambiance 1 
what a waste 0 
the ngage is still lacking in earbuds 0 
i cant wait to go back 1 
first time going but i think i will quickly become a regular 1 
leopard print is wonderfully wild 1 
this film has no redeeming features 0 
really pleased with this product so far 1 
the nano stated itmy son was dissapointed 0 
superb phone on a great network 1 
pretty awesome place 1 
used and dirty 0 
this short film certainly pulls no punches 0 
overall i am psyched to have a phone which has all my appointments and contacts in and gets great reception 1 
do not buy do not buyit sucks 0 
a great touch 1 
its fits like a glove and is strong secure and durable 1 
the voice recognition thru the handset is excellent 1 
i found a six inch long piece of wire in my salsa 0 
my boyfriend tried the mediterranean chicken salad and fell in love 1 
so they performed 1 
i searched the internet and found this one to be the best value 1 
i was not impressed by this product 0 
excellent dualpurpose headset 1 
i believe every one should see this movie as i think few people outside of south africa understand its past and what is being attempted in the truth and reconciliation process 1 
mediocre food 0 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
the selection on the menu was great and so were the prices 1 
omg i felt like i had never eaten thai food until this dish 1 
the sides are delish mixed mushrooms yukon gold puree white corn beateous 1 
my husband said she was very rude did not even apologize for the bad food or anything 0 
worst hour and a half of my lifeoh my gosh 0 
this is so embarassing and also my ears hurt if i try to push the ear plug into my ear 0 
but when i check voice mail at night the keypad backlight turns off a few seconds into the first message and then im lost 0 
fantastic buy and will get again for whatever my next phone is 1 
im big fan of rpg games too but this movie its a disgrace to any selfrespecting rpger there is 0 
it didnt work people can not hear me when i talk 0 
this greedy corporation will never see another dime from me 0 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
definitely worth seeing its the sort of thought provoking film that forces you to question your own threshold of loneliness 1 
rude inconsiderate management 0 
the worst experience ever 0 
but above all the exquisite visual composition of each moment with inventive and elegant use of closeup camera angle and lighting including pointillistic faux home movie footage is a wonder and joy to behold 1 
the food is about on par with dennys which is to say not good at all 0 
food arrived quickly 1 
i own 2 of these cases and would order another 1 
as many people complained i found this headsets microphone was very weak 0 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
now i know that i made a wise decision 1 
i would recommend this 1 
the folks at otto always make us feel so welcome and special 1 
the worst sappiest dialogue i could go on and on 0 
never been to hard rock casino before will never ever step forward in it again 0 
would not recommend to others 0 
gotta love those closeups of slimy drooling teeth 1 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
also if your phone is dropped this case is not going to save it specially when dropped face down 0 
we are so glad we found this place 1 
this movie contained an allstar cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i havent seen before 1 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
amazon sucks 0 
it is an insane game 1 
this fixes all the problems 1 
the only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive 1 
juano hernandez an exceptional actor who played supporting roles in many films of the era is a proud black man who is accused of murdering a white man in the south 1 
to summarize the food was incredible nay transcendant but nothing brings me joy quite like the memory of the pneumatic condiment dispenser 1 
the food is about on par with dennys which is to say not good at all 0 
no additional ear gels provided and no instructions whatsoever 0 
the dining space is tiny but elegantly decorated and comfortable 1 
do not buy do not buyit sucks 0 
too bad cause i know its family owned i really wanted to like this place 0 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
this is a great restaurant at the mandalay bay 1 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
but the movie makes a lot of serious mistakes 0 
do not buy if you want to use the holster 0 
what should have been a hilarious yummy christmas eve dinner to remember was the biggest fail of the entire trip for us 0 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
clever and a real crowdpleaserthis film still ranks among mickeys best films even after 80 wonderful years 1 
i will never forget it now 1 
the battery is unreliable as well as the service use antena 0 
not to mention the combination of pears almonds and bacon is a big winner 1 
add betty white and jean smart and you have a great cast everyone played their parts really well 1 
so far it has worked like a charm 1 
it is indescribably the most annoying and idiotic show i have ever seen 0 
when i opened the sandwich i was impressed but not in a good way 0 
i must say i have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again 1 
it was absolutely amazing 1 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
dont waste your money 0 
its a feelgood film and thats how i felt when i came out of the cinema 1 
its really easy 1 
the movie was so boring that i sometimes found myself occupied peaking in the paper instead of watching never happened during a columbo movie before 0 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
omit watching this 0 
it doesnt make you look cool 0 
nice ambiance 1 
the service was terrible food was mediocre 0 
we had a group of 70 when we claimed we would only have 40 and they handled us beautifully 1 
pretty piece of junk 0 
join the club and get awesome offers via email 1 
i just saw this film and i recommend it 1 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
my order was not correct 0 
but the service was beyond bad 0 
best tater tots in the southwest 1 
poor sound quality 0 
if this premise sound stupid thats because it is 0 
this fixes all the problems 1 
krussel always good 1 
when it opens the battery connection is broken and the device is turned off 0 
at no point in the proceedings does it look remotely like america 0 
come hungry leave happy and stuffed 1 
the pizza selections are good 1 
i live in the neighborhood so i am disappointed i wont be back here because it is a convenient location 0 
my only complaint is the standard sound volume is a little low even when turned up to 5of 5 0 
piece of trash 0 
there is a lot of beautiful places 1 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
i hate movies like that 0 
service was exceptional and food was a good as all the reviews 1 
they know how to make them here 1 
bluetooth range is good a few days ago i left my phone in the trunk got a call and carried the conversation without a hitch 1 
having to humour him just to get by and get through the day was so apt 1 
i wouldnt return 0 
the mic is great 1 
they have a really nice atmosphere 1 
audio quality is poor very poor 0 
the staff are great the ambiance is great 1 
the best place in vegas for breakfast just check out a sat or sun 1 
nothing at all to recommend 0 
i want my money back 0 
service is quick and even to go orders are just like we like it 1 
the two main characters may be two of the most believable children i ever saw put on screen 1 
though the wind and the lion is told largely through the eyes of the son every member of the family can identify with one of the characters whether it be sean connerys noble brigand candace bergens feisty heroine john hustons wily john hay or steve kanalys spiffy radiant ruthless cando lieutenant roosevelts big stick 1 
every element of this story was so over the top excessively phony and contrived that it was painful to sit through 0 
this wonderful experience made this place a muststop whenever we are in town again 1 
better than expected 1 
also difficult to put onid recommend avoiding this product 0 
crust is not good 0 
i love the look and feel of samsung flipphones 1 
i searched the internet and found this one to be the best value 1 
a lot of websites have been rating this a very good phone and so do i 1 
what this film lacks is a convincing script 0 
their monster chicken fried steak and eggs is my all time favorite 1 
battery has no life 0 
again no plot at all 0 
dont bother go to the store 0 
great phone 1 
poor sound quality 0 
in short dont bother with this movie 0 
id like to return it 0 
definitely worth seeing its the sort of thought provoking film that forces you to question your own threshold of loneliness 1 
i can say that the desserts were yummy 1 
great for ipods too 1 
i might have gotten a defect but i would not risk buying it again because of the built quality alone 0 
love this place hits the spot when i want something healthy but not lacking in quantity or flavor 1 
special mention should be made of the superb music score and sound effects which are an integral element in helping to make this such a memorable and enjoyable cartoon 1 
the live music on fridays totally blows 0 
only had this a month but its worked flawlessly so far 1 
it was a long time that i didnt see a so charismatic actor on screen 1 
and it was boring 0 
great case and price 1 
not good when wearing a hat or sunglasses 0 
doesnt last long 0 
the awful dialogue and hopeless overacting by everyone who gets shot top off a real waste of space and time 0 
the warm beer didnt help 0 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0
