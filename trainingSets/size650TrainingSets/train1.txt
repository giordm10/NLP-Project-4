worst hour and a half of my lifeoh my gosh 0 
i recently tried caballeros and i have been back every week since 1 
att is not clear sound is very distorted and you have to yell when you talk 0 
the result is a powerhouse achievement made more timely now perhaps because of our cultures disturbing fascination with celebrity and its distorted interpretations of fame 1 
things that went wrong they burned the saganaki 0 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
this film and i use that word loosely is an insult to the moviegoing public 0 
attempting artiness with black white and clever camera angles the movie disappointed became even more ridiculous as the acting was poor and the plot and lines almost nonexistent 0 
first of all there are enough racial stereotypes and racial jokes to offend everyone 0 
i am so pleased to know such a modern day genius is out there letting is passion for art drive him and taking us as an audience with him 1 
after a year the battery went completely dead on my headset 0 
i loved their mussels cooked in this wine reduction the duck was tender and their potato dishes were delicious 1 
its pretty easy 1 
very happy with this product 1 
excellent product 1 
my boyfriend tried the mediterranean chicken salad and fell in love 1 
the steak and the shrimp are in my opinion the best entrees at gc 1 
i got the car charger and not even after a week the charger was brokeni went to plug it in and it started smoking 0 
left very frustrated 0 
disappointing accessory from a good manufacturer 0 
talk about useless customer service 0 
blue ant is easy to use 1 
it has been a winner for us 1 
this product is clearly not ready for prime time i dont care how cool it looks if you cant tell a call is coming in its worthless 0 
you never know if you pushed it hard enough or the right number of times for the function you want or not 0 
my mother and brother had to do thiswhen i saw robert ryan portraying this type of man it was a very good imitation of this type of individual and i was impressed 1 
i felt asleep the first time i watched it so i can recommend it for insomniacs 0 
yes i am simplifying things here for the sake of brevity for this really is at the core of the problems with this film it has too much going on without any real fulfilling explanation 0 
just really good so far probably the best bt headset i have ever had 1 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurv√•g being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
restaurant is always full but never a wait 1 
to sum the film up breeders is a terrible cheaply made horror movie that should be avoided like the ebola virus 0 
see both films if you can 1 
everything about it is just bad 0 
mic doesnt work 0 
i highly recommend this case 1 
when i opened the sandwich i was impressed but not in a good way 0 
i had a salad with the wings and some ice cream for dessert and left feeling quite satisfied 1 
id rather eat airline food seriously 0 
very convenient since we were staying at the mgm 1 
in conclusion i will not bother with this movie because a volcano in los angeles is nothing but nonsense 0 
nine out of ten for a truly lovely film 1 
great pocket pc phone combination 1 
i wasnt expecting oscar material but this 0 
ill give this film 10 out of 10 1 
also its slim enough to fit into my alarm clock docking station without removing the case 1 
the stories were powerful explorations of the nature of man and of art 1 
nargile i think you are great 1 
i consider this theft 0 
my experience was terrible this was my fourth bluetooth headset and while it was much more comfortable than my last jabra which i hated 0 
this pair of headphones is the worst that i have ever had soundwise 0 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
you can even take self portraits with the outside exterior display very cool 1 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
considering the relations off screen between taylor and stanwyck it was surprising how little chemistry there was on screen between the two of them 0 
the jabra eargels fit my ears very well 1 
not only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic but it also managed to give away the entire movie and im not exaggerating every moment every plot point every joke is told in the trailer 0 
the food is rich so order accordingly 1 
overall the film is interesting and thoughtprovoking 1 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
logitech bluetooth headset is a 10 1 
there is so much good food in vegas that i feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to rice and company 0 
any grandmother can make a roasted chicken better than this one 0 
but she is still a bad actress repeating her robotic face moves in each of her pictures 0 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
i loved it 1 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
i understand that its supposed to be a cheap popcorn comedy but that doesnt mean that it has to completely insult our intelligence and have writing so incredibly hackneyed that it borders on offensive 0 
their menu is diverse and reasonably priced 1 
i would give this television series a 10 plus if i could 1 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
this product is clearly not ready for prime time i dont care how cool it looks if you cant tell a call is coming in its worthless 0 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
the yellowtail carpaccio was melt in your mouth fresh 1 
great place fo take out or eat in 1 
the story starts too fast with absolutely no suspense or buildup in the slightest 0 
i have eaten here multiple times and each time the food was delicious 1 
today the graphics are crap 0 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
it is unusable in a moving car at freeway speed 0 
the servers are not pleasant to deal with and they dont always honor pizza hut coupons 0 
this movie is terrible 0 
cooked to perfection and the service was impeccable 1 
due to this happening on every call i was forced to stop using this headset 0 
there is a lot of beautiful places 1 
things happen characters personalities change plot twists occur for no real reason other than that script calls for it 0 
the hockey scenes are terrible defensemen playing like theyre 5 years old goalies diving at shots that are 10 feet wide of the net etc 0 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
hence the whole story lacks a certain energy 0 
that being said for a phone the camera is very nice many cool effects to play with and video is decent as well 1 
what a big waste of time 0 
i really enjoyed eating here 1 
this film offers many delights and surprises 1 
i would recommend it 1 
how can that bethe audio quality is poor 0 
the bt headset was such a disapoinment 0 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
i can take a little bad service but the food sucks 0 
ive only had my bluetooth for a few weeks but i really like it 1 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
maybe its just their vegetarian fare but ive been twice and i thought it was average at best 0 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
this is simply the best bluetooth headset for sound quality 1 
dont waste your time here 0 
the volume switch rocketed out of the unit to a destination unknown 0 
that was done in the second movie 0 
the real disappointment was our waiter 0 
1010 1 
sam shepards portrayal of a gung ho marine was sobering 1 
its an empty hollow shell of a movie 0 
i was so insulted 0 
will order from them again 1 
the folks at otto always make us feel so welcome and special 1 
trumbull on i love lucy 1 
this place is pretty good nice little vibe in the restaurant 1 
the poor actors 0 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
feelings thoughtsgabriels discomfort during the danceall these intangibles leap to life and come within the viewers grasp in hustons portrayal 1 
your brain will attempt to shutdown as part of a primal impulse of selfpreservation 0 
im returning them 0 
everything stinks 0 
what this film lacks is a convincing script 0 
trying to make a call on these is an exercise in frustration 0 
this movie suffered because of the writing it needed more suspense 0 
the best phone in market 1 
it really is impressive that the place hasnt closed down 0 
you can even take self portraits with the outside exterior display very cool 1 
when my mom and i got home she immediately got sick and she only had a few bites of salad 0 
the stories were powerful explorations of the nature of man and of art 1 
maybe if they werent cold they would have been somewhat edible 0 
personally i think it shows that people should learn to find a compromise them self without involving other people into issue 1 
if only someone involved with it knew how to string together narrative 0 
very good lunch spot 1 
this place is overpriced not consistent with their boba and it really is overpriced 0 
now the pizza itself was good the peanut sauce was very tasty 1 
his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic 1 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
any ring toneoverall good phone to buy 1 
really pleased with this product so far 1 
but the duet between the astronaut and his doctor at the beginning of the movie is a perfect exchange if one considers that this movie was made well into the cold war and the astronauts biggest fear is that he has crashed in the ussr 1 
this is a great little item 1 
this is definitely a cult classic well worth viewing and sharing with others 1 
this wonderful experience made this place a muststop whenever we are in town again 1 
i never walked out of a movie faster 0 
the art style has the appearance of crayonpencil drawings and is wonderfully colorful and fanciful 1 
its too bad the food is so damn generic 0 
also great directing and photography 1 
i did not have any problem with this item and would order it again if needed 1 
service is quick and friendly 1 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
despite how hard i rate businesses its actually rare for me to give a 1 star 0 
overall i like this place a lot 1 
i could care less the interior is just beautiful 1 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
a piece of junk that broke after being on my phone for 2 days 0 
worse theres an incredibly weak subplot thrown in that follows a little band of latterday mansonites as they go after a reporter whos working on a story on the anniversary of the killings 0 
my sashimi was poor quality being soggy and tasteless 0 
it was a good thing that the tickets only cost five dollars because i would be mad if id have paid 750 to see this crap 0 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
he was terrible 0 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
i had strawberry tea which was good 1 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
an instant classic with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits 1 
the burger is good beef cooked just right 1 
very unreliable service from tmobile 0 
they were excellent 1 
i live in the neighborhood so i am disappointed i wont be back here because it is a convenient location 0 
the turkey and roast beef were bland 0 
i give it 2 thumbs down 0 
dont waste your time watching this rubbish nonresearched film 0 
love this headset 1 
doesnt do the job 0 
the macarons here are insanely good 1 
i gave it 5 stars then and im giving it 5 stars now 1 
jawbone era is awesome too 1 
it is zillion times away from reality 0 
this place is handsdown one of the best places to eat in the phoenix metro area 1 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
unfortunately it did not work 0 
but then they came back cold 0 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
customer service was terrible 0 
kids pizza is always a hit too with lots of great side dish options for the kiddos 1 
they never brought a salad we asked for 0 
will never ever go back and have told many people what had happened 0 
this little device has transformed my organizational capability and made my life a whole lot easier 1 
fantastic earphones 1 
a lot of websites have been rating this a very good phone and so do i 1 
what a piece of junk i lose more calls on this phone 0 
great for the jawbone 1 
i want my money back 0 
the buffet at bellagio was far from what i anticipated 0 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
maybe if they werent cold they would have been somewhat edible 0 
left very frustrated 0 
cant upload ringtones from a third party 0 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
the battery life is highly unacceptable 0 
now imagine that every single one of those decisions was made wrong 0 
it is the best charger i have seen on the market yet 1 
add betty white and jean smart and you have a great cast everyone played their parts really well 1 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
i was not impressed by this product 0 
dee snider just plain sucks 0 
yes its that bad 0 
will go back next trip out 1 
an interesting premise and billy drago is always good as a dangerous nutbag side note id love to see drago stephen mchattie and lance hendrikson in a flick together talk about raging cheekbones 1 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
camerawork again bad 0 
hackneyed writing certainly but made even worse by the bad directing 0 
everyone is very attentive providing excellent customer service 1 
actually the graphics were good at the time 1 
service stinks here 0 
the kids are annoying 0 
dont waste your money 0 
it really created a unique feeling though 1 
nothing short of magnificent photographycinematography in this film 1 
my salad had a bland vinegrette on the baby greens and hearts of palm 0 
i wouldnt see this movie again for free 0 
not good for the money 0 
this place is like chipotle but better 1 
it was an inexpensive piece but i would still have expected better quality 0 
the interplay between martin and emilio contains the same wonderful chemistry we saw in wall street with martin and charlie 1 
i received my headset in good time and was happy with it 1 
this is hands down the best phone ive ever had 1 
couldnt ask for a more satisfying meal 1 
lately they have been extremely nice and helpful on the phone 1 
today the graphics are crap 0 
lewis blacks considerable talent is wasted here too as he is at his most incendiary when he is unrestrained which the pg13 rating certainly wont allow 0 
this gets a 1 out of 10 simply because theres nothing lower 0 
nice quality build unlike some cheap s out there 1 
unfortunately this is a bad movie that is just plain bad 0 
buttons are too small 0 
that being said for a phone the camera is very nice many cool effects to play with and video is decent as well 1 
it isnt even an achievement as a sobaditsgood or sobaditsmemorable movie 0 
this film has no redeeming features 0 
both great 1 
great brunch spot 1 
i agree with jessica this movie is pretty bad 0 
we definately enjoyed ourselves 1 
however paul schrader has indeed made a film about mishima that is both superb complex 1 
this movie is a good and humorous comment on life in 2006 1 
he surely doesnt know how to make a coherent action movie from the screenwriter of air force one who was only obliged to write the script just for a big sum of money 0 
if you do go see this movie bring a pillow or a girlfriendboyfriend to keep you occupied through out 0 
i have 23 bars on my cell phone when i am home but you cant not hear anything 0 
it is perfect for a sitdown family meal or get together with a few friends 1 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
the films dialogue is natural real to life 1 
these were so good we ordered them twice 1 
5 stars for the brick oven bread app 1 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
so absolutley fantastic 1 
a fly was in my apple juice a fly 0 
these are the nicest restaurant owners ive ever come across 1 
that one didnt work either 0 
judith light is one of my favorite actresses and i think she does a superb job in this film 1 
from here on the widmark character turns unintentionally comical 0 
there was a warm feeling with the service and i felt like their guest for a special treat 1 
my 5year old nokia 2160 from tracfone holds the charge a lot better than this 0 
after watching this film i wanted to learn more about the works of this artist 1 
these headphones were a great find and i think they are perhaps the best purchase ive made in the last several years seriously 1 
i seriously cannot believe that the owner has so many unexperienced employees that all are running around like chickens with their heads cut off 0 
good value works fine power via usb car or wall outlet 1 
very very disappointed ordered the 35 big bay plater 0 
dont waste your money 0 
the attention given to every character and complex psychological portrayals detailing loyalty treachery love and hope are tremendous 1 
the portion was huge 1 
great phone 1 
the acting from all involved and that includes those like shatner and nimoy is bad and washed out and making them seem as old as they look in real life the special effects are tacky like when spock has to rescue kirk on a jet pack when he falls down from a mountain 0 
there are many continuity errors one other user commented on different cars in the garage joes glassesthe one that got to me the most was the fact joes facial hair configuration seemed to change from scene to scene 0 
great pocket pc phone combination 1 
the film deserves strong kudos for taking this stand for having exceptional acting from its mostly lesserknown cast and for the superintelligent script that doesnt insult the audience or take the easy way out when it comes to white racism 1 
some may say this buffet is pricey but i think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot 1 
excellent dualpurpose headset 1 
it felt too light and tinny 0 
none of it works just dont buy it 0 
it was either too cold not enough flavor or just bad 0 
this is a bad film with bad writing and good actorsan ugly cartoon crafted by paul haggis for people who cant handle anything but the bold strokes in storytellinga picture painted with crayons 0 
garbo who showed right off the bat that her talents could carry over from the silent era i wanted to see some of her silent work but netflix doesnt seem to be stocking them 1 
very good though 1 
the nano stated itmy son was dissapointed 0 
this case seems well made 1 
it kept getting worse and worse so now im officially done 0 
the best example of how dumb the writing is when its established that you can turn the zombiestudents back into humans by removing a necklace containing a piece of the meteorite 0 
ive had this bluetoooth headset for some time now and still not comfortable with the way it fits on the ear 0 
delicious and i will absolutely be back 1 
works for me 1 
the cr√™pe was delicate and thin and moist 1 
didnt laugh or even smile once 0 
excellent dualpurpose headset 1 
hated it 0 
do not make the same mistake as me 0 
my friend loved the salmon tartar 1 
the best place to go for a tasty bowl of pho 1 
i own 2 of these cases and would order another 1 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
im not sure how long we stood there but it was long enough for me to begin to feel awkwardly out of place 0 
it was an inexpensive piece but i would still have expected better quality 0 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
the selection of food was not the best 0 
i guess it was supposed to be clever twist then shed some light on the situation but it was just stupid 0 
lets start with all the problems¬óthe acting especially from the lead professor was very very bad 0 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
do not purchase this phone 0 
i exchanged the sony ericson z500a for this and im pretty happy with that decision 1 
its a sad movie but very good 1 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
ill put this gem up against any movie in terms of screenplay cinematography acting postproduction editing directing or any other aspect of filmmaking 1 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
i hate movies like that 0 
if she had not rolled the eyes we may have stayed not sure if we will go back and try it again 0 
the worst phone ive ever had only had it for a few months 0 
when my order arrived one of the gyros was missing 0 
go rent it 1 
the worst piece of crap ever along with the verizon customer service 0 
once you get inside youll be impressed with the place 1 
this product is clearly not ready for prime time i dont care how cool it looks if you cant tell a call is coming in its worthless 0 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
ive also had problems with the phone reading the memory card in which i always turn it on and then off again 0 
its a piece of crap 0 
the igo chargers and tips are really great 1 
do not waste your time 0 
what a great double cheeseburger 1 
obviously they have a terrible customer service so you get what you pay for 0 
setup couldnt have been simpler 1 
good value works fine power via usb car or wall outlet 1 
a piece of junk that broke after being on my phone for 2 days 0 
my boyfriend tried the mediterranean chicken salad and fell in love 1 
the sound quality for the device is unacceptableunless you are in a really quiet area you almost hear nothing 0 
oh the charger seems to work fine 1 
i felt asleep the first time i watched it so i can recommend it for insomniacs 0 
the only thing that i think could improve is the sound leaks out from the headset 0 
before i go in to why i gave a 1 star rating please know that this was my third time eating at bachi burger before writing a review 0 
they have been around for years and carries the highest quality of antiglare screen protector that i have found to date 1 
i had the chicken pho and it tasted very bland 0 
those phones are working just fine now 1 
theres really nothing bad i can say about this headset 0 
im not impressed with the concept or the food 0 
good service very clean and inexpensive to boot 1 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
seller shipped quickly and much cheaper than the competitors 1 
the only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive 1 
i left with a stomach ache and felt sick the rest of the day 0 
it was a drive to get there 0 
and his subtle connections between the three films are awesome 1 
it is not good 0 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
we have tried 2 units and they both failed within 2 months pros 0 
it is super charged up for use as a small hybrid palmtopcameracellphone and excels in those roles 1 
i highly recommend these and encourage people to give them a try 1 
the acting was decidely wooden though no worse than a period universal b movie 0 
they have a really nice atmosphere 1 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
you can find better movies at youtube 0 
not easy to watch 0 
i saw this short film on hbo the other day and absolutely loved it 1 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
it is not good 0 
i would recommend it 1 
in fact i liked it better than interview with a vampire and i liked this lestat stuart townsend better than cruises attempt 1 
never been to hard rock casino before will never ever step forward in it again 0 
they work about 2 weeks then break 0 
the service was terrible though 0 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
the structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema 1 
damian is so talented and versatile in so many ways of writing and portraying different characters on screen 1 
i was very disappointed in the movie 0 
and then tragedy struck 0 
great for ipods too 1 
its hard not to fall headoverheels in love with that girl 1 
very slow at seating even with reservation 0 
but the duet between the astronaut and his doctor at the beginning of the movie is a perfect exchange if one considers that this movie was made well into the cold war and the astronauts biggest fear is that he has crashed in the ussr 1 
i bought two of them and neither will charge 0 
a piece of junk that broke after being on my phone for 2 days 0 
that company is a joke 0 
dont buy it 0 
10 out of 10 for both the movie and trilogy 1 
doesnt work at all i bougth it for my l7c and its not working 0 
the chicken wings contained the driest chicken meat i have ever eaten 0 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
will be back again 1 
macbeth jason connery moved me to tears with his final monolog out brief candle outhe gave the sphere of moral decay and dark forces a human face which makes it the more interesting 1 
i guess maybe we went on an off night but it was disgraceful 0 
not enough volume 0 
probably not in a hurry to go back 0 
worth every penny 1 
nonlinear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well 1 
imdb ratings only go as low 1 for awful its time to get some negative numbers in there for cases such as these 0 
and there wasnt a single sour note struck actingwise either some surprisingly solid casting here 1 
the cocktails are all handmade and delicious 1 
i was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar not only because the quality is great but the service is fast and the food impeccable 1 
the acting was decidely wooden though no worse than a period universal b movie 0 
i wouldnt see this movie again for free 0 
i would have given no star if i was able 0 
the budget was evidently very limited 0 
this hole in the wall has great mexican street tacos and friendly staff 1 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
overall i wasnt very impressed with noca 0 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
the structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema 1 
after the first charge kept going dead after 12 minutes 0 
the cashier had no care what so ever on what i had to say it still ended up being wayyy overpriced 0 
battery life is real good 1 
and it was way to expensive 0 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
not recommended 0 
in fact this stinker smells like a directtovideo release 0 
i would have given no star if i was able 0 
price is good too 1 
the portion was huge 1 
sorry i will not be getting food from here anytime soon 0 
it defeats the purpose of a bluetooth headset 0 
you have to hold the phone at a particular angle for the other party to hear you clearly 0 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
the construction of the headsets is poor 0 
nice ambiance 1 
the cinematography is simply stunning to say the least and the fx are nothing if not stateoftheart 1 
the selection was probably the worst ive seen in vegasthere was none 0 
so absolutley fantastic 1 
easy to pair with my samsung cell 1 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurv√•g being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
despite the pans of reviewers i liked this movie 1 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
the delivery was on time 1 
the only place good for this film is in the garbage 0 
in the span of an hour i had two people exclaim whoa is that the new phone on tv 1 
it was too predictable even for a chick flick 0 
you wont regret it 1 
and service was super friendly 1 
i love being able to use one headset for both by landline and cell 1 
were jerks on the phone 0 
it was just too horrible 0 
hard to judge whether these sides were good because we were grossed out by the melted styrofoam and didnt want to eat it for fear of getting sick 0 
i enjoyed reading this book to my children when they were little 1 
all the bread is made inhouse 1 
a fantastic neighborhood gem 1 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
it clicks into place in a way that makes you wonder how long that mechanism would last 0 
i love this phone 1 
the jamaican mojitos are delicious 1 
i especially liked the noncliche choices with the parents in other movies i could predict the dialog verbatim but the writing in this movie made better selections 1 
highly unprofessional and rude to a loyal patron 0 
i let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this bad idea we both hated it 0 
the construction of the headsets is poor 0 
overall i rate this movie a 10 out of a 110 scale 1 
i took back my money and got outta there 0 
the management is rude 0 
not good for the money 0 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
bland not a liking this place for a number of reasons and i dont want to waste time on bad reviewing ill leave it at that 0 
the instructions didnt explain that a microphone jack could be used 0 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
its kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly its embarrassing how childlike the company is 0 
the steak was amazingrge fillet relleno was the best seafood plate i have ever had 1 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
fantastic service here 1 
and the accents are absolutely abysmal 0 
this place receives stars for their appetizers 1 
despite the pans of reviewers i liked this movie 1 
waited and waited and waited 0 
item arrived quickly and works great with my metro pcs samsung schr450 slider phone and sony premium sound in ear plugs 1 
service was very prompt 1 
i will continue to come here on ladies night andddd date night highly recommend this place to anyone who is in the area 1 
perabo has a nice energy level and is obviously very comfortable in front of a camera 1 
the structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema 1 
kind of hard to mess up a steak but they did 0 
very bad performance plays angela bennett a computer expert who is at home all the time 0 
for the price on amazon it is an excellent product which i would highly recommend 1 
the kids are very cool too 1 
theres barely a boring moment in the film and there are plenty of humorous parts 1 
the microphone also works well but according to people i have called it applifies everything 1 
horrible horrible protector 0 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
both films are terrible but to the credit of the 1986 version it was watchable 0 
this is a good joint 1 
the service was terrible though 0 
a great way to finish a great 1 
the color is even prettier than i thought it would be and the graphics are incredibly sharp 1 
i had to go to a store and bought a new nokia phone which is working great 1 
i rather enjoyed it 1 
it felt too light and tinny 0 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
this movie is greatespecially if you enjoy visual arts 1 
battery is terrible 0 
essentially you can forget microsofts tech support 0 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
waiter was a jerk 0 
this was like the final blow 0 
reasonably priced also 1 
its like a really sexy party in your mouth where youre outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party 1 
i am going to have to be the first to negatively review this product 0 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
we sat another ten minutes and finally gave up and left 0 
i bought this battery with a coupon from amazon and im very happy with my purchase 1 
i am pairing this with my iphone and i could not be happier with it so far 1 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
the film deserves strong kudos for taking this stand for having exceptional acting from its mostly lesserknown cast and for the superintelligent script that doesnt insult the audience or take the easy way out when it comes to white racism 1 
my wife had the lobster bisque soup which was lukewarm 0 
it is a very well acted and done tv movie 1 
this movie is excellentangel is beautiful and scamp is adorablehis little yelps when hes scaredand the funniest parts are whenscamp is caught under the curtain and when angel and scamp are singing ive never had this feeling beforei totally recommend this movieits coming out on special edition on june 20the cover has scamp on a garbage can and angel underneath the lid 1 
i especially liked the noncliche choices with the parents in other movies i could predict the dialog verbatim but the writing in this movie made better selections 1 
weird vibe from owners 0 
the performances are not improved by improvisation because the actors now have twice as much to worry about not only whether theyre delivering the line well but whether the line itself is any good 0 
this is not moviemaking 0 
sending it back 0 
this place is great 1 
the place was fairly clean but the food simply wasnt worth it 0 
very very fun chef 1 
the movie is terribly boring in places 0 
by far the best cheesecurds we have ever had 1 
love this headset 1 
damn good steak 1 
the films dialogue is natural real to life 1 
avoid at all costs 0 
i love their fries and their beans 1 
the croutons also taste homemade which is an extra plus 1 
weird vibe from owners 0 
actually the graphics were good at the time 1 
i would definitely recommend the jabra bt250v for those who are looking for comfort clarity and a great price 1 
i was totally fascinated by the music the dancing everything 1 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
their menu is diverse and reasonably priced 1 
editing the editing of this film was phenomenal in my opinion 1 
made very sturdy 1 
his losing his marbles so early in the proceedings is totally implausible and unconvincing 0 
motorola finally got the voice quality of a bluetooth headset right 1 
works as described 1 
to call this movie a drama is ridiculous 0 
10 out of 10 for both the movie and trilogy 1 
left very frustrated 0 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
so i am here to warn youdo not rent this movie it is the dumbest thing you have never seen 0 
best service and food ever maria our server was so good and friendly she made our day 1 
any ring toneoverall good phone to buy 1 
service is quick and friendly 1 
we wont be returning 0 
i particularly remember my senses being assaulted by strident cords of music that would blare out with very little warning and even less meaning 0 
the only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive 1 
1 long lasting battery you dont have to recharge it as frequentyly as some of the flip phones2 0 
we are sending it back 0 
all the bread is made inhouse 1 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
i had strawberry tea which was good 1 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
this is a great product sure beats using your fingers 1 
i am very impressed with the job that motorola did on the sturdiness of this phone 1 
we also ordered the spinach and avocado salad the ingredients were sad and the dressing literally had zero taste 0 
a bit predictable 0 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
i have had mine for about a year and this christmas i bought some for the rest of the family 1 
i just wanted to leave 0 
everything about this film is simply incredible 1 
the movie is full of wonderful dancing hence the title 1 
i love being able to use one headset for both by landline and cell 1 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
its pretty easy 1 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
the buffet at bellagio was far from what i anticipated 0 
i guess it was supposed to be clever twist then shed some light on the situation but it was just stupid 0 
bad day or not i have a very low tolerance for rude customer service people it is your job to be nice and polite wash dishes otherwise 0 
kind of hard to mess up a steak but they did 0 
this place lacked style 0 
on the up side their cafe serves really good food 1 
great food and awesome service 1 
the pleather case doesnt fit 0 
it has a great camera thats 2mp and the pics are nice and clear with great picture quality 1 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
the story itself is just predictable and lazy 0 
disappointed 0 
and i just love the colors 1 
i got to enjoy the seafood salad with a fabulous vinegrette 1 
i want my money back 0 
some highlights great quality nigiri here 1 
then i watched it again two sundays ago march 20th 2005 and i began to really enjoy it and this time i taped the entire thing 1 
the worst phone ive ever had only had it for a few months 0 
the story line is just awful 0 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
damian is so talented and versatile in so many ways of writing and portraying different characters on screen 1 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
we ordered some old classics and some new dishes after going there a few times and were sorely disappointed with everything 0 
the building itself seems pretty neat the bathroom is pretty trippy but i wouldnt eat here again 0 
2 thumbs up 1 
do not buy for d807wrongly advertised for d807 0 
battery has no life 0 
nice docking station for home or work 1 
ample portions and good prices 1 
an excellent new restaurant by an experienced frenchman 1 
my boyfriend and i sat at the bar and had a completely delightful experience 1 
the service was a bit lacking 0 
do not buy do not buyit sucks 0 
i have tried these cables with my computer and my ipod and it works just fine 1 
it didnt charge for me 0 
i love this place 1 
but it wasnt until i watched this film that i realised how great he actually was 1 
i was bored throughout the whole damn thing 0 
i liked this movie way too much 1 
i mean really how do you get so famous for your fish and chips when its so terrible 0 
anyway the plot flowed smoothly and the malebonding scenes were a hoot 1 
the movie had you on the edge of your seat and made you somewhat afraid to go to your car at the end of the night 1 
good transmit audio 1 
it fits my ear well and is comfortable on 1 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
clever and a real crowdpleaserthis film still ranks among mickeys best films even after 80 wonderful years 1 
im probably one of the few people to ever go to ians and not like it 0 
this is actually a very smart movie 1 
i was particularly pleased with the acting ability of dwight schultz 1 
my sister has one also and she loves it 1 
made very sturdy 1 
constantine gives everything the right intensity and seems to have a good understanding of the underlying psychological motivations 1 
i have read others reviews here but i havent had any problem with it 1 
but even the talented carrell cant save this 0 
i highly recommend this modest priced cellular phone 1 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
the stories were powerful explorations of the nature of man and of art 1 
there was no chemistry between ben affleck and sandra bullock in this film and i couldnt understand why he would consider even leaving his wifetobe for this chick that he supposedly was knocked out by 0 
great product for the price 1 
i swung in to give them a try but was deeply disappointed 0 
better than expected 1 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
its not what it says it is 0 
still i do like this movie for its empowerment of women theres not enough movies out there like this one 1 
first time there and might just be the last 0 
despite how hard i rate businesses its actually rare for me to give a 1 star 0 
hitchcock is a great director 1 
i really do recommend this place you can go wrong with this donut place 1 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
shrimp when i unwrapped it i live only 12 a mile from brushfire it was literally ice cold 0 
considering the relations off screen between taylor and stanwyck it was surprising how little chemistry there was on screen between the two of them 0 
i used bitpim a free program you can find on the internetto transfer data to the phonethe price of the cable was excellent 1 
i dont know what kind it is but they have the best iced tea 1 
must have been an off night at this place 0 
ive dropped my phone more times than i can say even on concrete and my phone is still great knock on wood 1 
waitress was good though 1 
it has northern humour and positive about the community it represents 1 
the visual effects were awful 0 
dont miss it 1 
the tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu 0
