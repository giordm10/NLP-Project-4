its also great to see that renowned silent screenwriter frances marion hasnt missed a step going from silent to sound 1 
the cast is good 1 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
food was delicious 1 
call me a nut but i think this is one of the best movies ever 1 
once your food arrives its meh 0 
there is so much good food in vegas that i feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to rice and company 0 
the service was a bit lacking 0 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
i have eaten here multiple times and each time the food was delicious 1 
service was good and the company was better 1 
dont buy it 0 
top line dont waste your time and money on this one its as bad as it comes 0 
the best place to go for a tasty bowl of pho 1 
it didnt work people can not hear me when i talk 0 
the cable looks so thin and flimsy it is scary 0 
anyways the food was definitely not filling at all and for the price you pay you should expect more 0 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
everyone is treated equally special 1 
used and dirty 0 
the death row scenes were entirely unmoving 0 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
best ive found so far ive tried 2 other bluetooths and this one has the best quality for both me and the listener as well as ease of using 1 
this is a great deal 1 
the selection was probably the worst ive seen in vegasthere was none 0 
ive had this for nearly 2 years and it has worked great for me 1 
i was very disappointed 0 
oh the charger seems to work fine 1 
we wont be returning 0 
the descriptions said yum yum sauce and another said eel sauce yet another said spicy mayowell none of the rolls had sauces on them 0 
rating 010 grade z note the show is so bad that even mother of the cast pull her daughter out of the show 0 
no ear loop needed its tiny and the sound is great 1 
its an empty hollow shell of a movie 0 
this place is not quality sushi it is not a quality restaurant 0 
i will continue to come here on ladies night andddd date night highly recommend this place to anyone who is in the area 1 
there was no chemistry between ben affleck and sandra bullock in this film and i couldnt understand why he would consider even leaving his wifetobe for this chick that he supposedly was knocked out by 0 
i know this is not like the other restaurants at all something is very off here 0 
i could not stand to even watch it for very long for fear of losing iq 0 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
not enough volume 0 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
i have to use the smallest earpieces provided but it stays on pretty well 1 
ray charles life provided excellent biographical material for the film which goes well beyond being just another movie about a musician 1 
worst foodservice ive had in a while 0 
service is quick and friendly 1 
but i dont like it 0 
piece of trash 0 
its a great item 1 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
very dissapointing performance 0 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
its one of the most boring horror movies from the 90s mainly because it starts slow and centers in a boring atmosphere 0 
headset works great was packaged nicely to avoid any damage 1 
too politically correct 0 
to call this movie a drama is ridiculous 0 
great phone 1 
be sure to order dessert even if you need to pack it togo the tiramisu and cannoli are both to die for 1 
good price 1 
despite how hard i rate businesses its actually rare for me to give a 1 star 0 
all the other cases ive tried normally fall apart after a few months but this one seems to be in for the long haul 1 
if you check the directors filmography on this site you will see why this film didnt have a chance 0 
ordered burger rare came in well done 0 
they have great dinners 1 
overall the film is interesting and thoughtprovoking 1 
after my phone got to be about a year old its been slowly breaking despite much care on my part 0 
and those baby owls were adorable 1 
avoid this establishment 0 
mic doesnt work 0 
the text messaging feature is really tricky to use 0 
he cant act one of the least scary villains i have ever seen he cant write did he write this damn movie in his sleep 0 
he was extremely rude and really there are so many other restaurants i would love to dine at during a weekend in vegas 0 
my brother in law who works at the mall ate here same day and guess what he was sick all night too 0 
the headsets are easy to use and everyone loves them 1 
then i watched it again two sundays ago march 20th 2005 and i began to really enjoy it and this time i taped the entire thing 1 
the inside is really quite nice and very clean 1 
the script is bad very bad  it contains both cheesiness and unethical joke that you normally see in rated r or nc17 movie 0 
that being said for a phone the camera is very nice many cool effects to play with and video is decent as well 1 
each day of the week they have a different deal and its all so delicious 1 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
the structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema 1 
the success of the film depends on the casting of sydney greenstreet as the alexander yardley character 1 
doesnt work 0 
im not impressed with the concept or the food 0 
that movie was bad 0 
really really good rice all the time 1 
couldnt figure it out 0 
i totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is 1 
horrible 0 
how this piece of trash was ever released is beyond me the acting the story the characters the supposedly special effects etcits all wrong 0 
i am so pleased to know such a modern day genius is out there letting is passion for art drive him and taking us as an audience with him 1 
i cannot make calls at certain places 0 
i had a salad with the wings and some ice cream for dessert and left feeling quite satisfied 1 
not tasty and the texture was just nasty 0 
the music in the film is really nice too 1 
unfortunately it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees 0 
but it wasnt anything at all just one big yawn 0 
the igo chargers and tips are really great 1 
you need at least 3 mins to get to your phone book from the time you first turn on the phonebattery life is short 0 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
when i opened the sandwich i was impressed but not in a good way 0 
dont make the same mistake i did 0 
could not get strong enough signal 0 
camerawork again bad 0 
this review is long overdue since i consider a tale of two sisters to be the single greatest film ever made 1 
i had strawberry tea which was good 1 
very happy with this product 1 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
it is just the sort of pap that is screened in the afternoon to punish the unemployed for not having jobs 0 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
having trouble with volume 0 
not only did the software do a great job of this i could also make my own ringtones form my existing cds without an internet connection 1 
excellent 1 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
i might have gotten a defect but i would not risk buying it again because of the built quality alone 0 
the nokia ca42 usb cable did not work with my phone 0 
often the dialogue doesnt really follow from one line to another or fit the surroundings 0 
the plot is nonsense that doesnt interest in the slightest way or have any uniqueness to it 0 
poor reliability 0 
clever and a real crowdpleaserthis film still ranks among mickeys best films even after 80 wonderful years 1 
the characters are interesting and you want to find out more about them the longer the movie goes on and i think people will be surprised by who does and doesnt make it 1 
easy to pair with my samsung cell 1 
the plot has more holes than a pair of fishnet stockings and the direction and editing is astonishingly ham fisted 0 
not only did the software do a great job of this i could also make my own ringtones form my existing cds without an internet connection 1 
service is perfect and the family atmosphere is nice to see 1 
the structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema 1 
poor product 0 
it rocked my world and is certainly a must see for anyone with no social or physical outlets 1 
they have a really nice atmosphere 1 
food was delicious 1 
these were so good we ordered them twice 1 
cant store anything but phone numbers to sim 0 
after 3 months screen just went black all of a sudden 0 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
great product and price 1 
the loudspeaker option is great the bumpers with the lights is very appealing 0 
this is a disgrace 0 
the waitress and manager are so friendly 1 
also great directing and photography 1 
also notable is john baileys fine crisp beautifully colored cinematography and the great production design costumes by eiko ishioka who went on to do the memorable costumes for coppolas dracula for which she received a well deserved oscar 1 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
very very fun chef 1 
i got the aluminum case for my new palm vx and it worked really wellit has protected my handheld perfectly so far 1 
then i exchanged for the same phone even that had the same problem 0 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
well just if you keep thinking how bad it is 0 
and the rest of it just sits there being awful with soldiers singing songs about the masculinity they pledge themselves to hairsplitting about purity the admiration of swords etc 0 
if you stay in vegas you must get breakfast here at least once 1 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
my gyro was basically lettuce only 0 
due to this happening on every call i was forced to stop using this headset 0 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
on a positive note our server was very attentive and provided great service 1 
hard to judge whether these sides were good because we were grossed out by the melted styrofoam and didnt want to eat it for fear of getting sick 0 
i have two more years left in this contract and i hate this phone 0 
generally it just lacked imagination 0 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
you will leave the theater wanting to go out and dance under the stars 1 
its one of the movies i need to see whenever it comes on tvnever mind the fact that i already have it memorized 1 
it really is impressive that the place hasnt closed down 0 
i own 2 of these cases and would order another 1 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
is pretty funny 1 
poor voice clarity 0 
comfort for our whole family 1 
dont buy this product 0 
four stars for the food the guy in the blue shirt for his great vibe still letting us in to eat 1 
my friend did not like his bloody mary 0 
will never ever go back 0 
highly unprofessional and rude to a loyal patron 0 
when it opens the battery connection is broken and the device is turned off 0 
the battery runs down quickly 0 
did not like at all 0 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
soggy and not good 0 
all i can do is whine on the internet so here it goesthe more i use the thing the less i like it 0 
this case seems well made 1 
tom wilkinson broke my heart at the end and everyone elses judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike 1 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
it was a great phone 1 
delete this film from your mind 0 
as a courtroom drama its compelling as an indictment on the american justice system its frightening 1 
i rather enjoyed it 1 
i love this thing 1 
when it opens the battery connection is broken and the device is turned off 0 
if you want healthy authentic or ethic food try this place 1 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
his losing his marbles so early in the proceedings is totally implausible and unconvincing 0 
still i do like this movie for its empowerment of women theres not enough movies out there like this one 1 
price is good too 1 
did not like at all 0 
i really like this product over the motorola because it is allot clearer on the ear piece and the mic 1 
dont buy it 0 
about 30 minutes of footage is wasted to show mediocre elderly actors awkwardly babbling overwrought pseudosatanic gibberish corny enough to make a teen goth blush almost always in olde english and sometimes in latin that may or may not be made up words 0 
very clear quality sound and you dont have to mess with the sound on your ipod since you have the sound buttons on the headset 1 
blue ant is easy to use 1 
case was more or less an extra that i originally put on but later discarded because it scratched my ear 0 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
battery is terrible 0 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
i received it quickly and it works great 1 
also if your phone is dropped this case is not going to save it specially when dropped face down 0 
great phone 1 
i particularly remember my senses being assaulted by strident cords of music that would blare out with very little warning and even less meaning 0 
that being said for a phone the camera is very nice many cool effects to play with and video is decent as well 1 
sauce was tasteless 0 
the football scenes at the end were perplexing 0 
sound quality on both end is excellent i use headset to call my wife and ask my wife to use headset to call me 2 1 
i own 2 of these cases and would order another 1 
too politically correct 0 
im a bit disappointed 0 
how can that bethe audio quality is poor 0 
it rocked my world and is certainly a must see for anyone with no social or physical outlets 1 
a piece of cinematic garbage captured on celluloid 0 
the food was great as always compliments to the chef 1 
speaking of the music it is unbearably predictably and kitchy 0 
on a positive note our server was very attentive and provided great service 1 
i had about two bites and refused to eat anymore 0 
sprint charges for this service 0 
its a gloriously fun fast paced and fairly accurate portrayal of the night of a raver 1 
this place receives stars for their appetizers 1 
i wont say any more i dont like spoilers so i dont want to be one but i believe this film is worth your time 1 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
the camera really likes her in this movie 1 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
its quite simply the highest most superlative form of cinema imaginable 1 
this really is how vegas fine dining used to be right down to the menus handed to the ladies that have no prices listed 1 
never got it 0 
unfortunately it will not recharge my iphone 4s despite connecting it from multiple power sources imac external battery wall outlet etc 0 
when im on this side of town this will definitely be a spot ill hit up again 1 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
i have had mine for about a year and this christmas i bought some for the rest of the family 1 
as for the service i thought it was good 1 
the bipolarity of the ruthless thug one minute a ruthless killer the next minute a luvs diaper commercial is completely unconvincing 0 
i was not happy with this item 0 
if there was ever an indication of a writer and a directors ability to meld two highly volatile temperaments into a seamless union of creativity then this is it 1 
its really easy 1 
unfortunately it did not work 0 
it really created a unique feeling though 1 
the plastic breaks really easy on this clip 0 
third the cheese on my friends burger was cold 0 
but the premise of the film was so ridiculous that the president of the us 0 
i checked out this place a couple years ago and was not impressed 0 
the staff is always super friendly and helpful which is especially cool when you bring two small boys and a baby 1 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
there is a totally unnecessary trainroller coaster scene 0 
superb phone on a great network 1 
exactly what i wanted 1 
this greedy corporation will never see another dime from me 0 
john garfield ann revere lilli plmer william conrad canada leeand filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screenjames wong howe 1 
buyer beware you could flush money right down the toilet 0 
as always the evening was wonderful and the food delicious 1 
a very good film indeed about great and unconditional love 1 
point your finger at any item on the menu order it and you wont be disappointed 1 
problem is that the ear loops are made of weak material and break easily 0 
great brunch spot 1 
chinese forgeries abound 0 
clear skype calls long battery life long range 1 
we had 7 at our table and the service was pretty fast 1 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
you can even take self portraits with the outside exterior display very cool 1 
you could drive a semi truck into these holes 0 
treo and tmobile refused to replace it again and forced me to buy another phone without any kind of upgrade discount 0 
the plot has more holes than a pair of fishnet stockings and the direction and editing is astonishingly ham fisted 0 
i guess that nobody at the network that aired this dribble watched it before putting it on 0 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
better than new 1 
paolo sorrentino has written a wonderful story about loneliness and tony has built one of the most unforgettable characters seen in movies in recent years 1 
disappointing experience 0 
its extremely slow and takes forever to do anything with it 0 
they really want to make your experience a good one 1 
what should have been a hilarious yummy christmas eve dinner to remember was the biggest fail of the entire trip for us 0 
this product is great it makes working a lot easier i can go to the copier while waiting on hold for something 1 
if you plan to use this in a car forget about it 0 
for sushi on the strip this is the place to go 1 
the results well are a shame 0 
not good when wearing a hat or sunglasses 0 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
definitely not worth the 3 i paid 0 
every time he opened his mouth you expect to hear you see kids pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show 0 
dont waste your on this one 0 
the shower area is outside so you can only rinse not take a full shower unless you dont mind being nude for everyone to see 0 
this is a great phone 1 
people couldnt hear me talk and i had to pull out the earphone and talk on the phone 0 
camera color balance is awful 0 
these are the central themes of the film and they are handled ineptly stereotypically and with no depth of imagination 0 
summary the witticisms werent witty 0 
i find wasting food to be despicable but this just wasnt food 0 
couldnt use the unit with sunglasses not good in texas 0 
my husband said she was very rude did not even apologize for the bad food or anything 0 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
a cheap and cheerless heist movie with poor characterisation lots of underbite style stoic emoting think chow yun fat in a better tomorrow and some cheesy clichés thrown into an abandoned factory ready for a few poorly executed flying judo rolls a la john woo 0 
if it was to turn my good day feeling into a night of disturbing memories than i guess he succeeded 0 
the greek dressing was very creamy and flavorful 1 
we waited an hour for what was a breakfast i could have done 100 times better at home 0 
food was really boring 0 
the instructions didnt explain that a microphone jack could be used 0 
the greek dressing was very creamy and flavorful 1 
well packaged arrived on time and works as intended 1 
it was so bad i had lost the heart to finish it 0 
the fried rice was dry as well 0 
was not happy 0 
later i found myself lost in the power of the film 1 
for the price this was a great deal 1 
highly recommended 1 
items stated as included from the description are not included 0 
you share general loewenhielms exquisite joy in his partaking of the cailles en sarcophage even though you are just watching a movie but you do wish for just a small sample to savor 1 
not to mention the combination of pears almonds and bacon is a big winner 1 
treo and tmobile refused to replace it again and forced me to buy another phone without any kind of upgrade discount 0 
now you know why i gave it a 10 1 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
best tacos in town by far 1 
the roast beef sandwich tasted really good 1 
one of my favorite purchases ever 1 
i put the latest os on it v115g and it now likes to slow to a crawl and lock up every once in a while 0 
now this dish was quite flavourful 1 
the owner used to work at nobu so this place is really similar for half the price 1 
mediocre food 0 
i really enjoyed eating here 1 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
i love it 1 
i know he was a contract player with little control over his scripts but the acting was as bad as the script 0 
nice blanket of moz over top but i feel like this was done to cover up the subpar food 1 
the text messaging feature is really tricky to use 0 
it is super charged up for use as a small hybrid palmtopcameracellphone and excels in those roles 1 
i wasted my little money with this earpiece 0 
an hour and a half i wish i could bring back 0 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
often the dialogue doesnt really follow from one line to another or fit the surroundings 0 
instead we got a bore fest about a whiny spoiled brat babysitting 0 
same evening him and i are both drastically sick 0 
my 5year old nokia 2160 from tracfone holds the charge a lot better than this 0 
dont waste your time 0 
but in any case the best part is you can download these pictures to your laptop using ir or even send pictures from your laptop to the phone 1 
better than expected 1 
this is a beautiful phone 1 
items stated as included from the description are not included 0 
all of the tapas dishes were delicious 1 
its fits like a glove and is strong secure and durable 1 
i let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this bad idea we both hated it 0 
i liked the patio and the service was outstanding 1 
its also great to see that renowned silent screenwriter frances marion hasnt missed a step going from silent to sound 1 
ordered burger rare came in well done 0 
the movie is terribly boring in places 0 
i dont each much pasta but i love the homemade hand made pastas and thin pizzas here 1 
good case excellent value 1 
conclusion very filling meals 1 
timely shipment and quality product 1 
if there was ever an indication of a writer and a directors ability to meld two highly volatile temperaments into a seamless union of creativity then this is it 1 
and it was way to expensive 0 
the dialogue is composed of things that make little sense 0 
i enjoyed it 1 
so i am here to warn youdo not rent this movie it is the dumbest thing you have never seen 0 
utterly without merit on any level this is akin to torture 0 
the movie has almost no action scenes in it and very little comedy 0 
the football scenes at the end were perplexing 0 
i think the most wonderful parts literally full of wonder are the excerpts from his works 1 
i love the look and feel of samsung flipphones 1 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
i love this place 1 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
it makes very strange ticking noises before it ends the call 0 
but when someone strives for greatness and poetry but delivers a muddled and often ridiculous story a bunch of disparate scenes pretentious dialogue then you get the worst kind of a movie that some other reviewer very accurately defined as pretentious crap 0 
its extremely slow and takes forever to do anything with it 0 
yes its that bad 0 
the least said about the acting the better 0 
better than expected 1 
a pretty good product 1 
restaurant is always full but never a wait 1 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
probably not in a hurry to go back 0 
this is a great phone 1 
im glad i found this product on amazon it is hard to find it wasnt high priced 1 
the cast is good 1 
that said our mouths and bellies were still quite pleased 1 
lets start with all the problemsthe acting especially from the lead professor was very very bad 0 
the descriptions said yum yum sauce and another said eel sauce yet another said spicy mayowell none of the rolls had sauces on them 0 
after two i felt disgusting 0 
this company charge me a restocking fee and still not given me my refund back 0 
very serious spoilers this movie was a huge disappointment 0 
it was so bad i had lost the heart to finish it 0 
the pizza tasted old super chewy in not a good way 0 
you wont be disappointed 1 
just whatever you do avoid groove as its the antithesis of all that is good about human traffic 0 
there is really nothing for me at postinos hope your experience is better 0 
nice quality build unlike some cheap s out there 1 
i will be back many times soon 1 
what is even more stupid is that who had thought an idea that there should be a volcano in los angeles 0 
by the time the film ended i not only disliked it i despised it 0 
i also didnt like the on button it felt like it would crack with use 0 
perfect for someone me who only likes beer ice cold or in this case even colder 1 
the management is rude 0 
lasted one day and then blew up 0 
good case 1 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
predictable but not a bad watch 1 
waited 2 hours never got either of our pizzas as many other around us who came in later did 0 
i hope this place sticks around 1 
and it was boring 0 
dont buy this product 0 
but its just not funny 0 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
this place is awesome if you want something light and healthy during the summer 1 
case was more or less an extra that i originally put on but later discarded because it scratched my ear 0 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
i am also very happy with the price 1 
interesting decor 1 
if there were zero stars i would give it zero stars 0 
it is worth the drive 1 
victor mclaglen was even bad and brian donlevy was almost unrecognizable 0 
ive tried several different earpieces for my cell phone and this jabra one is the first one ive found that fits my ear comfortably 1 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
also great directing and photography 1 
we are sending it back 0 
seems like a good quick place to grab a bite of some familiar pub food but do yourself a favor and look elsewhere 0 
gets a signal when other verizon phones wont 1 
i felt asleep the first time i watched it so i can recommend it for insomniacs 0 
nice ambiance 1 
it is light has plenty of battery capacity and is very confortable to wear for somewhat extended periods of time 1 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
the bt headset was such a disapoinment 0 
my girlfriends veal was very bad 0 
this was like the final blow 0 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
i was seated immediately 1 
im terribly disappointed that this film would receive so many awards and accolades especially when there are far more deserving works of film out there 0 
he was extremely rude and really there are so many other restaurants i would love to dine at during a weekend in vegas 0 
how stupid is that 0 
the songs were the best and the muppets were so hilarious 1 
but it picked up speed and got right to the point 1 
worst ever 0 
not a weekly haunt but definitely a place to come back to every once in a while 1 
jawbone era is awesome too 1 
i advise everyone do not be fooled 0 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
if you are looking for a good quality motorola headset keep looking this isnt it 0 
i use this product in a motor control center where there is a lot of high voltage humming from the equipment and it works great 1 
i love the scream movies and all horror movies and this one ranks way up there 1 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
i would recommend it 1 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
this is probably one of the least effective and utterly unoriginal films i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
i think that it is a must see older john wayne film 1 
customer service was terrible 0 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
this is probably the most irritating show i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
terrible product and waste of money 0 
back to good bbq lighter fare reasonable pricing and tell the public they are back to the old ways 1 
poor voice clarity 0 
i did not have any problem with this item and would order it again if needed 1 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
i love this phone it is very handy and has a lot of features 1 
jawbone era is awesome too 1 
the acting was decidely wooden though no worse than a period universal b movie 0 
you have to hold the phone at a particular angle for the other party to hear you clearly 0 
they refuse to refund or replace 0 
but when someone strives for greatness and poetry but delivers a muddled and often ridiculous story a bunch of disparate scenes pretentious dialogue then you get the worst kind of a movie that some other reviewer very accurately defined as pretentious crap 0 
i could not stand to even watch it for very long for fear of losing iq 0 
the shrimp tender and moist 1 
classywarm atmosphere fun and fresh appetizers succulent steaks baseball steak 1 
their steaks are 100 recommended 1 
the portion was huge 1 
this gets a 1 out of 10 simply because theres nothing lower 0 
worst martini ever 0 
try them in the airport to experience some tasty food and speedy friendly service 1 
they refuse to refund or replace 0 
very displeased 0 
some applause should be given to the prelude however 1

also notable is john baileys fine crisp beautifully colored cinematography and the great production design costumes by eiko ishioka who went on to do the memorable costumes for coppolas dracula for which she received a well deserved oscar 1 
magical help 1

this item is great installed it let it charged up overnite and it has been working good every since with no problems 1 
the restaurant is very clean and has a family restaurant feel to it 1

the burger is good beef cooked just right 1 
the service was extremely slow 0

best service and food ever maria our server was so good and friendly she made our day 1 
unless youre just out to visually collect all extant films of austens work you can skip this one 0 
there was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth but it didnt really work into the rest of the plot 0 
the worst experience ever 0 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
i searched the internet and found this one to be the best value 1

highquality chicken on the chicken caesar salad 1 
i found a six inch long piece of wire in my salsa 0 
i received my headset in good time and was happy with it 1

however my girl was complain that some time the phone doesnt wake up like normal phone does 0 
the movie was very interesting from beginning to the end 1 
his use of the colours of the french flag in the three films was nothing short of incredible every shot every scene was like a work of art 1

disappointed with battery 0 
nice design and quality 1 
the ambience is wonderful and there is music playing 1 
leopard print is wonderfully wild 1 
i have eaten here multiple times and each time the food was delicious 1 
their frozen margaritas are way too sugary for my taste 0 
it has been a winner for us 1 
the movie had you on the edge of your seat and made you somewhat afraid to go to your car at the end of the night 1 
its kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly its embarrassing how childlike the company is 0 
its this pandering to the audience that sabotages most of his films 0 
the handsfree part works fine but then the car tries to download the address book and the treo rebootsoverall i still rate this device high 1 
i would give this television series a 10 plus if i could 1 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
im a bit disappointed 0 
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 
i got the aluminum case for my new palm vx and it worked really wellit has protected my handheld perfectly so far 1 
for service i give them no stars 0 
worst service to boot but that is the least of their worries 0 
however the ear pads come off easily and after only one week i lost one 0 
this place is way too overpriced for mediocre food 0 
this was one of the worst films i have ever seen 0 
dont waste your time here 0 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
i would not recommend this place 0 
however the keypads are so tinny that i sometimes reach the wrong buttons 0 
i heart this place 1 
both of the egg rolls were fantastic 1 
to those who find this movie intelligent or even masterful i can only say its your intelligence and your imagination you obviously used to try and make some sense of this pitiful attempt its in our human nature to try and make sense of things 0 
i couldnt think of a better way to end the film but a smile on my face great way to wrap up an amazing film and trilogy 1 
service sucks 0 
if you do go see this movie bring a pillow or a girlfriendboyfriend to keep you occupied through out 0 
love this place hits the spot when i want something healthy but not lacking in quantity or flavor 1 
someone shouldve invented this sooner 1 
low quality 0 
in fact its hard to remember that the part of ray charles is being acted and not played by the man himself 1 
first off the reception sucks i have never had more than 2 bars ever 0 
i find wasting food to be despicable but this just wasnt food 0 
too politically correct 0 
great price also 1 
good item low price 1 
his performance as awarded was stunning 1 
this phone is very fast with sending any kind of messages and web browsing is significantly faster than previous phones i have used 1 
my experience was terrible this was my fourth bluetooth headset and while it was much more comfortable than my last jabra which i hated 0 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
im really disappointed all i have now is a charger that doesnt work 0 
this is an excellent film 1 
treo and tmobile refused to replace it again and forced me to buy another phone without any kind of upgrade discount 0 
i must say i have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again 1 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
the atmosphere was great with a lovely duo of violinists playing songs we requested 1 
the film gives meaning to the phrase never in the history of human conflict has so much been owed by so many to so few 1 
how can you call yourself a steakhouse if you cant properly cook a steak i dont understand 0 
it really is impressive that the place hasnt closed down 0 
loved itfriendly servers great food wonderful and imaginative menu 1 
i connected my wifes bluetoothmotorola hs850 to my phone and it worked like a charm whether the phone was in my pocket or the case 1 
im so happy to be here 1 
if you want healthy authentic or ethic food try this place 1 
this place lacked style 0 
very displeased 0 
clever and a real crowdpleaserthis film still ranks among mickeys best films even after 80 wonderful years 1 
at no point in the proceedings does it look remotely like america 0 
steve martin delivers a really funny performance of a middleaged upper class uptight white guy 1 
i would advise to not purchase this item it never worked very well 0 
i found the product to be easy to set up and use 1 
not good for the money 0 
this phone works great 1 
john garfield ann revere lilli plmer william conrad canada leeand filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screenjames wong howe 1 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
i think the most wonderful parts literally full of wonder are the excerpts from his works 1 
verizon tech support walked my through a few procedures none of which worked and i ended up having to do a hard reset wiping out all my data 0 
i kept catching the cable on the seat and i had to pull the phone out to turn it on an off 0 
i have only had it for a few weeks but so far so good 1 
1 hour 54 minutes of sheer tedium melodrama and horrible acting a mess of a script and a sinking feeling of good lord what were they thinking 0 
all things considered a job very well done 1 
the restaurant is very clean and has a family restaurant feel to it 1 
well packaged arrived on time and works as intended 1 
the worst experience ever 0 
avoid at all costs 0 
i really wanted the plantronics 510 to be the right one but it has too many issues for methe good 0 
recommend with confidence 1 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
also great directing and photography 1 
works great 1 
the fries were not hot and neither was my burger 0 
and i just love the colors 1 
i gave it a 10 1 
the shower area is outside so you can only rinse not take a full shower unless you dont mind being nude for everyone to see 0 
the waiter wasnt helpful or friendly and rarely checked on us 0 
everything about this product is wrongfirst 0 
my sashimi was poor quality being soggy and tasteless 0 
so i bought about 10 of these and saved alot of money 1 
my first visit to hiro was a delight 1 
im glad the film didnt go for the most obvious choice as a lesser film certainly would have 1 
the majority of the logitech earbud headsets failed 0 
the movie was very interesting from beginning to the end 1 
i was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar not only because the quality is great but the service is fast and the food impeccable 1 
not sure who was more lost the flat characters or the audience nearly half of whom walked out 0 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
the only suspense i was feeling was the frustration at just how retarded the girls were 0 
im not sure what he was trying to do with this film 0 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
the shrimp tender and moist 1 
absolutel junk 0 
at least think to refill my water before i struggle to wave you over for 10 minutes 0 
however this didnt make up for the fact that overall this was a tremendously boring movie 0 
treo and tmobile refused to replace it again and forced me to buy another phone without any kind of upgrade discount 0 
much better than the other ayce sushi place i went to in vegas 1 
sorry i will not be getting food from here anytime soon 0 
i bought this phone as a replacement for my startac and have regretted it since 0 
the last 15 minutes of movie are also not bad as well 1 
my side greek salad with the greek dressing was so tasty and the pita and hummus was very refreshing 1 
as a courtroom drama its compelling as an indictment on the american justice system its frightening 1 
also difficult to put onid recommend avoiding this product 0 
the servers went back and forth several times not even so much as an are you being helped 0 
that one didnt work either 0 
im returning them 0 
i agree with jessica this movie is pretty bad 0 
the plot doesnt hang together at all and the acting is absolutely appalling 0 
my experience was terrible this was my fourth bluetooth headset and while it was much more comfortable than my last jabra which i hated 0 
the cashew cream sauce was bland and the vegetables were undercooked 0 
it lasts less than 3o minutes if i actually try to use the phonemy wife has the same phone with the same problem 0 
youll love how thin it is 1 
always a great time at dos gringos 1 
definitely worth checking out 1 
lastly the mozzarella sticks they were the best thing we ordered 1 
i saw mirrormask last night and it was an unsatisfactory experience 0 
the design is very odd as the ear clip is not very comfortable at all 0 
for readers who have already seen one of miyazakis films he is still in top form and made another worthwhile experience 1 
on a positive note our server was very attentive and provided great service 1 
summary the witticisms werent witty 0 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
a truly truly bad film 0 
i got the aluminum case for my new palm vx and it worked really wellit has protected my handheld perfectly so far 1 
a world better than 95 of the garbage in the theatres today 1 
you can even take self portraits with the outside exterior display very cool 1 
the stories were as unbelievable as the actors 0 
worst thai ever 0 
i loved it it was really scary 1 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0
