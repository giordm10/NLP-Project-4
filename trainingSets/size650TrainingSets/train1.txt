i liked it 1 
everything on the menu is terrific and we were also thrilled that they made amazing accommodations for our vegetarian daughter 1 
this is by far the worst purchase ive made on amazon 0 
overall i would recommend this phone over the new walkman 1 
well never go again 0 
ive tried several different earpieces for my cell phone and this jabra one is the first one ive found that fits my ear comfortably 1 
highly entertaining at all angles 1 
if you want a sandwich just go to any firehouse 1 
could not get strong enough signal 0 
a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it 1 
a good commentary of todays love and undoubtedly a film worth seeing 1 
ive also had problems with the phone reading the memory card in which i always turn it on and then off again 0 
so for our enjoyment we get to see them run around play games and be dangerous 1 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
i love lane but ive never seen her in a movie this lousy 0 
i would recommend purchasing the jabra jx10 series 2 which works flawlessly with my moto q go figure 1 
my order was not correct 0 
the art style has the appearance of crayonpencil drawings and is wonderfully colorful and fanciful 1 
it was just too horrible 0 
this movie has a cutting edge to it 1 
i love it 1 
these are fabulous 1 
each track commands sentiment actually contributing to the scenes and characters 1 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
we enjoy their pizza and brunch 1 
just spicy enough perfect actually 1 
utterly without merit on any level this is akin to torture 0 
it works fine on my motorola 325 cellphone and a lot better than the wornout battery did 1 
so i am here to warn youdo not rent this movie it is the dumbest thing you have never seen 0 
which is precisely why i am giving it such a bad review 0 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
poor reliability 0 
its a great tool for entertainment communication and data managementoh be sure to use activesync 42 for optimal data synchronization results 1 
we received a white colored battery that goes dead after a couple hoursthe original used to last a week but still lasts longer than thereplacement 0 
it was just not a fun experience 1 
this place was such a nice surprise 1 
its a great tool for entertainment communication and data managementoh be sure to use activesync 42 for optimal data synchronization results 1 
i rather enjoyed it 1 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
if you are reading this please dont go there 0 
and finally after all that we get to an ending that wouldve been great had it been handled by competent people and not jerry falwell 0 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
a drive thru means you do not want to wait around for half an hour for your food but somehow when we end up going here they make us wait and wait 0 
i find wasting food to be despicable but this just wasnt food 0 
id rather eat airline food seriously 0 
i am a fan of his this movie sucked really bad 0 
i have been to very few places to eat that under no circumstances would i ever return to and this tops the list 0 
i love being able to use one headset for both by landline and cell 1 
good case excellent value 1 
the only possible way this movie could be redeemed would be as mst3k fodder 0 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
the art style has the appearance of crayonpencil drawings and is wonderfully colorful and fanciful 1 
its a fresh subtle and rather sublime effect 1 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
this gets a 1 out of 10 simply because theres nothing lower 0 
best tacos in town by far 1 
my boyfriend and i sat at the bar and had a completely delightful experience 1 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
i ate there twice on my last visit and especially enjoyed the salmon salad 1 
the acting from all involved and that includes those like shatner and nimoy is bad and washed out and making them seem as old as they look in real life the special effects are tacky like when spock has to rescue kirk on a jet pack when he falls down from a mountain 0 
this blueant supertooth handsfree phone speaker is awesome 1 
i was particularly pleased with the acting ability of dwight schultz 1 
one of the worst shows of all time 0 
crust is not good 0 
this is simply the best bluetooth headset for sound quality 1 
works for me 1 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
definitely will come back here again 1 
i am sorry i made this purchase 0 
i did not bother contacting the company for few dollar product but i learned the lesson that i should not have bought this form online anyway 0 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
the directing seems too pretentious 0 
its too bad the food is so damn generic 0 
their onscreen chemistry critical to the entire film is genuine 1 
does not work 0 
all of the tapas dishes were delicious 1 
the burger is good beef cooked just right 1 
the camera really likes her in this movie 1 
the jamaican mojitos are delicious 1 
now this is a movie i really dislike 0 
each day of the week they have a different deal and its all so delicious 1 
i felt insulted and disrespected how could you talk and judge another human being like that 0 
this is not moviemaking 0 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
plus it was wellpaced and suited its relatively short run time 1 
mediocre food 0 
obviously they have a terrible customer service so you get what you pay for 0 
the headsets are easy to use and everyone loves them 1 
probably not in a hurry to go back 0 
absolutely great 1 
in my house i was getting dropped coverage upstairs and no coverage in my basement 0 
i also decided not to send it back because our waitress looked like she was on the verge of having a heart attack 0 
this review is long overdue since i consider a tale of two sisters to be the single greatest film ever made 1 
bad characters bad story and bad acting 0 
great brunch spot 1 
the story which was told so eloquently by francis ford coppola 25 years earlier really unfolds gradually and leaves room for the characters to develop 1 
im so sorry but i really cant recommend it to anyone 0 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
the film is way too long 0 
but i definitely would not eat here again 0 
the point is the journey a journey that touches every member of the family 1 
phone is sturdy as all nokia bar phones are 1 
there are the usual hitchcock logic flaws 0 
the food is good 1 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
for the price on amazon it is an excellent product which i would highly recommend 1 
also great directing and photography 1 
however the keypads are so tinny that i sometimes reach the wrong buttons 0 
mediocre food 0 
nice spicy and tender 1 
for 40 bucks a head i really expect better food 0 
great product 1 
my sashimi was poor quality being soggy and tasteless 0 
i mean in a realistic world she would never have gotten into that ballet repertory the whole thing was quite pathetic 0 
why was this film made 0 
nothing new there 0 
as for the service i thought it was good 1 
ive never been more insulted or felt disrespected 0 
the cashier was friendly and even brought the food out to me 1 
a good film by a great director 1 
i only hear garbage for audio 0 
an amazing finale to possibly the best trilogy of all time 1 
great place to relax and have an awesome burger and beer 1 
im pleased 1 
i thought it was bad 0 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
it was also the right balance of war and love 1 
i love it 1 
ive tried several different earpieces for my cell phone and this jabra one is the first one ive found that fits my ear comfortably 1 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
these are the central themes of the film and they are handled ineptly stereotypically and with no depth of imagination 0 
wont go back 0 
clear crisp sound 1 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
these headphones were a great find and i think they are perhaps the best purchase ive made in the last several years seriously 1 
black water is a thriller that manages to completely transcend its limitations its an indie flick by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience 1 
gave up trying to eat any of the crust teeth still sore 0 
come hungry leave happy and stuffed 1 
the servers are not pleasant to deal with and they dont always honor pizza hut coupons 0 
dont waste your time watching this rubbish nonresearched film 0 
customer service was terrible 0 
the battery is completely useless to me 0 
im not eating here 0 
this is a bad film with bad writing and good actorsan ugly cartoon crafted by paul haggis for people who cant handle anything but the bold strokes in storytellinga picture painted with crayons 0 
it works fine on my motorola 325 cellphone and a lot better than the wornout battery did 1 
design flaw 0 
works fine 1 
hackneyed writing certainly but made even worse by the bad directing 0 
this is simply the best bluetooth headset for sound quality 1 
i know that sounds funny but to me it seemed like sketchy technology that wouldnt work wellwell this one works great 1 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
battery is terrible 0 
i mean this in a terrible way 0 
ample portions and good prices 1 
this place lacked style 0 
cheap but hey it works was pleasantly suprised given the low cost of this item 1 
best breakfast buffet 1 
then the film just dropped the ball 0 
love this place hits the spot when i want something healthy but not lacking in quantity or flavor 1 
horrible dont waste your time and money 0 
it really is impressive that the place hasnt closed down 0 
i rather enjoyed it 1 
very much disappointed with this company 0 
we arent ones to make a scene at restaurants but i just dont get itdefinitely lost the love after this one 0 
cool phone 1 
i love this place 1 
after a year the battery went completely dead on my headset 0 
i tried the cape cod ravoli chickenwith cranberrymmmm 1 
this is truly an art movieit actually has a lot of art in it 1 
its a great tool for entertainment communication and data managementoh be sure to use activesync 42 for optimal data synchronization results 1 
it works fine on my motorola 325 cellphone and a lot better than the wornout battery did 1 
the delivery was on time 1 
come hungry leave happy and stuffed 1 
soggy and not good 0 
but it picked up speed and got right to the point 1 
terrible management 0 
and the rest of it just sits there being awful with soldiers singing songs about the masculinity they pledge themselves to hairsplitting about purity the admiration of swords etc 0 
very displeased 0 
terrible my car will not accept this cassette 0 
i love this place 1 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
the guys all had steaks and our steak loving son who has had steak at the best and worst places said it was the best steak hes ever eaten 1 
my boyfriend and i sat at the bar and had a completely delightful experience 1 
he was extremely rude and really there are so many other restaurants i would love to dine at during a weekend in vegas 0 
the staff is always super friendly and helpful which is especially cool when you bring two small boys and a baby 1 
the plot doesnt hang together at all and the acting is absolutely appalling 0 
its a sad movie but very good 1 
im super pissd 0 
i recently had problems where i could not stay connected for more than 10 minutes before being disconnected 0 
mediocre food 0 
after 20 minutes wait i got a table 0 
very displeased 0 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
things that went wrong they burned the saganaki 0 
we watched our waiter pay a lot more attention to other tables and ignore us 0 
the films dialogue is natural real to life 1 
what a mistake that was 0 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
if you love authentic mexican food and want a whole bunch of interesting yet delicious meats to choose from you need to try this place 1 
all this movie does is make you sick watching all these slackers make excuses for their stupid actions for 90 minutes 0 
not enough volume 0 
highly recommended a 1 
i gave it a 10 1 
but despite these few flaws this case is of exceptional quality and well worth the additional costs of owning an official oem product 1 
excellent product 1 
good value great food great service 1 
the phone loads super 1 
not a good item it worked for a while then started having problems in my auto reverse tape player 0 
a piece of cinematic garbage captured on celluloid 0 
the staff are also very friendly and efficient 1 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
mishima is extremely uninteresting 0 
as many people complained i found this headsets microphone was very weak 0 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
i do not know if this was emilio estevezs directorial debut but the pacing the interplay and development of the characters as well as some clever camera work surrounding the character estevez plays all suggest a natural eye 1 
the plot is nonsense that doesnt interest in the slightest way or have any uniqueness to it 0 
dont bother coming here 0 
great service and food 1 
the vegetables are so fresh and the sauce feels like authentic thai 1 
very satisifed with that 1 
bad fit way too big 0 
i am very impressed with this headset from plantronics 1 
i would give this television series a 10 plus if i could 1 
its not user friendly 0 
internet is excrutiatingly slow 0 
it crackles with an unpredictable youthful energy but honestly i found it hard to follow and concentrate on it meanders so badly 0 
i really wanted the plantronics 510 to be the right one but it has too many issues for methe good 0 
this device is great in several situations1 1 
i advise you to look out for it 1 
the charger worked for about a week and then completely stopped charging my phone 0 
you get extra minutes so that you can carry out the call and not get cut off 1 
now this dish was quite flavourful 1 
but the premise of the film was so ridiculous that the president of the us 0 
what i really like there is the crepe station 1 
ive missed numerous calls because of this reason 0 
i guess that nobody at the network that aired this dribble watched it before putting it on 0 
made very sturdy 1 
i get absolutely horrible reception in my apartment where with other phones i have not had this problem 0 
cant say enough good things about this place 1 
i recently had problems where i could not stay connected for more than 10 minutes before being disconnected 0 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
everything from acting to cinematography was solid 1 
what a disappointment 0 
horrible had to switch 3 times 0 
i wasted my little money with this earpiece 0 
dont buy this product 0 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
this mostly routine factbased tv drama gets a boost from the fine performance by cole 1 
awesome service and food 1 
awful service 0 
the film succeeds despite or perhaps because of an obviously meagre budget 1 
i did not have any problem with this item and would order it again if needed 1 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
nothing short of magnificent photographycinematography in this film 1 
the sides are delish mixed mushrooms yukon gold puree white corn beateous 1 
i am also very happy with the price 1 
probably never coming back and wouldnt recommend it 0 
the battery is working well as a replacement for the original that came with the phone over 2 years ago 1 
dont waste your time here 0 
this one works and was priced right 1 
i tried talking real loud but shouting on the telephone gets old and i was still told it wasnt great 0 
whatever prompted such a documentary is beyond me 0 
in particular the relationship between the bakery assistant and the waitress just didnt work for me at all 0 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
how can anyone in their right mind ask for anything more from a movie than this 1 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
the script is horrendously stupid 0 
excellent hands free tool 1 
i was hoping for more 0 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
in fact its hard to remember that the part of ray charles is being acted and not played by the man himself 1 
updatewent back for a second time and it was still just as amazing 1 
the building itself seems pretty neat the bathroom is pretty trippy but i wouldnt eat here again 0 
this is the kind of money that is wasted properly 1 
waste of 13 bucks 0 
you have to hold the phone at a particular angle for the other party to hear you clearly 0 
there is a lot of beautiful places 1 
the pleather case doesnt fit 0 
nicest chinese restaurant ive been in a while 1 
some may say this buffet is pricey but i think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot 1 
fast service 1 
the chefs were friendly and did a good job 1 
the first thing that happened was that the tracking was off 0 
great movie 1 
i love this place 1 
damian is so talented and versatile in so many ways of writing and portraying different characters on screen 1 
comfort for our whole family 1 
today was my first taste of a buldogis gourmet hot dog and i have to tell you it was more than i ever thought possible 1 
i guess it was supposed to be clever twist then shed some light on the situation but it was just stupid 0 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
i did not expect this to be so good 1 
the scripting of the subtle comedy is unmatched by any movie in recent years 1 
none of them are engaging or exciting 0 
the update procedure is difficult and cumbersome 0 
great product for the price 1 
it was a great phone 1 
this is a great product sure beats using your fingers 1 
the goat taco didnt skimp on the meat and wow what flavor 1 
nice case feels good in your hands 1 
it holds a charge for a long time is reasonably comfortable under longwearing conditions and the quality of sound is tremendous 1 
small sleek impressive looking practical setup with ample storage in place 1 
the acting helps the writing along very well maybe the idiotsavant sister could have been played better and it is a real joy to watch 1 
its like a bad two hour tv movie 0 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
there is nothing privileged about workingeating there 0 
and i just love the colors 1 
this item is fantastic and works perfectly 1 
does everything it should and more 1 
great for ipods too 1 
my first visit to hiro was a delight 1 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
it is unusable in a moving car at freeway speed 0 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
the design is very odd as the ear clip is not very comfortable at all 0 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
the acting sucks the music sucks the script sucks the pacing sucks the special fx suck the directing sucks basically this movie sucks 0 
my boyfriend tried the mediterranean chicken salad and fell in love 1 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
disappointing accessory from a good manufacturer 0 
excellent product for the price 1 
works good 1 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
just dont know why they were so slow 0 
fast service 1 
a very good film indeed about great and unconditional love 1 
the movie in movie situations in the beginning and through the game that is played with her by the acting coach are fascinating 1 
this movie is also revealing 1 
the only downside is the service 0 
the movie lacks visual interest drama expression of feeling and celebration of the very patriotism that underlines the narrative 0 
camerawork again bad 0 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
i own 2 of these cases and would order another 1 
both of the egg rolls were fantastic 1 
the pan cakes everyone are raving about taste like a sugary disaster tailored to the palate of a six year old 0 
i am so pleased to know such a modern day genius is out there letting is passion for art drive him and taking us as an audience with him 1 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
it is unusable in a moving car at freeway speed 0 
the steak was amazingrge fillet relleno was the best seafood plate i have ever had 1 
they made this case too small and is very difficult to install 0 
plus it was wellpaced and suited its relatively short run time 1 
they have great dinners 1 
this film tries to be a serious and sophisticated thrillerhorror flick and it fails miserably 0 
light weight i hardly notice it is there 1 
extremely tasty 1 
either way it sucks 0 
its a gloriously fun fast paced and fairly accurate portrayal of the night of a raver 1 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
plus its only 8 bucks 1 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
this place is not quality sushi it is not a quality restaurant 0 
trouble is the writing and directing make it impossible to establish those things that make a movie watchable like character story theme and so on 0 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
i have had problems wit hit dropping signal and more 0 
which are small and not worth the price 0 
not good by any stretch of the imagination 0 
this game rocks 1 
i felt asleep the first time i watched it so i can recommend it for insomniacs 0 
highly recommended a 1 
the phone crashed completely and now i have to get it replaced 0 
jabra ear gels r the best 1 
i have only had it for a few weeks but so far so good 1 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
in fact this stinker smells like a directtovideo release 0 
end of days is one of the worst bigbudget action movies ive ever seen 0 
it didnt work people can not hear me when i talk 0 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
i paid too much 0 
so i am here to warn youdo not rent this movie it is the dumbest thing you have never seen 0 
i enjoyed it 1 
people who like european films and art movies will like this movie 1 
pretty piece of junk 0 
it was a riot to see hugo weaving play a sexobsessed gay real estate salesman who uses his clients houses for his trysts with the flaming darren tom hollander 1 
and finally after all that we get to an ending that wouldve been great had it been handled by competent people and not jerry falwell 0 
worst customer service 0 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
seller shipped quickly and much cheaper than the competitors 1 
its really easy 1 
this is a simple little phone to use but the breakage is unacceptible 0 
i like design and look of jabra behing the ear headsets and 5020 is pretty comfortible to wear 24 hours a day without pain in the ear 1 
however after about a year the fliptop started to get loose and wobbly and eventually my screen went black and i couldnt receive and place calls 0 
regardless the film fails on most levels 0 
we started with the tuna sashimi which was brownish in color and obviously wasnt fresh 0 
i love it 1 
it lasts less than 3o minutes if i actually try to use the phonemy wife has the same phone with the same problem 0 
makes it easier to keep up with my bluetooth when im not wearing it 0 
the lighting is awful 0 
the burger is good beef cooked just right 1 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
its not hard to make a decent hamburger 0 
you cant relate with them hell you barely can understand them 0 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
they will customize your order any way youd like my usual is eggplant with green bean stir fry love it 1 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
oh yeah and the storyline was pathetic too 0 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
the food was barely lukewarm so it must have been sitting waiting for the server to bring it out to us 0 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
this is was due to the fact that it took 20 minutes to be acknowledged then another 35 minutes to get our foodand they kept forgetting things 0 
its like a really sexy party in your mouth where youre outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party 1 
if you see it you should probably just leave it on the shelf 0 
the music in the film is really nice too 1 
it is a true classic 1 
ive seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie 0 
gotta love those closeups of slimy drooling teeth 1 
the puppets look really cheesy not in a good way like in the puppet master 80s flicks 0 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
its this pandering to the audience that sabotages most of his films 0 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
everything stinks 0 
wow what a bad film 0 
it worked very well 1 
shes poised and amazing 1 
the sets especially designed to work with the camera are amazingstylized beautiful and effective 1 
i bought this to use with my kindle fire and absolutely loved it 1 
my ribeye steak was cooked perfectly and had great mesquite flavor 1 
when a song could explain the emotions of the subjects better such as when jay adams unfortunate life was a subject of talk the song old man by neil young was played which evokes many emotions 1 
but its just not funny 0 
director paul matthews who also wrotedirected the weak 1995 monster movie grim clearly doesnt know how to pace his films 0 
i was hoping for more 0 
same evening him and i are both drastically sick 0 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
the potatoes were like rubber and you could tell they had been made up ahead of time being kept under a warmer 0 
but now i was completely grossed out 0 
people who like european films and art movies will like this movie 1 
i recommend this for everyone who loves film movies anythinga work of art 1 
all of the main players are mesmerising 1 
a world better than 95 of the garbage in the theatres today 1 
i tried the cape cod ravoli chickenwith cranberrymmmm 1 
very very fun chef 1 
this place is disgusting 0 
call me a nut but i think this is one of the best movies ever 1 
good case excellent value 1 
host staff were for lack of a better word bitches 0 
i found the product to be easy to set up and use 1 
this is probably one of the least effective and utterly unoriginal films i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
the scenes are often funny and occasionally touching as the characters evaluate their lives and where they are going 1 
this scene is very strong and unpleasant 0 
when my order arrived one of the gyros was missing 0 
bland not a liking this place for a number of reasons and i dont want to waste time on bad reviewing ill leave it at that 0 
it quit working after id used it for about 18 months so i just purchased another one because this is the best headset ive ever owned 1 
the construction of the headsets is poor 0 
it fits my ear well and is comfortable on 1 
very very sad 0 
one nice thing was that they added gratuity on the bill since our party was larger than 6 or 8 and they didnt expect more tip than that 1 
the owners really really need to quit being soooooo cheap let them wrap my freaking sandwich in two papers not one 0 
the only suspense i was feeling was the frustration at just how retarded the girls were 0 
beware this is not a trashy cult movie this is trash period 0 
the only downside is the service 0 
we watched our waiter pay a lot more attention to other tables and ignore us 0 
there was no chemistry between ben affleck and sandra bullock in this film and i couldnt understand why he would consider even leaving his wifetobe for this chick that he supposedly was knocked out by 0 
i let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this bad idea we both hated it 0 
product is useless since it does not have enough charging current to charge the 2 cellphones i was planning to use it with 0 
works great 1 
the films dialogue is natural real to life 1 
will be back again 1 
the live music on fridays totally blows 0 
after a year the battery went completely dead on my headset 0 
worst service to boot but that is the least of their worries 0 
small sleek impressive looking practical setup with ample storage in place 1 
too bad cause i know its family owned i really wanted to like this place 0 
and the chef was generous with his time even came around twice so we can take pictures with him 1 
it is light easy to use and has very clear reception and transmission 1 
eclectic selection 1 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
its a great item 1 
the owners really really need to quit being soooooo cheap let them wrap my freaking sandwich in two papers not one 0 
he was extremely rude and really there are so many other restaurants i would love to dine at during a weekend in vegas 0 
ive bought 5 wired headphones that sound better than these 0 
dont bother go to the store 0 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
the characters are interesting and you want to find out more about them the longer the movie goes on and i think people will be surprised by who does and doesnt make it 1 
dont miss it 1 
just dont know why they were so slow 0 
tried to go here for lunch and it was a madhouse 0 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
this is an outstanding little restaurant with some of the best food i have ever tasted 1 
the visual effects were awful 0 
what a waste of money and time 0 
the scallop dish is quite appalling for value as well 0 
the food was outstanding and the prices were very reasonable 1 
the scripting of the subtle comedy is unmatched by any movie in recent years 1 
we received a white colored battery that goes dead after a couple hoursthe original used to last a week but still lasts longer than thereplacement 0 
i left the theater with a lilt in my step joy in my heart and hope for the human race 1 
i hope this place sticks around 1 
yeah the movie pretty much sucked 0 
there was a warm feeling with the service and i felt like their guest for a special treat 1 
i love this thing 1 
i dont think ill be running back to carlys anytime soon for food 0 
highly recommend for any one who has a blue tooth phone 1 
the script is bad very bad  it contains both cheesiness and unethical joke that you normally see in rated r or nc17 movie 0 
first off the reception sucks i have never had more than 2 bars ever 0 
nicest chinese restaurant ive been in a while 1 
the food was great as always compliments to the chef 1 
not a pleasant voyage of selfdiscovery 0 
were jerks on the phone 0 
product is exactly as described 1 
really good product 1 
this early film from future goremeister lucio fulci is a very good addition to the giallo subgenre 1 
try them in the airport to experience some tasty food and speedy friendly service 1 
i dont think ill be running back to carlys anytime soon for food 0 
couldnt use the unit with sunglasses not good in texas 0 
i had the mac salad and it was pretty bland so i will not be getting that again 0 
which has more depth and character than the man underneath it 0 
i highly recommend this case 1 
nobody identifies with these characters because theyre all cardboard cutouts and stereotypes or predictably reversestereotypes 0 
easy to use 1 
this early film from future goremeister lucio fulci is a very good addition to the giallo subgenre 1 
i felt as though her going to ireland did absolutely nothing whatsoever 0 
its worth driving up from tucson 1 
that company is a joke 0 
not loud enough and doesnt turn on like it should 0 
itll be a regular stop on my trips to phoenix 1 
works good 1 
i came back today since they relocated and still not impressed 0 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
the seasonal fruit was fresh white peach puree 1 
the jamaican mojitos are delicious 1 
i can take a little bad service but the food sucks 0 
appetite instantly gone 0 
i dont think i will be back for a very long time 0 
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 
i am a fan of his this movie sucked really bad 0 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
love the margaritas too 1 
problem is that the ear loops are made of weak material and break easily 0 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
the budget was evidently very limited 0 
i agree with jessica this movie is pretty bad 0 
this place lacked style 0 
pretty awesome place 1 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
i mean in a realistic world she would never have gotten into that ballet repertory the whole thing was quite pathetic 0 
i have had this phone for over a year now and i will tell you its not that great 0 
the plot simply rumbles on like a machine desperately depending on the addition of new scenes 0 
but when someone strives for greatness and poetry but delivers a muddled and often ridiculous story a bunch of disparate scenes pretentious dialogue then you get the worst kind of a movie that some other reviewer very accurately defined as pretentious crap 0 
poor talk time performance 0 
paolo sorrentino has written a wonderful story about loneliness and tony has built one of the most unforgettable characters seen in movies in recent years 1 
disappointed 0 
the service was poor and thats being nice 0 
poor quality 0 
but the duet between the astronaut and his doctor at the beginning of the movie is a perfect exchange if one considers that this movie was made well into the cold war and the astronauts biggest fear is that he has crashed in the ussr 1 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
i hate movies like that 0 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
its pure brilliance 1 
plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job 1 
we had a group of 70 when we claimed we would only have 40 and they handled us beautifully 1 
they were excellent 1 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
theres also enough hypocrisy in this film to make me vomit 0 
all in all ha long bay was a bit of a flop 0 
this is a masterful piece of filmmaking with many themes simmering and occasionally boiling over in this warts and all study of the poets bohemian selfindulgent wartime years that span the aerial bombardments of london and the outward tranquillity of a welsh coastal retreat the borderlines between friendship lust and love dedication to art and experience versus practical concerns jealousy rivalry cowardice and egotism versus heroism and selfsacrifice and more 1 
i would avoid this place if you are staying in the mirage 0 
for service i give them no stars 0 
see it 1 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
i tried the cape cod ravoli chickenwith cranberrymmmm 1 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
the story itself is just predictable and lazy 0 
this is one of the better buffets that i have been to 1 
the food was great as always compliments to the chef 1 
if you check the directors filmography on this site you will see why this film didnt have a chance 0 
what a piece of junk i lose more calls on this phone 0 
everything stinks 0 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
seriously killer hot chai latte 1 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
this is a great place to eat 1 
saw the movie today and thought it was a good effort good messages for kids 1 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
excellent 1 
then a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use 0 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
the puppets look really cheesy not in a good way like in the puppet master 80s flicks 0 
better than youd expect 1 
i gave it a 10 1 
the steaks are all well trimmed and also perfectly cooked 1 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
i was very disappointed 0 
the success of the film depends on the casting of sydney greenstreet as the alexander yardley character 1 
five star plus plus 1 
the real disappointment was our waiter 0 
lots of holes in the script 0 
my headset works just peachykeen 1 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
my headset works just peachykeen 1 
all in all im quite satisfied with this purchase 1 
then i exchanged for the same phone even that had the same problem 0 
not impressed 0 
it is shameful 0 
the dining space is tiny but elegantly decorated and comfortable 1 
i love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it 1 
the chips and salsa were really good the salsa was very fresh 1 
waste of money 0 
the script is was there a script 0 
there is so much good food in vegas that i feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to rice and company 0 
the acting helps the writing along very well maybe the idiotsavant sister could have been played better and it is a real joy to watch 1 
defective crap 0 
so absolutley fantastic 1 
portable and it works 1 
definitely will come back here again 1 
the battery life is highly unacceptable 0 
seriously flavorful delights folks 1 
this device is great in several situations1 1 
the screen does get smudged easily because it touches your ear and face 0 
also its slim enough to fit into my alarm clock docking station without removing the case 1 
i love the scream movies and all horror movies and this one ranks way up there 1 
all in all i think it was a good investment 1 
i work in the hospitality industry in paradise valley and have refrained from recommending cibo any longer 0 
this phone is pretty sturdy and ive never had any large problems with it 1 
full of unconvincing cardboard characters it is blandly written by edward chodorov who also produced and is surprisingly directed by jean negulesco from whom one would expect a great deal more 0 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
love this phone 1 
maybe there would be a reasonable explanation for this atrocity 0 
the sets especially designed to work with the camera are amazingstylized beautiful and effective 1 
when i received my pita it was huge it did have a lot of meat in it so thumbs up there 1 
will never ever go back and have told many people what had happened 0 
highly recommended 1 
then as if i hadnt wasted enough of my life there they poured salt in the wound by drawing out the time it took to bring the check 0 
this phone might well be the worst ive ever had in any brand 0 
i have always used corded headsets and the freedom from the wireless is very helpful 1 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
she ordered a toasted english muffin that came out untoasted 0 
i know he was a contract player with little control over his scripts but the acting was as bad as the script 0 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
i also decided not to send it back because our waitress looked like she was on the verge of having a heart attack 0 
the acting is beyond abysmal 0 
however after about a year the fliptop started to get loose and wobbly and eventually my screen went black and i couldnt receive and place calls 0 
a fantastic neighborhood gem 1 
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 
while i managed to bend the leaf spring back in place the metal now has enough stress that it will break on the next drop 0 
it was a very superficial movie and it gave me the feeling that i was watching play rather than a film 0 
so just beware 0 
worst service to boot but that is the least of their worries 0 
disappointed 0 
its not what it says it is 0 
all this movie does is make you sick watching all these slackers make excuses for their stupid actions for 90 minutes 0 
i was sitting in my vehicle with the cradle on my belt and the headset lost signal 0 
i came back today since they relocated and still not impressed 0 
that said our mouths and bellies were still quite pleased 1 
the movie was so boring that i sometimes found myself occupied peaking in the paper instead of watching never happened during a columbo movie before 0 
it also took her forever to bring us the check when we asked for it 0 
battery life is real good 1 
the spaghetti is nothing special whatsoever 0 
if you are razr owneryou must have this 1
