end of days is one of the worst bigbudget action movies ive ever seen 0 
steamboat willie is an amazingly important film to our cinema history 1 
the problem i have is that they charge 1199 for a sandwich that is no bigger than a subway sub which offers better and more amount of vegetables 0 
i had high hopes for this place since the burgers are cooked over a charcoal grill but unfortunately the taste fell flat way flat 0 
whatever the producer was going for he missed entirely 0 
i had ordered a motorola data cable got a very well finished and working product 1 
it is the best charger i have seen on the market yet 1 
i love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it 1 
clever and a real crowdpleaserthis film still ranks among mickeys best films even after 80 wonderful years 1 
this is definitely one of the better documentaries i have seen looking at family relationships and marriage 1 
the acting is fantastic the stories are seamlessly woven together and the dogs are splendid a must rent view or see 1 
we started with the tuna sashimi which was brownish in color and obviously wasnt fresh 0 
the food was great as always compliments to the chef 1 
if you look for authentic thai food go else where 0 
great value 1 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
be sure to order dessert even if you need to pack it togo the tiramisu and cannoli are both to die for 1 
we started with the tuna sashimi which was brownish in color and obviously wasnt fresh 0 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
owners are really great people 1 
i wasnt really impressed with strip steak 0 
these are fabulous 1 
good food good service 1 
painful on the ear 0 
having trouble with volume 0 
dont buy it 0 
i knew when i saw the film that more great things were to come from this gifted actor 1 
the stories were as unbelievable as the actors 0 
the pancake was also really good and pretty large at that 1 
if that bug never showed up i would have given a 4 for sure but on the other side of the wall where this bug was climbing was the kitchen 0 
howeverthe riingtones are not the best and neither are the games 0 
on the negative its insipid enough to cause regret for another 2 hours of life wasted in front of the screen 0 
i kept catching the cable on the seat and i had to pull the phone out to turn it on an off 0 
this is a good joint 1 
this was like the final blow 0 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
i dont know what the big deal is about this place but i wont be back yaall 0 
i think i was one of the people who found this another one of roths pearls 1 
the staff are great the ambiance is great 1 
battery is holding up well 1 
i love that they put their food in nice plastic containers as opposed to cramming it in little paper takeout boxes 1 
i mean in a realistic world she would never have gotten into that ballet repertory the whole thing was quite pathetic 0 
lately they have been extremely nice and helpful on the phone 1 
the fries were great too 1 
the construction of the headsets is poor 0 
i saw it as a child on tv back in 1973 when it was the stranger and i loved it 1 
this one is simply a disappointment 0 
i have to mention this and it is a huge spoiler i loved the ending how all the characters of the three films were the remaining survivors of the ferry disaster with valentine and the young judge together and the old man watching it on her tv solidifying his happiness over the suffering which he dealt with for those many years 1 
i ended up sliding it on the edge of my pants or back pockets instead 1 
very comfortable 1 
i swung in to give them a try but was deeply disappointed 0 
best service and food ever maria our server was so good and friendly she made our day 1 
to my disbelief each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods i have ever tasted 0 
truly awful 0 
it didnt charge for me 0 
happy so far 1 
i got the aluminum case for my new palm vx and it worked really wellit has protected my handheld perfectly so far 1 
a very very very slowmoving aimless movie about a distressed drifting young man 0 
does not work 0 
the vegetables are so fresh and the sauce feels like authentic thai 1 
i was very disappointed in the movie 0 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
the poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying 0 
all things considered a job very well done 1 
great pizza and salads 1 
fast service 1 
terrible management 0 
i rate this movie 910 1 
it is cheap and it feel and look just as cheap 0 
10 out of 10 stars 1 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
the seller is very understanding and patient i would definitely buy from them again 1 
adapter does not provide enough charging current 0 
i wont say any more i dont like spoilers so i dont want to be one but i believe this film is worth your time 1 
happy so far 1 
im really disappointed all i have now is a charger that doesnt work 0 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
you will leave the theater wanting to go out and dance under the stars 1 
lasted one day and then blew up 0 
is it possible for a movie to get any worse than this 0 
on the ground right next to our table was a large smeared beensteppedinandtrackedeverywhere pile of green bird poop 0 
then i watched it again two sundays ago march 20th 2005 and i began to really enjoy it and this time i taped the entire thing 1 
2 times very bad customer service 0 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
were jerks on the phone 0 
she carries the movie well 1 
i definitly recommend 1 
the waiter wasnt helpful or friendly and rarely checked on us 0 
great pizza and salads 1 
this is a really fantastic thai restaurant which is definitely worth a visit 1 
everything on the menu is terrific and we were also thrilled that they made amazing accommodations for our vegetarian daughter 1 
the service was not up to par either 0 
the result is a powerhouse achievement made more timely now perhaps because of our cultures disturbing fascination with celebrity and its distorted interpretations of fame 1 
not impressed 0 
performed awful muffled tinny incoming sound and severe echo for those on the other end of the call 0 
it really created a unique feeling though 1 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
their research and development division obviously knows what theyre doing 1 
we got sitting fairly fast but ended up waiting 40 minutes just to place our order another 30 minutes before the food arrived 0 
the movie was so boring that i sometimes found myself occupied peaking in the paper instead of watching never happened during a columbo movie before 0 
it is cheap and it feel and look just as cheap 0 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
this was utterly confusing at first which caused me to lose a couple of very very important contacts 0 
tasted like dirt 0 
their rotating beers on tap is also a highlight of this place 1 
just as good as when i had it more than a year ago 1 
ive also had problems with the phone reading the memory card in which i always turn it on and then off again 0 
still waiting im sure this item would work well if i ever recieve it 0 
coming here is like experiencing an underwhelming relationship where both parties cant wait for the other person to ask to break up 0 
there was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters 0 
if you havent gone here go now 1 
when my order arrived one of the gyros was missing 0 
classywarm atmosphere fun and fresh appetizers succulent steaks baseball steak 1 
after 3 months screen just went black all of a sudden 0 
helen baxendale is a very credible lady macbeth who can be very cheerfull at times and sometimes she just looks like a naughty girl but deadly in her taste for blood and evil 1 
i will never forget it now 1 
the flat reenactments dont hold your attention because they are emotionally adrift and stagy 0 
first the bathrooms at this location were dirty seat covers were not replenished just plain yucky 0 
go and see it 1 
the food was great as always compliments to the chef 1 
the instructions didnt explain that a microphone jack could be used 0 
the battery is completely useless to me 0 
i dont each much pasta but i love the homemade hand made pastas and thin pizzas here 1 
not a good item it worked for a while then started having problems in my auto reverse tape player 0 
eclectic selection 1 
this is one of the best italian thrillers of the early 70s 1 
steamboat willie is an amazingly important film to our cinema history 1 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
then a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use 0 
i will not be eating there again 0 
his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic 1 
its practically perfect in all of them Â– a true masterpiece in a sea of faux masterpieces 1 
all the actors give a wonderful performance especially jennifer rubin as jamie harris who changes from the nervous starlet in the beginning through the strange events she is part of to the cool star 1 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
made very sturdy 1 
i received my orders well within the shipping timeframe everything was in good working order and overall i am very excited to have this source 1 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
theres really nothing bad i can say about this headset 0 
i found a six inch long piece of wire in my salsa 0 
everything about this film is simply incredible 1 
when i received my pita it was huge it did have a lot of meat in it so thumbs up there 1 
lightweight and works well 1 
my husband and i ate lunch here and were very disappointed with the food and service 0 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichÃ©s to be admitted elsewhere 0 
i will come back here every time im in vegas 1 
it is worth the drive 1 
the cow tongue and cheek tacos are amazing 1 
the story which was told so eloquently by francis ford coppola 25 years earlier really unfolds gradually and leaves room for the characters to develop 1 
i am very happy 1 
must have been an off night at this place 0 
great phone 1 
ray charles life provided excellent biographical material for the film which goes well beyond being just another movie about a musician 1 
good servicecheck 1 
overall a great experience 1 
wont work right or atleast for me 0 
leopard print is wonderfully wild 1 
any grandmother can make a roasted chicken better than this one 0 
this hole in the wall has great mexican street tacos and friendly staff 1 
the battery works great 1 
very comfortable 1 
but when someone strives for greatness and poetry but delivers a muddled and often ridiculous story a bunch of disparate scenes pretentious dialogue then you get the worst kind of a movie that some other reviewer very accurately defined as pretentious crap 0 
he was extremely rude and really there are so many other restaurants i would love to dine at during a weekend in vegas 0 
plug was the wrong size 0 
great food and great service in a clean and friendly setting 1 
great hands free device 1 
what a mistake 0 
any ring toneoverall good phone to buy 1 
clever and a real crowdpleaserthis film still ranks among mickeys best films even after 80 wonderful years 1 
disappointing experience 0 
dont buy this product it fails 0 
phone now holds charge like it did when it was new 1 
superb phone on a great network 1 
the food is not tasty at all not to say its real traditional hunan style 0 
the speaker is of low quality so as making the ring tones sound very cheap 0 
the plot doesnt hang together at all and the acting is absolutely appalling 0 
hitchcock is a great director 1 
i think not again 0 
this is a great little item 1 
however my girl was complain that some time the phone doesnt wake up like normal phone does 0 
the film gives meaning to the phrase never in the history of human conflict has so much been owed by so many to so few 1 
there was no chemistry between ben affleck and sandra bullock in this film and i couldnt understand why he would consider even leaving his wifetobe for this chick that he supposedly was knocked out by 0 
battery is terrible 0 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
a very very very slowmoving aimless movie about a distressed drifting young man 0 
you share general loewenhielms exquisite joy in his partaking of the cailles en sarcophage even though you are just watching a movie but you do wish for just a small sample to savor 1 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
omg i felt like i had never eaten thai food until this dish 1 
the whole experience was underwhelming and i think well just go to ninja sushi next time 0 
the best place in vegas for breakfast just check out a sat or sun 1 
we waited for forty five minutes in vain 0 
id like to return it 0 
there is so much good food in vegas that i feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to rice and company 0 
could not get strong enough signal 0 
i really loved the story line and the poler bear was kinda cutebut if anyone has a question about fort steele just ask away 1 
the yellowtail carpaccio was melt in your mouth fresh 1 
if you love authentic mexican food and want a whole bunch of interesting yet delicious meats to choose from you need to try this place 1 
yes its shiny on front side and i love it 1 
i will be back many times soon 1 
setup couldnt have been simpler 1 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
all in all i can assure you ill be back 1 
its very slow 0 
the warm beer didnt help 0 
the soundtrack sucked 0 
the management is rude 0 
it was either too cold not enough flavor or just bad 0 
beware this is not a trashy cult movie this is trash period 0 
poor talk time performance 0 
i love the pho and the spring rolls oh so yummy you have to try 1 
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
however paul schrader has indeed made a film about mishima that is both superb complex 1 
what a waste 0 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
it fits so securely that the ear hook does not even need to be used and the sound is better directed through your ear canal 1 
good works fine 1 
very very sad 0 
very displeased 0 
the problem was the script 0 
i especially liked the noncliche choices with the parents in other movies i could predict the dialog verbatim but the writing in this movie made better selections 1 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
the characters are interesting and you want to find out more about them the longer the movie goes on and i think people will be surprised by who does and doesnt make it 1 
their monster chicken fried steak and eggs is my all time favorite 1 
this movie is bad 0 
makes it easier to keep up with my bluetooth when im not wearing it 0 
the jerky camera movements were also annoying 0 
earbud piece breaks easily 0 
if you do watch it however there are small consolations the actresses playing annes sisters each do a wonderful job with their roles 1 
talk about useless customer service 0 
it rocked my world and is certainly a must see for anyone with no social or physical outlets 1 
after the first charge kept going dead after 12 minutes 0 
if you see it you should probably just leave it on the shelf 0 
did not like at all 0 
i wasnt really impressed with strip steak 0 
the sweet potato fries were very good and seasoned well 1 
very very disappointed ordered the 35 big bay plater 0 
i just saw this film and i recommend it 1 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
integrated seamlessly with the motorola razr phone 1 
i am not a filmmaker nor am i a director but i would hide my head in the sand if id spent whatever amount of money and time on this movie 0 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
really ugly 0 
the lines the cuts the audio everything is wrong 0 
not nearly as good looking as the amazon picture makes it look 0 
my friend did not like his bloody mary 0 
that one didnt work either 0 
a truly truly bad film 0 
the foreigner is not worth one second of your time 0 
this is a stunning movie 1 
the only consistent thread holding the series together were the amazing performances of leni parker and anita laselva as the two taelons in quiet idealogical conflict 0 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
otherwise dont even waste your time on this 0 
it is light has plenty of battery capacity and is very confortable to wear for somewhat extended periods of time 1 
the voice recognition thru the handset is excellent 1 
down the drain because of a weak snap 0 
we had fantastic service and were pleased by the atmosphere 1 
our server was super nice and checked on us many times 1 
the restaurant atmosphere was exquisite 1 
the basic premise is wasted since it is sidelined by the inexplicable focus on the documentary crew 0 
you need at least 3 mins to get to your phone book from the time you first turn on the phonebattery life is short 0 
we walked away stuffed and happy about our first vegas buffet experience 1 
about ten minutes into this film i started having second thoughts 0 
customer service was terrible 0 
this phone is pretty sturdy and ive never had any large problems with it 1 
i wish i could return the unit and get back my money 0 
i love all the features and form factor 1 
i dont think there are any redeeming qualities in this remake 0 
you need at least 3 mins to get to your phone book from the time you first turn on the phonebattery life is short 0 
i love the scream movies and all horror movies and this one ranks way up there 1 
maybe its just their vegetarian fare but ive been twice and i thought it was average at best 0 
i have eaten here multiple times and each time the food was delicious 1 
its one of the movies i need to see whenever it comes on tvnever mind the fact that i already have it memorized 1 
the movie was very interesting from beginning to the end 1 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
5 stars for the brick oven bread app 1 
we are sending it back 0 
i have had problems wit hit dropping signal and more 0 
the sangria was about half of a glass wine full and was 12 ridiculous 0 
i would highly recommend this product 1 
this is a good joint 1 
what a waste 0 
when i received my pita it was huge it did have a lot of meat in it so thumbs up there 1 
love it great armband 1 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
doesnt hold charge 0 
the camera really likes her in this movie 1 
disappointing experience 0 
in the span of an hour i had two people exclaim whoa is that the new phone on tv 1 
bacon is hella salty 1 
an awesome new look for fall 2000 1 
what makes this story different are the terrific production values faultless photography composition and editing the terrific casting the underappreciated brian keith playing a bully teddy and vivid history 1 
the calls drop the phone comes on and off at will the screen goes black and the worst of all it stops ringing intermittently 0 
the seasonal fruit was fresh white peach puree 1 
my husband said she was very rude did not even apologize for the bad food or anything 0 
a fantastic neighborhood gem 1 
it defeats the purpose of a bluetooth headset 0 
about 30 minutes of footage is wasted to show mediocre elderly actors awkwardly babbling overwrought pseudosatanic gibberish corny enough to make a teen goth blush almost always in olde english and sometimes in latin that may or may not be made up words 0 
a great way to finish a great 1 
i really do recommend this place you can go wrong with this donut place 1 
incredible 1 
camerawork again bad 0 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
pricing is a bit of a concern at mellow mushroom 0 
nice spicy and tender 1 
victor mclaglen was even bad and brian donlevy was almost unrecognizable 0 
its reception is very very poor 0 
i was hoping for more 0 
best of all is the rotating feature very helpful 1 
i had absolutely no problem with this headset linking to my 8530 blackberry curve 1 
product was excellent and works better than the verizon one and boy was it cheaper 1 
when my order arrived one of the gyros was missing 0 
the awful dialogue and hopeless overacting by everyone who gets shot top off a real waste of space and time 0 
this place is like chipotle but better 1 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
ive had this bluetoooth headset for some time now and still not comfortable with the way it fits on the ear 0 
you cant beat the price on these 1 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
love this product 1 
being a 90s child i truly enjoyed this show and i can proudly say that i enjoyed it big time and even more than the classical wb cartoons 1 
dont waste your time here 0 
seriously killer hot chai latte 1 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
the loudspeaker option is great the bumpers with the lights is very appealing 0 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
service was very prompt 1 
dont waste your on this one 0 
which has more depth and character than the man underneath it 0 
good audio quality 1 
i checked everywhere and there is no feature for it which is really disappointing 0 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
i paid the bill but did not tip because i felt the server did a terrible job 0 
all the bread is made inhouse 1 
excellent bluetooth headset 1 
they do not care about the consumer one bit 0 
special mention should be made of the superb music score and sound effects which are an integral element in helping to make this such a memorable and enjoyable cartoon 1 
for the price on amazon it is an excellent product which i would highly recommend 1 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
dont waste your time 0 
horrible phone 0 
do not make the same mistake as me 0 
the shower area is outside so you can only rinse not take a full shower unless you dont mind being nude for everyone to see 0 
however i recently watched the whole thing again on dvd and i was completely struck by how extremely stupid the storyline was how it contained holes inconsistencies and frankly a whole lot of crap and how horrid the dancing was 0 
delicious nyc bagels good selections of cream cheese real lox with capers even 1 
the meat was pretty dry i had the sliced brisket and pulled pork 0 
the refried beans that came with my meal were dried out and crusty and the food was bland 0 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
exactly what i wanted 1 
conclusion i loved it 1 
this movie was kind of long in length but i enjoyed every minute of it 1 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
nice spicy and tender 1 
terrible my car will not accept this cassette 0 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
not recommended 0 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
very bad performance plays angela bennett a computer expert who is at home all the time 0 
the jamaican mojitos are delicious 1 
a standout scene 1 
dont waste your money and time 0 
love the margaritas too 1 
this is essentially a communications tool that does not communicate 0 
it always cuts out and makes a beep beep beep sound then says signal failed 0 
its hard not to fall headoverheels in love with that girl 1 
rip off over charge shipping 0 
no plot whatsoever 0 
not even good for camp value 0 
exceptionally bad 0 
adapter does not provide enough charging current 0 
the update procedure is difficult and cumbersome 0 
ive had better not only from dedicated boba tea spots but even from jenni pho 0 
the phone takes forever to charge like 2 to 5 hours literally 0 
very poor service 0 
black water is a thriller that manages to completely transcend its limitations its an indie flick by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience 1 
best of all is the rotating feature very helpful 1 
all the pretty pictures in the world cannot make up for a piece of work that is flawed at the core 0 
my sashimi was poor quality being soggy and tasteless 0 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
these are the nicest restaurant owners ive ever come across 1 
i didnt realize how wonderful the short really is until the last two scenes 1 
this movie is a good and humorous comment on life in 2006 1 
food was really boring 0 
the whole experience was underwhelming and i think well just go to ninja sushi next time 0 
judith light is one of my favorite actresses and i think she does a superb job in this film 1 
this really is how vegas fine dining used to be right down to the menus handed to the ladies that have no prices listed 1 
its fits like a glove and is strong secure and durable 1 
do not buy for d807wrongly advertised for d807 0 
raw and sublimely moving 1 
everything was good and tasty 1 
the servers are not pleasant to deal with and they dont always honor pizza hut coupons 0 
this is not moviemaking 0 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
product is exactly as described 1 
definitely worth checking out 1 
my mother and brother had to do thiswhen i saw robert ryan portraying this type of man it was a very good imitation of this type of individual and i was impressed 1 
i went to bachi burger on a friends recommendation and was not disappointed 1 
if you want a sandwich just go to any firehouse 1 
i would recommend this 1 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
works great when my cat attacked the phone he scratched the protective strip instead of destroying the screen 1 
the calls drop the phone comes on and off at will the screen goes black and the worst of all it stops ringing intermittently 0 
the characters are interesting even if a bit predictable 1 
when achille and philippa beautifully sing a duet from don giovanni that perfectly describes their situation in the movie you appreciate the subtle layers of this excellent film 1 
i felt insulted and disrespected how could you talk and judge another human being like that 0 
it never condescends all the characters have good genuine hearts and believable problems 1 
very disappointing 0 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
we got sitting fairly fast but ended up waiting 40 minutes just to place our order another 30 minutes before the food arrived 0 
we had fantastic service and were pleased by the atmosphere 1 
it seems completely secure both holding on to my belt and keeping the iphone inside 1 
these are the nicest restaurant owners ive ever come across 1 
cute quaint simple honest 1 
brilliance indeed 1 
in the span of an hour i had two people exclaim whoa is that the new phone on tv 1 
this case seems well made 1 
warning stay away 0 
the vegetables are so fresh and the sauce feels like authentic thai 1 
the descriptions said yum yum sauce and another said eel sauce yet another said spicy mayowell none of the rolls had sauces on them 0 
one of the best mexican movies ever and one of the less understood even by mexican themselves no matter how identified the should have felt with it 1 
the potatoes were great and so was the biscuit 1 
customer service was terrible 0 
saw the movie today and thought it was a good effort good messages for kids 1 
excellent performance 1 
five star plus plus 1 
i mean this in a terrible way 0 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
bad fit way too big 0 
i bought this battery with a coupon from amazon and im very happy with my purchase 1 
great product 1 
the chefs were friendly and did a good job 1 
this film tries to be a serious and sophisticated thrillerhorror flick and it fails miserably 0 
it was attached to a gas station and that is rarely a good sign 0 
the calls drop the phone comes on and off at will the screen goes black and the worst of all it stops ringing intermittently 0 
we ordered the duck rare and it was pink and tender on the inside with a nice char on the outside 1 
i will not be eating there again 0 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
the pizza tasted old super chewy in not a good way 0 
basically the service was very bad 0 
in short dont bother with this movie 0 
lordy the khao soi is a dish that is not to be missed for curry lovers 1 
not much dialogue not much music the whole film was shot as elaborately and aesthetically like a sculpture 1 
this is the kind of money that is wasted properly 1 
the phone gets extremely hot 0 
each day of the week they have a different deal and its all so delicious 1 
not recommended 0 
the 12 mega pixel camera being a part of a phone is reasonably good7 1 
the crÃªpe was delicate and thin and moist 1 
i came back today since they relocated and still not impressed 0 
i promise they wont disappoint 1 
very disappointing 0 
so i basically threw my money out the window for nothing 0 
the potato chip order was sad i could probably count how many chips were in that box and it was probably around 12 0 
cant get the software to work with my computer 0 
i believe the screenwriter did a good job of tying up the loose ends 1 
this is the phone to get for 2005 i just bought my s710a and all i can say is wow 1 
i have been very happy with the 510 and have had no complaints from any one regarding my sound quality on their end 1 
how awesome is that 1 
it plays louder than any other speaker of this size the price is so low that most would think the quality is lacking however its not 1 
the only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive 1 
the grilled chicken was so tender and yellow from the saffron seasoning 1 
i wasted my little money with this earpiece 0 
their research and development division obviously knows what theyre doing 1 
the waitresses are very friendly 1 
much better than the other ayce sushi place i went to in vegas 1 
i cant wait to go back 1 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
the only thing i wasnt too crazy about was their guacamole as i dont like it purÃ©ed 0 
the phone loads super 1 
the salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop which was perfectly cooked 1 
his performance is simply genius 1 
the worst sappiest dialogue i could go on and on 0 
but it wasnt anything at all just one big yawn 0 
horrible phone 0 
like the other reviewer said you couldnt pay me to eat at this place again 0 
i advise you to look out for it 1 
a piece of junk that broke after being on my phone for 2 days 0 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
this place is not worth your time let alone vegas 0 
this is one of the better buffets that i have been to 1 
it doesnt make you look cool 0 
people couldnt hear me talk and i had to pull out the earphone and talk on the phone 0 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
the phone takes forever to charge like 2 to 5 hours literally 0 
very good food great atmosphere1 1 
the construction of the headsets is poor 0 
too bad cause i know its family owned i really wanted to like this place 0 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
cheap but hey it works was pleasantly suprised given the low cost of this item 1 
if there was ever an indication of a writer and a directors ability to meld two highly volatile temperaments into a seamless union of creativity then this is it 1 
this was my first time and i cant wait until the next 1 
the songs were the best and the muppets were so hilarious 1 
this is a bad film with bad writing and good actorsan ugly cartoon crafted by paul haggis for people who cant handle anything but the bold strokes in storytellinga picture painted with crayons 0 
this is a good joint 1 
their menu is diverse and reasonably priced 1 
the memories are murky but i can only say that i enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show 1 
it is light easy to use and has very clear reception and transmission 1 
worst customer service 0 
you could only take 2 videos at a time and the quality was very poor 0 
then i had to continue pairing it periodically since it somehow kept dropping 0 
my sister has one also and she loves it 1 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
avoid at any and all costs 0 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
10 out of 10 for both the movie and trilogy 1 
this is an extraordinary film 1 
with great sound effects and impressive special effects i cant recommend this movie enough 1 
i love that they put their food in nice plastic containers as opposed to cramming it in little paper takeout boxes 1 
however paul schrader has indeed made a film about mishima that is both superb complex 1 
all in all an excellent restaurant highlighted by great service a unique menu and a beautiful setting 1 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
i also didnt like the on button it felt like it would crack with use 0 
after trying many many handsfree gadgets this is the one that finally works well 1 
the pizza tasted old super chewy in not a good way 0 
thank you for such great service 1 
great software for motorolas 1 
dont make the same mistake that i did and please dont buy this phone 0 
very bad experience 0 
that said our mouths and bellies were still quite pleased 1 
elias koteasjack palance play good roles angelina is hot and gets nakedbilly drago appears in this and is cool as usual a cameo by sven ole thorsen helps make this a very enjoyable movie with good acting and a decent budget 1 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
im not sure how long we stood there but it was long enough for me to begin to feel awkwardly out of place 0 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
to my disbelief each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods i have ever tasted 0 
the plot well i said id let that one go 0 
join the club and get awesome offers via email 1 
the only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port irda 0 
i really liked that 1 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
utter crap sound quality is terrible 0 
i advise everyone do not be fooled 0 
considering the relations off screen between taylor and stanwyck it was surprising how little chemistry there was on screen between the two of them 0 
the camera although rated at an impressive 13 megapixels renders images that fall well below expectations of such a relatively high resolution 0 
this place is horrible and way overpriced 0 
maybe its just their vegetarian fare but ive been twice and i thought it was average at best 0 
crust is not good 0 
the attractive set used throughout most of the film is an eyepleasing gem 1 
awsome device works great 1 
muddy low quality sound and the casing around the wires insert was poorly super glued and slid off 0 
great brunch spot 1 
it looks very nice 1 
battery lasts only a few hours 0 
i do not know if this was emilio estevezs directorial debut but the pacing the interplay and development of the characters as well as some clever camera work surrounding the character estevez plays all suggest a natural eye 1 
excellent 1 
however this didnt make up for the fact that overall this was a tremendously boring movie 0 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
say bye bye to your tip lady 0 
motorola finally got the voice quality of a bluetooth headset right 1 
all in all id expected a better consumer experience from motorola 0 
sprint charges for this service 0 
one of the most disappointing aspects is the lack of notable gore 0 
this was one of the worst films i have ever seen 0 
on the up side their cafe serves really good food 1 
i totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is 1 
i checked everywhere and there is no feature for it which is really disappointing 0 
the scenes are often funny and occasionally touching as the characters evaluate their lives and where they are going 1 
perhaps i caught them on an off night judging by the other reviews but im not inspired to go back 0 
the cashier was friendly and even brought the food out to me 1 
i believe the screenwriter did a good job of tying up the loose ends 1 
and i really did find them funny 1 
very disappointed and wondered how it could be in the oscar shortlist 0 
the cashier was friendly and even brought the food out to me 1 
great product fast shipping 1 
the food wasnt good 0 
generous portions and great taste 1 
this phone is slim and light and the display is beautiful 1 
very friendly staff 1 
phone is sturdy as all nokia bar phones are 1 
then i had to continue pairing it periodically since it somehow kept dropping 0 
stay away from the q 0 
it is zillion times away from reality 0 
this is one of the best italian thrillers of the early 70s 1 
go watch it 1 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
its kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly its embarrassing how childlike the company is 0 
you can even take self portraits with the outside exterior display very cool 1 
love the margaritas too 1 
the pizza tasted old super chewy in not a good way 0 
so i am here to warn youdo not rent this movie it is the dumbest thing you have never seen 0 
unfortunately it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees 0 
performed awful muffled tinny incoming sound and severe echo for those on the other end of the call 0 
product was excellent and works better than the verizon one and boy was it cheaper 1 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
exceptionally bad 0 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani Â– particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
the eargels channel the sound directly into your ear and seem to increase the sound volume and clarity 1 
i wish i could enter negative values admins 0 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
i cant believe theres even a sequel to this 0 
having to humour him just to get by and get through the day was so apt 1 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
i love the scream movies and all horror movies and this one ranks way up there 1 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
this is a stunning movie 1 
i had absolutely no problem with this headset linking to my 8530 blackberry curve 1 
i liked this movie way too much 1 
bt50 battery junk 0 
great sound and service 1 
it was a bit too sweet not really spicy enough and lacked flavor 0 
a greasy unhealthy meal 0 
i will be back many times soon 1 
but i thought his acting was skilled 1 
the plot was the same as pretty much every other cheap horror 0 
i advise you to look out for it 1 
my brother in law who works at the mall ate here same day and guess what he was sick all night too 0 
this place is pretty good nice little vibe in the restaurant 1 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
i was very pleased to see that i could replace my well travled swivel holster for my blackberry flip 1 
please dont waste your money 0 
sauce was tasteless 0 
doesnt last long 0 
the stories were as unbelievable as the actors 0 
food was really boring 0 
as i said abovepretty useless 0 
what on earth is irons doing in this film 0 
i hate movies like that 0 
the directing and the cinematography arent quite as good 0 
dont waste your money 0 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
not a weekly haunt but definitely a place to come back to every once in a while 1 
will not be back 0 
really really good rice all the time 1 
it makes very strange ticking noises before it ends the call 0 
we ordered the duck rare and it was pink and tender on the inside with a nice char on the outside 1 
you wont forget this movie 1 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
the hockey scenes are terrible defensemen playing like theyre 5 years old goalies diving at shots that are 10 feet wide of the net etc 0 
worse theres an incredibly weak subplot thrown in that follows a little band of latterday mansonites as they go after a reporter whos working on a story on the anniversary of the killings 0 
no shifting no bubbling no peeling not even a scratch nothingi couldnt be more happier with my new one for the droid 1 
this greedy corporation will never see another dime from me 0 
as many people complained i found this headsets microphone was very weak 0 
but other than that the movie seemed to drag and the heroes didnt really work for their freedom 0 
were jerks on the phone 0 
i highly recommend this device to everyone 1 
works great 1 
the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach 0 
okay i like to consider myself a fair critic so ill give credit where credits duethe creature effects were actually pretty cool 1 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
this allows the possibility of double booking for the same date and time after the first 0 
drinks took close to 30 minutes to come out at one point 0 
i have eaten here multiple times and each time the food was delicious 1 
not much flavor to them and very poorly constructed 0 
ill give this film 10 out of 10 1 
eew this location needs a complete overhaul 0 
all things considered a job very well done 1
