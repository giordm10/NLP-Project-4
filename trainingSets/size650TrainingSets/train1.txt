soyo technology sucks 0 
bad day or not i have a very low tolerance for rude customer service people it is your job to be nice and polite wash dishes otherwise 0 
she ordered a toasted english muffin that came out untoasted 0 
itll be a regular stop on my trips to phoenix 1 
during several different 2 minute calls i experienced 5 drops and it was in an area that had 5 bars 0 
putting the race card aside lets look at the major flaw in the film they destroy latifas character 0 
ive never been more insulted or felt disrespected 0 
so good i am going to have to review this place twice once hereas a tribute to the place and once as a tribute to an event held here last night 1 
returned 8 hours later 0 
the cast is always entertaining as usual 1 
i live in the neighborhood so i am disappointed i wont be back here because it is a convenient location 0 
but whatever it was that cost them so much it didnt translate to quality thats for sure 0 
and sometimes it was so embarrassing that i had to look away 0 
the kids are annoying 0 
definitely worth checking out 1 
now you know why i gave it a 10 1 
i had a pretty satifying experience 1 
bad day or not i have a very low tolerance for rude customer service people it is your job to be nice and polite wash dishes otherwise 0 
the incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film 1 
the mic is great 1 
it had some average acting from the main person and it was a low budget as you clearly can see 0 
this movie was kind of long in length but i enjoyed every minute of it 1 
my phone doesnt slide around my car now and the grip prevents my phone from slipping out of my hand 1 
when im on this side of town this will definitely be a spot ill hit up again 1 
do not buy if you want to use the holster 0 
feelings thoughtsgabriels discomfort during the danceall these intangibles leap to life and come within the viewers grasp in hustons portrayal 1 
much better than the other ayce sushi place i went to in vegas 1 
this is a really fantastic thai restaurant which is definitely worth a visit 1 
the phone gets extremely hot 0 
it has kept up very well 1 
unfortunately inexperience of direction meant that scene after scene passed with little in the way of dramatic tension or conflict 0 
horrible 0 
i found this place by accident and i could not be happier 1 
unfortunately inexperience of direction meant that scene after scene passed with little in the way of dramatic tension or conflict 0 
i gave it 5 stars because of the sound quality 1 
itll be a regular stop on my trips to phoenix 1 
what a mistake 0 
the only thing i wasnt too crazy about was their guacamole as i dont like it puréed 0 
dont bother go to the store 0 
this place should honestly be blown up 0 
1 long lasting battery you dont have to recharge it as frequentyly as some of the flip phones2 0 
its also great to see that renowned silent screenwriter frances marion hasnt missed a step going from silent to sound 1 
i dont think there are any redeeming qualities in this remake 0 
only had this a month but its worked flawlessly so far 1 
this is a great deal 1 
1 long lasting battery you dont have to recharge it as frequentyly as some of the flip phones2 0 
youd have to have the iq of particularly stupid mollusk not to see that one coming 0 
but even the talented carrell cant save this 0 
well never go again 0 
awsome device works great 1 
the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach 0 
i especially love the long battery life 1 
total letdown i would much rather just go to the camelback flower shop and cartel coffee 0 
there are the usual hitchcock logic flaws 0 
at first i thought i was grtting a good deal at 744 until i plugged it into my phone v3c razr 0 
the story line is totally predictable 0 
another thing i didnt really like is when a character got punched in the face a gallon of blood would spew forth soon after 0 
i dont recommend unless your car breaks down in front of it and you are starving 0 
unfortunately any virtue in this films production work was lost on a regrettable script 0 
a fantastic neighborhood gem 1 
wonderful lil tapas and the ambience made me feel all warm and fuzzy inside 1 
i immediately said i wanted to talk to the manager but i did not want to talk to the guy who was doing shots of fireball behind the bar 0 
del taco is pretty nasty and should be avoided if possible 0 
its worth driving up from tucson 1 
how awful she is 0 
back to good bbq lighter fare reasonable pricing and tell the public they are back to the old ways 1 
the eargels channel the sound directly into your ear and seem to increase the sound volume and clarity 1 
they have a really nice atmosphere 1 
i love this thing 1 
this is an excellent tool especially when paired with your phones autoanswer 1 
very very fun chef 1 
as a sushi lover avoid this place by all means 0 
wow loved this place 1 
horrible 0 
very bad experience 0 
some highlights great quality nigiri here 1 
sam shepards portrayal of a gung ho marine was sobering 1 
the selection was probably the worst ive seen in vegasthere was none 0 
i also decided not to send it back because our waitress looked like she was on the verge of having a heart attack 0 
nice ambiance 1 
just what i wanted 1 
i liked it 1 
which has more depth and character than the man underneath it 0 
an amazing finale to possibly the best trilogy of all time 1 
great value 1 
dont waste your money 0 
the nokia ca42 usb cable did not work with my phone 0 
im surprised this is a good quality car charger and theres not much reviews about it 1 
it was absolutely amazing 1 
i really dont see how anyone could enjoy this movie 0 
in addition it feels amp looks as if the phone is all lightweight cheap plastic 0 
i left the theater with a lilt in my step joy in my heart and hope for the human race 1 
damian is so talented and versatile in so many ways of writing and portraying different characters on screen 1 
it is very educational for children 1 to 8 years old 1 
food was really good and i got full petty fast 1 
linked to my phone without effort 1 
was not happy 0 
kind of flops around 0 
overall a delight 1 
theres barely a boring moment in the film and there are plenty of humorous parts 1 
it showed exactly how the government and the scientist argued for humanity and the reasons of the gadget 1 
it is not good 0 
filmiing was less expansive 0 
blue ant is easy to use 1 
i go to far too many places and ive never seen any restaurant that serves a 1 egg breakfast especially for 400 0 
these are the nicest restaurant owners ive ever come across 1 
if you want a sandwich just go to any firehouse 1 
this is by far the worst purchase ive made on amazon 0 
the bipolarity of the ruthless thug one minute a ruthless killer the next minute a luvs diaper commercial is completely unconvincing 0 
from what my dinner companions told meeverything was very fresh with nice texture and taste 1 
good service very clean and inexpensive to boot 1 
the chicken i got was definitely reheated and was only ok the wedges were cold and soggy 0 
food was delicious 1 
i received it quickly and it works great 1 
full of unconvincing cardboard characters it is blandly written by edward chodorov who also produced and is surprisingly directed by jean negulesco from whom one would expect a great deal more 0 
this is a great deal 1 
i have read others reviews here but i havent had any problem with it 1 
the owner used to work at nobu so this place is really similar for half the price 1 
if this premise sound stupid thats because it is 0 
i dont know exactly what it is about this movie but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our familys memories 1 
they are so cool 1 
the movie in movie situations in the beginning and through the game that is played with her by the acting coach are fascinating 1 
they will customize your order any way youd like my usual is eggplant with green bean stir fry love it 1 
it is simple to use and i like it 1 
but kevin spacey is an excellent verbal tsunami as buddy ackerman  and totally believable because he is a great actor 1 
putting the race card aside lets look at the major flaw in the film they destroy latifas character 0 
even allowing for poor production values for the time 1971 and the format some kind of miniseries this is baaaaaad 0 
over rated 0 
everything from acting to cinematography was solid 1 
but i thought his acting was skilled 1 
if you want a real scare rent this one 1 
we enjoy their pizza and brunch 1 
youd have to have the iq of particularly stupid mollusk not to see that one coming 0 
not much flavor to them and very poorly constructed 0 
the selection was probably the worst ive seen in vegasthere was none 0 
great hands free device 1 
service was fantastic 1 
i am a fan of his this movie sucked really bad 0 
also difficult to put onid recommend avoiding this product 0 
the film is well paced understated and one of the best courtroom documentaries ive seen 1 
i used bitpim a free program you can find on the internetto transfer data to the phonethe price of the cable was excellent 1 
i am very impressed with the job that motorola did on the sturdiness of this phone 1 
it didnt make me scared horrified or make me sympathetic towards the characters it was simply annoying 0 
this is the phone to get for 2005 i just bought my s710a and all i can say is wow 1 
as for the service i thought it was good 1 
this movie is terrible 0 
ive bought 5 wired headphones that sound better than these 0 
im so happy to be here 1 
nargile i think you are great 1 
i know this is not like the other restaurants at all something is very off here 0 
about ten minutes into this film i started having second thoughts 0 
this film and i use that word loosely is an insult to the moviegoing public 0 
here in the wind and the lion we see a wonderful rendering of americas own imperial age 1 
i wasnt the least bit interested 0 
i have had this phone for over a year now and i will tell you its not that great 0 
again no plot at all 0 
the ending is so so perfect youll shed a tear 1 
her role was played well 1 
on three different occasions i asked for well done or medium well and all three times i got the bloodiest piece of meat on my plate 0 
i thought errol flynn was brilliant as custer and has since become my favourite actor 1 
what possesed me to get this junk i have no idea 0 
you get extra minutes so that you can carry out the call and not get cut off 1 
it was so bad i had lost the heart to finish it 0 
if you dont find it too bad as again the unit comes with one earpad onlyi would not recommend this to anyone 0 
their steaks are 100 recommended 1 
con spotty service 0 
the spaghetti is nothing special whatsoever 0 
i love all the features and form factor 1 
appetite instantly gone 0 
about 30 minutes of footage is wasted to show mediocre elderly actors awkwardly babbling overwrought pseudosatanic gibberish corny enough to make a teen goth blush almost always in olde english and sometimes in latin that may or may not be made up words 0 
it crackles with an unpredictable youthful energy but honestly i found it hard to follow and concentrate on it meanders so badly 0 
do not waste your money here 0 
its so stupid to have to keep buying new chargers car chargers cradles headphones and car kits every time a new phone comes out 0 
if you dont find it too bad as again the unit comes with one earpad onlyi would not recommend this to anyone 0 
i was very pleased to see that i could replace my well travled swivel holster for my blackberry flip 1 
everything about this film is simply incredible 1 
bela lugosi was totally extraneous intoning odd lines 0 
and the accents are absolutely abysmal 0 
dont waste your time watching this rubbish nonresearched film 0 
the phone is sturdy and waterproof 1 
the instruction manual is lacking 0 
at least think to refill my water before i struggle to wave you over for 10 minutes 0 
the ambiance was incredible 1 
he was extremely rude and really there are so many other restaurants i would love to dine at during a weekend in vegas 0 
see it with your kids if you have a chanceit will open up some amazing dialog about how far race relations have come in the last 50 years 1 
you will leave the theater wanting to go out and dance under the stars 1 
you will leave the theater wanting to go out and dance under the stars 1 
its hard not to fall headoverheels in love with that girl 1 
juano hernandez an exceptional actor who played supporting roles in many films of the era is a proud black man who is accused of murdering a white man in the south 1 
food was below average 0 
this product is great it makes working a lot easier i can go to the copier while waiting on hold for something 1 
pretty good beer selection too 1 
i was amazed at the quick arrival of the two original lg cell phone batteries and and at a fraction of the price 1 
i enjoyed it 1 
ive had no trouble accessing the internet downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions 1 
i am glad i purchased it 1 
however the ear pads come off easily and after only one week i lost one 0 
tasted like dirt 0 
comfortable fit you need your headset to be comfortable for at least an hour at a time if not for an entire day 1 
its so bad its actually worth seeing just for that reason 0 
in the summer you can dine in a charming outdoor patio so very delightful 1 
tried to go here for lunch and it was a madhouse 0 
but i thought his acting was skilled 1 
otherwise easy to install and use clear sound 1 
my sister has one also and she loves it 1 
the story line is totally predictable 0 
walked in and the place smelled like an old grease trap and only 2 others there eating 0 
too bad you have to pay up to a month for the service 0 
if you want healthy authentic or ethic food try this place 1 
i wish i could return the unit and get back my money 0 
battery life is also great 1 
battery is terrible 0 
if you love authentic mexican food and want a whole bunch of interesting yet delicious meats to choose from you need to try this place 1 
service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is vegas and located inside the crystals shopping mall by aria 1 
went in for happy hour great list of wines 1 
the food is not tasty at all not to say its real traditional hunan style 0 
i even fully charged it before i went to bed and turned off blue tooth and wifi and noticed that it only had 20 left in the morning 0 
i had to go to a store and bought a new nokia phone which is working great 1 
the characters are interesting and you really care for them 1 
wow loved this place 1 
after watching this film i wanted to learn more about the works of this artist 1 
this place is not quality sushi it is not a quality restaurant 0 
this film highlights the fundamental flaws of the legal process that its not about discovering guilt or innocence but rather is about who presents better in court 1 
this movie is so awesome 1 
best breakfast buffet 1 
top line dont waste your time and money on this one its as bad as it comes 0 
everything captain howdy says is either laughable or just plain stupid 0 
we thought youd have to venture further away to get good sushi but this place really hit the spot that night 1 
my sashimi was poor quality being soggy and tasteless 0 
an hour seriously 0 
the sound quality is excellent as well 1 
this is a great place to eat 1 
20th century foxs road house 1948 is not only quite a silly noir but is an implausible unmitigated bore of a movie 0 
love this place hits the spot when i want something healthy but not lacking in quantity or flavor 1 
i would recommend purchasing the jabra jx10 series 2 which works flawlessly with my moto q go figure 1 
the music in the film is really nice too 1 
i found this place by accident and i could not be happier 1 
the cashew cream sauce was bland and the vegetables were undercooked 0 
victor mclaglen was even bad and brian donlevy was almost unrecognizable 0 
i wish i could return the unit and get back my money 0 
nothing special 0 
this is the kind of money that is wasted properly 1 
the company shipped my product very promptly and it works well 1 
great steak great sides great wine amazing desserts 1 
as an earlier review noted plug in this charger and nothing happens 0 
waited 2 hours never got either of our pizzas as many other around us who came in later did 0 
this is some seriously good pizza and im an expertconnisseur on the topic 1 
it was either too cold not enough flavor or just bad 0 
it was a huge awkward 15lb piece of cow that was 34ths gristle and fat 0 
i wouldnt return 0 
i promise they wont disappoint 1 
the incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film 1 
first the bathrooms at this location were dirty seat covers were not replenished just plain yucky 0 
however after about a year the fliptop started to get loose and wobbly and eventually my screen went black and i couldnt receive and place calls 0 
both the hot sour the egg flower soups were absolutely 5 stars 1 
they could be used as exemplars for any set designer 1 
timely shipment and quality product 1 
never got it 0 
otherwise dont even waste your time on this 0 
i highly recommend this movie for anyone interested in art poetry theater politics or japanese history 1 
the staff is always super friendly and helpful which is especially cool when you bring two small boys and a baby 1 
nice headphones for the price and they work great 1 
and finally after all that we get to an ending that wouldve been great had it been handled by competent people and not jerry falwell 0 
mishima is extremely uninteresting 0 
this place is horrible and way overpriced 0 
gets a signal when other verizon phones wont 1 
i can take a little bad service but the food sucks 0 
there was no chemistry between ben affleck and sandra bullock in this film and i couldnt understand why he would consider even leaving his wifetobe for this chick that he supposedly was knocked out by 0 
the fried rice was dry as well 0 
classywarm atmosphere fun and fresh appetizers succulent steaks baseball steak 1 
this movie is bad 0 
great time family dinner on a sunday night 1 
these are fabulous 1 
his use of the colours of the french flag in the three films was nothing short of incredible every shot every scene was like a work of art 1 
just what i wanted 1 
we loved the place 1 
i had strawberry tea which was good 1 
worst service to boot but that is the least of their worries 0 
the worst experience ever 0 
punishment park is a brilliant piece of cinema 1 
the acting as youd expect from this cast is top notch 1 
bad purchase 0 
this is an outstanding little restaurant with some of the best food i have ever tasted 1 
lame would be the best way to describe it 0 
not too screamy not to masculine but just right 1 
so i bought about 10 of these and saved alot of money 1 
to be honest with you this is unbelievable nonsense and very foolish 0 
its too bad that everyone else involved didnt share crowes level of dedication to quality for if they did wed have a far better film on our hands than this subpar mess 0 
im super pissd 0 
the vanilla ice cream was creamy and smooth while the profiterole choux pastry was fresh enough 1 
the two main characters may be two of the most believable children i ever saw put on screen 1 
do not waste your time 0 
yet plantronincs continues to use the same flawed charger design 0 
phone is sturdy as all nokia bar phones are 1 
the football scenes at the end were perplexing 0 
this is an outstanding little restaurant with some of the best food i have ever tasted 1 
i seriously cannot believe that the owner has so many unexperienced employees that all are running around like chickens with their heads cut off 0 
service was very prompt 1 
the cow tongue and cheek tacos are amazing 1 
i wont spoil it but the ending in pretty amazing 1 
it looses connection to the phone even when it is within a couple feet between the two 0 
the 12 mega pixel camera being a part of a phone is reasonably good7 1 
avoid at any and all costs 0 
ill even say it again  this is torture 0 
good value works fine power via usb car or wall outlet 1 
gets the job done 1 
food was really good and i got full petty fast 1 
doesnt do the job 0 
there was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth but it didnt really work into the rest of the plot 0 
camera color balance is awful 0 
my sashimi was poor quality being soggy and tasteless 0 
were jerks on the phone 0 
my sister has one also and she loves it 1 
the acting sucks the music sucks the script sucks the pacing sucks the special fx suck the directing sucks basically this movie sucks 0 
the basic premise is wasted since it is sidelined by the inexplicable focus on the documentary crew 0 
okay i like to consider myself a fair critic so ill give credit where credits duethe creature effects were actually pretty cool 1 
excellent phone 1 
the movie is full of wonderful dancing hence the title 1 
bland and flavorless is a good way of describing the barely tepid meat 0 
what a great double cheeseburger 1 
this second appearance of mickey mouse following the silent plane crazy earlier that year is probably his most famous filmmostly because it was so groundbreaking 1 
we started with the tuna sashimi which was brownish in color and obviously wasnt fresh 0 
disappointment i hate anything that goes in my ear 0 
i will never go back to this place and will never ever recommended this place to anyone 0 
steve martin delivers a really funny performance of a middleaged upper class uptight white guy 1 
the noise shield is incrediable 1 
i will be back many times soon 1 
this place is way too overpriced for mediocre food 0 
they have a plethora of salads and sandwiches and everything ive tried gets my seal of approval 1 
i give it 2 thumbs down 0 
how awful she is 0 
the food is about on par with dennys which is to say not good at all 0 
the scenes are often funny and occasionally touching as the characters evaluate their lives and where they are going 1 
however after seeing the short again after about 25 years i was amazed at how timeless the film actually is 1 
this blueant supertooth handsfree phone speaker is awesome 1 
i am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this 1 
an amazing finale to possibly the best trilogy of all time 1 
great headset very impressed h500 1 
voice quality signal strength dropped calls 0 
food was average at best 0 
if you want a real scare rent this one 1 
it was so boring 0 
dont waste your on this one 0 
the burrittos blah 0 
the speaker is of low quality so as making the ring tones sound very cheap 0 
the service here is fair at best 0 
portable and it works 1 
this item worked great but it broke after 6 months of use 0 
there is so much good food in vegas that i feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to rice and company 0 
good audio quality 1 
considering the relations off screen between taylor and stanwyck it was surprising how little chemistry there was on screen between the two of them 0 
be sure to order dessert even if you need to pack it togo the tiramisu and cannoli are both to die for 1 
im not sure how long we stood there but it was long enough for me to begin to feel awkwardly out of place 0 
absolutely great 1 
i have always used corded headsets and the freedom from the wireless is very helpful 1 
the delivery was on time 1 
its pure brilliance 1 
well im satisfied 1 
in conclusion i will not bother with this movie because a volcano in los angeles is nothing but nonsense 0 
you cant relate with them hell you barely can understand them 0 
everything from acting to cinematography was solid 1 
well im satisfied 1 
after the first charge kept going dead after 12 minutes 0 
add betty white and jean smart and you have a great cast everyone played their parts really well 1 
the worst piece of crap ever along with the verizon customer service 0 
timely shipment and quality product 1 
paolo sorrentino has written a wonderful story about loneliness and tony has built one of the most unforgettable characters seen in movies in recent years 1 
why was this film made 0 
its like a bad two hour tv movie 0 
not as good as i had hoped 0 
the cinematography is simply stunning to say the least and the fx are nothing if not stateoftheart 1 
now imagine that every single one of those decisions was made wrong 0 
the service was terrible food was mediocre 0 
i would recommend this 1 
phenomenal food service and ambiance 1 
poor voice clarity 0 
he came running after us when he realized my husband had left his sunglasses on the table 1 
new battery works great in phone 1 
director paul matthews who also wrotedirected the weak 1995 monster movie grim clearly doesnt know how to pace his films 0 
the bartender was also nice 1 
probably not in a hurry to go back 0 
dont waste your time here 0 
nice sound 1 
it was also the right balance of war and love 1 
bad choice 0 
i would recommend it 1 
5 stars for the brick oven bread app 1 
design flaw 0 
great earpiece 1 
today was my first taste of a buldogis gourmet hot dog and i have to tell you it was more than i ever thought possible 1 
you wont be disappointed 1 
as for the mains also uninspired 0 
i love their fries and their beans 1 
the instruction manual is lacking 0 
i dont think i will be back for a very long time 0 
dont buy it 0 
the acting is beyond abysmal 0 
it was delicious 1 
the goat taco didnt skimp on the meat and wow what flavor 1 
i will never go back to this place and will never ever recommended this place to anyone 0 
also the area where my unit broke im not too fond of the magnetic strap 0 
improper description i had to return it 0 
the battery is unreliable as well as the service use antena 0 
the memories are murky but i can only say that i enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show 1 
i wont say any more i dont like spoilers so i dont want to be one but i believe this film is worth your time 1 
very good stuff for the price 1 
we have tried 2 units and they both failed within 2 months pros 0 
i got the aluminum case for my new palm vx and it worked really wellit has protected my handheld perfectly so far 1 
not good by any stretch of the imagination 0 
verizons bills however are difficult to understand even though their pricing plans are simple 0 
very nice and relaxing late night viewing 1 
i dont think it would hold it too securly on your belt 0 
one of the most disappointing aspects is the lack of notable gore 0 
battery lasts only a few hours 0 
delicious and i will absolutely be back 1 
however after finally watching this film i realized that not only had i had a closed mind to the brilliance it depicts i also found myself watching it over and over again 1 
would recommend this item 1 
very dissapointing performance 0 
cumbersome design 0 
but it wasnt anything at all just one big yawn 0 
im still trying to get over how bad it was 0 
the folks at otto always make us feel so welcome and special 1 
i will be back many times soon 1 
terrible product and waste of money 0 
the service was great even the manager came and helped with our table 1 
when i received my pita it was huge it did have a lot of meat in it so thumbs up there 1 
overall i would recommend this phone over the new walkman 1 
an absolute must visit 1 
i had a seriously solid breakfast here 1 
attempting artiness with black white and clever camera angles the movie disappointed became even more ridiculous as the acting was poor and the plot and lines almost nonexistent 0 
the story line is just awful 0 
not good for the money 0 
i checked out this place a couple years ago and was not impressed 0 
i was particularly pleased with the acting ability of dwight schultz 1 
the majority of the logitech earbud headsets failed 0 
utter crap sound quality is terrible 0 
the battery is working well as a replacement for the original that came with the phone over 2 years ago 1 
this is so embarassing and also my ears hurt if i try to push the ear plug into my ear 0 
it was packed 0 
delicious nyc bagels good selections of cream cheese real lox with capers even 1 
but i thought his acting was skilled 1 
pretty piece of junk 0 
the kids are annoying 0 
these are fabulous 1 
weird vibe from owners 0 
i enjoyed it 1 
the croutons also taste homemade which is an extra plus 1 
the bus boy on the other hand was so rude 0 
the grilled chicken was so tender and yellow from the saffron seasoning 1 
sounds good reasonably priced and effective its that simple 1 
trouble is the writing and directing make it impossible to establish those things that make a movie watchable like character story theme and so on 0 
in the summer you can dine in a charming outdoor patio so very delightful 1 
its not user friendly 0 
duris has a wholesome appearance and gives a fine performance 1 
as an earlier review noted plug in this charger and nothing happens 0 
the plot such as it is is so derivative and predictable that the ending is like a mercy killing 0 
the 12 mega pixel camera being a part of a phone is reasonably good7 1 
this is cool because most cases are just open there allowing the screen to get all scratched up 1 
trouble is the writing and directing make it impossible to establish those things that make a movie watchable like character story theme and so on 0 
my sister has one also and she loves it 1 
an excellent new restaurant by an experienced frenchman 1 
the manager was the worst 0 
its been my choice headset for yearsgreat sound good volume good noise cancellation 1 
great software for motorolas 1 
defective crap 0 
shes poised and amazing 1 
the earpiece on this is too large or too heavyit keeps falling out of my ear 0 
i know that sounds funny but to me it seemed like sketchy technology that wouldnt work wellwell this one works great 1 
things that went wrong they burned the saganaki 0 
the script is was there a script 0 
service was very prompt 1 
great product for the price 1 
yes this film does require a rather significant amount of puzzlesolving but the pieces fit together to create a beautiful picture 1 
gets a signal when other verizon phones wont 1 
i have tried these cables with my computer and my ipod and it works just fine 1 
the puppets look really cheesy not in a good way like in the puppet master 80s flicks 0 
i loved their mussels cooked in this wine reduction the duck was tender and their potato dishes were delicious 1 
barney is definitely super de duper 1 
it holds a charge for a long time is reasonably comfortable under longwearing conditions and the quality of sound is tremendous 1 
i love this place 1 
you also cannot take pictures with it in the case because the lense is covered 0 
not only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic but it also managed to give away the entire movie and im not exaggerating every moment every plot point every joke is told in the trailer 0 
i was particularly pleased with the acting ability of dwight schultz 1 
owners are really great people 1 
i vomited in the bathroom mid lunch 0 
really bad 0 
my ribeye steak was cooked perfectly and had great mesquite flavor 1 
you cant go wrong with any of the food here 1 
the presentation of the food was awful 0 
bland not a liking this place for a number of reasons and i dont want to waste time on bad reviewing ill leave it at that 0 
the movie showed a lot of florida at its best made it look very appealing 1 
nothing new there 0 
this scene is very strong and unpleasant 0 
i find this inexcusable and so will probably be returning this phone and perhaps changing carriers 0 
i wasnt really impressed with strip steak 0 
how awful she is 0 
the grilled chicken was so tender and yellow from the saffron seasoning 1 
motorola finally got the voice quality of a bluetooth headset right 1 
i love this place 1 
victor mclaglen was even bad and brian donlevy was almost unrecognizable 0 
amazon sucks 0 
their rotating beers on tap is also a highlight of this place 1 
yes i am simplifying things here for the sake of brevity for this really is at the core of the problems with this film it has too much going on without any real fulfilling explanation 0 
my boyfriend and i came here for the first time on a recent trip to vegas and could not have been more pleased with the quality of food and service 1 
i think i was one of the people who found this another one of roths pearls 1 
the new characters werent all that memorable and i found myself forgetting who was who 0 
mic doesnt work 0 
a greasy unhealthy meal 0 
dessert panna cotta was amazing 1 
hated it 0 
the potato chip order was sad i could probably count how many chips were in that box and it was probably around 12 0 
pretty cool i would say 1 
she ordered a toasted english muffin that came out untoasted 0 
what this film lacks is a convincing script 0 
its hard not to fall headoverheels in love with that girl 1 
at first glance it is a lovely bakery cafe nice ambiance clean friendly staff 1 
on the negative its insipid enough to cause regret for another 2 hours of life wasted in front of the screen 0 
pretty awesome place 1 
exceptionally bad 0 
very happy with this product 1 
see it with your kids if you have a chanceit will open up some amazing dialog about how far race relations have come in the last 50 years 1 
this convention never worked well in the past and certainly doesnt work here 0 
10 out of 10 stars 1 
what a piece of junk i lose more calls on this phone 0 
the food was barely lukewarm so it must have been sitting waiting for the server to bring it out to us 0 
in the span of an hour i had two people exclaim whoa is that the new phone on tv 1 
it does everything the description said it would 1 
on a positive note our server was very attentive and provided great service 1 
really pleased with this product so far 1 
never heard of any of them except cole who was totally unbelievable in the part 0 
the movie in movie situations in the beginning and through the game that is played with her by the acting coach are fascinating 1 
overall i wasnt very impressed with noca 0 
on the ground right next to our table was a large smeared beensteppedinandtrackedeverywhere pile of green bird poop 0 
i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
appetite instantly gone 0 
think it over when you plan to own this onethis sure is the last moto phone for me 0 
i would recommend this 1 
it was an inexpensive piece but i would still have expected better quality 0 
it defeats the purpose of a bluetooth headset 0 
he was extremely rude and really there are so many other restaurants i would love to dine at during a weekend in vegas 0 
delicious 1 
i wouldnt return 0 
disappointed with battery 0 
i love this cable it allows me to connect any miniusb device to my pc 1 
food quality has been horrible 0 
thanks good a movie like this was done and released 1 
we ordered some old classics and some new dishes after going there a few times and were sorely disappointed with everything 0 
cute quaint simple honest 1 
the ear buds only play music in one ear 0 
the bottowm lineanother worthless cheap gimmick from sprint 0 
we made the drive all the way from north scottsdale and i was not one bit disappointed 1 
the very idea of it was lame take a minor character from a mediocre pg13 film and make a complete nonsequel while changing its tone to a pgrated family movie 0 
this movie contained an allstar cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i havent seen before 1 
everyone is treated equally special 1 
yet plantronincs continues to use the same flawed charger design 0 
muddy low quality sound and the casing around the wires insert was poorly super glued and slid off 0 
i still maintain that monkeys shouldnt make headphones we just obviously dont share enough dna to copy the design over to humans 0 
then our food came out disappointment ensued 0 
cute quaint simple honest 1 
the writer gorman bechard undoubtedly did his homework because all references are industry and characterage appropriate 1 
comfortable in my hand 1 
would not recommend to others 0 
nevertheless yet another wonderful film from the great masters stable 1 
now we were chosen to be tortured with this disgusting piece of blatant american propaganda 0 
the acting by the whole cast could be put on a scale and balanced perfectly between overacting and underacting 0 
only like 3 or 4 buildings used a couple of locations maybe poor hummh 0 
give this one a look 1 
but the actingeven that of such professionals as drago and debbie rochonwas terrible the directing worse perhaps contributory to the former the dialog chimplike and the camera work barely tolerable 0 
best of all is the rotating feature very helpful 1 
a drive thru means you do not want to wait around for half an hour for your food but somehow when we end up going here they make us wait and wait 0 
the chicken dishes are ok the beef is like shoe leather 0 
but it is great i would really recommend it 1 
my sashimi was poor quality being soggy and tasteless 0 
i was very disappointed in the movie 0 
very disappointing 0 
emily watsons character is very strong and she has only to give a quick glance and you understand everything 1 
the characters are interesting and you want to find out more about them the longer the movie goes on and i think people will be surprised by who does and doesnt make it 1 
worst service to boot but that is the least of their worries 0 
adapter does not provide enough charging current 0 
i consider this theft 0 
this product had a strong rubberpetroleum smell that was unbearable after a while and caused me to return it 0 
stopped by during the late may bank holiday off rick steve recommendation and loved it 1 
not nearly as good looking as the amazon picture makes it look 0 
did not like at all 0 
however paul schrader has indeed made a film about mishima that is both superb complex 1 
lovely little thriller from hitchcock with lots of nice shenanigans surrounding a murdered spy a kidnapped child a nasty church a foreign plot and some random taxidermists 1 
the chips that came out were dripping with grease and mostly not edible 0 
the color is even prettier than i thought it would be and the graphics are incredibly sharp 1 
at around 4 pm i bought it at around 8pm i started to watch at around 815pm i fast forwarded the remaining film to see if there was anything left watchable for a human being with a brain but there wasnt 0 
dessert panna cotta was amazing 1 
it is very comfortable to wear as well which is probably the most important aspect about using a case 1 
its a sad movie but very good 1 
and dont even get me started on the jerky camerawork 0 
lots of holes in the script 0 
omelets are to die for 1 
i would recommend it 1 
come hungry leave happy and stuffed 1 
this movie was kind of long in length but i enjoyed every minute of it 1 
the construction of the headsets is poor 0 
im surprised this is a good quality car charger and theres not much reviews about it 1 
i have had tmobile service for 2 or 3 years now and i am pretty happy with it 1 
but it does get better reception and clarity than any phone ive had before 1 
the flair bartenders are absolutely amazing 1 
but if you liked movies like the matrix and better yet their sequels i think youll appreciate the thought provoking mindblowing experience this film will give you 1 
and i just love the colors 1 
after all the rave reviews i couldnt wait to eat herewhat a disappointment 0 
aside from its terrible lead this film has loads of other debits 0 
definitely not worth the 3 i paid 0 
third the cheese on my friends burger was cold 0 
to call this movie a drama is ridiculous 0 
i can assure you that you wont be disappointed 1 
then i had to continue pairing it periodically since it somehow kept dropping 0 
i love my 350 headset my jabra350 bluetooth headset is great the reception is very good and the ear piece is a comfortable fit 1 
i have bought this nokia cell phone a few weeks ago and it was a nightmare 0 
utter crap sound quality is terrible 0 
i would not recommend this place 0 
very disappointed 0 
its also great to see that renowned silent screenwriter frances marion hasnt missed a step going from silent to sound 1 
did not like at all 0 
i started this review with two stars but im editing it to give it only one 0 
they work about 2 weeks then break 0 
it was horrible 0 
everything was gross 0 
the guys all had steaks and our steak loving son who has had steak at the best and worst places said it was the best steak hes ever eaten 1 
pretty good beer selection too 1 
the food is about on par with dennys which is to say not good at all 0 
i was very disappointed 0 
good works fine 1 
this is was due to the fact that it took 20 minutes to be acknowledged then another 35 minutes to get our foodand they kept forgetting things 0 
i cant use this case because the smell is disgusting 0 
would recommend this item 1 
jabra ear gels r the best 1 
the ri style calamari was a joke 0 
for service i give them no stars 0 
this place is handsdown one of the best places to eat in the phoenix metro area 1 
i was totally fascinated by the music the dancing everything 1 
what makes this story different are the terrific production values faultless photography composition and editing the terrific casting the underappreciated brian keith playing a bully teddy and vivid history 1 
much better than the other ayce sushi place i went to in vegas 1 
our server was very nice and even though he looked a little overwhelmed with all of our needs he stayed professional and friendly until the end 1 
this is so embarassing and also my ears hurt if i try to push the ear plug into my ear 0 
if you havent choked in your own vomit by the end by all the cheap drama and worthless dialogue youve must have bored yourself to death with this waste of time 0 
it was forced like everything in this movie 0 
disappointing experience 0 
this particular model would not work with my motorola q smartphone 0 
and dont even get me started on the jerky camerawork 0 
setup couldnt have been simpler 1 
bland and flavorless is a good way of describing the barely tepid meat 0 
my friend did not like his bloody mary 0 
great hands free device 1 
down the drain because of a weak snap 0
