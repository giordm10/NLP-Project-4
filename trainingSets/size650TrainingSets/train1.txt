it was way over fried 0 
doesnt hold charge 0 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
the food was delicious our bartender was attentive and personable and we got a great deal 1 
plus its only 8 bucks 1 
the design is very good4 1 
so in a nutshell 1 the restaraunt smells like a combination of a dirty fish market and a sewer 0 
i was shocked because no signs indicate cash only 0 
it just blew 0 
dont buy this product it fails 0 
cute quaint simple honest 1 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
thank you for wasting my money 0 
it was a long time that i didnt see a so charismatic actor on screen 1 
when my mom and i got home she immediately got sick and she only had a few bites of salad 0 
i like the fact that it rests lightly against your ear rather than inside 1 
the best example of how dumb the writing is when its established that you can turn the zombiestudents back into humans by removing a necklace containing a piece of the meteorite 0 
i received my orders well within the shipping timeframe everything was in good working order and overall i am very excited to have this source 1 
my fella got the huevos rancheros and they didnt look too appealing 0 
yes i am simplifying things here for the sake of brevity for this really is at the core of the problems with this film it has too much going on without any real fulfilling explanation 0 
do not waste your money here 0 
product is exactly as described 1 
one of the best mexican movies ever and one of the less understood even by mexican themselves no matter how identified the should have felt with it 1 
wow what a bad film 0 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
if you want healthy authentic or ethic food try this place 1 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
tom wilkinson broke my heart at the end and everyone elses judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike 1 
you wont regret it 1 
and there wasnt a single sour note struck actingwise either some surprisingly solid casting here 1 
i will come back here every time im in vegas 1 
they do not care about the consumer one bit 0 
and considering the two of us left there very full and happy for about 20 you just cant go wrong 1 
id like to return it 0 
i ended up sliding it on the edge of my pants or back pockets instead 1 
i wasnt the least bit interested 0 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
worthwhile 1 
avoid this one if you can 0 
we were promptly greeted and seated 1 
the camera really likes her in this movie 1 
it was horrendous 0 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
my fella got the huevos rancheros and they didnt look too appealing 0 
and the rest of it just sits there being awful with soldiers singing songs about the masculinity they pledge themselves to hairsplitting about purity the admiration of swords etc 0 
there was hardly any meat 0 
great place fo take out or eat in 1 
very disappointed 0 
its fits like a glove and is strong secure and durable 1 
couldnt ask for a more satisfying meal 1 
service is also cute 1 
of course the footage from the 70s was grainy but that only enhanced the film 1 
prosgood camera very nice pictures also has cool styles like black and white and more 1 
also were served hot bread and butter and home made potato chips with bacon bits on topvery original and very good 1 
in a word it is embarrassing 0 
i have always used corded headsets and the freedom from the wireless is very helpful 1 
to be honest with you this is unbelievable nonsense and very foolish 0 
this is the kind of money that is wasted properly 1 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
i highly recommend this modest priced cellular phone 1 
after i pulled up my car i waited for another 15 minutes before being acknowledged 0 
please dont waste your money 0 
if good intentions made a film great then this film might be one of the greatest films ever made 1 
food was really boring 0 
comfortable in my hand 1 
great choice 1 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
now this is a movie i really dislike 0 
the waitress was friendly and happy to accomodate for veganveggie options 1 
we waited for thirty minutes to be seated although there were 8 vacant tables and we were the only folks waiting 0 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
this is a bad film with bad writing and good actorsan ugly cartoon crafted by paul haggis for people who cant handle anything but the bold strokes in storytellinga picture painted with crayons 0 
add betty white and jean smart and you have a great cast everyone played their parts really well 1 
also notable is john baileys fine crisp beautifully colored cinematography and the great production design costumes by eiko ishioka who went on to do the memorable costumes for coppolas dracula for which she received a well deserved oscar 1 
exceptionally bad 0 
he deserves 5 stars 1 
its fits like a glove and is strong secure and durable 1 
so i basically threw my money out the window for nothing 0 
everything is appalling 0 
the soundtrack sucked 0 
it is an excellent drama an excellent thriller and an excellent film 1 
highly recommended for all ages although the younger set will probably not appreciate some of the more subtle references they will certainly appreciate one galley scene in particular 1 
it seems completely secure both holding on to my belt and keeping the iphone inside 1 
horrible phone 0 
only pros large seating area nice bar area great simple drink menu the best brick oven pizza with homemade dough 1 
it was too predictable even for a chick flick 0 
the steaks are all well trimmed and also perfectly cooked 1 
food quality has been horrible 0 
i dont think well be going back anytime soon 0 
so flavorful and has just the perfect amount of heat 1 
the attempts at humor were pitiful and story is so awful it dosent bear thinking about which basically involves a vulcan stealing the enterprise to find god seriously i just didnt care about any of this film and oh not to mention uhura does a belly dance to distract male guards 0 
very convenient since we were staying at the mgm 1 
i did not have any problem with this item and would order it again if needed 1 
this case seems well made 1 
disappointment i hate anything that goes in my ear 0 
i know that sounds funny but to me it seemed like sketchy technology that wouldnt work wellwell this one works great 1 
this case has passed the one year mark and while it shows signs of wear it is 100 functional 1 
i own 2 of these cases and would order another 1 
i use this product in a motor control center where there is a lot of high voltage humming from the equipment and it works great 1 
it is an insane game 1 
my only complaint is the standard sound volume is a little low even when turned up to 5of 5 0 
the handsfree part works fine but then the car tries to download the address book and the treo rebootsoverall i still rate this device high 1 
this movie has a cutting edge to it 1 
the sides are delish mixed mushrooms yukon gold puree white corn beateous 1 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
i keep watching it over and over 1 
that company is a joke 0 
what a waste of money and time 0 
very disappointed in accessoryone 0 
he is an amazing film artist one of the most important whoever lived 1 
we wont be returning 0 
love the margaritas too 1 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
yeah the movie pretty much sucked 0 
then theres the plot holes 0 
it was either too cold not enough flavor or just bad 0 
first of all there are enough racial stereotypes and racial jokes to offend everyone 0 
this phone is very fast with sending any kind of messages and web browsing is significantly faster than previous phones i have used 1 
so for our enjoyment we get to see them run around play games and be dangerous 1 
the cashier was friendly and even brought the food out to me 1 
but the movie makes a lot of serious mistakes 0 
everything on the menu is terrific and we were also thrilled that they made amazing accommodations for our vegetarian daughter 1 
the keyboard is a nice compromise between a full qwerty and the basic cell phone number keypad 1 
mic doesnt work 0 
excellent product for the price 1 
i had heard good things about this place but it exceeding every hope i could have dreamed of 1 
we also ordered the spinach and avocado salad the ingredients were sad and the dressing literally had zero taste 0 
definitely not worth the 3 i paid 0 
now imagine that every single one of those decisions was made wrong 0 
judith light is one of my favorite actresses and i think she does a superb job in this film 1 
very slow at seating even with reservation 0 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
the mic there is a joke and the volume is quite low 0 
beautiful styling though 1 
service is friendly and inviting 1 
the film is well paced understated and one of the best courtroom documentaries ive seen 1 
as for the service im a fan because its quick and youre being served by some nice folks 1 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
for service i give them no stars 0 
i have had mine for about a year and this christmas i bought some for the rest of the family 1 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
when i placed my treo into the case not only was it not snug but there was a lot of extra room on the sides 0 
im in az all the time and now have my new spot 1 
im not impressed with the concept or the food 0 
it felt like a very gripping intelligent stage play but without the overly theatrical feeling one actually gets from watching people on a stage which plays on everyones terror of a white lie escalating to monstrous consequences 1 
a pretty good product 1 
the problem i have is that they charge 1199 for a sandwich that is no bigger than a subway sub which offers better and more amount of vegetables 0 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
the shower area is outside so you can only rinse not take a full shower unless you dont mind being nude for everyone to see 0 
the dining space is tiny but elegantly decorated and comfortable 1 
it was so cool 1 
i am sorry i made this purchase 0 
you wont be disappointed 1 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
i love this device 1 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
excellent sound quality 1 
same problem as others have mentioned 0 
the charger arrived within the promised timeframe but it did not work 0 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
the charger worked for about a week and then completely stopped charging my phone 0 
gotta love those closeups of slimy drooling teeth 1 
i get absolutely horrible reception in my apartment where with other phones i have not had this problem 0 
be sure to order dessert even if you need to pack it togo the tiramisu and cannoli are both to die for 1 
if you dont find it too bad as again the unit comes with one earpad onlyi would not recommend this to anyone 0 
its pretty surprising that this wonderful film was made in 1949 as hollywood generally had its collective heads in the sand concerning black and white issues at that time 1 
the headset fulfills my requirements so i am happy with my purchase 1 
all it took was one drop from about 6 inches above the kitchen counter and it was crackedi am not impressed and i am not laughing 0 
i dont recommend unless your car breaks down in front of it and you are starving 0 
also the fries are without a doubt the worst fries ive ever had 0 
good case excellent value 1 
worst customer service 0 
best tacos in town by far 1 
thats how id describe this painfully dreary timewaster of a film 0 
the bus boy on the other hand was so rude 0 
id advise anyone to go and see it 1 
i gave it 5 stars then and im giving it 5 stars now 1 
worth every penny 1 
this film and i use that word loosely is an insult to the moviegoing public 0 
i let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this bad idea we both hated it 0 
and i just love the colors 1 
both films are terrible but to the credit of the 1986 version it was watchable 0 
it dit not work most of the time with my nokia 5320 0 
my experience was terrible this was my fourth bluetooth headset and while it was much more comfortable than my last jabra which i hated 0 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
i tried the cape cod ravoli chickenwith cranberrymmmm 1 
too bad cause i know its family owned i really wanted to like this place 0 
and the red curry had so much bamboo shoots and wasnt very tasty to me 0 
this short film certainly pulls no punches 0 
this product is clearly not ready for prime time i dont care how cool it looks if you cant tell a call is coming in its worthless 0 
the mic there is a joke and the volume is quite low 0 
down the drain because of a weak snap 0 
the scripting of the subtle comedy is unmatched by any movie in recent years 1 
once you get inside youll be impressed with the place 1 
totally believable 1 
dee snider just plain sucks 0 
the fries were great too 1 
why are these sad little vegetables so overcooked 0 
the jamaican mojitos are delicious 1 
it has a great camera thats 2mp and the pics are nice and clear with great picture quality 1 
it was probably dirt 0 
classywarm atmosphere fun and fresh appetizers succulent steaks baseball steak 1 
good protection and does not make phone too bulky 1 
jawbone era is awesome too 1 
just does not work 0 
stay away from the q 0 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
interesting decor 1 
its pretty surprising that this wonderful film was made in 1949 as hollywood generally had its collective heads in the sand concerning black and white issues at that time 1 
raw and sublimely moving 1 
the waitress was friendly and happy to accomodate for veganveggie options 1 
the cg opening sequence in space looked like it could have been created on microsoft slideshow for gods sake 0 
constantine gives everything the right intensity and seems to have a good understanding of the underlying psychological motivations 1 
110 and only because there is no setting for 010 0 
the inside is really quite nice and very clean 1 
waaaaaayyyyyyyyyy over rated is all i am saying 0 
cinematography noteworthy including fine views of barcelona and its famed gaudi towers 1 
both great 1 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
the aerial scenes were welldone 1 
this movie is bad 0 
the acting is like watching wooden puppets moving around and reading from a book thats how bad it is 0 
this is one of the best italian thrillers of the early 70s 1 
does not work for listening to music with the cingular 8125 0 
aailiyah was pretty good as akasha in places compelling her first entrance and mini dance scene 1 
these are fabulous 1 
this was reflected not only in the cast but also in the belowpar script which borrowed much from the earlier classic 0 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
ive had no trouble accessing the internet downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions 1 
ive owned this phone for 7 months now and can say that its the best mobile phone ive had 1 
good show samsung 1 
by this time our side of the restaurant was almost empty so there was no excuse 0 
the characters are interesting and you want to find out more about them the longer the movie goes on and i think people will be surprised by who does and doesnt make it 1 
echo problemvery unsatisfactory 0 
first of all there are enough racial stereotypes and racial jokes to offend everyone 0 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
very good phone 1 
it had some average acting from the main person and it was a low budget as you clearly can see 0 
this place is not worth your time let alone vegas 0 
the 12 mega pixel camera being a part of a phone is reasonably good7 1 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
i believe that this place is a great stop for those with a huge belly and hankering for sushi 1 
i never walked out of a movie faster 0 
the bottowm lineanother worthless cheap gimmick from sprint 0 
the cast of veteran actors are more than just a nostalgia trip 1 
best headset ever 1 
this phone works great 1 
it does everything the description said it would 1 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
john wayne did an incredible job for being so young in the movie industry 1 
not tasty and the texture was just nasty 0 
an hour seriously 0 
it definitely was not as good as my s11 1 
this movie is also revealing 1 
also the area where my unit broke im not too fond of the magnetic strap 0 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
will never ever go back 0 
i believe the screenwriter did a good job of tying up the loose ends 1 
this is a masterful piece of filmmaking with many themes simmering and occasionally boiling over in this warts and all study of the poets bohemian selfindulgent wartime years that span the aerial bombardments of london and the outward tranquillity of a welsh coastal retreat the borderlines between friendship lust and love dedication to art and experience versus practical concerns jealousy rivalry cowardice and egotism versus heroism and selfsacrifice and more 1 
the steak was amazingrge fillet relleno was the best seafood plate i have ever had 1 
it has been a winner for us 1 
your staff spends more time talking to themselves than me 0 
i could care less the interior is just beautiful 1 
there was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth but it didnt really work into the rest of the plot 0 
the story itself is just predictable and lazy 0 
i saw this movie and i thought this is a stupid movie 0 
the plot was the same as pretty much every other cheap horror 0 
you could drive a semi truck into these holes 0 
ps the only scene in the movie that was cool is when the central character finds her room blown up 1 
the jamaican mojitos are delicious 1 
i was very pleased to see that i could replace my well travled swivel holster for my blackberry flip 1 
i ordered the voodoo pasta and it was the first time id had really excellent pasta since going gluten free several years ago 1 
not easy to watch 0 
to be honest with you this is unbelievable nonsense and very foolish 0 
if only someone involved with it knew how to string together narrative 0 
the reception has been generally good 1 
judith light is one of my favorite actresses and i think she does a superb job in this film 1 
cant upload ringtones from a third party 0 
reasonably priced also 1 
very funny 1 
to those who find this movie intelligent or even masterful i can only say its your intelligence and your imagination you obviously used to try and make some sense of this pitiful attempt its in our human nature to try and make sense of things 0 
this product had a strong rubberpetroleum smell that was unbearable after a while and caused me to return it 0 
while you dont yet hear mickey speak there are tons of sound effects and music throughout the filmsomething we take for granted now but which was a huge crowd pleaser in 1928 1 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
very funny 1 
do not buy for d807wrongly advertised for d807 0 
go watch it 1 
but this movie is not funny considering the ridiculousness of it 0 
i do not know if this was emilio estevezs directorial debut but the pacing the interplay and development of the characters as well as some clever camera work surrounding the character estevez plays all suggest a natural eye 1 
his performance is simply genius 1 
im not impressed with the concept or the food 0 
delete this film from your mind 0 
i have had this phone for over a year now and i will tell you its not that great 0 
works like a charm it work the same as the one i got with the phone 1 
very bad performance plays angela bennett a computer expert who is at home all the time 0 
in addition it feels amp looks as if the phone is all lightweight cheap plastic 0 
both of them were truly unbelievably good and i am so glad we went back 1 
however bt headsets are currently not good for real time games like firstperson shooters since the audio delay messes me up 0 
hayao miyazakis latest and eighth film for studio ghibili gake no ue no ponyo ponyo on the cliff by the sea is a wonderfully fun and imaginative look at childhood 1 
brilliance indeed 1 
you also cannot take pictures with it in the case because the lense is covered 0 
disappointed with battery 0 
razr battery good buy 1 
restaurant is always full but never a wait 1 
other than that the leather is nice and soft the fit is very tight the cut out for the face is a good shape 1 
ordered burger rare came in well done 0 
then i had to continue pairing it periodically since it somehow kept dropping 0 
service is perfect and the family atmosphere is nice to see 1 
worst ever 0 
very nice and relaxing late night viewing 1 
the lead man is charismafree 0 
i have had tmobile service for 2 or 3 years now and i am pretty happy with it 1 
this film has no redeeming features 0 
freezes frequently4 0 
great product fast shipping 1 
lately they have been extremely nice and helpful on the phone 1 
pretty cool i would say 1 
will never ever go back 0 
in my house i was getting dropped coverage upstairs and no coverage in my basement 0 
excellent product 1 
crostini that came with the salad was stale 0 
honeslty it didnt taste that fresh 0 
their chow mein is so good 1 
the performances are not improved by improvisation because the actors now have twice as much to worry about not only whether theyre delivering the line well but whether the line itself is any good 0 
he also came back to check on us regularly excellent service 1 
this is an excellent film 1 
best tater tots in the southwest 1 
reaching for the bottom row is uncomfortable and the send and end keys are not where i expect them to be3 0 
the fries were great too 1 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
so bad 0 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
my sister has one also and she loves it 1 
lightweight and works well 1 
ill put this gem up against any movie in terms of screenplay cinematography acting postproduction editing directing or any other aspect of filmmaking 1 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
i believe the screenwriter did a good job of tying up the loose ends 1 
took an hour to get our food only 4 tables in restaurant my food was luke warm our sever was running around like he was totally overwhelmed 0 
i sat riveted to the tv screen 1 
i am going to have to be the first to negatively review this product 0 
the jerky camera movements were also annoying 0 
it has all the features i want 1 
but it picked up speed and got right to the point 1 
my experience was terrible this was my fourth bluetooth headset and while it was much more comfortable than my last jabra which i hated 0 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
warning do not buy 0 
they have horrible attitudes towards customers and talk down to each one when customers dont enjoy their food 0 
20th century foxs road house 1948 is not only quite a silly noir but is an implausible unmitigated bore of a movie 0 
the cinematography is simply stunning to say the least and the fx are nothing if not stateoftheart 1 
it was a pale color instead of nice and char and has no flavor 0 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
their regular toasted bread was equally satisfying with the occasional pats of butter mmmm 1 
gets the job done 1 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
all this movie does is make you sick watching all these slackers make excuses for their stupid actions for 90 minutes 0 
the story which was told so eloquently by francis ford coppola 25 years earlier really unfolds gradually and leaves room for the characters to develop 1 
all this movie does is make you sick watching all these slackers make excuses for their stupid actions for 90 minutes 0 
the ambiance was incredible 1 
owners are really great people 1 
for people who are first timers in film making i think they did an excellent job 1 
it just blew 0 
in addition it feels amp looks as if the phone is all lightweight cheap plastic 0 
trouble is the writing and directing make it impossible to establish those things that make a movie watchable like character story theme and so on 0 
this is a simple little phone to use but the breakage is unacceptible 0 
i must say i have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again 1 
how can you call yourself a steakhouse if you cant properly cook a steak i dont understand 0 
food was good service was good prices were good 1 
the construction of the headsets is poor 0 
once you get inside youll be impressed with the place 1 
interesting decor 1 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
all in all id expected a better consumer experience from motorola 0 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
lousy product 0 
it was forced like everything in this movie 0 
not to mention the combination of pears almonds and bacon is a big winner 1 
well packaged arrived on time and works as intended 1 
we had fantastic service and were pleased by the atmosphere 1 
the update procedure is difficult and cumbersome 0 
dee snider just plain sucks 0 
so far it has worked like a charm 1 
this would not even be good as a made for tv flick 0 
i have to use the smallest earpieces provided but it stays on pretty well 1 
excellent short film 1 
this place deserves one star and 90 has to do with the food 0 
i had high hopes for this place since the burgers are cooked over a charcoal grill but unfortunately the taste fell flat way flat 0 
very pleased with this headset 1 
all things considered a job very well done 1 
the best place in vegas for breakfast just check out a sat or sun 1 
my friend did not like his bloody mary 0 
poor product 0 
this movie is excellentangel is beautiful and scamp is adorablehis little yelps when hes scaredand the funniest parts are whenscamp is caught under the curtain and when angel and scamp are singing ive never had this feeling beforei totally recommend this movieits coming out on special edition on june 20the cover has scamp on a garbage can and angel underneath the lid 1 
comfort for our whole family 1 
yes its shiny on front side and i love it 1 
fantastic service here 1 
i received my orders well within the shipping timeframe everything was in good working order and overall i am very excited to have this source 1 
good quality 1 
the two main characters may be two of the most believable children i ever saw put on screen 1 
one character is totally annoying with a voice that gives me the feeling of fingernails on a chalkboard 0 
when a song could explain the emotions of the subjects better such as when jay adams unfortunate life was a subject of talk the song old man by neil young was played which evokes many emotions 1 
other than that the leather is nice and soft the fit is very tight the cut out for the face is a good shape 1 
anyway the plot flowed smoothly and the malebonding scenes were a hoot 1 
not what i wanted 0 
a good film by a great director 1 
dont buy this product 0 
blue ant is easy to use 1 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
hitchcock is a great director 1 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
reception is terrible and full of static 0 
i totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is 1 
i was not impressed by this product 0 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
clear crisp sound 1 
the menu had so much good stuff on it i could not decide 1 
i can say that the desserts were yummy 1 
it is shameful 0 
this product is great it makes working a lot easier i can go to the copier while waiting on hold for something 1 
i have been in more than a few bars in vegas and do not ever recall being charged for tap water 0 
it was too predictable even for a chick flick 0 
great phone 1 
gets a signal when other verizon phones wont 1 
i do think tom hanks is a good actor 1 
first of all there are enough racial stereotypes and racial jokes to offend everyone 0 
third the cheese on my friends burger was cold 0 
the seasonal fruit was fresh white peach puree 1 
if you are looking for a good quality motorola headset keep looking this isnt it 0 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
the only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive 1 
reversible plug works great 1 
an hour seriously 0 
it ranks highly as a great noircrimedrama incredible performances by belmondo and lino ventura 1 
she carries the movie well 1 
ive had better not only from dedicated boba tea spots but even from jenni pho 0 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
the fact is this film is a wonderful heartwarming tale about two people chasing their dreams 1 
if you check the directors filmography on this site you will see why this film didnt have a chance 0 
hell no will i go back 0 
there are many continuity errors one other user commented on different cars in the garage joes glassesthe one that got to me the most was the fact joes facial hair configuration seemed to change from scene to scene 0 
very disappointed 0 
this mostly routine factbased tv drama gets a boost from the fine performance by cole 1 
the spaghetti is nothing special whatsoever 0 
this was a different cut than the piece the other day but still wonderful and tender s well as well flavored 1 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
i have tried these cables with my computer and my ipod and it works just fine 1 
i give wirefly 1 stari will contact cingularatt and inform them of this practice 0 
the price is reasonable and the service is great 1 
tasted like dirt 0 
design flaw 0 
i guess i should have known that this place would suck because it is inside of the excalibur but i didnt use my common sense 0 
very nice and relaxing late night viewing 1 
the movie in movie situations in the beginning and through the game that is played with her by the acting coach are fascinating 1 
often the dialogue doesnt really follow from one line to another or fit the surroundings 0 
i am so tired of clichés that is just lazy writing and here they come in thick and fast 0 
dont waste your time watching this rubbish nonresearched film 0 
reaching for the bottom row is uncomfortable and the send and end keys are not where i expect them to be3 0 
if you want healthy authentic or ethic food try this place 1 
what a waste 0 
the shower area is outside so you can only rinse not take a full shower unless you dont mind being nude for everyone to see 0 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
we wont be going back anytime soon 0 
very very disappointed ordered the 35 big bay plater 0 
it was also the right balance of war and love 1 
four stars for the food the guy in the blue shirt for his great vibe still letting us in to eat 1 
not much dialogue not much music the whole film was shot as elaborately and aesthetically like a sculpture 1 
and considering the two of us left there very full and happy for about 20 you just cant go wrong 1 
for service i give them no stars 0 
i just wanted to leave 0 
i think i was one of the people who found this another one of roths pearls 1 
exactly what i wanted 1 
i went on motorolas website and followed all directions but could not get it to pair again 0 
we were promptly greeted and seated 1 
this is so embarassing and also my ears hurt if i try to push the ear plug into my ear 0 
same problem as others have mentioned 0 
great phone 1 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic 1 
one of my favorite purchases ever 1 
as for the mains also uninspired 0 
would recommend this item 1 
my fella got the huevos rancheros and they didnt look too appealing 0 
highly recommend for any one who has a blue tooth phone 1 
item does not match picture 0 
terrible phone holder 0 
service is friendly and inviting 1 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
the movie was very interesting from beginning to the end 1 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
my 5year old nokia 2160 from tracfone holds the charge a lot better than this 0 
my wife had the lobster bisque soup which was lukewarm 0 
which are small and not worth the price 0 
it is the best charger i have seen on the market yet 1 
as a courtroom drama its compelling as an indictment on the american justice system its frightening 1 
i know he was a contract player with little control over his scripts but the acting was as bad as the script 0 
there is so much good food in vegas that i feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to rice and company 0 
the soundtrack wasnt terrible either 1 
what a piece of junk i lose more calls on this phone 0 
did not like at all 0 
worst thai ever 0 
the plot was the same as pretty much every other cheap horror 0 
i have only had it for a few weeks but so far so good 1 
i saw mirrormask last night and it was an unsatisfactory experience 0 
both films are terrible but to the credit of the 1986 version it was watchable 0 
the story line is just awful 0 
the roast beef sandwich tasted really good 1 
a bit predictable 0 
i love this thing 1 
its hard not to fall headoverheels in love with that girl 1 
we also ordered the spinach and avocado salad the ingredients were sad and the dressing literally had zero taste 0 
so bad 0 
very unreliable service from tmobile 0 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
great place fo take out or eat in 1 
wont work right or atleast for me 0 
anne heche was utterly convincing 1 
ill give this film 10 out of 10 1 
top line dont waste your time and money on this one its as bad as it comes 0 
you need at least 3 mins to get to your phone book from the time you first turn on the phonebattery life is short 0 
crust is not good 0 
everything was fresh and delicious 1 
2 thumbs up 1 
director paul matthews who also wrotedirected the weak 1995 monster movie grim clearly doesnt know how to pace his films 0 
i have to mention this and it is a huge spoiler i loved the ending how all the characters of the three films were the remaining survivors of the ferry disaster with valentine and the young judge together and the old man watching it on her tv solidifying his happiness over the suffering which he dealt with for those many years 1 
great software for motorolas 1 
they are so cool 1 
disappointed 0 
lifetime does not air it enough so if anyone knows what store sells it let me know because this is a musthave 1 
love the margaritas too 1 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
very disappointed in accessoryone 0 
it has a great camera thats 2mp and the pics are nice and clear with great picture quality 1 
back to good bbq lighter fare reasonable pricing and tell the public they are back to the old ways 1 
omg the food was delicioso 1 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
then scene where they debated whether or not to sack the trumpeter who falsely was accused for the murder is pure horror really stupid 0 
what is even more stupid is that who had thought an idea that there should be a volcano in los angeles 0 
the bartender was also nice 1 
they will customize your order any way youd like my usual is eggplant with green bean stir fry love it 1 
dont make the same mistake that i did and please dont buy this phone 0 
i can say that the desserts were yummy 1 
im glad the film didnt go for the most obvious choice as a lesser film certainly would have 1 
i use this product in a motor control center where there is a lot of high voltage humming from the equipment and it works great 1 
overall i am psyched to have a phone which has all my appointments and contacts in and gets great reception 1 
i bought this phone as a replacement for my startac and have regretted it since 0 
it came free with a dvd player i bought but i still turned the thing off halfway through because i was embarrassed for howell 0 
its one of the movies i need to see whenever it comes on tvnever mind the fact that i already have it memorized 1 
his performance as awarded was stunning 1 
to sum the film up breeders is a terrible cheaply made horror movie that should be avoided like the ebola virus 0 
bt50 battery junk 0 
victor mclaglen was even bad and brian donlevy was almost unrecognizable 0 
i was mortified 0 
it was that loudglad to say that the plantronics 510 maintains a flawless connection to my cell and with no static during normal use 1 
im a big fan of this series mostly due to anne rices style sensitivities and treatments 1 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
the food is good 1 
a very charming film with wonderful sentiment and heart 1 
gets a signal when other verizon phones wont 1 
this was one of the worst films i have ever seen 0 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
the ear buds only play music in one ear 0 
when my mom and i got home she immediately got sick and she only had a few bites of salad 0 
waste of 13 bucks 0 
the cinematography is simply stunning to say the least and the fx are nothing if not stateoftheart 1 
its a gloriously fun fast paced and fairly accurate portrayal of the night of a raver 1 
waitress was sweet and funny 1 
crisp and clear 1 
avoid this film at all costs 0 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
by this time our side of the restaurant was almost empty so there was no excuse 0 
seafood was limited to boiled shrimp and crab legs but the crab legs definitely did not taste fresh 0 
i have yet to run this new battery below two bars and thats three days without charging 1 
if you love death and decay and shakespears lyrics this is the one 1 
i purcashed this for the car charger and it does not work 0 
it is practically useless and did not add any kind of boost to my reception after i bought it 0 
in the span of an hour i had two people exclaim whoa is that the new phone on tv 1 
mishima is extremely uninteresting 0 
very well made and fits my surefire gx2 perfectly 1 
its a total package 1 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
here in the wind and the lion we see a wonderful rendering of americas own imperial age 1 
i immediately said i wanted to talk to the manager but i did not want to talk to the guy who was doing shots of fireball behind the bar 0 
i thought it was bad 0 
server did a great job handling our large rowdy table 1 
the movie lacks visual interest drama expression of feeling and celebration of the very patriotism that underlines the narrative 0 
2 thumbs up 1 
arrived quickly and much less expensive than others being sold 1 
i hate movies like that 0 
the acting is beyond abysmal 0 
the potatoes were like rubber and you could tell they had been made up ahead of time being kept under a warmer 0 
any ring toneoverall good phone to buy 1 
i ordered the voodoo pasta and it was the first time id had really excellent pasta since going gluten free several years ago 1 
my boyfriend and i sat at the bar and had a completely delightful experience 1 
the soundtrack sucked 0 
this is definitely a cult classic well worth viewing and sharing with others 1 
it is just the sort of pap that is screened in the afternoon to punish the unemployed for not having jobs 0 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
characters are onedimensional even the good guys and especially the bad guys 0 
penne vodka excellent 1 
will be back again 1 
nothing new there 0 
110 and only because there is no setting for 010 0 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
worst thai ever 0 
gave up trying to eat any of the crust teeth still sore 0 
this place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver 0 
i own 2 of these cases and would order another 1 
they work about 2 weeks then break 0 
this is such a fun and funny movie 1 
it didnt work people can not hear me when i talk 0 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
i cant believe theres even a sequel to this 0 
the design is very odd as the ear clip is not very comfortable at all 0 
overall i rate this movie a 10 out of a 110 scale 1 
not only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic but it also managed to give away the entire movie and im not exaggerating every moment every plot point every joke is told in the trailer 0 
omelets are to die for 1 
logitech bluetooth headset is a 10 1 
you get extra minutes so that you can carry out the call and not get cut off 1 
yes i am simplifying things here for the sake of brevity for this really is at the core of the problems with this film it has too much going on without any real fulfilling explanation 0 
there is no real plot 0 
i cant believe theres even a sequel to this 0 
and generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode 0 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
no shifting no bubbling no peeling not even a scratch nothingi couldnt be more happier with my new one for the droid 1 
waited and waited and waited 0 
bad purchase 0 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
it lasts less than 3o minutes if i actually try to use the phonemy wife has the same phone with the same problem 0 
but the movie makes a lot of serious mistakes 0 
i liked this movie way too much 1 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
this movie is terrible 0 
the only thing that i think could improve is the sound leaks out from the headset 0 
it is an insane game 1 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
its welldesigned and very sharp the blue is a very nice color 1 
this is a good joint 1 
what a piece of junk i lose more calls on this phone 0 
it crackles with an unpredictable youthful energy but honestly i found it hard to follow and concentrate on it meanders so badly 0 
very clear quality sound and you dont have to mess with the sound on your ipod since you have the sound buttons on the headset 1 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
despite how hard i rate businesses its actually rare for me to give a 1 star 0 
a usable keyboard actually turns a pda into a realworld useful machine instead of just a neat gadget 1 
you never know if you pushed it hard enough or the right number of times for the function you want or not 0 
really bad 0 
the cinematography is simply stunning to say the least and the fx are nothing if not stateoftheart 1 
however i recently watched the whole thing again on dvd and i was completely struck by how extremely stupid the storyline was how it contained holes inconsistencies and frankly a whole lot of crap and how horrid the dancing was 0
