if that bug never showed up i would have given a 4 for sure but on the other side of the wall where this bug was climbing was the kitchen 0 
must have been an off night at this place 0 
they dropped more than the ball 0 
dont miss it 1 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
waited 2 hours never got either of our pizzas as many other around us who came in later did 0 
their daily specials are always a hit with my group 1 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
overall i was not impressed and would not go back 0 
do not make the same mistake as me 0 
excellent sound battery life and inconspicuous to boot 1 
summary the witticisms werent witty 0 
my fiancé and i came in the middle of the day and we were greeted and seated right away 1 
a lot of websites have been rating this a very good phone and so do i 1 
the fish is badly made and some of its underwater shots are repeated a thousand times in the film 0 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
it is shameful 0 
the pleather case doesnt fit 0 
this place is not quality sushi it is not a quality restaurant 0 
this is a great product sure beats using your fingers 1 
went for lunch service was slow 0 
overall i wasnt very impressed with noca 0 
they were goldencrispy and delicious 1 
never going back 0 
very true to shakespear and a must for all shakespear fans 1 
kind of flops around 0 
i would recommend saving room for this 1 
but the actingeven that of such professionals as drago and debbie rochonwas terrible the directing worse perhaps contributory to the former the dialog chimplike and the camera work barely tolerable 0 
unfortunately we must have hit the bakery on leftover day because everything we ordered was stale 0 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
id rather eat airline food seriously 0 
its a shame to see good actors like thomerson and james make a living in a mess like this 0 
in fact i liked it better than interview with a vampire and i liked this lestat stuart townsend better than cruises attempt 1 
overall i like there food and the service 1 
this is cool because most cases are just open there allowing the screen to get all scratched up 1 
although i very much liked the look and sound of this place the actual experience was a bit disappointing 0 
absolutely great 1 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
the only place good for this film is in the garbage 0 
its reception is very very poor 0 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
this film tries to be a serious and sophisticated thrillerhorror flick and it fails miserably 0 
but it wasnt anything at all just one big yawn 0 
yes i am simplifying things here for the sake of brevity for this really is at the core of the problems with this film it has too much going on without any real fulfilling explanation 0 
worked great 1 
2 thumbs up to this seller 1 
of course the footage from the 70s was grainy but that only enhanced the film 1 
avoid at all costs 0 
it was packed 0 
our server was super nice and checked on us many times 1 
i guess it was supposed to be clever twist then shed some light on the situation but it was just stupid 0 
piece of junk 0 
and it was way to expensive 0 
hence the whole story lacks a certain energy 0 
the entire audience applauded at the conclusion of the film 1 
first time there and might just be the last 0 
an excellent new restaurant by an experienced frenchman 1 
waiter was a jerk 0 
fantastic service here 1 
the food amazing 1 
the accompanied software is almost brilliant 1 
elias koteasjack palance play good roles angelina is hot and gets nakedbilly drago appears in this and is cool as usual a cameo by sven ole thorsen helps make this a very enjoyable movie with good acting and a decent budget 1 
there were several moments in the movie that just didnt need to be there and were excruciatingly slow moving 0 
it was just too horrible 0 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
the acting is fantastic the stories are seamlessly woven together and the dogs are splendid a must rent view or see 1 
the menu is always changing food quality is going down service is extremely slow 0 
it quit working after id used it for about 18 months so i just purchased another one because this is the best headset ive ever owned 1 
lately they have been extremely nice and helpful on the phone 1 
similarly the delivery man did not say a word of apology when our food was 45 minutes late 0 
as for the service im a fan because its quick and youre being served by some nice folks 1 
i am far from a sushi connoisseur but i can definitely tell the difference between good food and bad food and this was certainly bad food 0 
i do not know if this was emilio estevezs directorial debut but the pacing the interplay and development of the characters as well as some clever camera work surrounding the character estevez plays all suggest a natural eye 1 
im glad i found this product on amazon it is hard to find it wasnt high priced 1 
the sound is clear and the people i talk to on it are amazed at the quality too 1 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
tasted like dirt 0 
it is wonderful and inspiring to watch and i hope that it gets released again on to video or dvd 1 
the movie has almost no action scenes in it and very little comedy 0 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
performed awful muffled tinny incoming sound and severe echo for those on the other end of the call 0 
bland and flavorless is a good way of describing the barely tepid meat 0 
he came running after us when he realized my husband had left his sunglasses on the table 1 
this item is great installed it let it charged up overnite and it has been working good every since with no problems 1 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
this isnt a small family restaurant this is a fine dining establishment 1 
speaking of the music it is unbearably predictably and kitchy 0 
ordered a double cheeseburger got a single patty that was falling apart picture uploaded yeah still sucks 0 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
but the duet between the astronaut and his doctor at the beginning of the movie is a perfect exchange if one considers that this movie was made well into the cold war and the astronauts biggest fear is that he has crashed in the ussr 1 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
there are massive levels massive unlockable characters its just a massive game 1 
i also decided not to send it back because our waitress looked like she was on the verge of having a heart attack 0 
the camera although rated at an impressive 13 megapixels renders images that fall well below expectations of such a relatively high resolution 0 
this phone is very fast with sending any kind of messages and web browsing is significantly faster than previous phones i have used 1 
this place is amazing 1 
strike 2 who wants to be rushed 0 
this item is fantastic and works perfectly 1 
i had the chicken pho and it tasted very bland 0 
i received my headset in good time and was happy with it 1 
its aggravating 0 
great software for motorolas 1 
ive also had problems with the phone reading the memory card in which i always turn it on and then off again 0 
i love this place 1 
characters are onedimensional even the good guys and especially the bad guys 0 
i thoroughly enjoyed it when christopher eccleston took control of the tardis and the continuation of the series 1 
mic doesnt work 0 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
i can think of no other film where something vitally important occurs every other minute 1 
do not waste your money here 0 
however after seeing the short again after about 25 years i was amazed at how timeless the film actually is 1 
there was a warm feeling with the service and i felt like their guest for a special treat 1 
a lot of websites have been rating this a very good phone and so do i 1 
very serious spoilers this movie was a huge disappointment 0 
duris has a wholesome appearance and gives a fine performance 1 
none of it works just dont buy it 0 
up there with the best of melville 1 
none of them are engaging or exciting 0 
see it 1 
the directing seems too pretentious 0 
i know that sounds funny but to me it seemed like sketchy technology that wouldnt work wellwell this one works great 1 
this is definitely one of the better documentaries i have seen looking at family relationships and marriage 1 
the movie seemed a little slow at first 0 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
its practically perfect in all of them  a true masterpiece in a sea of faux masterpieces 1 
long whiny and pointless 0 
best service and food ever maria our server was so good and friendly she made our day 1 
there arent death scenes like in previous movies and the fx are terrible 0 
the acting helps the writing along very well maybe the idiotsavant sister could have been played better and it is a real joy to watch 1 
terrible phone holder 0 
the plantains were the worst ive ever tasted 0 
its not hard to make a decent hamburger 0 
love this headset 1 
its not what it says it is 0 
regrettably the film fails 0 
hence the whole story lacks a certain energy 0 
on a positive note our server was very attentive and provided great service 1 
i loved their mussels cooked in this wine reduction the duck was tender and their potato dishes were delicious 1 
stopped by during the late may bank holiday off rick steve recommendation and loved it 1 
everything about it is just bad 0 
total brunch fail 0 
this was one of the worst films i have ever seen 0 
arrived quickly and much less expensive than others being sold 1 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
these products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet 0 
to call this movie a drama is ridiculous 0 
howeverthe riingtones are not the best and neither are the games 0 
earbud piece breaks easily 0 
i liked it 1 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
now the pizza itself was good the peanut sauce was very tasty 1 
performed awful muffled tinny incoming sound and severe echo for those on the other end of the call 0 
i really recommend this faceplates since it looks very nice elegant and cool 1 
also great directing and photography 1 
i kept looking at the time and it had soon become 35 minutes yet still no food 0 
this greedy corporation will never see another dime from me 0 
host staff were for lack of a better word bitches 0 
i bought this phone as a replacement for my startac and have regretted it since 0 
it works fine on my motorola 325 cellphone and a lot better than the wornout battery did 1 
i can take a little bad service but the food sucks 0 
the bipolarity of the ruthless thug one minute a ruthless killer the next minute a luvs diaper commercial is completely unconvincing 0 
reception is terrible and full of static 0 
its a sad movie but very good 1 
great pizza and salads 1 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
the writers were smack on and i think the best actors and actresses were a bonus to the showthese characters were so real 1 
after charging overnight these batteries work great 1 
this product had a strong rubberpetroleum smell that was unbearable after a while and caused me to return it 0 
we had fantastic service and were pleased by the atmosphere 1 
plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job 1 
you have to hold the phone at a particular angle for the other party to hear you clearly 0 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
great phone 1 
on a positive note our server was very attentive and provided great service 1 
i love this place 1 
this place deserves one star and 90 has to do with the food 0 
10 out of 10 stars 1 
no im going to eat the potato that i found some strangers hair in it 0 
yes this film does require a rather significant amount of puzzlesolving but the pieces fit together to create a beautiful picture 1 
customer service was terrible 0 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
please dont waste your money 0 
i dont think well be going back anytime soon 0 
the management is rude 0 
we got the food and apparently they have never heard of salt and the batter on the fish was chewy 0 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
i didnt want the clip going over the top of my ear causing discomfort 0 
my side greek salad with the greek dressing was so tasty and the pita and hummus was very refreshing 1 
nobody identifies with these characters because theyre all cardboard cutouts and stereotypes or predictably reversestereotypes 0 
the scenes with the ohsomature neighbourgirl are a misplace 0 
this is an extraordinary film 1 
so far so good 1 
ordered a double cheeseburger got a single patty that was falling apart picture uploaded yeah still sucks 0 
performed awful muffled tinny incoming sound and severe echo for those on the other end of the call 0 
why was this film made 0 
this mostly routine factbased tv drama gets a boost from the fine performance by cole 1 
try them in the airport to experience some tasty food and speedy friendly service 1 
same problem as others have mentioned 0 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
at first i thought i was grtting a good deal at 744 until i plugged it into my phone v3c razr 0 
really awful 0 
and finally after all that we get to an ending that wouldve been great had it been handled by competent people and not jerry falwell 0 
i hope this place sticks around 1 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
not my thing 0 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
the acting is beyond abysmal 0 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
the volume for the ringer is real good you have choices how loud 1 
comes with a strong light that you can use to light up your camera shots and even flash sos signals seriously 1 
i will come back here every time im in vegas 1 
very good product well made 1 
great value 1 
the transfers are very good 1 
avoid at any and all costs 0 
i had heard good things about this place but it exceeding every hope i could have dreamed of 1 
that was done in the second movie 0 
it was too predictable even for a chick flick 0 
the ripped banana was not only ripped but petrified and tasteless 0 
food arrived quickly 1 
sam shepards portrayal of a gung ho marine was sobering 1 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
the bottowm lineanother worthless cheap gimmick from sprint 0 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
im so happy to be here 1 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
i have been in more than a few bars in vegas and do not ever recall being charged for tap water 0 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
good audio quality 1 
truly awful 0 
its a campy sort of film thats a joy to watch 1 
none of it works just dont buy it 0 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
meredith m was better than all right 1 
we watched our waiter pay a lot more attention to other tables and ignore us 0 
the macarons here are insanely good 1 
however i needed some better instructions 0 
lets start with all the problemsthe acting especially from the lead professor was very very bad 0 
this place is overpriced not consistent with their boba and it really is overpriced 0 
were jerks on the phone 0 
service was fantastic 1 
but the convoluted plot just didnt convince me and much of the film was watched with a weird questioning glance 0 
it was way over fried 0 
i believe every one should see this movie as i think few people outside of south africa understand its past and what is being attempted in the truth and reconciliation process 1 
doesnt hold charge 0 
not good when wearing a hat or sunglasses 0 
great value 1 
this is a really fantastic thai restaurant which is definitely worth a visit 1 
you get extra minutes so that you can carry out the call and not get cut off 1 
the design is very good4 1 
he is one of my favourite directors and one of the most talented directors in the history of cinema 1 
this is a very average phone with bad battery life that operates on a weak network 0 
it features an outlandish array of memorable psychotic but lovable nuts 1 
the plot is nonsense that doesnt interest in the slightest way or have any uniqueness to it 0 
a very charming film with wonderful sentiment and heart 1 
its not hard to make a decent hamburger 0 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
im translating movies for a living and this is the first movie in my 5year working experience that i found offensive to my intelligence 0 
it was a huge awkward 15lb piece of cow that was 34ths gristle and fat 0 
tried to go here for lunch and it was a madhouse 0 
their steaks are 100 recommended 1 
i rate this movie 910 1 
it is so small and you dont even realize that it is there after a while of getting used to it 1 
one character is totally annoying with a voice that gives me the feeling of fingernails on a chalkboard 0 
improper description i had to return it 0 
comfortable in my hand 1 
not much dialogue not much music the whole film was shot as elaborately and aesthetically like a sculpture 1 
buyer beware you could flush money right down the toilet 0 
if youre not familiar check it out 1 
i have had this phone for over a year now and i will tell you its not that great 0 
the voice recognition thru the handset is excellent 1 
third the cheese on my friends burger was cold 0 
i always order from the vegetarian menu during dinner which has a wide array of options to choose from 1 
i believe that this place is a great stop for those with a huge belly and hankering for sushi 1 
constantine gives everything the right intensity and seems to have a good understanding of the underlying psychological motivations 1 
works great 1 
conclusion i loved it 1 
these products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet 0 
there is a brilliant twist ending 1 
as a sushi lover avoid this place by all means 0 
this is probably the most irritating show i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
wonderful lil tapas and the ambience made me feel all warm and fuzzy inside 1 
the bipolarity of the ruthless thug one minute a ruthless killer the next minute a luvs diaper commercial is completely unconvincing 0 
it came free with a dvd player i bought but i still turned the thing off halfway through because i was embarrassed for howell 0 
dont make the same mistake that i did and please dont buy this phone 0 
barney is definitely super de duper 1 
i think the most wonderful parts literally full of wonder are the excerpts from his works 1 
beware this is not a trashy cult movie this is trash period 0 
this was my first and only vegas buffet and it did not disappoint 1 
hard to judge whether these sides were good because we were grossed out by the melted styrofoam and didnt want to eat it for fear of getting sick 0 
its been my choice headset for yearsgreat sound good volume good noise cancellation 1 
i advise you to look out for it 1 
improper description i had to return it 0 
dont do it 0 
if you see it you should probably just leave it on the shelf 0 
the owners really really need to quit being soooooo cheap let them wrap my freaking sandwich in two papers not one 0 
dont buy it 0 
im returning them 0 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
easily none other cartoon made me laugh in a tender way before getting into dark sitcoms oriented for teenagers 1 
on the good side the staff was genuinely pleasant and enthusiastic a real treat 1 
this place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver 0 
very good stuff for the price 1 
tasted like dirt 0 
probably not in a hurry to go back 0 
nice design and quality 1 
the screen size is big key pad lit well enough and the camera quality is excellent for a camera phone 1 
the jabra eargels fit my ears very well 1 
a great way to finish a great 1 
awesome device 1 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
excellent phone 1 
avoid this film at all costs 0 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
works well 1 
i also didnt like the on button it felt like it would crack with use 0 
i ate there twice on my last visit and especially enjoyed the salmon salad 1 
service is quick and even to go orders are just like we like it 1 
all the other cases ive tried normally fall apart after a few months but this one seems to be in for the long haul 1 
barney is definitely super de duper 1 
they have a plethora of salads and sandwiches and everything ive tried gets my seal of approval 1 
but it is great i would really recommend it 1 
i dont know exactly what it is about this movie but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our familys memories 1 
i waited and waited 0 
great time family dinner on a sunday night 1 
the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach 0 
you learn a lot about the real inside emotions of people in this movie and a lot about the movie business itself 1 
horrible horrible protector 0 
but the premise of the film was so ridiculous that the president of the us 0 
there are massive levels massive unlockable characters its just a massive game 1 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
in short dont bother with this movie 0 
itll be a regular stop on my trips to phoenix 1 
its a great tool for entertainment communication and data managementoh be sure to use activesync 42 for optimal data synchronization results 1 
not enough volume 0 
the warm beer didnt help 0 
this was like the final blow 0 
join the club and get awesome offers via email 1 
ray charles is legendary 1 
good item low price 1 
everything on the menu is terrific and we were also thrilled that they made amazing accommodations for our vegetarian daughter 1 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
i wouldnt see this movie again for free 0 
what happened next was prettyoff putting 0 
i would avoid this place if you are staying in the mirage 0 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
this item is great installed it let it charged up overnite and it has been working good every since with no problems 1 
very very disappointed ordered the 35 big bay plater 0 
the story line is totally predictable 0 
not worth it 0 
i was very disappointed in the movie 0 
dont waste your money 0 
also notable is john baileys fine crisp beautifully colored cinematography and the great production design costumes by eiko ishioka who went on to do the memorable costumes for coppolas dracula for which she received a well deserved oscar 1 
the phone was unusable and was not new 0 
horrible horrible protector 0 
did not like at all 0 
it is easy to turn on and off when you are in the car and the volume controls are quite accessable 1 
good product good seller 1 
they were excellent 1 
poorly contstruct hinge 0 
its pretty easy 1 
we made the drive all the way from north scottsdale and i was not one bit disappointed 1 
have been going since 2007 and every meal has been awesome 1 
love this place hits the spot when i want something healthy but not lacking in quantity or flavor 1 
also difficult to put onid recommend avoiding this product 0 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
its a campy sort of film thats a joy to watch 1 
in summary this was a largely disappointing dining experience 0 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
i felt as though her going to ireland did absolutely nothing whatsoever 0 
we started with the tuna sashimi which was brownish in color and obviously wasnt fresh 0 
waited and waited and waited 0 
this film offers many delights and surprises 1 
every thing on phone work perfectly she like it 1 
that movie was bad 0 
it failed to convey the broad sweep of landscapes that were a great part of the original 0 
a good time 1 
if you do watch it however there are small consolations the actresses playing annes sisters each do a wonderful job with their roles 1 
of all the dishes the salmon was the best but all were great 1 
jawbone era is awesome too 1 
nevertheless yet another wonderful film from the great masters stable 1 
i ordered the lemon raspberry ice cocktail which was also incredible 1 
it is light has plenty of battery capacity and is very confortable to wear for somewhat extended periods of time 1 
the results well are a shame 0 
excellent 1 
the death row scenes were entirely unmoving 0 
battery has no life 0 
we made the drive all the way from north scottsdale and i was not one bit disappointed 1 
so dont go there if you are looking for good food 0 
i probably wont be coming back here 0 
obviously they have a terrible customer service so you get what you pay for 0 
i probably wont be coming back here 0 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
however after seeing the short again after about 25 years i was amazed at how timeless the film actually is 1 
never been to hard rock casino before will never ever step forward in it again 0 
the last 15 minutes of movie are also not bad as well 1 
the management is rude 0 
i guess i should have known that this place would suck because it is inside of the excalibur but i didnt use my common sense 0 
great food 1 
bland and flavorless is a good way of describing the barely tepid meat 0 
i have had this phone for over a year now and i will tell you its not that great 0 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
this movie has a cutting edge to it 1 
great hands free device 1 
join the club and get awesome offers via email 1 
we had a group of 70 when we claimed we would only have 40 and they handled us beautifully 1 
it showed exactly how the government and the scientist argued for humanity and the reasons of the gadget 1 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
great phone 1 
not as good as i had hoped 0 
the staff is great the food is delish and they have an incredible beer selection 1 
we watched our waiter pay a lot more attention to other tables and ignore us 0 
i have to mention this and it is a huge spoiler i loved the ending how all the characters of the three films were the remaining survivors of the ferry disaster with valentine and the young judge together and the old man watching it on her tv solidifying his happiness over the suffering which he dealt with for those many years 1 
we started with the tuna sashimi which was brownish in color and obviously wasnt fresh 0 
bad quality 0 
an excellent new restaurant by an experienced frenchman 1 
seems like a good quick place to grab a bite of some familiar pub food but do yourself a favor and look elsewhere 0 
it isnt even an achievement as a sobaditsgood or sobaditsmemorable movie 0 
its aggravating 0 
spoilers whatever else can or cant be said about it surface is superbly crafted 1 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
does everything it should and more 1 
this phone tries very hard to do everything but fails at its very ability to be a phone 0 
would come back again if i had a sushi craving while in vegas 1 
then our food came out disappointment ensued 0 
excellent product for the price 1 
weve tried to like this place but after 10 times i think were done with them 0 
this movie now joins revenge of the boogeyman and zombiez as part of the hellish trinity of horror films 0 
im trying to return it for a refund 0 
horrible dont waste your time and money 0 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
a film not easily forgotten 1 
but its just not funny 0 
and generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode 0 
i dont think it would hold it too securly on your belt 0 
its not what it says it is 0 
worked great 1 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
when i placed my treo into the case not only was it not snug but there was a lot of extra room on the sides 0 
strike 2 who wants to be rushed 0 
back to good bbq lighter fare reasonable pricing and tell the public they are back to the old ways 1 
i recommend igo to anyone with different brand cell phonesmp3 players in the family 1 
very prompt service 1 
i would recommend this 1 
the food sucked which we expected but it sucked more than we could have imagined 0 
bluetooth range is good a few days ago i left my phone in the trunk got a call and carried the conversation without a hitch 1 
at no point in the proceedings does it look remotely like america 0 
about 30 minutes of footage is wasted to show mediocre elderly actors awkwardly babbling overwrought pseudosatanic gibberish corny enough to make a teen goth blush almost always in olde english and sometimes in latin that may or may not be made up words 0 
the film has great actors a master director a significant themeat least a wouldbe significant theme undertone of fifties existential worldweariness aerial scenes that ought to have thrilled both senses and imagination and characters about which one might deeply care 1 
i received it quickly and it works great 1 
i do love sushi but i found kabuki to be overpriced overhip and underservices 0 
best of all is the rotating feature very helpful 1 
but the premise of the film was so ridiculous that the president of the us 0 
i liked it 1 
hard to judge whether these sides were good because we were grossed out by the melted styrofoam and didnt want to eat it for fear of getting sick 0 
i started this review with two stars but im editing it to give it only one 0 
i love this phone it is very handy and has a lot of features 1 
wasted two hours 0 
this is the place where i first had pho and it was amazing 1 
i keep watching it over and over 1 
weve have gotten a much better service from the pizza place next door than the services we received from this restaurant 0 
worst customer service ever 0 
but i thought his acting was skilled 1 
i really hope the team behind this movie makes more movies and that they will continue to do so in their own some kinda weird style 1 
excellent dualpurpose headset 1 
the servers went back and forth several times not even so much as an are you being helped 0 
the movie seemed a little slow at first 0 
no real improvement 0 
worthless product 0 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
the soundtrack sucked 0 
better than new 1 
overall a great experience 1 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
very funny 1 
weve have gotten a much better service from the pizza place next door than the services we received from this restaurant 0 
we loved the place 1 
nevertheless yet another wonderful film from the great masters stable 1 
the vegetables are so fresh and the sauce feels like authentic thai 1 
you can find better movies at youtube 0 
its very attractive and appears to be of good quality 1 
the descriptions said yum yum sauce and another said eel sauce yet another said spicy mayowell none of the rolls had sauces on them 0 
the place was fairly clean but the food simply wasnt worth it 0 
is it possible for a movie to get any worse than this 0 
great place fo take out or eat in 1 
the camera although rated at an impressive 13 megapixels renders images that fall well below expectations of such a relatively high resolution 0 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
the selection of food was not the best 0 
thats how id describe this painfully dreary timewaster of a film 0 
worthless product 0 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
this place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver 0 
dont buy it 0 
everything was fresh and delicious 1 
great food 1 
yes i am simplifying things here for the sake of brevity for this really is at the core of the problems with this film it has too much going on without any real fulfilling explanation 0 
im probably one of the few people to ever go to ians and not like it 0 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
disappointed with battery 0 
awful service 0 
it clicks into place in a way that makes you wonder how long that mechanism would last 0 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
unreliable im giving up 0 
happy so far 1 
worst service to boot but that is the least of their worries 0 
it ranks highly as a great noircrimedrama incredible performances by belmondo and lino ventura 1 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
it was a pale color instead of nice and char and has no flavor 0 
the plot doesnt hang together at all and the acting is absolutely appalling 0 
garbo who showed right off the bat that her talents could carry over from the silent era i wanted to see some of her silent work but netflix doesnt seem to be stocking them 1 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
so i am here to warn youdo not rent this movie it is the dumbest thing you have never seen 0 
dont go here 0 
i love this phone 1 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
you need two hands to operate the screenthis software interface is decade old and cannot compete with new software designs 0 
using all earpieces left or right this thing will not stay on my ear 0 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
i am far from a sushi connoisseur but i can definitely tell the difference between good food and bad food and this was certainly bad food 0 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
dont buy it 0 
about half way through this film i started to dislike it 0 
this is my new fav vegas buffet spot 1 
i have purchased these for both family and friends and all enjoy their clarity and ease of use 1 
i guess that nobody at the network that aired this dribble watched it before putting it on 0 
they were excellent 1 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
awesome selection of beer 1 
i ordered this for sony ericsson w810i but i think it only worked once thats when i first used it 0 
bad choice 0 
emily watsons character is very strong and she has only to give a quick glance and you understand everything 1 
this is a stunning movie 1 
the grilled chicken was so tender and yellow from the saffron seasoning 1 
none of the new ones have ever quite worked properly 0 
totally believable 1 
kids pizza is always a hit too with lots of great side dish options for the kiddos 1 
very good product well made 1 
wow loved this place 1 
i am far from a sushi connoisseur but i can definitely tell the difference between good food and bad food and this was certainly bad food 0 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
this place is not worth your time let alone vegas 0 
this is a witty and delightful adaptation of the dr seuss book brilliantly animated by upas finest and thoroughly deserving of its academy award 1 
im probably one of the few people to ever go to ians and not like it 0 
this is one of the best italian thrillers of the early 70s 1 
this is truly an art movieit actually has a lot of art in it 1 
omg the food was delicioso 1 
the black eyed peas and sweet potatoes unreal 1 
the soundtrack wasnt terrible either 1 
no one at the table thought the food was above average or worth the wait that we had for it 0 
i saw this film over christmas and what a great film it was 1 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
itll be a regular stop on my trips to phoenix 1 
the jalapeno bacon is soooo good 1 
great character actors telly savalas and peter boyle 1 
emily watsons character is very strong and she has only to give a quick glance and you understand everything 1 
cinematography the film was shot in an interesting way 1 
i did not have any problem with this item and would order it again if needed 1 
improper description i had to return it 0 
verizon tech support walked my through a few procedures none of which worked and i ended up having to do a hard reset wiping out all my data 0 
your brain will attempt to shutdown as part of a primal impulse of selfpreservation 0 
oh the charger seems to work fine 1 
ill definitely be in soon again 1 
some may say this buffet is pricey but i think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot 1 
what a waste of money and time 0 
i was totally fascinated by the music the dancing everything 1 
none of them are engaging or exciting 0 
i did not have any problem with this item and would order it again if needed 1 
we started with the tuna sashimi which was brownish in color and obviously wasnt fresh 0 
all in all ha long bay was a bit of a flop 0 
avoid this film at all costs 0 
after i pulled up my car i waited for another 15 minutes before being acknowledged 0 
however after finally watching this film i realized that not only had i had a closed mind to the brilliance it depicts i also found myself watching it over and over again 1 
every element of this story was so over the top excessively phony and contrived that it was painful to sit through 0 
muddy low quality sound and the casing around the wires insert was poorly super glued and slid off 0 
paolo sorrentino has written a wonderful story about loneliness and tony has built one of the most unforgettable characters seen in movies in recent years 1 
the decor is nice and the piano music soundtrack is pleasant 1 
not too screamy not to masculine but just right 1 
trying to make a call on these is an exercise in frustration 0 
the interplay between martin and emilio contains the same wonderful chemistry we saw in wall street with martin and charlie 1 
my headset works just peachykeen 1 
great price too 1 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
the story line is totally predictable 0 
my mother and brother had to do thiswhen i saw robert ryan portraying this type of man it was a very good imitation of this type of individual and i was impressed 1 
we waited for thirty minutes to be seated although there were 8 vacant tables and we were the only folks waiting 0 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
performed awful muffled tinny incoming sound and severe echo for those on the other end of the call 0 
a cheap and cheerless heist movie with poor characterisation lots of underbite style stoic emoting think chow yun fat in a better tomorrow and some cheesy clichés thrown into an abandoned factory ready for a few poorly executed flying judo rolls a la john woo 0 
sam shepards portrayal of a gung ho marine was sobering 1 
basically the service was very bad 0 
im super pissd 0 
an italian reviewer called this a small great film and thats right 1 
very comfortable 1 
the concert sequences just sucked 0 
the foreigner is not worth one second of your time 0 
the kids are annoying 0 
i gave it a 10 1 
great product and price 1 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
you get what you pay for i guess 0 
also if your phone is dropped this case is not going to save it specially when dropped face down 0 
his use of the colours of the french flag in the three films was nothing short of incredible every shot every scene was like a work of art 1 
i was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar not only because the quality is great but the service is fast and the food impeccable 1 
i keep watching it over and over 1 
if there were zero stars i would give it zero stars 0 
ill even say it again  this is torture 0 
not too screamy not to masculine but just right 1 
its a great item 1 
truly awful 0 
crisp and clear 1 
the best scene in the movie was when gerardo is trying to find a song that keeps running through his head 1 
it wasnt busy either also the building was freezing cold 0 
its one of the most boring horror movies from the 90s mainly because it starts slow and centers in a boring atmosphere 0 
i was able to do voice dialing in the car with no problem 1 
i liked it 1 
it is perfect for a sitdown family meal or get together with a few friends 1 
weve have gotten a much better service from the pizza place next door than the services we received from this restaurant 0 
i have always used corded headsets and the freedom from the wireless is very helpful 1 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
helen baxendale is a very credible lady macbeth who can be very cheerfull at times and sometimes she just looks like a naughty girl but deadly in her taste for blood and evil 1 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
special mention should be made of the superb music score and sound effects which are an integral element in helping to make this such a memorable and enjoyable cartoon 1 
the staff are also very friendly and efficient 1 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
great phone 1 
the movie has almost no action scenes in it and very little comedy 0 
its one of the most boring horror movies from the 90s mainly because it starts slow and centers in a boring atmosphere 0 
the scenes with the ohsomature neighbourgirl are a misplace 0 
did not like at all 0 
however i needed some better instructions 0 
the mic there is a joke and the volume is quite low 0 
love this product 1 
i had absolutely no problem with this headset linking to my 8530 blackberry curve 1 
we were promptly greeted and seated 1 
i will not be eating there again 0 
i started this review with two stars but im editing it to give it only one 0 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
everything was fresh and delicious 1 
comfortable in my hand 1 
to those who find this movie intelligent or even masterful i can only say its your intelligence and your imagination you obviously used to try and make some sense of this pitiful attempt its in our human nature to try and make sense of things 0 
we loved the place 1 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
everything from acting to cinematography was solid 1
