Yes, I am simplifying things here for the sake of brevity, for this really is at the core of the problems with this film - it has too much going on without any real, fulfilling explanation.  	0
Everything about it is just bad.  	0

Great for the jawbone.	1

Of all the dishes, the salmon was the best, but all were great.	1
The iGo chargers and tips are really great.	1
Nice headphones for the price and they work great!	1
But now that it is "out of warranty" the same problems reoccure.Bottom line... put your money somewhere else... Cingular will not support it.	0
I really loved the story line and the poler bear was kinda cute.But if anyone has a question about Fort Steele, just ask away:)  	1

OMG I felt like I had never eaten Thai food until this dish.	1
Damn good steak.	1
Great for the jawbone.	1
It's as continuously beautiful to look at as a Bertolucci, but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that master's work.  	1
The Jabra EarGels fit my ears very well.	1
The movie showed a lot of Florida at it's best, made it look very appealing.  	1

This place is not quality sushi, it is not a quality restaurant.	0
I probably won't be back, to be honest.	0
Then, as if I hadn't wasted enough of my life there, they poured salt in the wound by drawing out the time it took to bring the check.	0
.... Item arrived quickly and works great with my Metro PCS Samsung SCH-r450 slider phone and Sony Premium Sound in ear plugs.	1
Best Buffet in town, for the price you cannot beat it.	1

its extremely slow and takes forever to do anything with it.	0
An Italian reviewer called this "a small, great film," and that's right.  	1

This is one I did not have, but I watched it recently on Fox Movie Channel, and was very disappointed.  	0
The phone is sturdy and waterproof.	1
The tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu.	0

Waitress was a little slow in service.	0
Too bad you have to pay up to $$$ a month for the service!	0
A world better than 95% of the garbage in the theatres today.  	1

The company shipped my product very promptly and it works well.	1
I have had TMobile service for 2 or 3 years now, and I am pretty happy with it.	1
The only thing I wasn't too crazy about was their guacamole as I don't like it puréed.	0
Terrible product, and waste of money!	0
I can't see how this movie can be an inspiration to anyone to come out or overcome fear and rejection.  	0
Third, the cheese on my friend's burger was cold.	0
He is an amazing film artist, one of the most important whoever lived.  	1
I particularly remember my senses being assaulted by strident cords of music that would blare out with very little warning, and even less meaning.  	0
This second appearance of Mickey Mouse (following the silent PLANE CRAZY earlier that year) is probably his most famous film--mostly because it was so ground-breaking.  	1
There are some generally great things in it.  	1
For a self proclaimed coffee cafe, I was wildly disappointed.	0

This place is way too overpriced for mediocre food.	0
I seriously cannot believe that the owner has so many unexperienced employees that all are running around like chickens with their heads cut off.	0
Fantastic service here.	1
But above all the exquisite visual composition of each moment, with inventive and elegant use of close-up, camera angle and lighting, including pointillistic faux home movie footage, is a wonder and joy to behold.  	1
The staff are great, the ambiance is great.	1
I will never forget it now.  	1
This place has it!	1
That's how I'd describe this painfully dreary time-waster of a film.  	0

Mark my words, this is one of those cult films like Evil Dead 2 or Phantasm that people will still be discovering and falling in love with 20, 30, 40 years down the line.  	1
I'm a big fan of this series mostly due to Anne Rice's style, sensitivities and treatments.  	1
Excellent performance.  	1

This place is not worth your time, let alone Vegas.	0

Macbeth (Jason Connery) moved me to tears with his final monolog (out brief candle, out)He gave the sphere of moral decay and dark forces a human face, which makes it the more interesting.  	1
The Wife hated her meal (coconut shrimp), and our friends really did not enjoy their meals, either.	0

The pleather case doesn't fit.	0
Too politically correct.  	0
I knew when I saw the film that more great things were to come from this gifted actor.  	1
The inside is really quite nice and very clean.	1
The plot has more holes than a pair of fishnet stockings and the direction and editing is astonishingly ham fisted.  	0
Steer clear of this product and go with the genuine Palm replacementr pens, which come in a three-pack.	0
Tasted like dirt.	0
I am also very happy with the price.	1
The management is rude.	0
I really like this product over the Motorola because it is allot clearer on the ear piece and the mic.	1
All this movie does is make you sick watching all these slackers make excuses for their stupid actions for 90 minutes.  	0
Everything was good and tasty!	1
Product was excellent and works better than the verizon one and Boy was it cheaper!	1
BLACK WATER is a thriller that manages to completely transcend it's limitations (it's an indie flick) by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience.  	1
An excellent new restaurant by an experienced Frenchman.	1

This one wants to surf on the small wave of space movies in 1998 (Deep Impact and Armageddon), and this one fails everywhere.  	0
But it is entertaining, nonetheless.  	1

When a song could explain the emotions of the subjects better, such as when Jay Adams' unfortunate life was a subject of talk, the song Old Man by Neil Young was played, which evokes many emotions.  	1
I love the camera, it's really pretty good quality.	1
But this movie is not funny, considering the ridiculousness of it.  	0
Frankly, after Cotton club and Unfaithful, it was kind of embarrassing to watch Lane and Gere in this film, because it is BAD.  	0
Also, I feel like the chips are bought, not made in house.	0
A very good film indeed, about great and unconditional love.  	1
Tom Wilkinson's character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin, but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses, and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the character's anguish and suffering.  	1
This scene is very strong and unpleasant.  	0
Crostini that came with the salad was stale.	0
Total letdown, I would much rather just go to the Camelback Flower Shop and Cartel Coffee.	0

Authentic leather with nice shine and comfort .I recommend you this case !!	1
But, Kevin Spacey is an excellent, verbal tsunami as Buddy Ackerman  and totally believable because he is a great actor.  	1
Battery lasts only a few hours.	0
Things happen, characters personalities change, plot twists occur for no real reason other than that script calls for it.  	0

There are many continuity errors: one other user commented on different cars in the garage, Joe's glasses...the one that got to me the most was the fact Joe's facial hair configuration seemed to change from scene to scene.  	0
The food was very good and I enjoyed every mouthful, an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc.	1
this was a different cut than the piece the other day but still wonderful and tender s well as well flavored.	1
The instructions didn't explain that a microphone jack could be used.	0
One of the most disappointing aspects is the lack of notable gore.  	0
if you simply want a small flip phone -- look elsewhere as the extra bells & whistles are mediocre.	0
We were promptly greeted and seated.	1
I really do recommend this place, you can go wrong with this donut place!	1
That's a huge design flaw (unless I'm not using it correctly, which I don't think is the case).	0
I checked everywhere and there is no feature for it which is really disappointing.	0
Excellently produced by one of Sci-fi's best producers Scot Vandiver !  	1

I have been very happy with the 510 and have had NO complaints from any one regarding my sound quality on their end.	1
It clicks into place in a way that makes you wonder how long that mechanism would last.	0
I vomited in the bathroom mid lunch.	0
Just reading on the specs alone makes you say WOW.	1
It crackles with an unpredictable, youthful energy - but honestly, i found it hard to follow and concentrate on it meanders so badly.  	0
Yes it's shiny on front side - and I love it!	1
So bad...well...it's just bad.  	0
This place is not quality sushi, it is not a quality restaurant.	0
It defeats the purpose of a bluetooth headset.	0
It is a true classic.  	1
Great product and price.	1
Don't make the same mistake that I did and please don't buy this phone.	0

So we went to Tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon!	1
Great Value.	1
The best part about "Nurse Betty" is it's unpredictability.  	1
I really liked that.  	1
Worked very well paired with a Treo 700w and as a Skype headset on my PC (using a USB Bluetooth transceiver).	1
Perfect for the PS3.	1
Classy/warm atmosphere, fun and fresh appetizers, succulent steaks (Baseball steak!!!!!	1

Do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish.	0
This phone is slim and light and the display is beautiful.	1
See it.  	1
Regardless, the film fails on most levels.  	0
Great food.	1
It seems completely secure, both holding on to my belt, and keeping the iPhone inside.	1
He also came back to check on us regularly, excellent service.	1
The phone can also take great pictures and even video clips.	1
Great brunch spot.	1
It also had a new problem.	0
Avoid at any and all costs.  	0
Finally, after three or four times the spring of the latch broke and I could not use it any longer on the visor.	0
I was very excited to get this headset because I thought it was really cute.	1

They were excellent.	1
I have been very happy with the 510 and have had NO complaints from any one regarding my sound quality on their end.	1

This place is hands-down one of the best places to eat in the Phoenix metro area.	1
The service here is fair at best.	0
Unfortunately, this is a bad movie that is just plain bad.  	0
Still it's quite interesting and entertaining to follow.  	1
Call me a nut, but I think this is one of the best movies ever.  	1
It fits so securely that the ear hook does not even need to be used and the sound is better directed through your ear canal.	1
Hopefully, the director James Cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast, or win us over with a whole new film.  	1
My phone sounded OK ( not great - OK), but my wife's phone was almost totally unintelligible, she couldn't understand a word being said on it.	0
Anyways, The food was definitely not filling at all, and for the price you pay you should expect more.	0
I'll put this gem up against any movie in terms of screenplay, cinematography, acting, post-production, editing, directing, or any other aspect of film-making.  	1
This movie is BAD.  	0
It was not good.	0
I ate there twice on my last visit, and especially enjoyed the salmon salad.	1

Its well-designed and very sharp -- the blue is a very nice color.	1
Then our food came out, disappointment ensued.	0
The only place good for this film is in the garbage.  	0
Needless to say, I won't be going back anytime soon.	0
The plot, such as it is, is so derivative and predictable that the ending is like a mercy killing.  	0
The goat taco didn't skimp on the meat and wow what FLAVOR!	1
The mic is great.	1
first of all, there are enough racial stereotypes and racial jokes to offend everyone.  	0
Keep up the good work Amazon!!	1
The bartender was also nice.	1
I took back my money and got outta there.	0
It's kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly it's embarrassing how child-like the company is.	0

The only thing really worth watching was the scenery and the house, because it is beautiful.  	1
The staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries, lawyers, and court staff.	1
The plantains were the worst I've ever tasted.	0
We sat another ten minutes and finally gave up and left.	0
In other words, the content level of this film is enough to easily fill a dozen other films.  	1
The buffet is small and all the food they offered was BLAND.	0
God, and I can never get that 90 minutes back!  	0
The movie showed a lot of Florida at it's best, made it look very appealing.  	1

You can not answer calls with the unit, never worked once!	0
Could not get strong enough signal.	0
I particularly remember my senses being assaulted by strident cords of music that would blare out with very little warning, and even less meaning.  	0
Buy a different phone - but not this.	0
Then the film just dropped the ball.  	0
Poor quality.	0
Just whatever you do, avoid "Groove" as its the antithesis of all that is good about Human Traffic.  	0
A truly, truly bad film.  	0
Rating: 1 out of 10.  	0
However, here there was no decent acting, action or location work to balance things up.  	0
All I have to say is the food was amazing!!!	1
The camera on the phone may be used as a dustpan when indoors... I'd rather be using a disposable then this.	0
My husband and I ate lunch here and were very disappointed with the food and service.	0
The acting was decidely wooden, though no worse than a period Universal B movie.  	0
I give it 2 thumbs down	0

Worse, there's an incredibly weak sub-plot thrown in that follows a little band of latter-day Mansonites as they go after a reporter who's working on a story on the anniversary of the killings.  	0
Our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow, he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go!	1
The reception is excellent!	1
Love this product.	1
By the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant I was bored and didn't care what happened next and so I switched off.  	0
The mic there is a joke, and the volume is quite low.	0
Also, the phone doesn't seem to accept anything except CBR mp3s, preferably ripped by Windows Media Player.	0
Customer service was terrible.	0
This is cool because most cases are just open there allowing the screen to get all scratched up.	1

Product was excellent and works better than the verizon one and Boy was it cheaper!	1
Service is also cute.	1
Great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with TV's.	1
I immediately said I wanted to talk to the manager but I did not want to talk to the guy who was doing shots of fireball behind the bar.	0
I'm not really sure how Joey's was voted best hot dog in the Valley by readers of Phoenix Magazine.	0
It was either too cold, not enough flavor or just bad.	0
Although I very much liked the look and sound of this place, the actual experience was a bit disappointing.	0
All this movie does is make you sick watching all these slackers make excuses for their stupid actions for 90 minutes.  	0
Food was below average.	0
She's poised and amazing.  	1
The only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive.	1

Her lines seem to have been WRITTEN by a fifteen year old, though they are trying oh so, so hard to sound like how a fifteen year old would really, um, you know, well... talk.  	0

I checked out this place a couple years ago and was not impressed.	0
Waited and waited and waited.	0
very clear, quality sound and you don't have to mess with the sound on your iPod since you have the sound buttons on the headset.	1
Unfortunately, inexperience of direction meant that scene after scene passed with little in the way of dramatic tension or conflict.  	0
However, this didn't make up for the fact that overall, this was a tremendously boring movie.  	0
Hot dishes are not hot, cold dishes are close to room temp.I watched staff prepare food with BARE HANDS, no gloves.Everything is deep fried in oil.	0
Timely shipment and quality product.	1
!I definitly recommend!!	1

much better than the hard plastic cases.	1
You'll love how thin it is.	1
The chicken wings contained the driest chicken meat I have ever eaten.	0
Superb Phone on a Great Network.	1
But when someone strives for greatness and poetry, but delivers a muddled (and often ridiculous) story, a bunch of disparate scenes, pretentious dialogue... Then you get the worst kind of a movie that some other reviewer very accurately defined as "pretentious crap".  	0
It was very popular when I was in the cinema, a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs.  	1
That was funny.  	1
Judith Light is one of my favorite actresses and I think she does a superb job in this film!  	1

There's a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that I have never experienced before.	0
The service was terrible, food was mediocre.	0

The film gives meaning to the phrase, "Never in the history of human conflict has so much been owed by so many to so few.  	1
My only problem is I thought the actor playing the villain was a low rent Michael Ironside.  	0
I like the fact that it rests lightly against your ear, rather than inside.	1
You need two hands to operate the screen.This software interface is decade old and cannot compete with new software designs.	0
Shrimp- When I unwrapped it (I live only 1/2 a mile from Brushfire) it was literally ice cold.	0
The film lacks any real scares or tension & some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least & I say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself.  	0

I keep watching it over and over.  	1
The plot - well, I said I'd let that one go.  	0

The incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film.  	1
Unfortunately, this is a bad movie that is just plain bad.  	0
It is super charged up for use as a small hybrid palmtop/camera/cellphone, and excels in those roles.	1
It isn't even an achievement as a "so-bad-it's-good" or "so-bad-it's-memorable" movie.  	0
He is almost unbearable to watch on screen, he has little to no charisma, and terrible comedic timing.  	0
The directing is sloppy at best.  	0
It is very comfortable to wear as well, which is probably the most important aspect about using a case.	1
It's a great place and I highly recommend it.	1
This is definitely one of the better documentaries I have seen looking at family relationships and marriage.  	1
The seller is very understanding and patient, I would definitely buy from them again.	1

Garbo, who showed right off the bat that her talents could carry over from the silent era (I wanted to see some of her silent work, but Netflix doesn't seem to be stocking them.  	1

Be sure to order dessert, even if you need to pack it to-go - the tiramisu and cannoli are both to die for.	1
This is a bad film, with bad writing, and good actors....an ugly cartoon crafted by Paul Haggis for people who can't handle anything but the bold strokes in storytelling....a picture painted with crayons.  	0
I would not recommend this place.	0
