the servers went back and forth several times not even so much as an are you being helped 0 
if you havent choked in your own vomit by the end by all the cheap drama and worthless dialogue youve must have bored yourself to death with this waste of time 0 
great product 1 
for those that havent seen it dont waste your time 0 
was not happy 0 
dont make the same mistake i did 0 
love this product 1 
my husband and i ate lunch here and were very disappointed with the food and service 0 
buttons are too small 0 
very disappointed 0 
do not purchase this phone 0 
doesnt do the job 0 
couldnt figure it out 0 
the stories were as unbelievable as the actors 0 
i had about two bites and refused to eat anymore 0 
great value 1 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
a world better than 95 of the garbage in the theatres today 1 
i love the ringtones because they are so upbeat 1 
service was good and the company was better 1 
but it picked up speed and got right to the point 1 
restaurant is always full but never a wait 1 
that said our mouths and bellies were still quite pleased 1 
i was bored throughout the whole damn thing 0 
dont do it 0 
what a disappointment 0 
very clear quality sound and you dont have to mess with the sound on your ipod since you have the sound buttons on the headset 1 
give this one a look 1 
the script is a big flawed mess 0 
bad choice 0 
walked in and the place smelled like an old grease trap and only 2 others there eating 0 
there is however some pretty good acting at least for this type of film 1 
plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job 1 
cool phone 1 
muddy low quality sound and the casing around the wires insert was poorly super glued and slid off 0 
i mean this in a terrible way 0 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
not a weekly haunt but definitely a place to come back to every once in a while 1 
even in my bmw 3 series which is fairly quiet i have trouble hearing what the other person is saying 0 
they have a plethora of salads and sandwiches and everything ive tried gets my seal of approval 1 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
owners are really great people 1 
how can you call yourself a steakhouse if you cant properly cook a steak i dont understand 0 
garbo who showed right off the bat that her talents could carry over from the silent era i wanted to see some of her silent work but netflix doesnt seem to be stocking them 1 
i work in the hospitality industry in paradise valley and have refrained from recommending cibo any longer 0 
i did not bother contacting the company for few dollar product but i learned the lesson that i should not have bought this form online anyway 0 
this movie contained an allstar cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i havent seen before 1 
iam very pleased with my purchase 1 
restaurant is always full but never a wait 1 
i probably would not go here again 0 
mark my words this is one of those cult films like evil dead 2 or phantasm that people will still be discovering and falling in love with 20 30 40 years down the line 1 
you will leave the theater wanting to go out and dance under the stars 1 
i mean really how do you get so famous for your fish and chips when its so terrible 0 
it is not good 0 
and it was way to expensive 0 
dont buy this product 0 
i have to use the smallest earpieces provided but it stays on pretty well 1 
great movie 1 
attempting artiness with black white and clever camera angles the movie disappointed became even more ridiculous as the acting was poor and the plot and lines almost nonexistent 0 
this does not fit the palm tungsten e2 and it broke the first time i tried to plug it in 0 
it is wonderful and inspiring to watch and i hope that it gets released again on to video or dvd 1 
the story itself is just predictable and lazy 0 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
nice ambiance 1 
the menu is always changing food quality is going down service is extremely slow 0 
the secondary plot line is incomprehensible and its relation to the primary plot line is mystifying 0 
the plot has more holes than a pair of fishnet stockings and the direction and editing is astonishingly ham fisted 0 
i would highly recommend this product 1 
do not buy if you want to use the holster 0 
it was horrible 0 
i have had mine for about a year and this christmas i bought some for the rest of the family 1 
also difficult to put onid recommend avoiding this product 0 
this pair of headphones is the worst that i have ever had soundwise 0 
i dont think ill be running back to carlys anytime soon for food 0 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
nothing special 0 
he is almost unbearable to watch on screen he has little to no charisma and terrible comedic timing 0 
terrible my car will not accept this cassette 0 
the fried rice was dry as well 0 
this place is great 1 
it has a great camera thats 2mp and the pics are nice and clear with great picture quality 1 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
a good time 1 
the art style has the appearance of crayonpencil drawings and is wonderfully colorful and fanciful 1 
delicious nyc bagels good selections of cream cheese real lox with capers even 1 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
i will be back many times soon 1 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
well im satisfied 1 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
id rather eat airline food seriously 0 
i know this is not like the other restaurants at all something is very off here 0 
clever and a real crowdpleaserthis film still ranks among mickeys best films even after 80 wonderful years 1 
some highlights great quality nigiri here 1 
beautiful styling though 1 
it was a waste of my money 0 
it has kept up very well 1 
and then tragedy struck 0 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
unless youre just out to visually collect all extant films of austens work you can skip this one 0 
i bought this phone as a replacement for my startac and have regretted it since 0 
im still trying to get over how bad it was 0 
chinese forgeries abound 0 
his losing his marbles so early in the proceedings is totally implausible and unconvincing 0 
i would advise to not purchase this item it never worked very well 0 
warning stay away 0 
they never brought a salad we asked for 0 
waste of money 0 
i didnt want the clip going over the top of my ear causing discomfort 0 
the dialogue sucked 0 
i have purchased these for both family and friends and all enjoy their clarity and ease of use 1 
by the time the film ended i not only disliked it i despised it 0 
disappointing experience 0 
highquality chicken on the chicken caesar salad 1 
i guess i should have known that this place would suck because it is inside of the excalibur but i didnt use my common sense 0 
this is an outstanding little restaurant with some of the best food i have ever tasted 1 
one of the best mexican movies ever and one of the less understood even by mexican themselves no matter how identified the should have felt with it 1 
will never ever go back and have told many people what had happened 0 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
very bad performance plays angela bennett a computer expert who is at home all the time 0 
do not buy if you want to use the holster 0 
the only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port irda 0 
a good commentary of todays love and undoubtedly a film worth seeing 1 
eew this location needs a complete overhaul 0 
must have been an off night at this place 0 
i thoroughly enjoyed it when christopher eccleston took control of the tardis and the continuation of the series 1 
meredith m was better than all right 1 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
the story line is totally predictable 0 
the potatoes were like rubber and you could tell they had been made up ahead of time being kept under a warmer 0 
design flaw 0 
very disappointing 0 
save your money ive had this item for 11 months now 0 
i loved it it was really scary 1 
it will drive you barking mad 0 
food was really boring 0 
i immediately said i wanted to talk to the manager but i did not want to talk to the guy who was doing shots of fireball behind the bar 0 
mobile phone tools are a must have 1 
the building itself seems pretty neat the bathroom is pretty trippy but i wouldnt eat here again 0 
interesting decor 1 
muddy low quality sound and the casing around the wires insert was poorly super glued and slid off 0 
a great touch 1 
worst martini ever 0 
these are the central themes of the film and they are handled ineptly stereotypically and with no depth of imagination 0 
the service was outshining i definitely recommend the halibut 1 
uncomfortable in the ear dont use with lg vx9900 env 0 
the jamaican mojitos are delicious 1 
which has more depth and character than the man underneath it 0 
cool phone 1 
all i have to say is the food was amazing 1 
ive tried several different earpieces for my cell phone and this jabra one is the first one ive found that fits my ear comfortably 1 
level 5 spicy was perfect where spice didnt overwhelm the soup 1 
i would not recommend this place 0 
its fits like a glove and is strong secure and durable 1 
the waitresses are very friendly 1 
first off the reception sucks i have never had more than 2 bars ever 0 
i could barely stomach the meal but didnt complain because it was a business lunch 0 
leopard print is wonderfully wild 1 
it fits so securely that the ear hook does not even need to be used and the sound is better directed through your ear canal 1 
we wont be returning 0 
delicious and i will absolutely be back 1 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
i really recommend this faceplates since it looks very nice elegant and cool 1 
youd have to have the iq of particularly stupid mollusk not to see that one coming 0 
i came over from verizon because cingulair has nicer cell phones the first thing i noticed was the really bad service 0 
it was so funny 1 
there is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again 0 
their research and development division obviously knows what theyre doing 1 
bland and flavorless is a good way of describing the barely tepid meat 0 
instead we got a bore fest about a whiny spoiled brat babysitting 0 
the goat taco didnt skimp on the meat and wow what flavor 1 
theres really nothing bad i can say about this headset 0 
we recently witnessed her poor quality of management towards other guests as well 0 
it was a very superficial movie and it gave me the feeling that i was watching play rather than a film 0 
the scallop dish is quite appalling for value as well 0 
simple lightweight and great fit 1 
i do love sushi but i found kabuki to be overpriced overhip and underservices 0 
i love it 1 
a standout scene 1 
you wont forget this movie 1 
the chicken i got was definitely reheated and was only ok the wedges were cold and soggy 0 
poor reliability 0 
the design is very odd as the ear clip is not very comfortable at all 0 
highquality chicken on the chicken caesar salad 1 
the acting was bad the dialogs were extremely shallow and insincere 0 
this movie totally grates on my nerves 0 
and those baby owls were adorable 1 
juano hernandez an exceptional actor who played supporting roles in many films of the era is a proud black man who is accused of murdering a white man in the south 1 
i ordered the voodoo pasta and it was the first time id had really excellent pasta since going gluten free several years ago 1 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
ill be looking for a new earpiece 0 
it is an hour and half waste of time following a bunch of very pretty high schoolers whine and cry about life 0 
ray charles is legendary 1 
the ri style calamari was a joke 0 
i highly recommend this modest priced cellular phone 1 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
and the chef was generous with his time even came around twice so we can take pictures with him 1 
the food was very good 1 
friends pasta also bad he barely touched it 0 
my gyro was basically lettuce only 0 
the worst sappiest dialogue i could go on and on 0 
i especially love the long battery life 1 
the service was meh 0 
the accompanied software is almost brilliant 1 
never again will i be dining at this place 0 
tom wilkinson broke my heart at the end and everyone elses judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike 1 
buttons are too small 0 
its kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly its embarrassing how childlike the company is 0 
because both ears are occupied background is not distracting at all 1 
gets a signal when other verizon phones wont 1 
see both films if you can 1 
bad fit way too big 0 
i highly recommend this device to everyone 1 
the croutons also taste homemade which is an extra plus 1 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
the food was barely lukewarm so it must have been sitting waiting for the server to bring it out to us 0 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
things that went wrong they burned the saganaki 0 
hands down my favorite italian restaurant 1 
its just painful 0 
really awful 0 
restored my phone to like new performance 1 
excellent product for the price 1 
he owns the film just as spacek owned coal miners daughter and quaid owned great balls of fire 1 
i thoroughly enjoyed it when christopher eccleston took control of the tardis and the continuation of the series 1 
as a courtroom drama its compelling as an indictment on the american justice system its frightening 1 
the ending is so so perfect youll shed a tear 1 
this hole in the wall has great mexican street tacos and friendly staff 1 
some highlights great quality nigiri here 1 
a great way to finish a great 1 
the use of slowmotion needlessly repeats itself throughout the movie but is well backed up by bad acting and bad is a kind word here no continuity scenes that are thrown in for no reason whatsoever vehicles that looked like they were made from a corn flakes box and a directorial style that bordered on stupidity 0 
damian is so talented and versatile in so many ways of writing and portraying different characters on screen 1 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
not good by any stretch of the imagination 0 
after a year the battery went completely dead on my headset 0 
too politically correct 0 
the best place in vegas for breakfast just check out a sat or sun 1 
at first i thought i was grtting a good deal at 744 until i plugged it into my phone v3c razr 0 
a disappointment 0 
the best place to go for a tasty bowl of pho 1 
clear skype calls long battery life long range 1 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
i will not be eating there again 0 
very well made and fits my surefire gx2 perfectly 1 
bluetooth range is good a few days ago i left my phone in the trunk got a call and carried the conversation without a hitch 1 
we made the drive all the way from north scottsdale and i was not one bit disappointed 1 
great product and price 1 
seems like a good quick place to grab a bite of some familiar pub food but do yourself a favor and look elsewhere 0 
i mean this in a terrible way 0 
it showed exactly how the government and the scientist argued for humanity and the reasons of the gadget 1 
but i thought his acting was skilled 1 
the place was fairly clean but the food simply wasnt worth it 0 
hayao miyazakis latest and eighth film for studio ghibili gake no ue no ponyo ponyo on the cliff by the sea is a wonderfully fun and imaginative look at childhood 1 
i can take a little bad service but the food sucks 0 
it is practically useless and did not add any kind of boost to my reception after i bought it 0 
good value great food great service 1 
this gets a 1 out of 10 simply because theres nothing lower 0 
great it was new packaged nice works good no problems and it came in less time then i expected 1 
it came free with a dvd player i bought but i still turned the thing off halfway through because i was embarrassed for howell 0 
cinematography noteworthy including fine views of barcelona and its famed gaudi towers 1 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
i heart this place 1 
for a product that costs as much as this one does i expect it to work far better and with greater ease than this thing does 0 
its reception is very very poor 0 
the characters are fleshed out surprisingly well particularly grimes and blake and all the actors deliver their sharply scripted lines with just the right amount of deadpan tongue in cheek to make the dialogue both hilarious and realistic 1 
the food is very good for your typical bar food 1 
fantastic earphones 1 
poor reliability 0 
the selection of food was not the best 0 
love this place hits the spot when i want something healthy but not lacking in quantity or flavor 1 
i had heard good things about this place but it exceeding every hope i could have dreamed of 1 
the food wasnt good 0 
mishima is extremely uninteresting 0 
the place was fairly clean but the food simply wasnt worth it 0 
they dropped more than the ball 0 
very serious spoilers this movie was a huge disappointment 0 
i found this move beautiful enjoyable and uplifting 1 
the price is reasonable and the service is great 1 
lasted one day and then blew up 0 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
ive bought 5 wired headphones that sound better than these 0 
the acting helps the writing along very well maybe the idiotsavant sister could have been played better and it is a real joy to watch 1 
it works fine on my motorola 325 cellphone and a lot better than the wornout battery did 1 
definitely worth seeing its the sort of thought provoking film that forces you to question your own threshold of loneliness 1 
works great 1 
it has a very good plot it holds your complete attention the acting is superb tom wilkinson was fantastic and emily watson was also very good 1 
it dit not work most of the time with my nokia 5320 0 
i have never had such bland food which surprised me considering the article we read focused so much on their spices and flavor 0 
easy to use 1 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
this company charge me a restocking fee and still not given me my refund back 0 
i love the look and feel of samsung flipphones 1 
this hole in the wall has great mexican street tacos and friendly staff 1 
a good time 1 
awful service 0 
i dont think well be going back anytime soon 0 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
i do not know if this was emilio estevezs directorial debut but the pacing the interplay and development of the characters as well as some clever camera work surrounding the character estevez plays all suggest a natural eye 1 
doesnt work at all i bougth it for my l7c and its not working 0 
its kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly its embarrassing how childlike the company is 0 
it was a riot to see hugo weaving play a sexobsessed gay real estate salesman who uses his clients houses for his trysts with the flaming darren tom hollander 1 
having trouble with volume 0 
it is zillion times away from reality 0 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
this movie is terrible 0 
the story is beyond stupid 0 
problem is that the ear loops are made of weak material and break easily 0 
an awesome new look for fall 2000 1 
they brought a fresh batch of fries and i was thinking yay something warm but no 0 
plus its only 8 bucks 1 
reaching for the bottom row is uncomfortable and the send and end keys are not where i expect them to be3 0 
it is worth the drive 1 
i do love sushi but i found kabuki to be overpriced overhip and underservices 0 
it is simple to use and i like it 1 
i bought two of them and neither will charge 0 
very pleased with this headset 1 
nice docking station for home or work 1 
it is rare when a filmmaker takes the time to tell a worthy moral tale with care and love that doesnt fall into the trap of being overly syrupy or over indulgent 1 
very bad performance plays angela bennett a computer expert who is at home all the time 0 
i have tried these cables with my computer and my ipod and it works just fine 1 
your brain will attempt to shutdown as part of a primal impulse of selfpreservation 0 
i also decided not to send it back because our waitress looked like she was on the verge of having a heart attack 0 
do not waste your money here 0 
also the fries are without a doubt the worst fries ive ever had 0 
i like the fact that it rests lightly against your ear rather than inside 1 
for the price this was a great deal 1 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
the veggitarian platter is out of this world 1 
as a courtroom drama its compelling as an indictment on the american justice system its frightening 1 
and it was boring 0 
at first glance it is a lovely bakery cafe nice ambiance clean friendly staff 1 
the phone takes forever to charge like 2 to 5 hours literally 0 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
defective crap 0 
the awful dialogue and hopeless overacting by everyone who gets shot top off a real waste of space and time 0 
this blueant supertooth handsfree phone speaker is awesome 1 
not worth it 0 
mediocre food 0 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
the phone loads super 1 
i thought it was bad 0 
great character actors telly savalas and peter boyle 1 
there is no plot or storyline 0 
who in their right mind is gonna buy this battery 0 
very pleased with this headset 1 
it always cuts out and makes a beep beep beep sound then says signal failed 0 
the cow tongue and cheek tacos are amazing 1 
who in their right mind is gonna buy this battery 0 
im not eating here 0 
the two main characters may be two of the most believable children i ever saw put on screen 1 
this is definitely one of the better documentaries i have seen looking at family relationships and marriage 1 
these are certainly very comfortable and functionality is decent 1 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
for service i give them no stars 0 
i thought it was bad 0 
i got home to see the driest damn wings ever 0 
unfortunately this is a bad movie that is just plain bad 0 
i love the ownerchef his one authentic japanese cool dude 1 
you wont be disappointed 1 
this is an excellent tool especially when paired with your phones autoanswer 1 
sucked most of the stuff does not work with my phone 0 
im really disappointed all i have now is a charger that doesnt work 0 
dont buy this product 0 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
the warm beer didnt help 0 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
i will be back many times soon 1 
as for the mains also uninspired 0 
rip off over charge shipping 0 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
the hockey scenes are terrible defensemen playing like theyre 5 years old goalies diving at shots that are 10 feet wide of the net etc 0 
the price is reasonable and the service is great 1 
a good film by a great director 1 
unfortunately it did not work 0 
works great 1 
this may be the only bad film he ever made 0 
chinese forgeries abound 0 
this isnt a small family restaurant this is a fine dining establishment 1 
i would have casted her in that role after ready the script 1 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
great food and awesome service 1 
i highly recommend this modest priced cellular phone 1 
it is rare when a filmmaker takes the time to tell a worthy moral tale with care and love that doesnt fall into the trap of being overly syrupy or over indulgent 1 
price is good too 1 
waitress was a little slow in service 0 
this is a beautiful phone 1 
think it over when you plan to own this onethis sure is the last moto phone for me 0 
i must say i have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again 1 
they will customize your order any way youd like my usual is eggplant with green bean stir fry love it 1 
the food was barely lukewarm so it must have been sitting waiting for the server to bring it out to us 0 
i will not return 0 
back to good bbq lighter fare reasonable pricing and tell the public they are back to the old ways 1 
there are many continuity errors one other user commented on different cars in the garage joes glassesthe one that got to me the most was the fact joes facial hair configuration seemed to change from scene to scene 0 
eclectic selection 1 
phone falls out easily 0 
the film gives meaning to the phrase never in the history of human conflict has so much been owed by so many to so few 1 
the acting as youd expect from this cast is top notch 1 
the bottowm lineanother worthless cheap gimmick from sprint 0 
each day of the week they have a different deal and its all so delicious 1 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
coming here is like experiencing an underwhelming relationship where both parties cant wait for the other person to ask to break up 0 
and i really did find them funny 1 
lots of holes in the script 0 
this greedy corporation will never see another dime from me 0 
the company shipped my product very promptly and it works well 1 
brilliance indeed 1 
absolutely great 1 
i dont have to be an accountant to know im getting screwed 0 
it was so bad i had lost the heart to finish it 0 
yeah the movie pretty much sucked 0 
overall i would recommend this phone over the new walkman 1 
jawbone era is awesome too 1 
it rocked my world and is certainly a must see for anyone with no social or physical outlets 1 
it was also the right balance of war and love 1 
gets a signal when other verizon phones wont 1 
im not sure what he was trying to do with this film 0 
they really want to make your experience a good one 1 
these are certainly very comfortable and functionality is decent 1 
unfortunately cover girl is an example of how hollywood used to exploit women for financial gain 0 
the buttons for on and off are bad 0 
great product for the price 1 
host staff were for lack of a better word bitches 0 
not much seafood and like 5 strings of pasta at the bottom 0 
this is a great restaurant at the mandalay bay 1 
also difficult to put onid recommend avoiding this product 0 
much more interesting more action more suspense and less of the unneeded controversy 1 
great phone 1 
after charging overnight these batteries work great 1 
they could be used as exemplars for any set designer 1 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
if you love authentic mexican food and want a whole bunch of interesting yet delicious meats to choose from you need to try this place 1 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
if you love death and decay and shakespears lyrics this is the one 1 
but even the talented carrell cant save this 0 
im not sure what he was trying to do with this film 0 
their steaks are 100 recommended 1 
tried to go here for lunch and it was a madhouse 0 
this is the place where i first had pho and it was amazing 1 
i will continue to come here on ladies night andddd date night highly recommend this place to anyone who is in the area 1 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
in other words the content level of this film is enough to easily fill a dozen other films 1 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
that was nice 1 
the steak and the shrimp are in my opinion the best entrees at gc 1 
i must say i have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again 1 
the acting sucked 0 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
very very disappointed ordered the 35 big bay plater 0 
the instructions didnt explain that a microphone jack could be used 0 
everything about this product is wrongfirst 0 
highly unrecommended 0 
it was a riot to see hugo weaving play a sexobsessed gay real estate salesman who uses his clients houses for his trysts with the flaming darren tom hollander 1 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
service is friendly and inviting 1 
disappointed 0 
i consider this theft 0 
its a piece of crap 0 
i think the most wonderful parts literally full of wonder are the excerpts from his works 1 
will go back next trip out 1 
the dialogue sucked 0 
the live music on fridays totally blows 0 
excellent product for the price 1 
nice leather 1 
you can find better movies at youtube 0 
so i had to take the battery out of the phone put it all back together and then restart it 0 
not good for the money 0 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
i found this place by accident and i could not be happier 1 
but when i check voice mail at night the keypad backlight turns off a few seconds into the first message and then im lost 0 
the steak and the shrimp are in my opinion the best entrees at gc 1 
does not fit 0 
but above all the exquisite visual composition of each moment with inventive and elegant use of closeup camera angle and lighting including pointillistic faux home movie footage is a wonder and joy to behold 1 
it was equally awful 0 
the ending is so so perfect youll shed a tear 1 
this is a really fantastic thai restaurant which is definitely worth a visit 1 
blue ant is easy to use 1 
it was not good 0 
you learn a lot about the real inside emotions of people in this movie and a lot about the movie business itself 1 
in fact i liked it better than interview with a vampire and i liked this lestat stuart townsend better than cruises attempt 1 
i never come again 0 
this movie is so awesome 1 
i believe that pitch black was done well 1 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
delicious and i will absolutely be back 1 
truly awful 0 
although i very much liked the look and sound of this place the actual experience was a bit disappointing 0 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic 1 
about 30 minutes of footage is wasted to show mediocre elderly actors awkwardly babbling overwrought pseudosatanic gibberish corny enough to make a teen goth blush almost always in olde english and sometimes in latin that may or may not be made up words 0 
nice ambiance 1 
it feels poorly constructed the menus are difficult to navigate and the buttons are so recessed that it is difficult to push them 0 
it presents a idyllic yet serious portrayal of the ups and downs of the characters lives 1 
also notable is john baileys fine crisp beautifully colored cinematography and the great production design costumes by eiko ishioka who went on to do the memorable costumes for coppolas dracula for which she received a well deserved oscar 1 
it really created a unique feeling though 1 
even if you love bad movies do not watch this movie 0 
those burgers were amazing 1 
i wont be back 0 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
i have only had it for a few weeks but so far so good 1 
the design might be ergonomic in theory but i could not stand having these in my ear 0 
considering the relations off screen between taylor and stanwyck it was surprising how little chemistry there was on screen between the two of them 0 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
worst customer service 0 
i have bought this nokia cell phone a few weeks ago and it was a nightmare 0 
it looses connection to the phone even when it is within a couple feet between the two 0 
my girlfriends veal was very bad 0 
it is worth the drive 1 
now the pizza itself was good the peanut sauce was very tasty 1 
i go to far too many places and ive never seen any restaurant that serves a 1 egg breakfast especially for 400 0 
dont waste your time here 0 
the first thing that happened was that the tracking was off 0 
will not be back 0 
service was exceptional and food was a good as all the reviews 1 
then our food came out disappointment ensued 0 
the best part about nurse betty is its unpredictability 1 
terrible service 0 
the microphone also works well but according to people i have called it applifies everything 1 
classywarm atmosphere fun and fresh appetizers succulent steaks baseball steak 1 
the service here is fair at best 0 
i probably would not go here again 0 
very unreliable service from tmobile 0 
i have only had it for a few weeks but so far so good 1 
i guess i liked the details of his dysfunctionhe was believable 1 
useless phone simply deaf 0 
i advise everyone do not be fooled 0 
works great 1 
the only thing that i think could improve is the sound leaks out from the headset 0 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
a standout scene 1 
everything was perfect the night we were in 1 
highquality chicken on the chicken caesar salad 1 
a world better than 95 of the garbage in the theatres today 1 
steve martin delivers a really funny performance of a middleaged upper class uptight white guy 1 
i was mortified 0 
their onscreen chemistry critical to the entire film is genuine 1 
i do think tom hanks is a good actor 1 
after a year the battery went completely dead on my headset 0 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
the script is bad very bad  it contains both cheesiness and unethical joke that you normally see in rated r or nc17 movie 0 
this is just a great movie 1 
i want my money back 0 
warning stay away 0 
this is definitely a cult classic well worth viewing and sharing with others 1 
the selection of food was not the best 0 
ordered burger rare came in well done 0 
this would not even be good as a made for tv flick 0 
a drive thru means you do not want to wait around for half an hour for your food but somehow when we end up going here they make us wait and wait 0 
this is a great deal 1 
they have been around for years and carries the highest quality of antiglare screen protector that i have found to date 1 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
its fits like a glove and is strong secure and durable 1 
service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is vegas and located inside the crystals shopping mall by aria 1 
it was probably dirt 0 
lastly the mozzarella sticks they were the best thing we ordered 1 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
do not purchase this phone 0 
you cant relate with them hell you barely can understand them 0 
one of the worst shows of all time 0 
id like to return it 0 
we ordered some old classics and some new dishes after going there a few times and were sorely disappointed with everything 0 
the ri style calamari was a joke 0 
do not waste your money here 0 
very very sad 0 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
worthwhile 1 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
the service was terrible food was mediocre 0 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
he also came back to check on us regularly excellent service 1 
bad fit way too big 0 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
the design might be ergonomic in theory but i could not stand having these in my ear 0 
i dont understand how this garbage got on the shelves of the movie store its not even a real movie 0 
item arrived quickly and works great with my metro pcs samsung schr450 slider phone and sony premium sound in ear plugs 1 
at first glance it is a lovely bakery cafe nice ambiance clean friendly staff 1 
each day of the week they have a different deal and its all so delicious 1 
which are small and not worth the price 0 
as for the service i thought it was good 1 
performed awful muffled tinny incoming sound and severe echo for those on the other end of the call 0 
there were several moments in the movie that just didnt need to be there and were excruciatingly slow moving 0 
ive bought 5 wired headphones that sound better than these 0 
it rocked my world and is certainly a must see for anyone with no social or physical outlets 1 
the ambiance isnt much better 0 
why are these sad little vegetables so overcooked 0 
i kept catching the cable on the seat and i had to pull the phone out to turn it on an off 0 
ill be looking for a new earpiece 0 
superb phone on a great network 1 
i dont know what the big deal is about this place but i wont be back yaall 0 
so far so good 1 
no real improvement 0 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
we got sitting fairly fast but ended up waiting 40 minutes just to place our order another 30 minutes before the food arrived 0 
i love being able to use one headset for both by landline and cell 1 
they have horrible attitudes towards customers and talk down to each one when customers dont enjoy their food 0 
this product is clearly not ready for prime time i dont care how cool it looks if you cant tell a call is coming in its worthless 0 
the worst experience ever 0 
their chow mein is so good 1 
my friend loved the salmon tartar 1 
i dont understand how this garbage got on the shelves of the movie store its not even a real movie 0 
ive also had problems with the phone reading the memory card in which i always turn it on and then off again 0 
its so stupid to have to keep buying new chargers car chargers cradles headphones and car kits every time a new phone comes out 0 
the cow tongue and cheek tacos are amazing 1 
i have to jiggle the plug to get it to line up right to get decent volume 0 
small sleek impressive looking practical setup with ample storage in place 1 
this company charge me a restocking fee and still not given me my refund back 0 
garbo who showed right off the bat that her talents could carry over from the silent era i wanted to see some of her silent work but netflix doesnt seem to be stocking them 1 
couldnt use the unit with sunglasses not good in texas 0 
very bad experience 0 
all in all i can assure you ill be back 1 
there was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters 0 
the scenes are often funny and occasionally touching as the characters evaluate their lives and where they are going 1 
service is quick and even to go orders are just like we like it 1 
unfortunately it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees 0 
i wasnt really impressed with strip steak 0 
only pros large seating area nice bar area great simple drink menu the best brick oven pizza with homemade dough 1 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
never been to hard rock casino before will never ever step forward in it again 0 
their daily specials are always a hit with my group 1 
great audio 1 
cant say enough good things about this place 1 
seriously its not worth wasting your or your kids time on 0 
this place is pretty good nice little vibe in the restaurant 1 
very very sad 0 
im very disappointed with my decision 0 
its a great tool for entertainment communication and data managementoh be sure to use activesync 42 for optimal data synchronization results 1 
they have great dinners 1 
at first i thought i was grtting a good deal at 744 until i plugged it into my phone v3c razr 0 
i gave it a 10 1 
no real improvement 0 
i great reception all the time 1 
now we were chosen to be tortured with this disgusting piece of blatant american propaganda 0 
it was a good thing that the tickets only cost five dollars because i would be mad if id have paid 750 to see this crap 0 
i thought it was bad 0 
my boyfriend and i came here for the first time on a recent trip to vegas and could not have been more pleased with the quality of food and service 1 
then as if i hadnt wasted enough of my life there they poured salt in the wound by drawing out the time it took to bring the check 0 
there still are good actors around 1 
worst customer service ever 0 
down the drain because of a weak snap 0 
it was way over fried 0 
however after about a year the fliptop started to get loose and wobbly and eventually my screen went black and i couldnt receive and place calls 0 
very cheap plastic creaks like an old wooden floor 0 
unfortunately the ability to actually know you are receiving a call is a rather important feature and this phone is pitiful in that respect 0
