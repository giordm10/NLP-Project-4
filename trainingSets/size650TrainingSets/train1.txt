the sound is clear and the people i talk to on it are amazed at the quality too 1 
it fits so securely that the ear hook does not even need to be used and the sound is better directed through your ear canal 1 
overall a great experience 1 
all in all i think it was a good investment 1 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
fans of the genre will be in heaven 1 
i love this device 1 
a good film by a great director 1 
my boyfriend and i came here for the first time on a recent trip to vegas and could not have been more pleased with the quality of food and service 1 
awful 0 
the kids are very cool too 1 
if you want a real scare rent this one 1 
the whole experience was underwhelming and i think well just go to ninja sushi next time 0 
soggy and not good 0 
what should have been a hilarious yummy christmas eve dinner to remember was the biggest fail of the entire trip for us 0 
works great 1 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
what on earth is irons doing in this film 0 
it is practically useless and did not add any kind of boost to my reception after i bought it 0 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
the restaurant is very clean and has a family restaurant feel to it 1 
on the up side their cafe serves really good food 1 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
after the first charge kept going dead after 12 minutes 0 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
our server was super nice and checked on us many times 1 
its a sad movie but very good 1 
no plot whatsoever 0 
about ten minutes into this film i started having second thoughts 0 
the management is rude 0 
ive had no trouble accessing the internet downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions 1 
i bought this battery with a coupon from amazon and im very happy with my purchase 1 
very good though 1 
i really dont see how anyone could enjoy this movie 0 
bought mainly for the charger which broke soon after purchasing 0 
i probably would not go here again 0 
the waiter wasnt helpful or friendly and rarely checked on us 0 
this is probably the most irritating show i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
but this movie really got to me 1 
this is a witty and delightful adaptation of the dr seuss book brilliantly animated by upas finest and thoroughly deserving of its academy award 1 
im big fan of rpg games too but this movie its a disgrace to any selfrespecting rpger there is 0 
the writers were smack on and i think the best actors and actresses were a bonus to the showthese characters were so real 1 
this item is fantastic and works perfectly 1 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
aside from its terrible lead this film has loads of other debits 0 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
i even dropped this phone into a stream and it was submerged for 15 seconds and it still works great 1 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
the only good thing was that it fits comfortably on small ears 1 
i guess i should have known that this place would suck because it is inside of the excalibur but i didnt use my common sense 0 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
price is good too 1 
that said our mouths and bellies were still quite pleased 1 
im glad i found this product on amazon it is hard to find it wasnt high priced 1 
this is an extraordinary film 1 
i wish i could return the unit and get back my money 0 
so flavorful and has just the perfect amount of heat 1 
it was too predictable even for a chick flick 0 
the charger worked for about a week and then completely stopped charging my phone 0 
insults profound deuchebaggery and had to go outside for a smoke break while serving just to solidify it 0 
owners are really great people 1 
every time he opened his mouth you expect to hear you see kids pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show 0 
leopard print is wonderfully wild 1 
it was so funny 1 
but it does get better reception and clarity than any phone ive had before 1 
it is a true classic 1 
i love this bluetooth 1 
1 long lasting battery you dont have to recharge it as frequentyly as some of the flip phones2 0 
i was very disappointed in the movie 0 
product was excellent and works better than the verizon one and boy was it cheaper 1 
it had some average acting from the main person and it was a low budget as you clearly can see 0 
this place is not quality sushi it is not a quality restaurant 0 
i have tried these cables with my computer and my ipod and it works just fine 1 
the entire audience applauded at the conclusion of the film 1 
damian is so talented and versatile in so many ways of writing and portraying different characters on screen 1 
good product incredible value 1 
i seriously cannot believe that the owner has so many unexperienced employees that all are running around like chickens with their heads cut off 0 
also its slim enough to fit into my alarm clock docking station without removing the case 1 
battery life is real good 1 
they have horrible attitudes towards customers and talk down to each one when customers dont enjoy their food 0 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
for that its worth checking out 1 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
this one is simply a disappointment 0 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
if you do watch it however there are small consolations the actresses playing annes sisters each do a wonderful job with their roles 1 
you can find better movies at youtube 0 
the memories are murky but i can only say that i enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show 1 
often the dialogue doesnt really follow from one line to another or fit the surroundings 0 
yes this film does require a rather significant amount of puzzlesolving but the pieces fit together to create a beautiful picture 1 
seriously its not worth wasting your or your kids time on 0 
the movie had you on the edge of your seat and made you somewhat afraid to go to your car at the end of the night 1 
i really do recommend this place you can go wrong with this donut place 1 
the acting is like watching wooden puppets moving around and reading from a book thats how bad it is 0 
this place is way too overpriced for mediocre food 0 
i guess i liked the details of his dysfunctionhe was believable 1 
cumbersome design 0 
this totally unfunny movie is so over the top and pathetic and unrealistic that throughout the whole 90 minutes of utter torture i probably looked at my watch about 70000 times 0 
great phone 1 
this place is good 1 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
useless phone simply deaf 0 
never going back 0 
i had to go to a store and bought a new nokia phone which is working great 1 
but i dont like it 0 
the turkey and roast beef were bland 0 
one more thing i can tolerate political incorrectness very well im all for artistic freedom and suspension of disbelief but the slavic female character was just too much 0 
how can anyone in their right mind ask for anything more from a movie than this 1 
when a song could explain the emotions of the subjects better such as when jay adams unfortunate life was a subject of talk the song old man by neil young was played which evokes many emotions 1 
the acting sucks the music sucks the script sucks the pacing sucks the special fx suck the directing sucks basically this movie sucks 0 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
i just saw this film and i recommend it 1 
regardless the film fails on most levels 0 
the movie was very interesting from beginning to the end 1 
i would have given no star if i was able 0 
if you want a real scare rent this one 1 
does not fit 0 
the pan cakes everyone are raving about taste like a sugary disaster tailored to the palate of a six year old 0 
maybe its just their vegetarian fare but ive been twice and i thought it was average at best 0 
i understand that its supposed to be a cheap popcorn comedy but that doesnt mean that it has to completely insult our intelligence and have writing so incredibly hackneyed that it borders on offensive 0 
the worst phone from samsungcrap this crappy samsung e715 is the worst i have ever seeen 0 
cute quaint simple honest 1 
secondly hitchcock pretty much perfected the thriller and chase movie 1 
at least think to refill my water before i struggle to wave you over for 10 minutes 0 
not much dialogue not much music the whole film was shot as elaborately and aesthetically like a sculpture 1 
great food and awesome service 1 
i hate writing bad reviews about films especially those in which i really like the star but this film is so bad i dont believe for one second that anyone could have been proud of it 0 
the burger i got the gold standard a 17 burger and was kind of disappointed 0 
it came free with a dvd player i bought but i still turned the thing off halfway through because i was embarrassed for howell 0 
in conclusion i will not bother with this movie because a volcano in los angeles is nothing but nonsense 0 
the movie is not completely perfect but titta di girolamo will stay with you for a long time after the vision of the movie 1 
when i opened the sandwich i was impressed but not in a good way 0 
third the cheese on my friends burger was cold 0 
we loved the biscuits 1 
also the area where my unit broke im not too fond of the magnetic strap 0 
i have had this phone for over a year now and i will tell you its not that great 0 
despite how hard i rate businesses its actually rare for me to give a 1 star 0 
very friendly staff 1 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
a great film by a great director 1 
i bought this phone as a replacement for my startac and have regretted it since 0 
the staff is friendly and the joint is always clean 1 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
very well made and fits my surefire gx2 perfectly 1 
we would recommend these to others 1 
host staff were for lack of a better word bitches 0 
this one is simply a disappointment 0 
other than that the leather is nice and soft the fit is very tight the cut out for the face is a good shape 1 
im glad i found this product on amazon it is hard to find it wasnt high priced 1 
still waiting im sure this item would work well if i ever recieve it 0 
a very good film indeed about great and unconditional love 1 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
i gave it 5 stars then and im giving it 5 stars now 1 
this one is simply a disappointment 0 
the chicken dishes are ok the beef is like shoe leather 0 
maybe its just their vegetarian fare but ive been twice and i thought it was average at best 0 
it sure does beat the nachos at the movies but i would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant 0 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
muddy low quality sound and the casing around the wires insert was poorly super glued and slid off 0 
product is useless since it does not have enough charging current to charge the 2 cellphones i was planning to use it with 0 
all in all i can assure you ill be back 1 
i highly recommend this movie for anyone interested in art poetry theater politics or japanese history 1 
the acting was decidely wooden though no worse than a period universal b movie 0 
its a total package 1 
do not buy if you want to use the holster 0 
i wish i could return the unit and get back my money 0 
interesting decor 1 
the fries were not hot and neither was my burger 0 
so they performed 1 
this review is long overdue since i consider a tale of two sisters to be the single greatest film ever made 1 
it was an inexpensive piece but i would still have expected better quality 0 
wont ever go here again 0 
theres barely a boring moment in the film and there are plenty of humorous parts 1 
great product fast shipping 1 
the art style has the appearance of crayonpencil drawings and is wonderfully colorful and fanciful 1 
i wear glasses and it fits fine with them 1 
so far so good 1 
the plastic breaks really easy on this clip 0 
having to humour him just to get by and get through the day was so apt 1 
the instructions didnt explain that a microphone jack could be used 0 
their research and development division obviously knows what theyre doing 1 
im not really sure how joeys was voted best hot dog in the valley by readers of phoenix magazine 0 
i promise they wont disappoint 1 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
amazon sucks 0 
here in the wind and the lion we see a wonderful rendering of americas own imperial age 1 
it was quite comfortable in the ear 1 
insults profound deuchebaggery and had to go outside for a smoke break while serving just to solidify it 0 
his performance is simply genius 1 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
the plot well i said id let that one go 0 
ive had this bluetoooth headset for some time now and still not comfortable with the way it fits on the ear 0 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
the seller is very understanding and patient i would definitely buy from them again 1 
this is an extraordinary film 1 
cinematography the film was shot in an interesting way 1 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
the acting is like watching wooden puppets moving around and reading from a book thats how bad it is 0 
dont buy this product 0 
the food was terrible 0 
it wasnt busy at all and now we know why 0 
the directing and the cinematography arent quite as good 0 
best of all is the rotating feature very helpful 1 
we wont be returning 0 
it was a huge awkward 15lb piece of cow that was 34ths gristle and fat 0 
not my thing 0 
one nice thing was that they added gratuity on the bill since our party was larger than 6 or 8 and they didnt expect more tip than that 1 
im super pissd 0 
pretty piece of junk 0 
the only thing that i think could improve is the sound leaks out from the headset 0 
you get incredibly fresh fish prepared with care 1 
it came free with a dvd player i bought but i still turned the thing off halfway through because i was embarrassed for howell 0 
seems like a good quick place to grab a bite of some familiar pub food but do yourself a favor and look elsewhere 0 
im probably one of the few people to ever go to ians and not like it 0 
the only very disappointing thing was there was no speakerphone 0 
the plot such as it is is so derivative and predictable that the ending is like a mercy killing 0 
great place fo take out or eat in 1 
the lines the cuts the audio everything is wrong 0 
jawbone era is awesome too 1 
dont make the same mistake i did 0 
i felt insulted and disrespected how could you talk and judge another human being like that 0 
also were served hot bread and butter and home made potato chips with bacon bits on topvery original and very good 1 
plug was the wrong size 0 
the chicken dishes are ok the beef is like shoe leather 0 
a must study for anyone interested in the worst sins of industrial design 0 
kris kristoffersen is good in this movie and really makes a difference 1 
has been working great 1 
all in all a great disappointment 0 
we waited for thirty minutes to be seated although there were 8 vacant tables and we were the only folks waiting 0 
would not recommend to others 0 
interesting decor 1 
i ate there twice on my last visit and especially enjoyed the salmon salad 1 
bt50 battery junk 0 
i am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this 1 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
ambience is perfect 1 
this is a good battery and it got here really fast 1 
good food good service 1 
it looks very nice 1 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
the movie is littered with overt racial slurs towards the black cast members and in return the whites are depicted as morons and boobs 0 
but when i check voice mail at night the keypad backlight turns off a few seconds into the first message and then im lost 0 
my sister has one also and she loves it 1 
ordered burger rare came in well done 0 
the soundtrack wasnt terrible either 1 
i am very impressed with the job that motorola did on the sturdiness of this phone 1 
wasted two hours 0 
the characters were all funny and had the peculiarity of not having a true lead character 1 
good product incredible value 1 
this is definitely one of the better documentaries i have seen looking at family relationships and marriage 1 
so absolutley fantastic 1 
even allowing for poor production values for the time 1971 and the format some kind of miniseries this is baaaaaad 0 
a lot of websites have been rating this a very good phone and so do i 1 
the cinematography is simply stunning to say the least and the fx are nothing if not stateoftheart 1 
very serious spoilers this movie was a huge disappointment 0 
reaching for the bottom row is uncomfortable and the send and end keys are not where i expect them to be3 0 
due to this happening on every call i was forced to stop using this headset 0 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
you get incredibly fresh fish prepared with care 1 
were jerks on the phone 0 
owners are really great people 1 
the battery is completely useless to me 0 
wow loved this place 1 
however after finally watching this film i realized that not only had i had a closed mind to the brilliance it depicts i also found myself watching it over and over again 1 
the lighting is just dark enough to set the mood 1 
extremely tasty 1 
definitely a bargain 1 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
very disappointed and wondered how it could be in the oscar shortlist 0 
plantronics bluetooth excelent buy 1 
there was hardly any meat 0 
not only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic but it also managed to give away the entire movie and im not exaggerating every moment every plot point every joke is told in the trailer 0 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
i would not recommend this place 0 
dont waste your money 0 
i cannot make calls at certain places 0 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
i would definitely recommend the jabra bt250v for those who are looking for comfort clarity and a great price 1 
woa talk about awful 0 
very satisifed with that 1 
not much dialogue not much music the whole film was shot as elaborately and aesthetically like a sculpture 1 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
it did not work in my cell phone plug i am very up set with the charger 0 
if she had not rolled the eyes we may have stayed not sure if we will go back and try it again 0 
you also cannot take pictures with it in the case because the lense is covered 0 
our server was super nice and checked on us many times 1 
the poor actors 0 
he is one of my favourite directors and one of the most talented directors in the history of cinema 1 
there was no chemistry between ben affleck and sandra bullock in this film and i couldnt understand why he would consider even leaving his wifetobe for this chick that he supposedly was knocked out by 0 
but she is still a bad actress repeating her robotic face moves in each of her pictures 0 
oh this is such a thing of beauty this restaurant 1 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
definitely worth checking out 1 
will not be back 0 
avoid at all cost 0 
this really is how vegas fine dining used to be right down to the menus handed to the ladies that have no prices listed 1 
earbud piece breaks easily 0 
i checked out this place a couple years ago and was not impressed 0 
the burger is good beef cooked just right 1 
the film is way too long 0 
1 hour 54 minutes of sheer tedium melodrama and horrible acting a mess of a script and a sinking feeling of good lord what were they thinking 0 
in conclusion i will not bother with this movie because a volcano in los angeles is nothing but nonsense 0 
this is an extraordinary film 1 
i love lane but ive never seen her in a movie this lousy 0 
my gyro was basically lettuce only 0 
best breakfast buffet 1 
i started this review with two stars but im editing it to give it only one 0 
it finds my cell phone right away when i enter the car 1 
it is an excellent drama an excellent thriller and an excellent film 1 
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1 
phone now holds charge like it did when it was new 1 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
this company charge me a restocking fee and still not given me my refund back 0 
i got to enjoy the seafood salad with a fabulous vinegrette 1 
fans of the genre will be in heaven 1 
awsome device works great 1 
it finds my cell phone right away when i enter the car 1 
terrible my car will not accept this cassette 0 
very clear quality sound and you dont have to mess with the sound on your ipod since you have the sound buttons on the headset 1 
new battery works great in phone 1 
theres also enough hypocrisy in this film to make me vomit 0 
i love lane but ive never seen her in a movie this lousy 0 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
this movie creates its own universe and is fascinating in every way 1 
bluetooth range is good a few days ago i left my phone in the trunk got a call and carried the conversation without a hitch 1 
having to humour him just to get by and get through the day was so apt 1 
headset works great was packaged nicely to avoid any damage 1 
really really good rice all the time 1 
bad script bad direction and horrible acting make this one plain bad 0 
the atmosphere was great with a lovely duo of violinists playing songs we requested 1 
but i thought his acting was skilled 1 
after two i felt disgusting 0 
and finally after all that we get to an ending that wouldve been great had it been handled by competent people and not jerry falwell 0 
great food and awesome service 1 
its hard not to fall headoverheels in love with that girl 1 
echo problemvery unsatisfactory 0 
it is a joy to use 1 
were jerks on the phone 0 
how this piece of trash was ever released is beyond me the acting the story the characters the supposedly special effects etcits all wrong 0 
and the sound quality is great 1 
special thanks to dylan t for the recommendation on what to order all yummy for my tummy 1 
this movie is also revealing 1 
this film offers many delights and surprises 1 
i am not a filmmaker nor am i a director but i would hide my head in the sand if id spent whatever amount of money and time on this movie 0 
it looks very nice 1 
speaking of the music it is unbearably predictably and kitchy 0 
lot of holes in the plot theres nothing about how he became the emperor nothing about where he spend 20 years between his childhood and mature age 0 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
i bought this phone as a replacement for my startac and have regretted it since 0 
when my order arrived one of the gyros was missing 0 
i highly recommend this movie for anyone interested in art poetry theater politics or japanese history 1 
for the price on amazon it is an excellent product which i would highly recommend 1 
lately they have been extremely nice and helpful on the phone 1 
the acting sucks the music sucks the script sucks the pacing sucks the special fx suck the directing sucks basically this movie sucks 0 
the staff are also very friendly and efficient 1 
amazon sucks 0 
to be honest with you this is unbelievable nonsense and very foolish 0 
unfortunately any virtue in this films production work was lost on a regrettable script 0 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
doesnt work 0 
the vegetables are so fresh and the sauce feels like authentic thai 1 
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
im super pissd 0 
they really want to make your experience a good one 1 
the waitress was friendly and happy to accomodate for veganveggie options 1 
this may be the only bad film he ever made 0 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
the first thing that happened was that the tracking was off 0 
the music in the film is really nice too 1 
i got the aluminum case for my new palm vx and it worked really wellit has protected my handheld perfectly so far 1 
this film offers many delights and surprises 1 
love it great armband 1 
design flaw 0 
i could barely stomach the meal but didnt complain because it was a business lunch 0 
very clear quality sound and you dont have to mess with the sound on your ipod since you have the sound buttons on the headset 1 
well im satisfied 1 
small sleek impressive looking practical setup with ample storage in place 1 
the owner used to work at nobu so this place is really similar for half the price 1 
the food is about on par with dennys which is to say not good at all 0 
save your money ive had this item for 11 months now 0 
i would have given no star if i was able 0 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
then i exchanged for the same phone even that had the same problem 0 
this movie is excellentangel is beautiful and scamp is adorablehis little yelps when hes scaredand the funniest parts are whenscamp is caught under the curtain and when angel and scamp are singing ive never had this feeling beforei totally recommend this movieits coming out on special edition on june 20the cover has scamp on a garbage can and angel underneath the lid 1 
great pocket pc phone combination 1 
what is even more stupid is that who had thought an idea that there should be a volcano in los angeles 0 
not recommended 0 
the service was terrible though 0 
awful service 0 
barney is definitely super de duper 1 
as an earlier review noted plug in this charger and nothing happens 0 
the turkey and roast beef were bland 0 
my breakfast was perpared great with a beautiful presentation of 3 giant slices of toast lightly dusted with powdered sugar 1 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
kind of hard to mess up a steak but they did 0 
no plot whatsoever 0 
overall i am psyched to have a phone which has all my appointments and contacts in and gets great reception 1 
it was packed 0 
there is a brilliant twist ending 1 
the crêpe was delicate and thin and moist 1 
editing the editing of this film was phenomenal in my opinion 1 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
great price also 1 
if you want a sandwich just go to any firehouse 1 
first of all there are enough racial stereotypes and racial jokes to offend everyone 0 
the ri style calamari was a joke 0 
poorly contstruct hinge 0 
i would not recommend this place 0 
it has everything i need and i couldnt ask for more 1 
the plot well i said id let that one go 0 
the staff was very attentive 1 
battery is terrible 0 
i will not be eating there again 0 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
excellent service 1 
whatever the producer was going for he missed entirely 0 
jamie foxx absolutely is ray charles 1 
appears to actually outperform the original battery from china that came with my v325i 1 
i never walked out of a movie faster 0 
the scenery that the two daughters paint and photograph are beautiful 1 
a piece of junk that broke after being on my phone for 2 days 0 
often the dialogue doesnt really follow from one line to another or fit the surroundings 0 
avoid at all cost 0 
gets a signal when other verizon phones wont 1 
poor quality and service 0 
i had the mac salad and it was pretty bland so i will not be getting that again 0 
this scene is very strong and unpleasant 0 
it is an insane game 1 
they do not care about the consumer one bit 0 
overall i like this place a lot 1 
cant say enough good things about this place 1 
voice quality signal strength dropped calls 0 
very bad experience 0 
5 stars for the brick oven bread app 1 
i had absolutely no problem with this headset linking to my 8530 blackberry curve 1 
plus its only 8 bucks 1 
so dont go there if you are looking for good food 0 
when my order arrived one of the gyros was missing 0 
the success of the film depends on the casting of sydney greenstreet as the alexander yardley character 1 
wed definitely go back here again 1 
echo problemvery unsatisfactory 0 
about ten minutes into this film i started having second thoughts 0 
the cocktails are all handmade and delicious 1 
definitely worth checking out 1 
a truly truly bad film 0 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
still waiting im sure this item would work well if i ever recieve it 0 
we walked away stuffed and happy about our first vegas buffet experience 1 
its one of the movies i need to see whenever it comes on tvnever mind the fact that i already have it memorized 1 
bad reception 0 
improper description i had to return it 0 
too bad you have to pay up to a month for the service 0 
the bathrooms are clean and the place itself is well decorated 1 
definitely a bargain 1 
con spotty service 0 
this movie contained an allstar cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i havent seen before 1 
dont waste your on this one 0 
for people who are first timers in film making i think they did an excellent job 1 
you could only take 2 videos at a time and the quality was very poor 0 
the instruction manual is lacking 0 
too bad cause i know its family owned i really wanted to like this place 0 
they made this case too small and is very difficult to install 0 
it was a great phone 1 
dont waste your money 0 
editing the editing of this film was phenomenal in my opinion 1 
after watching this film i wanted to learn more about the works of this artist 1 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
this scene is very strong and unpleasant 0 
i was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar not only because the quality is great but the service is fast and the food impeccable 1 
victor mclaglen was even bad and brian donlevy was almost unrecognizable 0 
nevertheless yet another wonderful film from the great masters stable 1 
they have a plethora of salads and sandwiches and everything ive tried gets my seal of approval 1 
i am not a filmmaker nor am i a director but i would hide my head in the sand if id spent whatever amount of money and time on this movie 0 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
exactly what i wanted 1 
its a case of so bad it is laughable 0 
you can find better movies at youtube 0 
the chicken i got was definitely reheated and was only ok the wedges were cold and soggy 0 
i went on motorolas website and followed all directions but could not get it to pair again 0 
camera color balance is awful 0 
the structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema 1 
i didnt know pulled pork could be soooo delicious 1 
gotta love those closeups of slimy drooling teeth 1 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
you wont be disappointed 1 
the han nan chicken was also very tasty 1 
i would recommend saving room for this 1 
if there were zero stars i would give it zero stars 0 
instead we got a bore fest about a whiny spoiled brat babysitting 0 
very friendly staff 1 
what a big waste of time 0 
frozen pucks of disgust with some of the worst people behind the register 0 
ray charles is legendary 1 
i have eaten here multiple times and each time the food was delicious 1 
not good enough for the price 0 
what should have been a hilarious yummy christmas eve dinner to remember was the biggest fail of the entire trip for us 0 
the attention given to every character and complex psychological portrayals detailing loyalty treachery love and hope are tremendous 1 
the mic there is a joke and the volume is quite low 0 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
the food is not tasty at all not to say its real traditional hunan style 0 
very serious spoilers this movie was a huge disappointment 0 
but in any case the best part is you can download these pictures to your laptop using ir or even send pictures from your laptop to the phone 1 
thank you for such great service 1 
their onscreen chemistry critical to the entire film is genuine 1 
disappointing 0 
food is way overpriced and portions are fucking small 0 
i want my money back 0 
speaking of the music it is unbearably predictably and kitchy 0 
it was so boring 0 
dont waste your time 0 
the cast is always entertaining as usual 1 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
and those baby owls were adorable 1 
this if the first movie ive given a 10 to in years 1 
if you do watch it however there are small consolations the actresses playing annes sisters each do a wonderful job with their roles 1 
and those baby owls were adorable 1 
it also had a new problem 0 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
the football scenes at the end were perplexing 0 
the hockey scenes are terrible defensemen playing like theyre 5 years old goalies diving at shots that are 10 feet wide of the net etc 0 
arrived quickly and much less expensive than others being sold 1 
customer service was terrible 0 
lots of holes in the script 0 
how can anyone in their right mind ask for anything more from a movie than this 1 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
the camera on the phone may be used as a dustpan when indoors id rather be using a disposable then this 0 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
his performance as awarded was stunning 1 
now this is a movie i really dislike 0 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
its very slow 0 
the story is beyond stupid 0 
the movie is littered with overt racial slurs towards the black cast members and in return the whites are depicted as morons and boobs 0 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
i wont spoil it but the ending in pretty amazing 1 
all in all a great disappointment 0 
you need at least 3 mins to get to your phone book from the time you first turn on the phonebattery life is short 0 
check it out 1 
someone shouldve invented this sooner 1 
avoid at all cost 0 
highquality chicken on the chicken caesar salad 1 
this is probably one of the least effective and utterly unoriginal films i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
after i pulled up my car i waited for another 15 minutes before being acknowledged 0 
i connected my wifes bluetoothmotorola hs850 to my phone and it worked like a charm whether the phone was in my pocket or the case 1 
the attempts at humor were pitiful and story is so awful it dosent bear thinking about which basically involves a vulcan stealing the enterprise to find god seriously i just didnt care about any of this film and oh not to mention uhura does a belly dance to distract male guards 0 
his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic 1 
not good for the money 0 
avoid this one if you can 0 
we have tried 2 units and they both failed within 2 months pros 0 
from here on the widmark character turns unintentionally comical 0 
very displeased 0 
well im satisfied 1 
there was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters 0 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
the plantains were the worst ive ever tasted 0 
essentially you can forget microsofts tech support 0 
what a disappointment 0 
this is the place where i first had pho and it was amazing 1 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
pretty awesome place 1 
low quality 0 
lastly the mozzarella sticks they were the best thing we ordered 1 
really awful 0 
it was absolutely amazing 1 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
other than that the leather is nice and soft the fit is very tight the cut out for the face is a good shape 1 
i like the fact that it rests lightly against your ear rather than inside 1 
great brunch spot 1 
it didnt work people can not hear me when i talk 0 
ive had no trouble accessing the internet downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions 1 
you get extra minutes so that you can carry out the call and not get cut off 1 
on the up side their cafe serves really good food 1 
the pleather case doesnt fit 0 
the kids are annoying 0 
also if your phone is dropped this case is not going to save it specially when dropped face down 0 
i advise you to look out for it 1 
fans of the genre will be in heaven 1 
theres barely a boring moment in the film and there are plenty of humorous parts 1 
worse theres an incredibly weak subplot thrown in that follows a little band of latterday mansonites as they go after a reporter whos working on a story on the anniversary of the killings 0 
we have tried 2 units and they both failed within 2 months pros 0 
some applause should be given to the prelude however 1 
bluetooth range is good a few days ago i left my phone in the trunk got a call and carried the conversation without a hitch 1 
my order was not correct 0 
i came over from verizon because cingulair has nicer cell phones the first thing i noticed was the really bad service 0 
i will be back many times soon 1 
this one wants to surf on the small wave of space movies in 1998 deep impact and armageddon and this one fails everywhere 0 
this was my first and only vegas buffet and it did not disappoint 1 
nine out of ten for a truly lovely film 1 
loved itfriendly servers great food wonderful and imaginative menu 1 
great brunch spot 1 
the camera really likes her in this movie 1 
i was so insulted 0 
the owner used to work at nobu so this place is really similar for half the price 1 
very disappointing 0 
by the time the film ended i not only disliked it i despised it 0 
very windresistant 1 
do not waste your money here 0 
insults profound deuchebaggery and had to go outside for a smoke break while serving just to solidify it 0 
will definitely be back 1 
brilliance indeed 1 
works great 1 
this place should honestly be blown up 0 
i dont have to be an accountant to know im getting screwed 0 
walked in and the place smelled like an old grease trap and only 2 others there eating 0 
the dialogue sucked 0 
i never come again 0 
the earpiece on this is too large or too heavyit keeps falling out of my ear 0 
the food was outstanding and the prices were very reasonable 1 
avoid at all cost 0 
so far it has worked like a charm 1 
i would not recommend this place 0 
do not waste your money here 0 
like the other reviewer said you couldnt pay me to eat at this place again 0 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
i am pairing this with my iphone and i could not be happier with it so far 1 
it didnt charge for me 0 
dont waste your money 0 
avoid this one if you can 0 
service was good and the company was better 1 
it was way over fried 0 
clever and a real crowdpleaserthis film still ranks among mickeys best films even after 80 wonderful years 1 
this one works and was priced right 1 
its a long time since i was so entertained by a movie 1 
the pancake was also really good and pretty large at that 1 
the sets especially designed to work with the camera are amazingstylized beautiful and effective 1 
they have horrible attitudes towards customers and talk down to each one when customers dont enjoy their food 0 
this review is long overdue since i consider a tale of two sisters to be the single greatest film ever made 1 
this is an excellent tool especially when paired with your phones autoanswer 1 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
when i received my pita it was huge it did have a lot of meat in it so thumbs up there 1 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
nothing new there 0 
editing the editing of this film was phenomenal in my opinion 1 
i know he was a contract player with little control over his scripts but the acting was as bad as the script 0 
i wasnt really impressed with strip steak 0 
my ribeye steak was cooked perfectly and had great mesquite flavor 1 
but whatever it was that cost them so much it didnt translate to quality thats for sure 0 
i let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this bad idea we both hated it 0 
i tried the cape cod ravoli chickenwith cranberrymmmm 1 
now imagine that every single one of those decisions was made wrong 0 
the aerial scenes were welldone 1 
now this is a movie i really dislike 0 
seems like a good quick place to grab a bite of some familiar pub food but do yourself a favor and look elsewhere 0 
same evening him and i are both drastically sick 0
