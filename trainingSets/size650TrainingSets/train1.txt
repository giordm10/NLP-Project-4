its still wild stuff though and is highly recommended to fans of giallo cinema 1 
great food and awesome service 1 
the black eyed peas and sweet potatoes unreal 1 
the only good thing was that it fits comfortably on small ears 1 
due to this happening on every call i was forced to stop using this headset 0 
do not make the same mistake as me 0 
drinks took close to 30 minutes to come out at one point 0 
excellent product for the price 1 
how can anyone in their right mind ask for anything more from a movie than this 1 
this place deserves no stars 0 
i checked out this place a couple years ago and was not impressed 0 
damn good steak 1 
this results in the phone being either stuck at max volume or mute 0 
we watched our waiter pay a lot more attention to other tables and ignore us 0 
bad characters bad story and bad acting 0 
it was a huge awkward 15lb piece of cow that was 34ths gristle and fat 0 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
these are fabulous 1 
cute quaint simple honest 1 
and it was boring 0 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
ive never been treated so bad 0 
there were several moments in the movie that just didnt need to be there and were excruciatingly slow moving 0 
i was able to do voice dialing in the car with no problem 1 
this is the first phone ive had that has been so cheaply made 0 
i tried the cape cod ravoli chickenwith cranberrymmmm 1 
down the drain because of a weak snap 0 
everything was fresh and delicious 1 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
you need at least 3 mins to get to your phone book from the time you first turn on the phonebattery life is short 0 
very dissapointing performance 0 
this item is great installed it let it charged up overnite and it has been working good every since with no problems 1 
nine out of ten for a truly lovely film 1 
the ambience is wonderful and there is music playing 1 
its worth driving up from tucson 1 
the design might be ergonomic in theory but i could not stand having these in my ear 0 
cant say enough good things about this place 1 
it didnt make me scared horrified or make me sympathetic towards the characters it was simply annoying 0 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
we waited for thirty minutes to be seated although there were 8 vacant tables and we were the only folks waiting 0 
the characters were all funny and had the peculiarity of not having a true lead character 1 
you cant beat the price on these 1 
first time there and might just be the last 0 
we made the drive all the way from north scottsdale and i was not one bit disappointed 1 
the point is the journey a journey that touches every member of the family 1 
i keep watching it over and over 1 
horrible phone 0 
after charging overnight these batteries work great 1 
we enjoy their pizza and brunch 1 
awsome device works great 1 
though the wind and the lion is told largely through the eyes of the son every member of the family can identify with one of the characters whether it be sean connerys noble brigand candace bergens feisty heroine john hustons wily john hay or steve kanalys spiffy radiant ruthless cando lieutenant roosevelts big stick 1 
the food is very good for your typical bar food 1 
buttons are too small 0 
the waiter wasnt helpful or friendly and rarely checked on us 0 
pretty good beer selection too 1 
the only very disappointing thing was there was no speakerphone 0 
this is a very average phone with bad battery life that operates on a weak network 0 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
long whiny and pointless 0 
pricing is a bit of a concern at mellow mushroom 0 
the building itself seems pretty neat the bathroom is pretty trippy but i wouldnt eat here again 0 
best of luck to the rude and noncustomer service focused new management 0 
lucy bell is so much higher than this crap and for her to sink this low is quite depressing 0 
classywarm atmosphere fun and fresh appetizers succulent steaks baseball steak 1 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
the movie is not completely perfect but titta di girolamo will stay with you for a long time after the vision of the movie 1 
but storm trooper is not even bad enough to make it to the list of wonderfully terrible movies 0 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job 1 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
i give wirefly 1 stari will contact cingularatt and inform them of this practice 0 
i am pairing this with my iphone and i could not be happier with it so far 1 
best headset ever 1 
it was pretty gross 0 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
all the actors give a wonderful performance especially jennifer rubin as jamie harris who changes from the nervous starlet in the beginning through the strange events she is part of to the cool star 1 
i think that it is a must see older john wayne film 1 
all the actors give a wonderful performance especially jennifer rubin as jamie harris who changes from the nervous starlet in the beginning through the strange events she is part of to the cool star 1 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
as a courtroom drama its compelling as an indictment on the american justice system its frightening 1 
also the fries are without a doubt the worst fries ive ever had 0 
overall i like this place a lot 1 
it felt like a very gripping intelligent stage play but without the overly theatrical feeling one actually gets from watching people on a stage which plays on everyones terror of a white lie escalating to monstrous consequences 1 
20th century foxs road house 1948 is not only quite a silly noir but is an implausible unmitigated bore of a movie 0 
this place is like chipotle but better 1 
how can that bethe audio quality is poor 0 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
you wont be disappointed 1 
food was really good and i got full petty fast 1 
the veggitarian platter is out of this world 1 
the sweet potato fries were very good and seasoned well 1 
bland not a liking this place for a number of reasons and i dont want to waste time on bad reviewing ill leave it at that 0 
great earpiece 1 
everything on the menu is terrific and we were also thrilled that they made amazing accommodations for our vegetarian daughter 1 
and it was way to expensive 0 
truly awful 0 
i am so tired of clichés that is just lazy writing and here they come in thick and fast 0 
this one works and was priced right 1 
a cheap and cheerless heist movie with poor characterisation lots of underbite style stoic emoting think chow yun fat in a better tomorrow and some cheesy clichés thrown into an abandoned factory ready for a few poorly executed flying judo rolls a la john woo 0 
id love to go back 1 
it is so small and you dont even realize that it is there after a while of getting used to it 1 
so i basically threw my money out the window for nothing 0 
its extremely slow and takes forever to do anything with it 0 
not recommended 0 
disappointed with battery 0 
buttons are too small 0 
i was shocked because no signs indicate cash only 0 
if there was ever an indication of a writer and a directors ability to meld two highly volatile temperaments into a seamless union of creativity then this is it 1 
try them in the airport to experience some tasty food and speedy friendly service 1 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
he was extremely rude and really there are so many other restaurants i would love to dine at during a weekend in vegas 0 
there is simply no excuse for something this poorly done 0 
anyway the plot flowed smoothly and the malebonding scenes were a hoot 1 
the art style has the appearance of crayonpencil drawings and is wonderfully colorful and fanciful 1 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
i probably wont be coming back here 0 
i highly recommend these and encourage people to give them a try 1 
this is essentially a communications tool that does not communicate 0 
the film has great actors a master director a significant themeat least a wouldbe significant theme undertone of fifties existential worldweariness aerial scenes that ought to have thrilled both senses and imagination and characters about which one might deeply care 1 
unfortunately it did not work 0 
the food is about on par with dennys which is to say not good at all 0 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
warning do not buy 0 
the waitress was friendly and happy to accomodate for veganveggie options 1 
its the one movie that never ceases to interest me simply because it keeps me alert as i try to attempt to decipher its meanings 1 
its one of the movies i need to see whenever it comes on tvnever mind the fact that i already have it memorized 1 
nonlinear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well 1 
i found this move beautiful enjoyable and uplifting 1 
i have never had such bland food which surprised me considering the article we read focused so much on their spices and flavor 0 
an interesting premise and billy drago is always good as a dangerous nutbag side note id love to see drago stephen mchattie and lance hendrikson in a flick together talk about raging cheekbones 1 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
i am very impressed with this headset from plantronics 1 
i want my money back 0 
i highly recommend this device to everyone 1 
as for the killer dont expect anything original or even remotely frightening 0 
i have to mention this and it is a huge spoiler i loved the ending how all the characters of the three films were the remaining survivors of the ferry disaster with valentine and the young judge together and the old man watching it on her tv solidifying his happiness over the suffering which he dealt with for those many years 1 
the majority of the logitech earbud headsets failed 0 
ps the only scene in the movie that was cool is when the central character finds her room blown up 1 
after i pulled up my car i waited for another 15 minutes before being acknowledged 0 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
gets a signal when other verizon phones wont 1 
oh yeah and the storyline was pathetic too 0 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
the movie was so boring that i sometimes found myself occupied peaking in the paper instead of watching never happened during a columbo movie before 0 
much more interesting more action more suspense and less of the unneeded controversy 1 
this movie contained an allstar cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i havent seen before 1 
weve tried to like this place but after 10 times i think were done with them 0 
even in my bmw 3 series which is fairly quiet i have trouble hearing what the other person is saying 0 
waste of 13 bucks 0 
the films sole bright spot was jonah hill who will look almost unrecognizable to fans of the recent superbad due to the amount of weight he lost in the interim 1 
the voice recognition thru the handset is excellent 1 
very comfortable 1 
it is rare when a filmmaker takes the time to tell a worthy moral tale with care and love that doesnt fall into the trap of being overly syrupy or over indulgent 1 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
w810i is just superb 1 
they were goldencrispy and delicious 1 
it has been a winner for us 1 
very displeased 0 
the food amazing 1 
waitress was sweet and funny 1 
the camera although rated at an impressive 13 megapixels renders images that fall well below expectations of such a relatively high resolution 0 
there is a lot of beautiful places 1 
barney is definitely super de duper 1 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
the ambience is wonderful and there is music playing 1 
this is a good joint 1 
when i placed my treo into the case not only was it not snug but there was a lot of extra room on the sides 0 
i could care less the interior is just beautiful 1 
best ive found so far ive tried 2 other bluetooths and this one has the best quality for both me and the listener as well as ease of using 1 
the cinematography is simply stunning to say the least and the fx are nothing if not stateoftheart 1 
its just adorable seeing mickey playing turkey in the straw in a highly imaginative if occasionally cruel way 1 
i have two more years left in this contract and i hate this phone 0 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
these products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet 0 
service is friendly and inviting 1 
about ten minutes into this film i started having second thoughts 0 
dont waste your money 0 
an extensive menu provides lots of options for breakfast 1 
its reception is very very poor 0 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
then theres the plot holes 0 
i wont spoil it but the ending in pretty amazing 1 
its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
i gave it 5 stars because of the sound quality 1 
each day of the week they have a different deal and its all so delicious 1 
it felt too light and tinny 0 
but it picked up speed and got right to the point 1 
this is so embarassing and also my ears hurt if i try to push the ear plug into my ear 0 
it is super charged up for use as a small hybrid palmtopcameracellphone and excels in those roles 1 
it was so bad i had lost the heart to finish it 0 
highly recommended 1 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
great brunch spot 1 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
i took back my money and got outta there 0 
this is essentially a communications tool that does not communicate 0 
everything about this movie is stupid 0 
bad day or not i have a very low tolerance for rude customer service people it is your job to be nice and polite wash dishes otherwise 0 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
we had 7 at our table and the service was pretty fast 1 
its a great tool for entertainment communication and data managementoh be sure to use activesync 42 for optimal data synchronization results 1 
i cannot believe that the actors agreed to do this film 0 
it wasnt busy at all and now we know why 0 
his performance as awarded was stunning 1 
i heart this place 1 
after all the rave reviews i couldnt wait to eat herewhat a disappointment 0 
and it was way to expensive 0 
so i basically threw my money out the window for nothing 0 
in addition to having one of the most lovely songs ever written french cancan also boasts one of the cutest leading ladies ever to grace the screen 1 
ive tried several different earpieces for my cell phone and this jabra one is the first one ive found that fits my ear comfortably 1 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
director paul matthews who also wrotedirected the weak 1995 monster movie grim clearly doesnt know how to pace his films 0 
ordered a double cheeseburger got a single patty that was falling apart picture uploaded yeah still sucks 0 
very displeased 0 
weird vibe from owners 0 
if you are looking for a good quality motorola headset keep looking this isnt it 0 
used and dirty 0 
my headset works just peachykeen 1 
it was a very superficial movie and it gave me the feeling that i was watching play rather than a film 0 
this is a great deal 1 
by far the best cheesecurds we have ever had 1 
i did not have any problem with this item and would order it again if needed 1 
the cast is good 1 
defective crap 0 
i love being able to use one headset for both by landline and cell 1 
the reception has been generally good 1 
terrible my car will not accept this cassette 0 
reversible plug works great 1 
i like armand assante my cable companys summary sounded interesting so i watched it twice already and probably will again 1 
my sashimi was poor quality being soggy and tasteless 0 
i really loved the story line and the poler bear was kinda cutebut if anyone has a question about fort steele just ask away 1 
avoid avoid avoid 0 
a usable keyboard actually turns a pda into a realworld useful machine instead of just a neat gadget 1 
this place has it 1 
it quit working after id used it for about 18 months so i just purchased another one because this is the best headset ive ever owned 1 
poor product 0 
do not buy do not buyit sucks 0 
easy to use 1 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
either way it sucks 0 
waitress was a little slow in service 0 
the results well are a shame 0 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
but whatever it was that cost them so much it didnt translate to quality thats for sure 0 
the performances are real and gripping the crocdodile is extremely well done indeed if the black water website is to be believed thats because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous 1 
seriously flavorful delights folks 1 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
perfect for the ps3 1 
there was so much hype over this phone that i assumed it was the best my mistake 0 
but it wasnt anything at all just one big yawn 0 
i consider this theft 0 
their regular toasted bread was equally satisfying with the occasional pats of butter mmmm 1 
i would recommend this 1 
also makes it easier to hold on to 1 
highly recommended a 1 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
overall the film is interesting and thoughtprovoking 1 
worst service to boot but that is the least of their worries 0 
who in their right mind is gonna buy this battery 0 
the death row scenes were entirely unmoving 0 
truly awful 0 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
for a self proclaimed coffee cafe i was wildly disappointed 0 
a usable keyboard actually turns a pda into a realworld useful machine instead of just a neat gadget 1 
yet plantronincs continues to use the same flawed charger design 0 
check it out 1 
the bathroom is just next door and very nice 1 
the bt headset was such a disapoinment 0 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
i like steiners because its dark and it feels like a bar 1 
the construction of the headsets is poor 0 
the film has an ultracheap look to it 0 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
reasonably priced also 1 
favorite place in town for shawarrrrrrma 1 
bad choice 0 
2 thumbs up to this seller 1 
watching washing machine twirling around wouldnt hurt your eyes as much as this show 0 
kids pizza is always a hit too with lots of great side dish options for the kiddos 1 
when a song could explain the emotions of the subjects better such as when jay adams unfortunate life was a subject of talk the song old man by neil young was played which evokes many emotions 1 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
you wont be disappointed 1 
the only thing that i think could improve is the sound leaks out from the headset 0 
excellent cast story line performances 1 
the ambiance was incredible 1 
rip off over charge shipping 0 
i ordered albondigas soup which was just warm and tasted like tomato soup with frozen meatballs 0 
the tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu 0 
some applause should be given to the prelude however 1 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
you need two hands to operate the screenthis software interface is decade old and cannot compete with new software designs 0 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
not to mention the combination of pears almonds and bacon is a big winner 1 
i was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar not only because the quality is great but the service is fast and the food impeccable 1 
i was mortified 0 
stay away from the q 0 
the two main characters may be two of the most believable children i ever saw put on screen 1 
on the ground right next to our table was a large smeared beensteppedinandtrackedeverywhere pile of green bird poop 0 
think of the film being like a dream 1 
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
what this film lacks is a convincing script 0 
mark my words this is one of those cult films like evil dead 2 or phantasm that people will still be discovering and falling in love with 20 30 40 years down the line 1 
very good phone 1 
in summary this was a largely disappointing dining experience 0 
the bartender was also nice 1 
loved the casting of jimmy buffet as the science teacher 1 
i was very pleased to see that i could replace my well travled swivel holster for my blackberry flip 1 
tied to charger for conversations lasting more than 45 minutesmajor problems 0 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
this movie totally grates on my nerves 0 
oh yeah and the storyline was pathetic too 0 
truly awful 0 
the food was outstanding and the prices were very reasonable 1 
would not reccommend 0 
shes poised and amazing 1 
worst foodservice ive had in a while 0 
the film is way too long 0 
yes its shiny on front side and i love it 1 
i had a pretty satifying experience 1 
its pure brilliance 1 
as an earlier review noted plug in this charger and nothing happens 0 
excellent bluetooth headset 1 
to call this movie a drama is ridiculous 0 
the selection of food was not the best 0 
pricing is a bit of a concern at mellow mushroom 0 
i hate to disagree with my fellow yelpers but my husband and i were so disappointed with this place 0 
the sound quality for the device is unacceptableunless you are in a really quiet area you almost hear nothing 0 
what a mistake that was 0 
it works fine on my motorola 325 cellphone and a lot better than the wornout battery did 1 
its one of the movies i need to see whenever it comes on tvnever mind the fact that i already have it memorized 1 
maybe its just their vegetarian fare but ive been twice and i thought it was average at best 0 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
the soundtrack wasnt terrible either 1 
i was disgusted because i was pretty sure that was human hair 0 
the steak and the shrimp are in my opinion the best entrees at gc 1 
unfortunately the ability to actually know you are receiving a call is a rather important feature and this phone is pitiful in that respect 0 
the directing and the cinematography arent quite as good 0 
what makes this story different are the terrific production values faultless photography composition and editing the terrific casting the underappreciated brian keith playing a bully teddy and vivid history 1 
trying to make a call on these is an exercise in frustration 0 
amazon sucks 0 
i agree with jessica this movie is pretty bad 0 
the characters are interesting and you really care for them 1 
then i had to continue pairing it periodically since it somehow kept dropping 0 
i felt as though her going to ireland did absolutely nothing whatsoever 0 
great character actors telly savalas and peter boyle 1 
the delivery was on time 1 
these were so good we ordered them twice 1 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
regrettably the film fails 0 
this company charge me a restocking fee and still not given me my refund back 0 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
we had so much to say about the place before we walked in that he expected it to be amazing but was quickly disappointed 0 
on the good side the staff was genuinely pleasant and enthusiastic a real treat 1 
we loved the biscuits 1 
now this is a movie i really dislike 0 
i was able to do voice dialing in the car with no problem 1 
sooooo good 1 
the ngage is still lacking in earbuds 0 
he is almost unbearable to watch on screen he has little to no charisma and terrible comedic timing 0 
this is definitely a cult classic well worth viewing and sharing with others 1 
this is cool because most cases are just open there allowing the screen to get all scratched up 1 
at least think to refill my water before i struggle to wave you over for 10 minutes 0 
i would recommend purchasing the jabra jx10 series 2 which works flawlessly with my moto q go figure 1 
razr battery good buy 1 
these are the nicest restaurant owners ive ever come across 1 
the bipolarity of the ruthless thug one minute a ruthless killer the next minute a luvs diaper commercial is completely unconvincing 0 
1010 1 
the real killer is the volume and of course it breaking 0 
i was hoping for more 0 
the feel of the dining room was more college cooking course than high class dining and the service was slow at best 0 
it was way over fried 0 
on the good side the staff was genuinely pleasant and enthusiastic a real treat 1 
im super pissd 0 
see both films if you can 1 
after a year the battery went completely dead on my headset 0 
when i placed my treo into the case not only was it not snug but there was a lot of extra room on the sides 0 
att is not clear sound is very distorted and you have to yell when you talk 0 
excellent sound battery life and inconspicuous to boot 1 
artless camerawork endlessly presents us with the ugliest setting imaginable ie 0 
what happened next was prettyoff putting 0 
sucked most of the stuff does not work with my phone 0 
loved itfriendly servers great food wonderful and imaginative menu 1 
its extremely slow and takes forever to do anything with it 0 
lots of holes in the script 0 
im using it with an iriver spinn with case and it fits fine 1 
excellent 1 
steamboat willie is an amazingly important film to our cinema history 1 
director paul matthews who also wrotedirected the weak 1995 monster movie grim clearly doesnt know how to pace his films 0 
the battery life is highly unacceptable 0 
i especially liked the noncliche choices with the parents in other movies i could predict the dialog verbatim but the writing in this movie made better selections 1 
this movie was kind of long in length but i enjoyed every minute of it 1 
very easy to use 1 
one character is totally annoying with a voice that gives me the feeling of fingernails on a chalkboard 0 
add betty white and jean smart and you have a great cast everyone played their parts really well 1 
it is perfect for a sitdown family meal or get together with a few friends 1 
i love being able to use one headset for both by landline and cell 1 
it seems completely secure both holding on to my belt and keeping the iphone inside 1 
if you havent choked in your own vomit by the end by all the cheap drama and worthless dialogue youve must have bored yourself to death with this waste of time 0 
there is nothing privileged about workingeating there 0 
first of all it doesnt wear well 0 
i had a seriously solid breakfast here 1 
the chefs were friendly and did a good job 1 
this place is disgusting 0 
it works fine on my motorola 325 cellphone and a lot better than the wornout battery did 1 
so good i am going to have to review this place twice once hereas a tribute to the place and once as a tribute to an event held here last night 1 
however after finally watching this film i realized that not only had i had a closed mind to the brilliance it depicts i also found myself watching it over and over again 1 
i bought this battery with a coupon from amazon and im very happy with my purchase 1 
wont work right or atleast for me 0 
the lighting is awful 0 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
if i take a picture the battery drops a bar and starts beeping letting me know its dieing 0 
fast service 1 
the grilled chicken was so tender and yellow from the saffron seasoning 1 
he was extremely rude and really there are so many other restaurants i would love to dine at during a weekend in vegas 0 
barney is definitely super de duper 1 
if you havent gone here go now 1 
the last 15 minutes of movie are also not bad as well 1 
disappointing 0 
this is probably one of the least effective and utterly unoriginal films i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
the steaks are all well trimmed and also perfectly cooked 1 
a very good film indeed about great and unconditional love 1 
comfortable fit you need your headset to be comfortable for at least an hour at a time if not for an entire day 1 
i never come again 0 
in an interesting part of town this place is amazing 1 
excellent service 1 
cant get the software to work with my computer 0 
this case has passed the one year mark and while it shows signs of wear it is 100 functional 1 
the first time i ever came here i had an amazing experience i still tell people how awesome the duck was 1 
it is an hour and half waste of time following a bunch of very pretty high schoolers whine and cry about life 0 
nice leather 1 
what a waste of money and time 0 
excellent short film 1 
perfect for the ps3 1 
it has northern humour and positive about the community it represents 1 
there were several moments in the movie that just didnt need to be there and were excruciatingly slow moving 0 
it was quite comfortable in the ear 1 
the only possible way this movie could be redeemed would be as mst3k fodder 0 
im using it with an iriver spinn with case and it fits fine 1 
the guys all had steaks and our steak loving son who has had steak at the best and worst places said it was the best steak hes ever eaten 1 
i have recommended it to friends 1 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
it is a very well acted and done tv movie 1 
i have never had such bland food which surprised me considering the article we read focused so much on their spices and flavor 0 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
he is almost unbearable to watch on screen he has little to no charisma and terrible comedic timing 0 
i dont know exactly what it is about this movie but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our familys memories 1 
i would definitely recommend the jabra bt250v for those who are looking for comfort clarity and a great price 1 
the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach 0 
nonlinear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well 1 
the characters were all funny and had the peculiarity of not having a true lead character 1 
for those that havent seen it dont waste your time 0 
another thing i didnt really like is when a character got punched in the face a gallon of blood would spew forth soon after 0 
it is light easy to use and has very clear reception and transmission 1 
this isnt a small family restaurant this is a fine dining establishment 1 
horrible 0 
its a shame to see good actors like thomerson and james make a living in a mess like this 0 
the restaurant is very clean and has a family restaurant feel to it 1 
good show samsung 1 
some applause should be given to the prelude however 1 
terrible my car will not accept this cassette 0 
how awesome is that 1 
rip off over charge shipping 0 
with the originality and freshness of the first movie now spent this remake had little else to offer 0 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
the acting sucks the music sucks the script sucks the pacing sucks the special fx suck the directing sucks basically this movie sucks 0 
we also ordered the spinach and avocado salad the ingredients were sad and the dressing literally had zero taste 0 
avoid avoid avoid 0 
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1 
we waited for forty five minutes in vain 0 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
kids pizza is always a hit too with lots of great side dish options for the kiddos 1 
they are so easy to love but even more easy to identify with 1 
i bought this battery with a coupon from amazon and im very happy with my purchase 1 
this movie has a cutting edge to it 1 
bad day or not i have a very low tolerance for rude customer service people it is your job to be nice and polite wash dishes otherwise 0 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
great place to relax and have an awesome burger and beer 1 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
the real killer is the volume and of course it breaking 0 
i am a fan of his this movie sucked really bad 0 
if you want a real scare rent this one 1 
the story line is totally predictable 0 
omit watching this 0 
the steak was amazingrge fillet relleno was the best seafood plate i have ever had 1 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
the scripting of the subtle comedy is unmatched by any movie in recent years 1 
this was utterly confusing at first which caused me to lose a couple of very very important contacts 0 
it really created a unique feeling though 1 
absolutel junk 0 
i got this phone on reccomendation from a relative and im glad i did 1 
eew this location needs a complete overhaul 0 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
i went on motorolas website and followed all directions but could not get it to pair again 0 
great earpiece 1 
as i said abovepretty useless 0 
the only thing that i think could improve is the sound leaks out from the headset 0 
could not get strong enough signal 0 
if you are reading this please dont go there 0 
phenomenal food service and ambiance 1 
you cant relate with them hell you barely can understand them 0 
this movie is a good and humorous comment on life in 2006 1 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
i have eaten here multiple times and each time the food was delicious 1 
his losing his marbles so early in the proceedings is totally implausible and unconvincing 0 
still waiting im sure this item would work well if i ever recieve it 0 
not much seafood and like 5 strings of pasta at the bottom 0 
when achille and philippa beautifully sing a duet from don giovanni that perfectly describes their situation in the movie you appreciate the subtle layers of this excellent film 1 
after a year the battery went completely dead on my headset 0 
easily none other cartoon made me laugh in a tender way before getting into dark sitcoms oriented for teenagers 1 
i would not recommend this place 0 
its a piece of crap 0 
one of the most disappointing aspects is the lack of notable gore 0 
the pizza tasted old super chewy in not a good way 0 
oh yeah and the storyline was pathetic too 0 
i ended up sliding it on the edge of my pants or back pockets instead 1 
for the price this was a great deal 1 
it always cuts out and makes a beep beep beep sound then says signal failed 0 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
tonight i had the elk filet specialand it sucked 0 
this movie contained an allstar cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i havent seen before 1 
cool phone 1 
the ambiance was incredible 1 
just as good as when i had it more than a year ago 1 
its kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly its embarrassing how childlike the company is 0 
also were served hot bread and butter and home made potato chips with bacon bits on topvery original and very good 1 
there is nothing authentic about this place 0 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
the bipolarity of the ruthless thug one minute a ruthless killer the next minute a luvs diaper commercial is completely unconvincing 0 
hes a national treasure 1 
what a waste of money and time 0 
my wife had the lobster bisque soup which was lukewarm 0 
service sucks 0 
the bathrooms are clean and the place itself is well decorated 1 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
i bought this phone as a replacement for my startac and have regretted it since 0 
does not fit 0 
i felt as though her going to ireland did absolutely nothing whatsoever 0 
nobody identifies with these characters because theyre all cardboard cutouts and stereotypes or predictably reversestereotypes 0 
and the rest of it just sits there being awful with soldiers singing songs about the masculinity they pledge themselves to hairsplitting about purity the admiration of swords etc 0 
i have had this phone for over a year now and i will tell you its not that great 0 
you need at least 3 mins to get to your phone book from the time you first turn on the phonebattery life is short 0 
they could serve it with just the vinaigrette and it may make for a better overall dish but it was still very good 1 
after all the rave reviews i couldnt wait to eat herewhat a disappointment 0 
this is truly an art movieit actually has a lot of art in it 1 
perfect for the ps3 1 
a film not easily forgotten 1 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
i think not again 0 
i would definitely recommend the jabra bt250v for those who are looking for comfort clarity and a great price 1 
i ate there twice on my last visit and especially enjoyed the salmon salad 1 
it was absolutely amazing 1 
overall i was not impressed and would not go back 0 
never again will i be dining at this place 0 
it felt like a very gripping intelligent stage play but without the overly theatrical feeling one actually gets from watching people on a stage which plays on everyones terror of a white lie escalating to monstrous consequences 1 
i have had this phone for over a year now and i will tell you its not that great 0 
end of days is one of the worst bigbudget action movies ive ever seen 0 
im probably one of the few people to ever go to ians and not like it 0 
worst ever 0 
its just lame 0 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
the phone is sturdy and waterproof 1 
the atmosphere is modern and hip while maintaining a touch of coziness 1 
great food and service huge portions and they give a military discount 1 
you can watch them preparing the delicious food 1 
fans of the genre will be in heaven 1 
i have to mention this and it is a huge spoiler i loved the ending how all the characters of the three films were the remaining survivors of the ferry disaster with valentine and the young judge together and the old man watching it on her tv solidifying his happiness over the suffering which he dealt with for those many years 1 
it also had a new problem 0 
5 stars for the brick oven bread app 1 
feelings thoughtsgabriels discomfort during the danceall these intangibles leap to life and come within the viewers grasp in hustons portrayal 1 
you cant beat the price on these 1 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
i must say i have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again 1 
very disappointing 0 
everything was perfect the night we were in 1 
then i had to continue pairing it periodically since it somehow kept dropping 0 
this is such a fun and funny movie 1 
lucy bell is so much higher than this crap and for her to sink this low is quite depressing 0 
dessert panna cotta was amazing 1 
about ten minutes into this film i started having second thoughts 0 
i love my 350 headset my jabra350 bluetooth headset is great the reception is very good and the ear piece is a comfortable fit 1 
this movie is bad 0 
i would definitely recommend the jabra bt250v for those who are looking for comfort clarity and a great price 1 
the buttons for on and off are bad 0 
rating 010 grade z note the show is so bad that even mother of the cast pull her daughter out of the show 0 
because both ears are occupied background is not distracting at all 1 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
works well 1 
on the up side their cafe serves really good food 1 
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
it even has its sweet moments 1 
this is one of the better buffets that i have been to 1 
it felt like a very gripping intelligent stage play but without the overly theatrical feeling one actually gets from watching people on a stage which plays on everyones terror of a white lie escalating to monstrous consequences 1 
the scenery that the two daughters paint and photograph are beautiful 1 
due to this happening on every call i was forced to stop using this headset 0 
the worst phone ive ever had only had it for a few months 0 
it was delicious 1 
hot dishes are not hot cold dishes are close to room tempi watched staff prepare food with bare hands no gloveseverything is deep fried in oil 0 
the headsets are easy to use and everyone loves them 1 
in fact its hard to remember that the part of ray charles is being acted and not played by the man himself 1 
now we were chosen to be tortured with this disgusting piece of blatant american propaganda 0 
i ended up sliding it on the edge of my pants or back pockets instead 1 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
id say that would be the hardest decision honestly all of ms dishes taste how they are supposed to taste amazing 1 
there is however some pretty good acting at least for this type of film 1 
my sister has one also and she loves it 1 
cant store anything but phone numbers to sim 0 
does not fit 0 
this is by far the worst purchase ive made on amazon 0 
there is really nothing for me at postinos hope your experience is better 0 
im a big fan of this series mostly due to anne rices style sensitivities and treatments 1 
my order was not correct 0 
what the hell kind of crap is that 0 
its a sad movie but very good 1 
went in for happy hour great list of wines 1 
its really easy 1 
the service was not up to par either 0 
its kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly its embarrassing how childlike the company is 0 
but the duet between the astronaut and his doctor at the beginning of the movie is a perfect exchange if one considers that this movie was made well into the cold war and the astronauts biggest fear is that he has crashed in the ussr 1 
when i placed my treo into the case not only was it not snug but there was a lot of extra room on the sides 0 
wed definitely go back here again 1 
i came over from verizon because cingulair has nicer cell phones the first thing i noticed was the really bad service 0 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in 0 
very dissapointing performance 0 
i love this phone 1 
the movie was very interesting from beginning to the end 1 
honeslty it didnt taste that fresh 0 
works great 1 
last night was my second time dining here and i was so happy i decided to go back 1 
paolo sorrentino has written a wonderful story about loneliness and tony has built one of the most unforgettable characters seen in movies in recent years 1 
first of all it doesnt wear well 0 
the acting is like watching wooden puppets moving around and reading from a book thats how bad it is 0 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
the flat reenactments dont hold your attention because they are emotionally adrift and stagy 0 
you get extra minutes so that you can carry out the call and not get cut off 1 
that one didnt work either 0 
all in all i can assure you ill be back 1 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
item arrived quickly and works great with my metro pcs samsung schr450 slider phone and sony premium sound in ear plugs 1 
then i watched it again two sundays ago march 20th 2005 and i began to really enjoy it and this time i taped the entire thing 1 
so in a nutshell 1 the restaraunt smells like a combination of a dirty fish market and a sewer 0 
it is indescribably the most annoying and idiotic show i have ever seen 0 
this particular model would not work with my motorola q smartphone 0 
i want to first say our server was great and we had perfect service 1
