i have yet to run this new battery below two bars and thats three days without charging 1 
its a fresh subtle and rather sublime effect 1 
and then tragedy struck 0 
both of them were truly unbelievably good and i am so glad we went back 1 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
not worth it 0 
why was this film made 0 
the handsfree part works fine but then the car tries to download the address book and the treo rebootsoverall i still rate this device high 1 
worst ever 0 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
the desserts were a bit strange 0 
the waitress was friendly and happy to accomodate for veganveggie options 1 
i have had mine for about a year and this christmas i bought some for the rest of the family 1 
this is so embarassing and also my ears hurt if i try to push the ear plug into my ear 0 
the seasonal fruit was fresh white peach puree 1 
i saw this movie and i thought this is a stupid movie 0 
much better than the other ayce sushi place i went to in vegas 1 
i hate those things as much as cheap quality black olives 0 
but then they came back cold 0 
this movie does an excellent job of revealing the complexity of the task and the incredible challenges facing south africa 1 
also the area where my unit broke im not too fond of the magnetic strap 0 
frozen pucks of disgust with some of the worst people behind the register 0 
horrible 0 
the only good thing was our waiter he was very helpful and kept the bloddy marys coming 1 
my gyro was basically lettuce only 0 
perhaps my phone is defective but people cannot hear me when i use this 0 
one more thing i can tolerate political incorrectness very well im all for artistic freedom and suspension of disbelief but the slavic female character was just too much 0 
the sound quality for the device is unacceptableunless you are in a really quiet area you almost hear nothing 0 
everyone is treated equally special 1 
this is a very average phone with bad battery life that operates on a weak network 0 
restaurant is always full but never a wait 1 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
i asked multiple times for the wine list and after some time of being ignored i went to the hostess and got one myself 0 
and i really did find them funny 1 
these are the central themes of the film and they are handled ineptly stereotypically and with no depth of imagination 0 
the camera on the phone may be used as a dustpan when indoors id rather be using a disposable then this 0 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
this place is great 1 
the plastic breaks really easy on this clip 0 
in the span of an hour i had two people exclaim whoa is that the new phone on tv 1 
same evening him and i are both drastically sick 0 
i really recommend this faceplates since it looks very nice elegant and cool 1 
it fits my ear well and is comfortable on 1 
a happy wonderful feel good ending 1 
i believe that this place is a great stop for those with a huge belly and hankering for sushi 1 
the waitresses are very friendly 1 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
similarly the delivery man did not say a word of apology when our food was 45 minutes late 0 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
we loved the place 1 
if you want healthy authentic or ethic food try this place 1 
lange had become a great actress 1 
i have 23 bars on my cell phone when i am home but you cant not hear anything 0 
no ear loop needed its tiny and the sound is great 1 
i have 23 bars on my cell phone when i am home but you cant not hear anything 0 
if you look for authentic thai food go else where 0 
i can say that the desserts were yummy 1 
this is a good battery and it got here really fast 1 
perhaps my phone is defective but people cannot hear me when i use this 0 
down the drain because of a weak snap 0 
but now that it is out of warranty the same problems reoccurebottom line put your money somewhere else cingular will not support it 0 
awful service 0 
the owners are super friendly and the staff is courteous 1 
good works fine 1 
if you want healthy authentic or ethic food try this place 1 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
i believe that pitch black was done well 1 
the characters are fleshed out surprisingly well particularly grimes and blake and all the actors deliver their sharply scripted lines with just the right amount of deadpan tongue in cheek to make the dialogue both hilarious and realistic 1 
the flair bartenders are absolutely amazing 1 
the ambiance was incredible 1 
as for the mains also uninspired 0 
as i said abovepretty useless 0 
i came back today since they relocated and still not impressed 0 
the staff is always super friendly and helpful which is especially cool when you bring two small boys and a baby 1 
the selection of food was not the best 0 
youd have to have the iq of particularly stupid mollusk not to see that one coming 0 
this is one of the best italian thrillers of the early 70s 1 
this frog phone charm is adorable and very eye catching 1 
i mean this in a terrible way 0 
really pleased with this product so far 1 
good case 1 
this was like the final blow 0 
service was exceptional and food was a good as all the reviews 1 
worthwhile 1 
comes with a strong light that you can use to light up your camera shots and even flash sos signals seriously 1 
great phone 1 
i found a six inch long piece of wire in my salsa 0 
and i really did find them funny 1 
bland and flavorless is a good way of describing the barely tepid meat 0 
i use this product in a motor control center where there is a lot of high voltage humming from the equipment and it works great 1 
my boyfriend and i sat at the bar and had a completely delightful experience 1 
and his subtle connections between the three films are awesome 1 
this phone works great 1 
i had a pretty satifying experience 1 
im glad the film didnt go for the most obvious choice as a lesser film certainly would have 1 
and then tragedy struck 0 
special mention should be made of the superb music score and sound effects which are an integral element in helping to make this such a memorable and enjoyable cartoon 1 
the calls drop the phone comes on and off at will the screen goes black and the worst of all it stops ringing intermittently 0 
the acting by the whole cast could be put on a scale and balanced perfectly between overacting and underacting 0 
some applause should be given to the prelude however 1 
sorry i will not be getting food from here anytime soon 0 
it felt too light and tinny 0 
another note about this phones appearance is that it really looks rather bland especially in the all black model 0 
rude inconsiderate management 0 
i contacted the company and they told me that although the unit was still under warranty if i couldnt produce my receipt i was out of luck 0 
everything on the menu is terrific and we were also thrilled that they made amazing accommodations for our vegetarian daughter 1 
give this one a look 1 
the death row scenes were entirely unmoving 0 
but in any case the best part is you can download these pictures to your laptop using ir or even send pictures from your laptop to the phone 1 
it has all the features i want 1 
this movie was kind of long in length but i enjoyed every minute of it 1 
this product had a strong rubberpetroleum smell that was unbearable after a while and caused me to return it 0 
the holster that arrived did not match the photo in the ad 0 
overall i was not impressed and would not go back 0 
definitely worth seeing its the sort of thought provoking film that forces you to question your own threshold of loneliness 1 
great brunch spot 1 
this is an outstanding little restaurant with some of the best food i have ever tasted 1 
furthermore you cant even find hours of operation on the website 0 
the phone loads super 1 
great value 1 
sounds good reasonably priced and effective its that simple 1 
a very very very slowmoving aimless movie about a distressed drifting young man 0 
it works 1 
ryans bar is definitely one edinburgh establishment i wont be revisiting 0 
service was exceptional and food was a good as all the reviews 1 
a bit predictable 0 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
instead we got a bore fest about a whiny spoiled brat babysitting 0 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
i received my orders well within the shipping timeframe everything was in good working order and overall i am very excited to have this source 1 
its one of the most boring horror movies from the 90s mainly because it starts slow and centers in a boring atmosphere 0 
all in all an excellent restaurant highlighted by great service a unique menu and a beautiful setting 1 
its a shame to see good actors like thomerson and james make a living in a mess like this 0 
id rather eat airline food seriously 0 
for readers who have already seen one of miyazakis films he is still in top form and made another worthwhile experience 1 
the croutons also taste homemade which is an extra plus 1 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
the reception is excellent 1 
cumbersome design 0 
razr battery good buy 1 
works as described 1 
very disappointed in accessoryone 0 
this place receives stars for their appetizers 1 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
comes with a strong light that you can use to light up your camera shots and even flash sos signals seriously 1 
for people who are first timers in film making i think they did an excellent job 1 
the cable looks so thin and flimsy it is scary 0 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
gets the job done 1 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
nice quality build unlike some cheap s out there 1 
the characters are fleshed out surprisingly well particularly grimes and blake and all the actors deliver their sharply scripted lines with just the right amount of deadpan tongue in cheek to make the dialogue both hilarious and realistic 1 
this movie has a cutting edge to it 1 
i love lane but ive never seen her in a movie this lousy 0 
the reception is excellent 1 
all in all an excellent restaurant highlighted by great service a unique menu and a beautiful setting 1 
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
we loved the place 1 
all in all i give this one a resounding 9 out of 10 1 
what a mistake 0 
i am so tired of clichés that is just lazy writing and here they come in thick and fast 0 
the staff is friendly and the joint is always clean 1 
sooooo good 1 
owners are really great people 1 
of course the acting is blah 0 
the secondary plot line is incomprehensible and its relation to the primary plot line is mystifying 0 
kieslowski never ceases to amaze me 1 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
the potatoes were great and so was the biscuit 1 
easily none other cartoon made me laugh in a tender way before getting into dark sitcoms oriented for teenagers 1 
favorite place in town for shawarrrrrrma 1 
funny clever hip just like prays previous film hype 1 
a fantastic neighborhood gem 1 
excellent product for the price 1 
we enjoy their pizza and brunch 1 
the instructions didnt explain that a microphone jack could be used 0 
also great directing and photography 1 
i highly recommend these and encourage people to give them a try 1 
no ear loop needed its tiny and the sound is great 1 
it is a really good show to watch 1 
all i have to say is the food was amazing 1 
the chicken dishes are ok the beef is like shoe leather 0 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
works great 1 
the staff are great the ambiance is great 1 
bland and flavorless is a good way of describing the barely tepid meat 0 
the shipping time was also very quick 1 
i guess that nobody at the network that aired this dribble watched it before putting it on 0 
but i definitely would not eat here again 0 
it was a waste of my money 0 
this pair of headphones is the worst that i have ever had soundwise 0 
his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic 1 
im terribly disappointed that this film would receive so many awards and accolades especially when there are far more deserving works of film out there 0 
if you simply want a small flip phone look elsewhere as the extra bells whistles are mediocre 0 
dont buy this product it fails 0 
hell no will i go back 0 
their daily specials are always a hit with my group 1 
the turkey and roast beef were bland 0 
good audio quality 1 
portable and it works 1 
they will customize your order any way youd like my usual is eggplant with green bean stir fry love it 1 
it was clear that she had the range and ability to pull off this part 1 
i dont think there are any redeeming qualities in this remake 0 
nice ambiance 1 
i left the theater with a lilt in my step joy in my heart and hope for the human race 1 
it kept getting worse and worse so now im officially done 0 
we ordered some old classics and some new dishes after going there a few times and were sorely disappointed with everything 0 
similarly the delivery man did not say a word of apology when our food was 45 minutes late 0 
the battery is completely useless to me 0 
it lasts less than 3o minutes if i actually try to use the phonemy wife has the same phone with the same problem 0 
everything from acting to cinematography was solid 1 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
the service was meh 0 
im a big fan of this series mostly due to anne rices style sensitivities and treatments 1 
the best part about nurse betty is its unpredictability 1 
the meat was pretty dry i had the sliced brisket and pulled pork 0 
special mention should be made of the superb music score and sound effects which are an integral element in helping to make this such a memorable and enjoyable cartoon 1 
after the disappointing dinner we went elsewhere for dessert 0 
my 5year old nokia 2160 from tracfone holds the charge a lot better than this 0 
but when i check voice mail at night the keypad backlight turns off a few seconds into the first message and then im lost 0 
i can take a little bad service but the food sucks 0 
the decor is nice and the piano music soundtrack is pleasant 1 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
my friend did not like his bloody mary 0 
best breakfast buffet 1 
if you plan to use this in a car forget about it 0 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
everything about this film is simply incredible 1 
its a shame to see good actors like thomerson and james make a living in a mess like this 0 
talk about great customer service of course we will be back 1 
all in all i can assure you ill be back 1 
if you see it you should probably just leave it on the shelf 0 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
this was my first time and i cant wait until the next 1 
the speaker is of low quality so as making the ring tones sound very cheap 0 
warning stay away 0 
cinematography the film was shot in an interesting way 1 
the camera although rated at an impressive 13 megapixels renders images that fall well below expectations of such a relatively high resolution 0 
emily watsons character is very strong and she has only to give a quick glance and you understand everything 1 
hackneyed writing certainly but made even worse by the bad directing 0 
at around 4 pm i bought it at around 8pm i started to watch at around 815pm i fast forwarded the remaining film to see if there was anything left watchable for a human being with a brain but there wasnt 0 
go to place for gyros 1 
if you simply want a small flip phone look elsewhere as the extra bells whistles are mediocre 0 
the cast of veteran actors are more than just a nostalgia trip 1 
never been to hard rock casino before will never ever step forward in it again 0 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
weve tried to like this place but after 10 times i think were done with them 0 
this place is good 1 
the films dialogue is natural real to life 1 
stopped by during the late may bank holiday off rick steve recommendation and loved it 1 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
the cast is always entertaining as usual 1 
what a waste 0 
this case has passed the one year mark and while it shows signs of wear it is 100 functional 1 
it was way over fried 0 
this movie creates its own universe and is fascinating in every way 1 
i just cant explain this movie more than romanticcharminghilariousand adorablethe junkyard scenes are funnyall the junkyard dogs have something specialtoo funny i laughedkids will love itbuy it when it comes outit has new features 1 
you also cannot take pictures with it in the case because the lense is covered 0 
think it over when you plan to own this onethis sure is the last moto phone for me 0 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
no additional ear gels provided and no instructions whatsoever 0 
i own 2 of these cases and would order another 1 
the live music on fridays totally blows 0 
i didnt want the clip going over the top of my ear causing discomfort 0 
the scallop dish is quite appalling for value as well 0 
we would recommend these to others 1 
i would advise to not purchase this item it never worked very well 0 
the plantains were the worst ive ever tasted 0 
i guess i should have known that this place would suck because it is inside of the excalibur but i didnt use my common sense 0 
i believe the screenwriter did a good job of tying up the loose ends 1 
this was my first time and i cant wait until the next 1 
dont bother coming here 0 
i will come back here every time im in vegas 1 
hot dishes are not hot cold dishes are close to room tempi watched staff prepare food with bare hands no gloveseverything is deep fried in oil 0 
the ambiance was incredible 1 
this is a very average phone with bad battery life that operates on a weak network 0 
of all the dishes the salmon was the best but all were great 1 
i left the theater with a lilt in my step joy in my heart and hope for the human race 1 
again no plot at all 0 
i was shocked because no signs indicate cash only 0 
this product is great it makes working a lot easier i can go to the copier while waiting on hold for something 1 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
this is a good battery and it got here really fast 1 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
his performance as awarded was stunning 1 
about 30 minutes of footage is wasted to show mediocre elderly actors awkwardly babbling overwrought pseudosatanic gibberish corny enough to make a teen goth blush almost always in olde english and sometimes in latin that may or may not be made up words 0 
the acting is like watching wooden puppets moving around and reading from a book thats how bad it is 0 
i must say i have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again 1 
about half way through this film i started to dislike it 0 
the attention given to every character and complex psychological portrayals detailing loyalty treachery love and hope are tremendous 1 
otherwise easy to install and use clear sound 1 
if good intentions made a film great then this film might be one of the greatest films ever made 1 
the movie is full of wonderful dancing hence the title 1 
bluetooth range is good a few days ago i left my phone in the trunk got a call and carried the conversation without a hitch 1 
i ordered albondigas soup which was just warm and tasted like tomato soup with frozen meatballs 0 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
thank you for wasting my money 0 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
i paid the bill but did not tip because i felt the server did a terrible job 0 
the design is very good4 1 
both of the egg rolls were fantastic 1 
i ordered albondigas soup which was just warm and tasted like tomato soup with frozen meatballs 0 
no additional ear gels provided and no instructions whatsoever 0 
comfortable fit you need your headset to be comfortable for at least an hour at a time if not for an entire day 1 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
i had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get some relief 0 
this was like the final blow 0 
what happened next was prettyoff putting 0 
i wear glasses and it fits fine with them 1 
the mic there is a joke and the volume is quite low 0 
i like design and look of jabra behing the ear headsets and 5020 is pretty comfortible to wear 24 hours a day without pain in the ear 1 
i love the scream movies and all horror movies and this one ranks way up there 1 
i love the ringtones because they are so upbeat 1 
despite the pans of reviewers i liked this movie 1 
highly recommend for any one who has a blue tooth phone 1 
the acting is terrible and the writing is worse 0 
i love this device 1 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
i like steiners because its dark and it feels like a bar 1 
one of my favorite purchases ever 1 
all of the main players are mesmerising 1 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
we loved the biscuits 1 
i felt as though her going to ireland did absolutely nothing whatsoever 0 
im a big fan of this series mostly due to anne rices style sensitivities and treatments 1 
im returning them 0 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
freezes frequently4 0 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
all the characters in this film are tremendously well played 1 
this movie totally grates on my nerves 0 
iam very pleased with my purchase 1 
if you check the directors filmography on this site you will see why this film didnt have a chance 0 
the phone loads super 1 
best breakfast buffet 1 
if you hate earbugs avoid this phone by all means 0 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
this is so embarassing and also my ears hurt if i try to push the ear plug into my ear 0 
seafood was limited to boiled shrimp and crab legs but the crab legs definitely did not taste fresh 0 
really bad 0 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
too bad cause i know its family owned i really wanted to like this place 0 
works great 1 
horrible had to switch 3 times 0 
the phone loads super 1 
after 20 minutes wait i got a table 0 
a disappointment 0 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
the characters were all funny and had the peculiarity of not having a true lead character 1 
but the service was beyond bad 0 
this movie was kind of long in length but i enjoyed every minute of it 1 
one more thing i can tolerate political incorrectness very well im all for artistic freedom and suspension of disbelief but the slavic female character was just too much 0 
great pizza and salads 1 
about ten minutes into this film i started having second thoughts 0 
i was not impressed by this product 0 
the least said about the acting the better 0 
you wont regret it 1 
okay i like to consider myself a fair critic so ill give credit where credits duethe creature effects were actually pretty cool 1 
yes this film does require a rather significant amount of puzzlesolving but the pieces fit together to create a beautiful picture 1 
however the ear pads come off easily and after only one week i lost one 0 
this is a great product sure beats using your fingers 1 
obviously they have a terrible customer service so you get what you pay for 0 
after my phone got to be about a year old its been slowly breaking despite much care on my part 0 
hot dishes are not hot cold dishes are close to room tempi watched staff prepare food with bare hands no gloveseverything is deep fried in oil 0 
i love the look and feel of samsung flipphones 1 
the servers are not pleasant to deal with and they dont always honor pizza hut coupons 0 
5 stars for the brick oven bread app 1 
the worst was the salmon sashimi 0 
very well made and fits my surefire gx2 perfectly 1 
awesome device 1 
i dont know exactly what it is about this movie but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our familys memories 1 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
i own a jabra earset and was very happy with it but the sound quality especially outgoing on this is better 1 
the flair bartenders are absolutely amazing 1 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
if it were possible to give them zero stars theyd have it 0 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
couldnt figure it out 0 
i recently had problems where i could not stay connected for more than 10 minutes before being disconnected 0 
i had about two bites and refused to eat anymore 0 
we had so much to say about the place before we walked in that he expected it to be amazing but was quickly disappointed 0 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
the chips and salsa were really good the salsa was very fresh 1 
the croutons also taste homemade which is an extra plus 1 
using all earpieces left or right this thing will not stay on my ear 0 
i had a pretty satifying experience 1 
that said our mouths and bellies were still quite pleased 1 
check it out 1 
a disappointment 0 
if there were zero stars i would give it zero stars 0 
the fact is this film is a wonderful heartwarming tale about two people chasing their dreams 1 
the selection of food was not the best 0 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
cant store anything but phone numbers to sim 0 
her role was played well 1 
10 out of 10 stars 1 
the charger arrived within the promised timeframe but it did not work 0 
for that its worth checking out 1 
there is simply no excuse for something this poorly done 0 
earbud piece breaks easily 0 
stopped by during the late may bank holiday off rick steve recommendation and loved it 1 
1010 1 
in particular the relationship between the bakery assistant and the waitress just didnt work for me at all 0 
design flaw 0 
also notable is john baileys fine crisp beautifully colored cinematography and the great production design costumes by eiko ishioka who went on to do the memorable costumes for coppolas dracula for which she received a well deserved oscar 1 
omit watching this 0 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
it failed to convey the broad sweep of landscapes that were a great part of the original 0 
what did bother me was the slow service 0 
this is a witty and delightful adaptation of the dr seuss book brilliantly animated by upas finest and thoroughly deserving of its academy award 1 
i had about two bites and refused to eat anymore 0 
unfortunately cover girl is an example of how hollywood used to exploit women for financial gain 0 
the voice recognition thru the handset is excellent 1 
avoid this establishment 0 
hitchcock is a great director 1 
this phone is very fast with sending any kind of messages and web browsing is significantly faster than previous phones i have used 1 
we recently witnessed her poor quality of management towards other guests as well 0 
and his subtle connections between the three films are awesome 1 
it felt too light and tinny 0 
the results well are a shame 0 
in conclusion i will not bother with this movie because a volcano in los angeles is nothing but nonsense 0 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
comfortable in my hand 1 
if that bug never showed up i would have given a 4 for sure but on the other side of the wall where this bug was climbing was the kitchen 0 
wow what a bad film 0 
not worth it 0 
dont waste your money and time 0 
the lighting is just dark enough to set the mood 1 
hands down my favorite italian restaurant 1 
i searched the internet and found this one to be the best value 1 
if that bug never showed up i would have given a 4 for sure but on the other side of the wall where this bug was climbing was the kitchen 0 
however i needed some better instructions 0 
best of all is the rotating feature very helpful 1 
and the chef was generous with his time even came around twice so we can take pictures with him 1 
it was that year however that reminded us that huston was still at the top of his game as evinced by his faithful adaptation of james joyces acclaimed novella the dead 1 
doesnt work at all i bougth it for my l7c and its not working 0 
the headset fulfills my requirements so i am happy with my purchase 1 
ive also had problems with the phone reading the memory card in which i always turn it on and then off again 0 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
very friendly staff 1 
which are small and not worth the price 0 
much more interesting more action more suspense and less of the unneeded controversy 1 
the worst sappiest dialogue i could go on and on 0 
probably not in a hurry to go back 0 
there were several moments in the movie that just didnt need to be there and were excruciatingly slow moving 0 
very true to shakespear and a must for all shakespear fans 1 
they brought a fresh batch of fries and i was thinking yay something warm but no 0 
the restaurant is very clean and has a family restaurant feel to it 1 
everything on the menu is terrific and we were also thrilled that they made amazing accommodations for our vegetarian daughter 1 
it is well made easy to access the phone and has a handy detachable belt clip 1 
much better than the other ayce sushi place i went to in vegas 1 
the food was terrible 0 
after watching this film i wanted to learn more about the works of this artist 1 
the microphone also works well but according to people i have called it applifies everything 1 
youll love how thin it is 1 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
you cant beat that 1 
the plastic breaks really easy on this clip 0 
if it was to turn my good day feeling into a night of disturbing memories than i guess he succeeded 0 
perhaps i caught them on an off night judging by the other reviews but im not inspired to go back 0 
made very sturdy 1 
i also decided not to send it back because our waitress looked like she was on the verge of having a heart attack 0 
but if you liked movies like the matrix and better yet their sequels i think youll appreciate the thought provoking mindblowing experience this film will give you 1 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
i do think tom hanks is a good actor 1 
waited and waited and waited 0 
if you want a real scare rent this one 1 
none of it works just dont buy it 0 
the sergeant pepper beef sandwich with auju sauce is an excellent sandwich as well 1 
it has everything i need and i couldnt ask for more 1 
this item is fantastic and works perfectly 1 
this movie contained an allstar cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i havent seen before 1 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
i guess i liked the details of his dysfunctionhe was believable 1 
i love this thing 1

this film highlights the fundamental flaws of the legal process that its not about discovering guilt or innocence but rather is about who presents better in court 1 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
omg the food was delicioso 1 
crash is a depressing little nothing that provokes emotion but teaches you nothing if you already know racism and prejudice are bad things 0 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
we will not be coming back 0 
each day of the week they have a different deal and its all so delicious 1 
the voice recognition thru the handset is excellent 1 
im not sure how long we stood there but it was long enough for me to begin to feel awkwardly out of place 0 
macbeth jason connery moved me to tears with his final monolog out brief candle outhe gave the sphere of moral decay and dark forces a human face which makes it the more interesting 1 
i have had this phone for over a year now and i will tell you its not that great 0 
it really is impressive that the place hasnt closed down 0 
waste of 13 bucks 0 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
i swung in to give them a try but was deeply disappointed 0 
waitress was a little slow in service 0 
this place receives stars for their appetizers 1 
considering the relations off screen between taylor and stanwyck it was surprising how little chemistry there was on screen between the two of them 0 
perfect for the ps3 1 
the bipolarity of the ruthless thug one minute a ruthless killer the next minute a luvs diaper commercial is completely unconvincing 0 
i had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get some relief 0 
her lines seem to have been written by a fifteen year old though they are trying oh so so hard to sound like how a fifteen year old would really um you know well talk 0 
highly unrecommended 0 
a cheap and cheerless heist movie with poor characterisation lots of underbite style stoic emoting think chow yun fat in a better tomorrow and some cheesy clichés thrown into an abandoned factory ready for a few poorly executed flying judo rolls a la john woo 0 
it was way over fried 0 
i never come again 0 
every element of this story was so over the top excessively phony and contrived that it was painful to sit through 0 
i asked multiple times for the wine list and after some time of being ignored i went to the hostess and got one myself 0 
last time buying from you 0

this game rocks 1 
hands down my favorite italian restaurant 1 
i didnt want the clip going over the top of my ear causing discomfort 0 
clear crisp sound 1 
they work about 2 weeks then break 0 
it kept getting worse and worse so now im officially done 0 
if you see it you should probably just leave it on the shelf 0 
hitchcock is a great director 1 
dont waste your money 0 
excellent dualpurpose headset 1 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
this case has passed the one year mark and while it shows signs of wear it is 100 functional 1 
nothing short of magnificent photographycinematography in this film 1 
yes this film does require a rather significant amount of puzzlesolving but the pieces fit together to create a beautiful picture 1 
about half way through this film i started to dislike it 0 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
5 stars for the brick oven bread app 1 
is pretty funny 1 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
good audio quality 1 
this place deserves no stars 0

disappointing accessory from a good manufacturer 0 
the movie has almost no action scenes in it and very little comedy 0

google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0 
there was hardly any meat 0 
i struggle to find anything bad to say about it 1 
that one didnt work either 0 
i love that they put their food in nice plastic containers as opposed to cramming it in little paper takeout boxes 1 
still waiting im sure this item would work well if i ever recieve it 0 
the acting by the whole cast could be put on a scale and balanced perfectly between overacting and underacting 0 
we wont be going back 0 
at first glance it is a lovely bakery cafe nice ambiance clean friendly staff 1 
the explosion of the gas tanks at the end was just as awful 0 
you have to hold the phone at a particular angle for the other party to hear you clearly 0 
i wish i could enter negative values admins 0 
also the phone doesnt seem to accept anything except cbr mp3s preferably ripped by windows media player 0 
i guess i should have known that this place would suck because it is inside of the excalibur but i didnt use my common sense 0 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
this is a great product sure beats using your fingers 1 
youd have to have the iq of particularly stupid mollusk not to see that one coming 0 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
my brother in law who works at the mall ate here same day and guess what he was sick all night too 0 
any ring toneoverall good phone to buy 1 
it is easy to turn on and off when you are in the car and the volume controls are quite accessable 1 
there are many continuity errors one other user commented on different cars in the garage joes glassesthe one that got to me the most was the fact joes facial hair configuration seemed to change from scene to scene 0 
seller shipped quickly and much cheaper than the competitors 1 
weve tried to like this place but after 10 times i think were done with them 0 
they do not last forever but is not overly expensive to replaceeasy to operate and the sound is much better than others i have tried 1 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
the characters are interesting and you want to find out more about them the longer the movie goes on and i think people will be surprised by who does and doesnt make it 1 
i did not bother contacting the company for few dollar product but i learned the lesson that i should not have bought this form online anyway 0 
headset works great was packaged nicely to avoid any damage 1 
excellent product for the price 1 
leopard print is wonderfully wild 1

this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
this is simply the best bluetooth headset for sound quality 1

he owns the film just as spacek owned coal miners daughter and quaid owned great balls of fire 1 
i will never go back to this place and will never ever recommended this place to anyone 0 
the potatoes were great and so was the biscuit 1 
the service was outshining i definitely recommend the halibut 1

the service was poor and thats being nice 0 
everything is appalling 0 
this is the phone to get for 2005 i just bought my s710a and all i can say is wow 1 
it is a really good show to watch 1 
overall i was not impressed and would not go back 0

this was a poor remake of my best friends wedding 0 
the films dialogue is natural real to life 1 
i knew when i saw the film that more great things were to come from this gifted actor 1 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
to summarize the food was incredible nay transcendant but nothing brings me joy quite like the memory of the pneumatic condiment dispenser 1 
if youre not familiar check it out 1 
1 hour 54 minutes of sheer tedium melodrama and horrible acting a mess of a script and a sinking feeling of good lord what were they thinking 0 
i cant wait to go back 1

poor construction 0 
i was amazed at the quick arrival of the two original lg cell phone batteries and and at a fraction of the price 1 
we ordered the duck rare and it was pink and tender on the inside with a nice char on the outside 1 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
great for ipods too 1 
i ordered the lemon raspberry ice cocktail which was also incredible 1 
after i pulled up my car i waited for another 15 minutes before being acknowledged 0 
the movie was so boring that i sometimes found myself occupied peaking in the paper instead of watching never happened during a columbo movie before 0 
avoid at all cost 0 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1
