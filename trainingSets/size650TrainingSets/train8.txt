2 times very bad customer service 0 
so far so good 1 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
the cow tongue and cheek tacos are amazing 1 
this is infuriating 0 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
excellent dualpurpose headset 1 
it just blew 0 
awesome device 1 
it is wonderful and inspiring to watch and i hope that it gets released again on to video or dvd 1 
if you are razr owneryou must have this 1 
id advise anyone to go and see it 1 
just really good so far probably the best bt headset i have ever had 1 
at first glance it is a lovely bakery cafe nice ambiance clean friendly staff 1 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
the cast was great 1 
nice design and quality 1 
and i really did find them funny 1 
however the keypads are so tinny that i sometimes reach the wrong buttons 0 
the story line is totally predictable 0 
it lasts less than 3o minutes if i actually try to use the phonemy wife has the same phone with the same problem 0 
wont go back 0 
have been going since 2007 and every meal has been awesome 1 
i ate there twice on my last visit and especially enjoyed the salmon salad 1 
we walked away stuffed and happy about our first vegas buffet experience 1 
the jerky camera movements were also annoying 0 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
however the keypads are so tinny that i sometimes reach the wrong buttons 0 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
the characters are interesting and you really care for them 1 
she carries the movie well 1 
restaurant is always full but never a wait 1 
wasted two hours 0 
i love this cable it allows me to connect any miniusb device to my pc 1 
this place is handsdown one of the best places to eat in the phoenix metro area 1 
excellent starter wireless headset 0 
i did not have any problem with this item and would order it again if needed 1 
love this product 1 
i cannot believe that the actors agreed to do this film 0 
its a great item 1 
those burgers were amazing 1 
no additional ear gels provided and no instructions whatsoever 0 
its extremely slow and takes forever to do anything with it 0 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
i got it because it was so small and adorable 1 
lordy the khao soi is a dish that is not to be missed for curry lovers 1 
always a great time at dos gringos 1 
same problem as others have mentioned 0 
we recently witnessed her poor quality of management towards other guests as well 0 
small sleek impressive looking practical setup with ample storage in place 1 
the acting was decidely wooden though no worse than a period universal b movie 0 
i received my supposedly new motorola 375 and apparently there was not a match between the phone and the charger 0 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
price is good too 1 
superb phone on a great network 1 
this movie suffered because of the writing it needed more suspense 0 
the movie had you on the edge of your seat and made you somewhat afraid to go to your car at the end of the night 1 
your staff spends more time talking to themselves than me 0 
great pork sandwich 1 
its practically perfect in all of them  a true masterpiece in a sea of faux masterpieces 1 
editing the editing of this film was phenomenal in my opinion 1 
items stated as included from the description are not included 0 
these headphones were a great find and i think they are perhaps the best purchase ive made in the last several years seriously 1 
i highly recommend this case 1 
i never come again 0 
editing the editing of this film was phenomenal in my opinion 1 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
excellent short film 1 
even if you love bad movies do not watch this movie 0 
my drink was never empty and he made some really great menu suggestions 1 
spend your money and time some place else 0 
overall i like there food and the service 1 
and finally after all that we get to an ending that wouldve been great had it been handled by competent people and not jerry falwell 0 
the voice recognition thru the handset is excellent 1 
will not be back 0 
you learn a lot about the real inside emotions of people in this movie and a lot about the movie business itself 1 
i contacted the company and they told me that although the unit was still under warranty if i couldnt produce my receipt i was out of luck 0 
another note about this phones appearance is that it really looks rather bland especially in the all black model 0 
it definitely was not as good as my s11 1 
too politically correct 0 
so for our enjoyment we get to see them run around play games and be dangerous 1 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
sam shepards portrayal of a gung ho marine was sobering 1 
the interplay between martin and emilio contains the same wonderful chemistry we saw in wall street with martin and charlie 1 
im not eating here 0 
the only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive 1 
crostini that came with the salad was stale 0 
not a good item it worked for a while then started having problems in my auto reverse tape player 0 
but it does get better reception and clarity than any phone ive had before 1 
this blueant supertooth handsfree phone speaker is awesome 1 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
the staff is great the food is delish and they have an incredible beer selection 1 
the turkey and roast beef were bland 0 
i thought errol flynn was brilliant as custer and has since become my favourite actor 1 
the service was poor and thats being nice 0 
the fact is this film is a wonderful heartwarming tale about two people chasing their dreams 1 
it is a joy to use 1 
the ambiance isnt much better 0 
highly recommended 1 
also notable is john baileys fine crisp beautifully colored cinematography and the great production design costumes by eiko ishioka who went on to do the memorable costumes for coppolas dracula for which she received a well deserved oscar 1 
setup went very smoothly 1 
the only good thing was our waiter he was very helpful and kept the bloddy marys coming 1 
poor sound quality 0 
i dont each much pasta but i love the homemade hand made pastas and thin pizzas here 1 
i had the mac salad and it was pretty bland so i will not be getting that again 0 
but now i was completely grossed out 0 
the sangria was about half of a glass wine full and was 12 ridiculous 0 
editing the editing of this film was phenomenal in my opinion 1 
if you look for authentic thai food go else where 0 
all the characters in this film are tremendously well played 1 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
not only did the software do a great job of this i could also make my own ringtones form my existing cds without an internet connection 1 
i did not expect this to be so good 1 
fantastic buy and will get again for whatever my next phone is 1 
i cannot make calls at certain places 0 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
the refried beans that came with my meal were dried out and crusty and the food was bland 0 
to sum the film up breeders is a terrible cheaply made horror movie that should be avoided like the ebola virus 0 
i cant wait to go back 1 
worst service to boot but that is the least of their worries 0 
i was particularly pleased with the acting ability of dwight schultz 1 
looks great and is strong 1 
new battery works great in phone 1 
my first visit to hiro was a delight 1 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
i have yet to run this new battery below two bars and thats three days without charging 1 
setup went very smoothly 1 
if the food isnt bad enough for you then enjoy dealing with the worlds worstannoying drunk people 0 
gotta love those closeups of slimy drooling teeth 1 
i am going to have to be the first to negatively review this product 0 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
so far so good 1 
to my disbelief each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods i have ever tasted 0 
steve martin delivers a really funny performance of a middleaged upper class uptight white guy 1 
poorly contstruct hinge 0 
doesnt hold charge 0 
i could care less the interior is just beautiful 1 
food was really boring 0 
we recently witnessed her poor quality of management towards other guests as well 0 
also difficult to put onid recommend avoiding this product 0 
awesome device 1 
if you want a real scare rent this one 1 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
this is simply the best bluetooth headset for sound quality 1 
excellent dualpurpose headset 1 
one of the worst shows of all time 0 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
see it 1 
the acting from all involved and that includes those like shatner and nimoy is bad and washed out and making them seem as old as they look in real life the special effects are tacky like when spock has to rescue kirk on a jet pack when he falls down from a mountain 0 
works like a charm it work the same as the one i got with the phone 1 
wow very spicy but delicious 1 
after arguing with verizon regarding the dropped calls we returned the phones after two days 0 
the ri style calamari was a joke 0 
hated it 0 
it is so small and you dont even realize that it is there after a while of getting used to it 1 
i did not have any problem with this item and would order it again if needed 1 
great product for the price 1 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
hackneyed writing certainly but made even worse by the bad directing 0 
about half way through this film i started to dislike it 0 
this wonderful experience made this place a muststop whenever we are in town again 1 
how stupid is that 0 
the plot has more holes than a pair of fishnet stockings and the direction and editing is astonishingly ham fisted 0 
the music in the film is really nice too 1 
one of my favorite purchases ever 1 
i love the ownerchef his one authentic japanese cool dude 1 
first off the reception sucks i have never had more than 2 bars ever 0 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
we are so glad we found this place 1 
unfortunately this is a bad movie that is just plain bad 0 
i have only had it for a few weeks but so far so good 1 
it plays louder than any other speaker of this size the price is so low that most would think the quality is lacking however its not 1 
star trek v the final frontier is the worst in the series 0 
doesnt last long 0 
the attention given to every character and complex psychological portrayals detailing loyalty treachery love and hope are tremendous 1 
an italian reviewer called this a small great film and thats right 1 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
this is a good battery and it got here really fast 1 
in an interesting part of town this place is amazing 1 
this is the place where i first had pho and it was amazing 1 
it was packed 0 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
voice recognition is tremendous 1 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
disappointment i hate anything that goes in my ear 0 
it was just not a fun experience 1 
the only thing really worth watching was the scenery and the house because it is beautiful 1 
the whole experience was underwhelming and i think well just go to ninja sushi next time 0 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
but despite these few flaws this case is of exceptional quality and well worth the additional costs of owning an official oem product 1 
echo problemvery unsatisfactory 0 
rude inconsiderate management 0 
there still are good actors around 1 
the only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port irda 0 
im so sorry but i really cant recommend it to anyone 0 
i used bitpim a free program you can find on the internetto transfer data to the phonethe price of the cable was excellent 1 
i know he was a contract player with little control over his scripts but the acting was as bad as the script 0 
couldnt ask for a more satisfying meal 1 
however my girl was complain that some time the phone doesnt wake up like normal phone does 0 
the nachos are a must have 1 
it was that year however that reminded us that huston was still at the top of his game as evinced by his faithful adaptation of james joyces acclaimed novella the dead 1 
talk about useless customer service 0 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
no real improvement 0 
highly recommended for all ages although the younger set will probably not appreciate some of the more subtle references they will certainly appreciate one galley scene in particular 1 
but then they came back cold 0 
i would advise to not purchase this item it never worked very well 0 
of course the footage from the 70s was grainy but that only enhanced the film 1 
think of the film being like a dream 1 
the pizza tasted old super chewy in not a good way 0 
initially the local sites in the film which was filmed here in buffalo intrigued me 1 
im not really sure how joeys was voted best hot dog in the valley by readers of phoenix magazine 0 
for readers who have already seen one of miyazakis films he is still in top form and made another worthwhile experience 1 
battery has no life 0 
never heard of any of them except cole who was totally unbelievable in the part 0 
my headset works just peachykeen 1 
i can say that the desserts were yummy 1 
still its quite interesting and entertaining to follow 1 
simple lightweight and great fit 1 
the greek dressing was very creamy and flavorful 1 
ive never been more insulted or felt disrespected 0 
none of them are engaging or exciting 0 
the football scenes at the end were perplexing 0 
im still infatuated with this phone 1 
she carries the movie well 1 
its a piece of crap 0 
terrible management 0 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
the acting was bad 0 
the only very disappointing thing was there was no speakerphone 0 
the plot simply rumbles on like a machine desperately depending on the addition of new scenes 0 
the sound quality for the device is unacceptableunless you are in a really quiet area you almost hear nothing 0 
nice sound 1 
i have always used corded headsets and the freedom from the wireless is very helpful 1 
ray charles is legendary 1 
i was so insulted 0 
the acting helps the writing along very well maybe the idiotsavant sister could have been played better and it is a real joy to watch 1 
i hate to disagree with my fellow yelpers but my husband and i were so disappointed with this place 0 
really awful 0 
crust is not good 0 
hence the whole story lacks a certain energy 0 
see both films if you can 1 
nothing at all to recommend 0 
as for the service i thought it was good 1 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
cant say enough good things about this place 1 
the phone is sturdy and waterproof 1 
i dont think ill be running back to carlys anytime soon for food 0 
as for the service im a fan because its quick and youre being served by some nice folks 1 
our server was super nice and checked on us many times 1 
its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
these are certainly very comfortable and functionality is decent 1 
their chow mein is so good 1 
the story is also both funny and poignant at times 1 
they have horrible attitudes towards customers and talk down to each one when customers dont enjoy their food 0 
ordered burger rare came in well done 0 
the refried beans that came with my meal were dried out and crusty and the food was bland 0 
id rather eat airline food seriously 0 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
the bottowm lineanother worthless cheap gimmick from sprint 0 
beware this is not a trashy cult movie this is trash period 0 
im really disappointed all i have now is a charger that doesnt work 0 
there is however some pretty good acting at least for this type of film 1 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
stay away from the q 0 
ive owned this phone for 7 months now and can say that its the best mobile phone ive had 1 
if you simply want a small flip phone look elsewhere as the extra bells whistles are mediocre 0 
lot of holes in the plot theres nothing about how he became the emperor nothing about where he spend 20 years between his childhood and mature age 0 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
by the time the film ended i not only disliked it i despised it 0 
too politically correct 0 
the staff are also very friendly and efficient 1 
every element of this story was so over the top excessively phony and contrived that it was painful to sit through 0 
the plot is nonsense that doesnt interest in the slightest way or have any uniqueness to it 0 
the 12 mega pixel camera being a part of a phone is reasonably good7 1 
portable and it works 1 
the aerial scenes were welldone 1 
it looks very nice 1 
to those who find this movie intelligent or even masterful i can only say its your intelligence and your imagination you obviously used to try and make some sense of this pitiful attempt its in our human nature to try and make sense of things 0 
the feel of the dining room was more college cooking course than high class dining and the service was slow at best 0 
they are so easy to love but even more easy to identify with 1 
this really is how vegas fine dining used to be right down to the menus handed to the ladies that have no prices listed 1 
i saw it as a child on tv back in 1973 when it was the stranger and i loved it 1 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
also the area where my unit broke im not too fond of the magnetic strap 0 
great for the jawbone 1 
waitress was good though 1 
dessert panna cotta was amazing 1 
my salad had a bland vinegrette on the baby greens and hearts of palm 0 
service stinks here 0 
this place is way too overpriced for mediocre food 0 
wasted two hours 0 
not much seafood and like 5 strings of pasta at the bottom 0 
its one of the movies i need to see whenever it comes on tvnever mind the fact that i already have it memorized 1 
the best example of how dumb the writing is when its established that you can turn the zombiestudents back into humans by removing a necklace containing a piece of the meteorite 0 
the buttons for on and off are bad 0 
after one bite i was hooked 1 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
great phone 1 
a standout scene 1 
great product for the price 1 
i felt as though her going to ireland did absolutely nothing whatsoever 0 
i hope this place sticks around 1 
i was amazed at the quick arrival of the two original lg cell phone batteries and and at a fraction of the price 1 
the restaurant is very clean and has a family restaurant feel to it 1 
perhaps i caught them on an off night judging by the other reviews but im not inspired to go back 0 
come hungry leave happy and stuffed 1 
there was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth but it didnt really work into the rest of the plot 0 
light weight i hardly notice it is there 1 
soggy and not good 0 
verizon tech support walked my through a few procedures none of which worked and i ended up having to do a hard reset wiping out all my data 0 
i found the product to be easy to set up and use 1 
the food was delicious our bartender was attentive and personable and we got a great deal 1 
i highly recommend this case 1 
none of the new ones have ever quite worked properly 0 
the success of the film depends on the casting of sydney greenstreet as the alexander yardley character 1 
things that went wrong they burned the saganaki 0 
clear skype calls long battery life long range 1 
they were excellent 1 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
yet plantronincs continues to use the same flawed charger design 0 
i will be back many times soon 1 
of course the footage from the 70s was grainy but that only enhanced the film 1 
for the price this was a great deal 1 
the casting is also horrible cause all you see is a really really bad actors period 0 
2 times very bad customer service 0 
you wont regret it 1 
treo and tmobile refused to replace it again and forced me to buy another phone without any kind of upgrade discount 0 
but it picked up speed and got right to the point 1 
enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film 1 
it doesnt work in europe or asia 0 
i have to mention this and it is a huge spoiler i loved the ending how all the characters of the three films were the remaining survivors of the ferry disaster with valentine and the young judge together and the old man watching it on her tv solidifying his happiness over the suffering which he dealt with for those many years 1 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
dont waste your time here 0 
i let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this bad idea we both hated it 0 
i really like this product over the motorola because it is allot clearer on the ear piece and the mic 1 
this product had a strong rubberpetroleum smell that was unbearable after a while and caused me to return it 0 
i love the look and feel of samsung flipphones 1 
the food was great as always compliments to the chef 1 
some highlights great quality nigiri here 1 
in the summer you can dine in a charming outdoor patio so very delightful 1 
some applause should be given to the prelude however 1 
car charger as well as ac charger are included to make sure you never run out of juicehighy recommended 1 
my boyfriend tried the mediterranean chicken salad and fell in love 1 
dont waste your time watching this rubbish nonresearched film 0 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
one of the worst shows of all time 0 
a cheap and cheerless heist movie with poor characterisation lots of underbite style stoic emoting think chow yun fat in a better tomorrow and some cheesy clichés thrown into an abandoned factory ready for a few poorly executed flying judo rolls a la john woo 0 
again no plot at all 0 
when achille and philippa beautifully sing a duet from don giovanni that perfectly describes their situation in the movie you appreciate the subtle layers of this excellent film 1 
i wouldnt return 0 
this is the first phone ive had that has been so cheaply made 0 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
bland not a liking this place for a number of reasons and i dont want to waste time on bad reviewing ill leave it at that 0 
it is just the sort of pap that is screened in the afternoon to punish the unemployed for not having jobs 0 
on the up side their cafe serves really good food 1 
never heard of any of them except cole who was totally unbelievable in the part 0 
kind of hard to mess up a steak but they did 0 
2 times very bad customer service 0 
there was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters 0 
not only did the software do a great job of this i could also make my own ringtones form my existing cds without an internet connection 1 
this film tries to be a serious and sophisticated thrillerhorror flick and it fails miserably 0 
go and see it 1 
the movie showed a lot of florida at its best made it look very appealing 1 
to sum the film up breeders is a terrible cheaply made horror movie that should be avoided like the ebola virus 0 
on a positive note our server was very attentive and provided great service 1 
it failed to convey the broad sweep of landscapes that were a great part of the original 0 
i go to far too many places and ive never seen any restaurant that serves a 1 egg breakfast especially for 400 0 
judith light is one of my favorite actresses and i think she does a superb job in this film 1 
so flavorful and has just the perfect amount of heat 1 
awsome device works great 1 
rip off over charge shipping 0 
its just adorable seeing mickey playing turkey in the straw in a highly imaginative if occasionally cruel way 1 
is it possible for a movie to get any worse than this 0 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
what happened next was prettyoff putting 0 
come hungry leave happy and stuffed 1 
very disappointed in accessoryone 0 
it was that year however that reminded us that huston was still at the top of his game as evinced by his faithful adaptation of james joyces acclaimed novella the dead 1 
lordy the khao soi is a dish that is not to be missed for curry lovers 1 
initially the local sites in the film which was filmed here in buffalo intrigued me 1 
i am very impressed with this headset from plantronics 1 
the food was great as always compliments to the chef 1 
blue ant is easy to use 1 
i am also very happy with the price 1 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
the pizza tasted old super chewy in not a good way 0 
the ripped banana was not only ripped but petrified and tasteless 0 
good servicecheck 1 
if it was to turn my good day feeling into a night of disturbing memories than i guess he succeeded 0 
which is precisely why i am giving it such a bad review 0 
much less than the jawbone i was going to replace it with 1 
babie bop is very cute 1 
this is the first phone ive had that has been so cheaply made 0 
i only hear garbage for audio 0 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
if she had not rolled the eyes we may have stayed not sure if we will go back and try it again 0 
they have horrible attitudes towards customers and talk down to each one when customers dont enjoy their food 0 
but it picked up speed and got right to the point 1 
i would highly recommend this product 1 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is vegas and located inside the crystals shopping mall by aria 1 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
they have great dinners 1 
it was that year however that reminded us that huston was still at the top of his game as evinced by his faithful adaptation of james joyces acclaimed novella the dead 1 
but if you liked movies like the matrix and better yet their sequels i think youll appreciate the thought provoking mindblowing experience this film will give you 1 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
service stinks here 0 
a good quality bargain i bought this after i bought a cheapy from big lots that sounded awful and people on the other end couldnt hear me 1 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
schrader has made a resume full of lousy amateurish films 0 
the plot simply rumbles on like a machine desperately depending on the addition of new scenes 0 
fantastic food 1 
victor mclaglen was even bad and brian donlevy was almost unrecognizable 0 
all in all id expected a better consumer experience from motorola 0 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
i would give this television series a 10 plus if i could 1 
waitress was a little slow in service 0 
then theres the plot holes 0 
the food is about on par with dennys which is to say not good at all 0 
i have yet to run this new battery below two bars and thats three days without charging 1 
interesting decor 1 
rip off over charge shipping 0 
my girlfriends veal was very bad 0 
the cinematographyif it can be called thatsucked 0 
say bye bye to your tip lady 0 
avoid this film at all costs 0 
this is one of the best movies out there that shows such strong sibling bond for each other 1 
the eargels channel the sound directly into your ear and seem to increase the sound volume and clarity 1 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
this place should honestly be blown up 0 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
their frozen margaritas are way too sugary for my taste 0 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
four stars for the food the guy in the blue shirt for his great vibe still letting us in to eat 1 
perhaps i caught them on an off night judging by the other reviews but im not inspired to go back 0 
could not get strong enough signal 0 
what on earth is irons doing in this film 0 
dont make the same mistake that i did and please dont buy this phone 0 
i love this place 1 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
i ordered the voodoo pasta and it was the first time id had really excellent pasta since going gluten free several years ago 1 
fast service 1 
his losing his marbles so early in the proceedings is totally implausible and unconvincing 0 
a very good film indeed about great and unconditional love 1 
their chow mein is so good 1 
i got it because it was so small and adorable 1 
the movie is not completely perfect but titta di girolamo will stay with you for a long time after the vision of the movie 1 
keep up the good work amazon 1 
sounds good reasonably priced and effective its that simple 1 
i love this device 1 
im big fan of rpg games too but this movie its a disgrace to any selfrespecting rpger there is 0 
amazon sucks 0 
his losing his marbles so early in the proceedings is totally implausible and unconvincing 0 
you share general loewenhielms exquisite joy in his partaking of the cailles en sarcophage even though you are just watching a movie but you do wish for just a small sample to savor 1 
well just if you keep thinking how bad it is 0 
works well 1 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
what a mistake 0 
i had the chicken pho and it tasted very bland 0 
at a time when it seems that film animation has been dominated by disneypixars cgi masterpieces it is both refreshing and comforting to know that miyazaki is still relying on traditional handdrawn animation to tell his charming and enchanting stories 1 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
piece of trash 0 
great choice 1 
ill put this gem up against any movie in terms of screenplay cinematography acting postproduction editing directing or any other aspect of filmmaking 1 
the only place good for this film is in the garbage 0 
so just beware 0 
im a bit disappointed 0 
disappointing accessory from a good manufacturer 0 
over rated 0 
i hate movies like that 0 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
this is one of the worst sandra bullock movie since speed 2 but not quite that bad 0 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
i want to first say our server was great and we had perfect service 1 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
the ambience is wonderful and there is music playing 1 
also difficult to put onid recommend avoiding this product 0 
i own 2 of these cases and would order another 1 
the movie showed a lot of florida at its best made it look very appealing 1 
first time there and might just be the last 0 
first off the reception sucks i have never had more than 2 bars ever 0 
reception is terrible and full of static 0 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
the interplay between martin and emilio contains the same wonderful chemistry we saw in wall street with martin and charlie 1 
it is wonderful and inspiring to watch and i hope that it gets released again on to video or dvd 1 
very much disappointed with this company 0 
there was a warm feeling with the service and i felt like their guest for a special treat 1 
i had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get some relief 0 
disappointment i hate anything that goes in my ear 0 
i did not bother contacting the company for few dollar product but i learned the lesson that i should not have bought this form online anyway 0 
tonight i had the elk filet specialand it sucked 0 
we were promptly greeted and seated 1 
will never ever go back and have told many people what had happened 0 
ill give this film 10 out of 10 1 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
everything about it is fine and reasonable for the price ie 1 
a good commentary of todays love and undoubtedly a film worth seeing 1 
the lighting is just dark enough to set the mood 1 
the charger worked for about a week and then completely stopped charging my phone 0 
we got the food and apparently they have never heard of salt and the batter on the fish was chewy 0 
perfect for someone me who only likes beer ice cold or in this case even colder 1 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
nice case feels good in your hands 1 
i love the scream movies and all horror movies and this one ranks way up there 1 
i had verizon 2 years ago and really liked their service 1 
i will continue to come here on ladies night andddd date night highly recommend this place to anyone who is in the area 1 
this movie creates its own universe and is fascinating in every way 1 
i do think tom hanks is a good actor 1 
i love the camera its really pretty good quality 1 
its not user friendly 0 
a very good film indeed about great and unconditional love 1 
the inside is really quite nice and very clean 1 
its pretty easy 1 
punishment park is a brilliant piece of cinema 1 
i had a salad with the wings and some ice cream for dessert and left feeling quite satisfied 1 
its not user friendly 0 
when i received my pita it was huge it did have a lot of meat in it so thumbs up there 1 
i would avoid this place if you are staying in the mirage 0 
i did not expect this to be so good 1 
if you want a real scare rent this one 1 
happy so far 1 
however paul schrader has indeed made a film about mishima that is both superb complex 1 
when i placed my treo into the case not only was it not snug but there was a lot of extra room on the sides 0 
the chips and sals a here is amazing 1 
the chefs were friendly and did a good job 1 
i have had problems wit hit dropping signal and more 0 
great phone 1 
im pleased 1 
steve martin delivers a really funny performance of a middleaged upper class uptight white guy 1 
1010 1 
just what i wanted 1 
this place receives stars for their appetizers 1 
phenomenal food service and ambiance 1 
you wont regret it 1 
the cg opening sequence in space looked like it could have been created on microsoft slideshow for gods sake 0 
if it was to turn my good day feeling into a night of disturbing memories than i guess he succeeded 0 
my brother in law who works at the mall ate here same day and guess what he was sick all night too 0 
it was just too horrible 0 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
not sure who was more lost the flat characters or the audience nearly half of whom walked out 0 
but the movie makes a lot of serious mistakes 0 
it features an outlandish array of memorable psychotic but lovable nuts 1 
both rickman and stowe play their roles to the hilt in this tale of a childrens book writer who maybe has written a subversive tract 1 
after i pulled up my car i waited for another 15 minutes before being acknowledged 0 
if you love authentic mexican food and want a whole bunch of interesting yet delicious meats to choose from you need to try this place 1 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
plug was the wrong size 0 
the only thing that i think could improve is the sound leaks out from the headset 0 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
crash is a depressing little nothing that provokes emotion but teaches you nothing if you already know racism and prejudice are bad things 0 
i love this place 1 
poor talk time performance 0 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
regardless the film fails on most levels 0 
garbo who showed right off the bat that her talents could carry over from the silent era i wanted to see some of her silent work but netflix doesnt seem to be stocking them 1 
bacon is hella salty 1 
after the disappointing dinner we went elsewhere for dessert 0 
our server was very nice and even though he looked a little overwhelmed with all of our needs he stayed professional and friendly until the end 1 
alexander nevsky is a great film 1 
this product is clearly not ready for prime time i dont care how cool it looks if you cant tell a call is coming in its worthless 0 
linksys should have some way to exchange a bad phone for a refurb unit or something 0 
i cant believe theres even a sequel to this 0 
bad script bad direction and horrible acting make this one plain bad 0 
excellent product for the price 1 
the staff are also very friendly and efficient 1 
the design is very odd as the ear clip is not very comfortable at all 0 
the music in the film is really nice too 1 
dont buy it 0 
freezes frequently4 0 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
lame would be the best way to describe it 0 
penne vodka excellent 1 
im really disappointed all i have now is a charger that doesnt work 0 
i am not a filmmaker nor am i a director but i would hide my head in the sand if id spent whatever amount of money and time on this movie 0 
we wont be going back 0 
very bad experience 0 
waste your money on this game 1 
in conclusion i will not bother with this movie because a volcano in los angeles is nothing but nonsense 0 
seriously killer hot chai latte 1 
this is one of the better buffets that i have been to 1 
great movie 1 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
waste your money on this game 1 
they dropped more than the ball 0 
i have tried these cables with my computer and my ipod and it works just fine 1 
it was a riot to see hugo weaving play a sexobsessed gay real estate salesman who uses his clients houses for his trysts with the flaming darren tom hollander 1 
not as good as i had hoped 0 
our server was very nice and even though he looked a little overwhelmed with all of our needs he stayed professional and friendly until the end 1 
if good intentions made a film great then this film might be one of the greatest films ever made 1 
ambience is perfect 1 
but it picked up speed and got right to the point 1 
i bought this to use with my kindle fire and absolutely loved it 1 
i am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this 1 
this film tries to be a serious and sophisticated thrillerhorror flick and it fails miserably 0 
kris kristoffersen is good in this movie and really makes a difference 1 
it crackles with an unpredictable youthful energy but honestly i found it hard to follow and concentrate on it meanders so badly 0 
the soundtrack wasnt terrible either 1 
the potato chip order was sad i could probably count how many chips were in that box and it was probably around 12 0 
for 40 bucks a head i really expect better food 0 
in fact its hard to remember that the part of ray charles is being acted and not played by the man himself 1 
10 out of 10 stars 1 
it looses connection to the phone even when it is within a couple feet between the two 0 
the handsfree part works fine but then the car tries to download the address book and the treo rebootsoverall i still rate this device high 1 
a pretty good product 1 
however i needed some better instructions 0 
everything on the menu is terrific and we were also thrilled that they made amazing accommodations for our vegetarian daughter 1 
but its just not funny 0 
the story is beyond stupid 0 
the speaker is of low quality so as making the ring tones sound very cheap 0 
even in my bmw 3 series which is fairly quiet i have trouble hearing what the other person is saying 0 
the movie is littered with overt racial slurs towards the black cast members and in return the whites are depicted as morons and boobs 0 
a piece of cinematic garbage captured on celluloid 0 
the nachos are a must have 1 
service sucks 0 
call me a nut but i think this is one of the best movies ever 1 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
i am not a filmmaker nor am i a director but i would hide my head in the sand if id spent whatever amount of money and time on this movie 0 
would not recommend to others 0 
i love the camera its really pretty good quality 1 
worthless product 0 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
is pretty funny 1 
the service was meh 0 
great steak great sides great wine amazing desserts 1 
a fantastic neighborhood gem 1 
its a piece of crap 0 
it shouldnt take 30 min for pancakes and eggs 0 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
but in any case the best part is you can download these pictures to your laptop using ir or even send pictures from your laptop to the phone 1 
good prices 1 
the fact is this film is a wonderful heartwarming tale about two people chasing their dreams 1 
i contacted the company and they told me that although the unit was still under warranty if i couldnt produce my receipt i was out of luck 0 
i tried the cape cod ravoli chickenwith cranberrymmmm 1 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
its one of the most boring horror movies from the 90s mainly because it starts slow and centers in a boring atmosphere 0 
every element of this story was so over the top excessively phony and contrived that it was painful to sit through 0 
no additional ear gels provided and no instructions whatsoever 0 
i get absolutely horrible reception in my apartment where with other phones i have not had this problem 0 
the bathrooms are clean and the place itself is well decorated 1
