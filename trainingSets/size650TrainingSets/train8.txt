either way it sucks 0 
it never condescends all the characters have good genuine hearts and believable problems 1 
on the good side the staff was genuinely pleasant and enthusiastic a real treat 1 
disappointed 0 
not a good item it worked for a while then started having problems in my auto reverse tape player 0 
both films are terrible but to the credit of the 1986 version it was watchable 0 
what the hell kind of crap is that 0 
its a long time since i was so entertained by a movie 1 
when i received my pita it was huge it did have a lot of meat in it so thumbs up there 1 
i waited and waited 0 
not much dialogue not much music the whole film was shot as elaborately and aesthetically like a sculpture 1 
i dressed up to be treated so rudely 0 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
the servers went back and forth several times not even so much as an are you being helped 0 
you get incredibly fresh fish prepared with care 1 
this is an excellent tool especially when paired with your phones autoanswer 1 
i love this cable it allows me to connect any miniusb device to my pc 1 
does not fit 0 
im so happy to be here 1 
it was a great phone 1 
the food came out at a good pace 1 
1010 1 
i gave it 5 stars because of the sound quality 1 
great for ipods too 1 
will order from them again 1 
i gave it a 10 1 
very clear quality sound and you dont have to mess with the sound on your ipod since you have the sound buttons on the headset 1 
you need at least 3 mins to get to your phone book from the time you first turn on the phonebattery life is short 0 
all in all id expected a better consumer experience from motorola 0 
not much dialogue not much music the whole film was shot as elaborately and aesthetically like a sculpture 1 
in fact this stinker smells like a directtovideo release 0 
nonlinear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well 1 
its a great tool for entertainment communication and data managementoh be sure to use activesync 42 for optimal data synchronization results 1 
this is probably the most irritating show i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
poor talk time performance 0 
soyo technology sucks 0 
very nice and relaxing late night viewing 1 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
i have two more years left in this contract and i hate this phone 0 
needless to say i wont be going back anytime soon 0 
this place receives stars for their appetizers 1 
if i take a picture the battery drops a bar and starts beeping letting me know its dieing 0 
the seasonal fruit was fresh white peach puree 1 
1 hour 54 minutes of sheer tedium melodrama and horrible acting a mess of a script and a sinking feeling of good lord what were they thinking 0 
cinematography the film was shot in an interesting way 1 
its practically perfect in all of them  a true masterpiece in a sea of faux masterpieces 1 
my first visit to hiro was a delight 1 
im glad i found this product on amazon it is hard to find it wasnt high priced 1 
i received it quickly and it works great 1 
great hands free device 1 
i could not understand what kind of idiot would produce this mess in the first place not to mention several season 0 
gotta love those closeups of slimy drooling teeth 1 
not much seafood and like 5 strings of pasta at the bottom 0 
if there was ever an indication of a writer and a directors ability to meld two highly volatile temperaments into a seamless union of creativity then this is it 1 
it doesnt make you look cool 0 
i purcashed this for the car charger and it does not work 0 
you cant go wrong with any of the food here 1 
there is no real plot 0 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
not only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic but it also managed to give away the entire movie and im not exaggerating every moment every plot point every joke is told in the trailer 0 
i ordered this for sony ericsson w810i but i think it only worked once thats when i first used it 0 
not worth it 0 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
does everything it should and more 1 
the service here is fair at best 0 
there is a totally unnecessary trainroller coaster scene 0 
very convenient since we were staying at the mgm 1 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
its one of the most boring horror movies from the 90s mainly because it starts slow and centers in a boring atmosphere 0 
its a great tool for entertainment communication and data managementoh be sure to use activesync 42 for optimal data synchronization results 1 
i found a six inch long piece of wire in my salsa 0 
first time going but i think i will quickly become a regular 1 
but this movie is not funny considering the ridiculousness of it 0 
but other than that the movie seemed to drag and the heroes didnt really work for their freedom 0 
however i recently watched the whole thing again on dvd and i was completely struck by how extremely stupid the storyline was how it contained holes inconsistencies and frankly a whole lot of crap and how horrid the dancing was 0 
i had a seriously solid breakfast here 1 
i checked everywhere and there is no feature for it which is really disappointing 0 
dont buy it 0 
if you want a real scare rent this one 1 
it was equally awful 0 
this is a disgrace 0 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
works like a charm it work the same as the one i got with the phone 1 
and those baby owls were adorable 1 
using all earpieces left or right this thing will not stay on my ear 0 
i saw this short film on hbo the other day and absolutely loved it 1 
too politically correct 0 
bluetooth does not work phone locks up screens just flash up and now it just makes calls randomly while in my pocket locked 0 
the battery runs down quickly 0 
the worst one of the series 0 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
it looses connection to the phone even when it is within a couple feet between the two 0 
saggy floppy piece of junk 0 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
its kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly its embarrassing how childlike the company is 0 
the memories are murky but i can only say that i enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show 1 
the cast is always entertaining as usual 1 
i might have gotten a defect but i would not risk buying it again because of the built quality alone 0 
never going back 0 
for readers who have already seen one of miyazakis films he is still in top form and made another worthwhile experience 1 
if you see it you should probably just leave it on the shelf 0 
the phone takes forever to charge like 2 to 5 hours literally 0 
this movie is greatespecially if you enjoy visual arts 1 
so i am here to warn youdo not rent this movie it is the dumbest thing you have never seen 0 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
really bad 0 
the plastic breaks really easy on this clip 0 
not good for the money 0 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
unfortunately it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees 0 
service was fantastic 1 
dont buy this product it fails 0 
the movie is full of wonderful dancing hence the title 1 
bad script bad direction and horrible acting make this one plain bad 0 
good quality 1 
after all the rave reviews i couldnt wait to eat herewhat a disappointment 0 
this phone is pretty sturdy and ive never had any large problems with it 1 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
love this place hits the spot when i want something healthy but not lacking in quantity or flavor 1 
there was hardly any meat 0 
their rotating beers on tap is also a highlight of this place 1 
his use of the colours of the french flag in the three films was nothing short of incredible every shot every scene was like a work of art 1 
poor quality 0 
garbo who showed right off the bat that her talents could carry over from the silent era i wanted to see some of her silent work but netflix doesnt seem to be stocking them 1 
if the food isnt bad enough for you then enjoy dealing with the worlds worstannoying drunk people 0 
highly recommend for any one who has a blue tooth phone 1 
very very disappointed ordered the 35 big bay plater 0 
not what i wanted 0 
the movie is terribly boring in places 0 
the tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu 0 
yes its that bad 0 
i know this is not like the other restaurants at all something is very off here 0 
product was excellent and works better than the verizon one and boy was it cheaper 1 
about half way through this film i started to dislike it 0 
after trying many many handsfree gadgets this is the one that finally works well 1 
this place is awesome if you want something light and healthy during the summer 1 
a great touch 1 
i always order from the vegetarian menu during dinner which has a wide array of options to choose from 1 
a good commentary of todays love and undoubtedly a film worth seeing 1 
the bose noise cancelling is amazing which is very important for a nyc commuter 1 
i also didnt like the on button it felt like it would crack with use 0 
but now that it is out of warranty the same problems reoccurebottom line put your money somewhere else cingular will not support it 0 
highly unprofessional and rude to a loyal patron 0 
this phone is pretty sturdy and ive never had any large problems with it 1 
i loved it it was really scary 1 
this phone might well be the worst ive ever had in any brand 0 
the cast is good 1 
the puppets look really cheesy not in a good way like in the puppet master 80s flicks 0 
crust is not good 0 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
last night was my second time dining here and i was so happy i decided to go back 1 
this place should honestly be blown up 0 
four stars for the food the guy in the blue shirt for his great vibe still letting us in to eat 1 
nice design and quality 1 
i probably would not go here again 0 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
this would not even be good as a made for tv flick 0 
i love this cable it allows me to connect any miniusb device to my pc 1 
ive had no trouble accessing the internet downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions 1 
it is an excellent drama an excellent thriller and an excellent film 1 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
there is however some pretty good acting at least for this type of film 1 
makes it easier to keep up with my bluetooth when im not wearing it 0 
this was a different cut than the piece the other day but still wonderful and tender s well as well flavored 1 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
so i bought about 10 of these and saved alot of money 1 
he also came back to check on us regularly excellent service 1 
my side greek salad with the greek dressing was so tasty and the pita and hummus was very refreshing 1 
you wont be disappointed 1 
good product incredible value 1 
tonight i had the elk filet specialand it sucked 0 
love the margaritas too 1 
i was bored throughout the whole damn thing 0 
i have recommended it to friends 1 
total letdown i would much rather just go to the camelback flower shop and cartel coffee 0 
the sides are delish mixed mushrooms yukon gold puree white corn beateous 1 
sounds good reasonably priced and effective its that simple 1 
it is very comfortable to wear as well which is probably the most important aspect about using a case 1 
in conclusion i will not bother with this movie because a volcano in los angeles is nothing but nonsense 0 
bacon is hella salty 1 
its the one movie that never ceases to interest me simply because it keeps me alert as i try to attempt to decipher its meanings 1 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
if you want a real scare rent this one 1 
i totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is 1 
aside from its terrible lead this film has loads of other debits 0 
level 5 spicy was perfect where spice didnt overwhelm the soup 1 
was not happy 0 
the best scene in the movie was when gerardo is trying to find a song that keeps running through his head 1 
50 down the drain 0 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
also the area where my unit broke im not too fond of the magnetic strap 0 
i love this phone it is very handy and has a lot of features 1 
once you get inside youll be impressed with the place 1 
good case 1 
it probably would have been better if the director hadnt spent most of the movie showcasing his own art work which really isnt that noteworthy 0 
it worked very well 1 
a great film by a great director 1 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
service is quick and friendly 1 
i am going to have to be the first to negatively review this product 0 
if you do go see this movie bring a pillow or a girlfriendboyfriend to keep you occupied through out 0 
this one wants to surf on the small wave of space movies in 1998 deep impact and armageddon and this one fails everywhere 0 
this is actually a very smart movie 1 
and i just love the colors 1 
kind of flops around 0 
nice headset priced right 1 
on the up side their cafe serves really good food 1 
best fish ive ever had in my life 1 
the best place to go for a tasty bowl of pho 1 
the shower area is outside so you can only rinse not take a full shower unless you dont mind being nude for everyone to see 0 
prosgood camera very nice pictures also has cool styles like black and white and more 1 
i do love sushi but i found kabuki to be overpriced overhip and underservices 0 
everything about it is fine and reasonable for the price ie 1 
good servicecheck 1 
it lasts less than 3o minutes if i actually try to use the phonemy wife has the same phone with the same problem 0 
if the food isnt bad enough for you then enjoy dealing with the worlds worstannoying drunk people 0 
just what i wanted 1 
kids pizza is always a hit too with lots of great side dish options for the kiddos 1 
the acting is terrible and the writing is worse 0 
we ordered some old classics and some new dishes after going there a few times and were sorely disappointed with everything 0 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
it is light easy to use and has very clear reception and transmission 1 
it was way over fried 0 
the only suspense i was feeling was the frustration at just how retarded the girls were 0 
greatno problems at all 1 
this blueant supertooth handsfree phone speaker is awesome 1 
a fantastic neighborhood gem 1 
this greedy corporation will never see another dime from me 0 
no complaints 1 
the cashier was friendly and even brought the food out to me 1 
this place is like chipotle but better 1 
how can that bethe audio quality is poor 0 
if there was ever an indication of a writer and a directors ability to meld two highly volatile temperaments into a seamless union of creativity then this is it 1 
you wont be disappointed 1 
their daily specials are always a hit with my group 1 
we got sitting fairly fast but ended up waiting 40 minutes just to place our order another 30 minutes before the food arrived 0 
much less than the jawbone i was going to replace it with 1 
but when someone strives for greatness and poetry but delivers a muddled and often ridiculous story a bunch of disparate scenes pretentious dialogue then you get the worst kind of a movie that some other reviewer very accurately defined as pretentious crap 0 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
bland and flavorless is a good way of describing the barely tepid meat 0 
the potato chip order was sad i could probably count how many chips were in that box and it was probably around 12 0 
we ordered some old classics and some new dishes after going there a few times and were sorely disappointed with everything 0 
special mention should be made of the superb music score and sound effects which are an integral element in helping to make this such a memorable and enjoyable cartoon 1 
insults profound deuchebaggery and had to go outside for a smoke break while serving just to solidify it 0 
have been going since 2007 and every meal has been awesome 1 
it rocked my world and is certainly a must see for anyone with no social or physical outlets 1 
i am going to have to be the first to negatively review this product 0 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
great sound and service 1 
the live music on fridays totally blows 0 
damian is so talented and versatile in so many ways of writing and portraying different characters on screen 1 
the directing and the cinematography arent quite as good 0 
both the hot sour the egg flower soups were absolutely 5 stars 1 
very easy to use 1 
then i watched it again two sundays ago march 20th 2005 and i began to really enjoy it and this time i taped the entire thing 1 
go rent it 1 
full of unconvincing cardboard characters it is blandly written by edward chodorov who also produced and is surprisingly directed by jean negulesco from whom one would expect a great deal more 0 
the igo chargers and tips are really great 1 
bela lugosi was totally extraneous intoning odd lines 0 
go rent it 1 
plantronics bluetooth excelent buy 1 
you get extra minutes so that you can carry out the call and not get cut off 1 
good protection and does not make phone too bulky 1 
the ending is so so perfect youll shed a tear 1 
i like design and look of jabra behing the ear headsets and 5020 is pretty comfortible to wear 24 hours a day without pain in the ear 1 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
not nearly as good looking as the amazon picture makes it look 0 
its the one movie that never ceases to interest me simply because it keeps me alert as i try to attempt to decipher its meanings 1 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
timely shipment and quality product 1 
an hour seriously 0 
i am very impressed with the job that motorola did on the sturdiness of this phone 1 
nice spicy and tender 1 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
the veggitarian platter is out of this world 1 
lot of holes in the plot theres nothing about how he became the emperor nothing about where he spend 20 years between his childhood and mature age 0 
best fish ive ever had in my life 1 
doesnt last long 0 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
someone shouldve invented this sooner 1 
the ambience is wonderful and there is music playing 1 
no additional ear gels provided and no instructions whatsoever 0 
great pizza and salads 1 
its uncomfortable and the sound quality is quite poor compared with the phone razr or with my previous wired headset that plugged into an lg 0 
food quality has been horrible 0 
their frozen margaritas are way too sugary for my taste 0 
this movie is also revealing 1 
last time buying from you 0 
you learn a lot about the real inside emotions of people in this movie and a lot about the movie business itself 1 
i let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this bad idea we both hated it 0 
they have a plethora of salads and sandwiches and everything ive tried gets my seal of approval 1 
my girlfriends veal was very bad 0 
the movie is full of wonderful dancing hence the title 1 
it also had a new problem 0 
similarly the delivery man did not say a word of apology when our food was 45 minutes late 0 
worst ever 0 
im pleased 1 
it was equally awful 0 
this place is overpriced not consistent with their boba and it really is overpriced 0 
everything about this movie is stupid 0 
same problem as others have mentioned 0 
awful 0 
some highlights great quality nigiri here 1 
it was absolutely amazing 1 
this item is fantastic and works perfectly 1 
one nice thing was that they added gratuity on the bill since our party was larger than 6 or 8 and they didnt expect more tip than that 1 
the casting is also horrible cause all you see is a really really bad actors period 0 
the owner used to work at nobu so this place is really similar for half the price 1 
i just saw this film and i recommend it 1 
the only downside is the service 0 
the only thing really worth watching was the scenery and the house because it is beautiful 1 
we sat another ten minutes and finally gave up and left 0 
it crackles with an unpredictable youthful energy but honestly i found it hard to follow and concentrate on it meanders so badly 0 
a very charming film with wonderful sentiment and heart 1 
i own 2 of these cases and would order another 1 
very happy with this product 1 
very convenient since we were staying at the mgm 1 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
im a big fan of this series mostly due to anne rices style sensitivities and treatments 1 
very good though 1 
ive tried several different earpieces for my cell phone and this jabra one is the first one ive found that fits my ear comfortably 1 
there are many continuity errors one other user commented on different cars in the garage joes glassesthe one that got to me the most was the fact joes facial hair configuration seemed to change from scene to scene 0 
you cant beat that 1 
this is a great phone 1 
the black eyed peas and sweet potatoes unreal 1 
this pair of headphones is the worst that i have ever had soundwise 0 
timely shipment and quality product 1 
it was that year however that reminded us that huston was still at the top of his game as evinced by his faithful adaptation of james joyces acclaimed novella the dead 1 
very disappointed and wondered how it could be in the oscar shortlist 0 
they are so easy to love but even more easy to identify with 1 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
works as described 1 
this movie is greatespecially if you enjoy visual arts 1 
nonlinear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well 1 
plug was the wrong size 0 
poor product 0 
good servicecheck 1 
wow what a bad film 0 
bad fit way too big 0 
the two main characters may be two of the most believable children i ever saw put on screen 1 
they were excellent 1 
this product is clearly not ready for prime time i dont care how cool it looks if you cant tell a call is coming in its worthless 0 
their chow mein is so good 1 
hayao miyazakis latest and eighth film for studio ghibili gake no ue no ponyo ponyo on the cliff by the sea is a wonderfully fun and imaginative look at childhood 1 
the handsfree part works fine but then the car tries to download the address book and the treo rebootsoverall i still rate this device high 1 
perabo has a nice energy level and is obviously very comfortable in front of a camera 1 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
do not make the same mistake as me 0 
i have seen many movies starring jaclyn smith but my god this was one of her best though it came out 12 years ago 1 
i purchased this and within 2 days it was no longer working 0 
service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is vegas and located inside the crystals shopping mall by aria 1 
it really created a unique feeling though 1 
we had 7 at our table and the service was pretty fast 1 
the charger arrived within the promised timeframe but it did not work 0 
my sister has one also and she loves it 1 
its extremely slow and takes forever to do anything with it 0 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
this movie totally grates on my nerves 0 
it rocked my world and is certainly a must see for anyone with no social or physical outlets 1 
john garfield ann revere lilli plmer william conrad canada leeand filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screenjames wong howe 1 
i saw this movie and i thought this is a stupid movie 0 
but it picked up speed and got right to the point 1 
good case excellent value 1 
the food sucked which we expected but it sucked more than we could have imagined 0 
ryans bar is definitely one edinburgh establishment i wont be revisiting 0 
i probably would not go here again 0 
highly entertaining at all angles 1 
special thanks to dylan t for the recommendation on what to order all yummy for my tummy 1 
the reception has been generally good 1 
im trying to return it for a refund 0 
and there wasnt a single sour note struck actingwise either some surprisingly solid casting here 1 
it was not good 0 
i received it quickly and it works great 1 
battery lasts only a few hours 0 
its not hard to make a decent hamburger 0 
unfortunately it was not good 0 
sound quality on both end is excellent i use headset to call my wife and ask my wife to use headset to call me 2 1 
go and see it 1 
restored my phone to like new performance 1 
dont buy this product it fails 0 
putting the race card aside lets look at the major flaw in the film they destroy latifas character 0 
a pretty good product 1 
it is indescribably the most annoying and idiotic show i have ever seen 0 
the ngage is still lacking in earbuds 0 
it is an insane game 1 
doesnt work 0 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
nice docking station for home or work 1 
this is a great deal 1 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
both do good jobs and are quite amusing 1 
i had absolutely no problem with this headset linking to my 8530 blackberry curve 1 
there was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth but it didnt really work into the rest of the plot 0 
the eargels channel the sound directly into your ear and seem to increase the sound volume and clarity 1 
being a 90s child i truly enjoyed this show and i can proudly say that i enjoyed it big time and even more than the classical wb cartoons 1 
not a weekly haunt but definitely a place to come back to every once in a while 1 
avoid at all cost 0 
i had verizon 2 years ago and really liked their service 1 
say bye bye to your tip lady 0 
needless to say we will never be back here again 0 
they keep getting better and better this is my third one and ive had numerous palms too 1 
iam very pleased with my purchase 1 
i dont think well be going back anytime soon 0 
to summarize the food was incredible nay transcendant but nothing brings me joy quite like the memory of the pneumatic condiment dispenser 1 
the pizza selections are good 1 
worked perfectly 1 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
stay away from this store be careful 0 
this may be the only bad film he ever made 0 
you cant beat that 1 
so far so good 1 
couldnt figure it out 0 
the art style has the appearance of crayonpencil drawings and is wonderfully colorful and fanciful 1 
the block was amazing 1 
did not like at all 0 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
also if your phone is dropped this case is not going to save it specially when dropped face down 0 
very funny 1 
interesting decor 1 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
works like a charm it work the same as the one i got with the phone 1 
logitech bluetooth headset is a 10 1 
highly unrecommended 0 
i had heard good things about this place but it exceeding every hope i could have dreamed of 1 
i agree with jessica this movie is pretty bad 0 
so dont go there if you are looking for good food 0 
phone falls out easily 0 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
food was great and so was the serivce 1 
his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic 1 
i was so insulted 0 
in summary this was a largely disappointing dining experience 0 
this phone works great 1 
putting the race card aside lets look at the major flaw in the film they destroy latifas character 0 
fans of the genre will be in heaven 1 
its not hard to make a decent hamburger 0 
for that price i can think of a few place i would have much rather gone 0 
i never walked out of a movie faster 0 
i could eat their bruschetta all day it is devine 1 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
you cant beat that 1 
not impressed 0 
never been to hard rock casino before will never ever step forward in it again 0 
bt50 battery junk 0 
too bad you have to pay up to a month for the service 0 
clear crisp sound 1 
even the squibs look awful 0 
this place should honestly be blown up 0 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
the screen does get smudged easily because it touches your ear and face 0 
in addition to having one of the most lovely songs ever written french cancan also boasts one of the cutest leading ladies ever to grace the screen 1 
ive had no trouble accessing the internet downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions 1 
i cannot believe that the actors agreed to do this film 0 
the croutons also taste homemade which is an extra plus 1 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
im returning them 0 
this movie contained an allstar cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i havent seen before 1 
im still trying to get over how bad it was 0 
this product had a strong rubberpetroleum smell that was unbearable after a while and caused me to return it 0 
it wasnt busy at all and now we know why 0 
god and i can never get that 90 minutes back 0 
the service was terrible food was mediocre 0 
we had so much to say about the place before we walked in that he expected it to be amazing but was quickly disappointed 0 
i went to bachi burger on a friends recommendation and was not disappointed 1 
the owner used to work at nobu so this place is really similar for half the price 1 
people who like european films and art movies will like this movie 1 
now imagine that every single one of those decisions was made wrong 0 
the point is the journey a journey that touches every member of the family 1 
level 5 spicy was perfect where spice didnt overwhelm the soup 1 
and generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode 0 
the story which was told so eloquently by francis ford coppola 25 years earlier really unfolds gradually and leaves room for the characters to develop 1 
he also came back to check on us regularly excellent service 1 
dont buy it 0 
this is definitely one of the better documentaries i have seen looking at family relationships and marriage 1 
the plot doesnt hang together at all and the acting is absolutely appalling 0 
you can watch them preparing the delicious food 1 
but i definitely would not eat here again 0 
this is an extraordinary film 1 
not worth it 0 
this is my new fav vegas buffet spot 1 
it is light easy to use and has very clear reception and transmission 1 
yes its shiny on front side and i love it 1 
this greedy corporation will never see another dime from me 0 
i kept catching the cable on the seat and i had to pull the phone out to turn it on an off 0 
its also great to see that renowned silent screenwriter frances marion hasnt missed a step going from silent to sound 1 
their onscreen chemistry critical to the entire film is genuine 1 
good transmit audio 1 
the servers are not pleasant to deal with and they dont always honor pizza hut coupons 0 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
i have had problems wit hit dropping signal and more 0 
nice blanket of moz over top but i feel like this was done to cover up the subpar food 1 
the entire audience applauded at the conclusion of the film 1 
the film gives meaning to the phrase never in the history of human conflict has so much been owed by so many to so few 1 
1 hour 54 minutes of sheer tedium melodrama and horrible acting a mess of a script and a sinking feeling of good lord what were they thinking 0 
as an earlier review noted plug in this charger and nothing happens 0 
no real improvement 0 
ray charles life provided excellent biographical material for the film which goes well beyond being just another movie about a musician 1 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
this is was due to the fact that it took 20 minutes to be acknowledged then another 35 minutes to get our foodand they kept forgetting things 0 
this movie now joins revenge of the boogeyman and zombiez as part of the hellish trinity of horror films 0 
very disappointed in accessoryone 0 
nice spicy and tender 1 
items stated as included from the description are not included 0 
this place receives stars for their appetizers 1 
conclusion i loved it 1 
all the characters in this film are tremendously well played 1 
disappointed 0 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
there was a warm feeling with the service and i felt like their guest for a special treat 1 
i could not recommend these more 0 
a happy wonderful feel good ending 1 
the story unfolds in 18th century jutland and the use of period music played on period instruments is just one more fine touch 1 
great place to eat reminds me of the little mom and pop shops in the san francisco bay area 1 
the only thing really worth watching was the scenery and the house because it is beautiful 1 
the seller is very understanding and patient i would definitely buy from them again 1 
not only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic but it also managed to give away the entire movie and im not exaggerating every moment every plot point every joke is told in the trailer 0 
voice quality signal strength dropped calls 0 
the cg opening sequence in space looked like it could have been created on microsoft slideshow for gods sake 0 
i love the scream movies and all horror movies and this one ranks way up there 1 
i put the latest os on it v115g and it now likes to slow to a crawl and lock up every once in a while 0 
this is an extraordinary film 1 
he is one of my favourite directors and one of the most talented directors in the history of cinema 1 
to those who find this movie intelligent or even masterful i can only say its your intelligence and your imagination you obviously used to try and make some sense of this pitiful attempt its in our human nature to try and make sense of things 0 
so bad 0 
crostini that came with the salad was stale 0 
i go to far too many places and ive never seen any restaurant that serves a 1 egg breakfast especially for 400 0 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
reception is terrible and full of static 0 
the foreigner is not worth one second of your time 0 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
the plastic breaks really easy on this clip 0 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
if you do watch it however there are small consolations the actresses playing annes sisters each do a wonderful job with their roles 1 
the burger had absolutely no flavor the meat itself was totally bland the burger was overcooked and there was no charcoal flavor 0 
very cheap plastic creaks like an old wooden floor 0 
went for lunch service was slow 0 
worst service to boot but that is the least of their worries 0 
razr battery good buy 1 
ive had this bluetoooth headset for some time now and still not comfortable with the way it fits on the ear 0 
this was my first and only vegas buffet and it did not disappoint 1 
i do love sushi but i found kabuki to be overpriced overhip and underservices 0 
i tried the cape cod ravoli chickenwith cranberrymmmm 1 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
this is a masterful piece of filmmaking with many themes simmering and occasionally boiling over in this warts and all study of the poets bohemian selfindulgent wartime years that span the aerial bombardments of london and the outward tranquillity of a welsh coastal retreat the borderlines between friendship lust and love dedication to art and experience versus practical concerns jealousy rivalry cowardice and egotism versus heroism and selfsacrifice and more 1 
nobody identifies with these characters because theyre all cardboard cutouts and stereotypes or predictably reversestereotypes 0 
over rated 0 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
the use of slowmotion needlessly repeats itself throughout the movie but is well backed up by bad acting and bad is a kind word here no continuity scenes that are thrown in for no reason whatsoever vehicles that looked like they were made from a corn flakes box and a directorial style that bordered on stupidity 0 
im pleased 1 
price is good too 1 
this phone is very fast with sending any kind of messages and web browsing is significantly faster than previous phones i have used 1 
great food 1 
the jalapeno bacon is soooo good 1 
the instructions didnt explain that a microphone jack could be used 0 
all the bread is made inhouse 1 
this game rocks 1 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
you truly take this journey through the eyes and soul of a child 1 
the service was extremely slow 0 
treo and tmobile refused to replace it again and forced me to buy another phone without any kind of upgrade discount 0 
this was like the final blow 0 
the best phone in market 1 
about half way through this film i started to dislike it 0 
this mostly routine factbased tv drama gets a boost from the fine performance by cole 1 
if this premise sound stupid thats because it is 0 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
this is the first phone ive had that has been so cheaply made 0 
delicious nyc bagels good selections of cream cheese real lox with capers even 1 
warning do not buy 0 
cinematography the film was shot in an interesting way 1 
the volume switch rocketed out of the unit to a destination unknown 0 
one more thing i can tolerate political incorrectness very well im all for artistic freedom and suspension of disbelief but the slavic female character was just too much 0 
the service was great even the manager came and helped with our table 1 
couldnt figure it out 0 
coming here is like experiencing an underwhelming relationship where both parties cant wait for the other person to ask to break up 0 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
they are so easy to love but even more easy to identify with 1 
i hate writing bad reviews about films especially those in which i really like the star but this film is so bad i dont believe for one second that anyone could have been proud of it 0 
mishima is extremely uninteresting 0 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
rating 010 grade z note the show is so bad that even mother of the cast pull her daughter out of the show 0 
att is not clear sound is very distorted and you have to yell when you talk 0 
shes poised and amazing 1 
very disappointing 0 
we watched our waiter pay a lot more attention to other tables and ignore us 0 
go rent it 1 
the vegetables are so fresh and the sauce feels like authentic thai 1 
i gave it 5 stars because of the sound quality 1 
good servicecheck 1 
the bottowm lineanother worthless cheap gimmick from sprint 0 
i liked this movie way too much 1 
i would not recommend this place 0 
great phone 1 
dont waste your time watching this rubbish nonresearched film 0 
i searched the internet and found this one to be the best value 1 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
here in the wind and the lion we see a wonderful rendering of americas own imperial age 1 
the film gives meaning to the phrase never in the history of human conflict has so much been owed by so many to so few 1 
the only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port irda 0 
the least said about the acting the better 0 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
summary the witticisms werent witty 0 
ray charles life provided excellent biographical material for the film which goes well beyond being just another movie about a musician 1 
the cinematography is simply stunning to say the least and the fx are nothing if not stateoftheart 1 
damn good steak 1 
this movie creates its own universe and is fascinating in every way 1 
this scene is very strong and unpleasant 0 
i am so tired of clichés that is just lazy writing and here they come in thick and fast 0 
at around 4 pm i bought it at around 8pm i started to watch at around 815pm i fast forwarded the remaining film to see if there was anything left watchable for a human being with a brain but there wasnt 0 
very cheap plastic creaks like an old wooden floor 0 
cant upload ringtones from a third party 0 
if she had not rolled the eyes we may have stayed not sure if we will go back and try it again 0 
restored my phone to like new performance 1 
very disappointing 0 
great phone 1 
i am going to have to be the first to negatively review this product 0 
even allowing for poor production values for the time 1971 and the format some kind of miniseries this is baaaaaad 0 
i want to first say our server was great and we had perfect service 1 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
it has a great camera thats 2mp and the pics are nice and clear with great picture quality 1 
steamboat willie is an amazingly important film to our cinema history 1 
works as described 1 
even the squibs look awful 0 
i cannot believe that the actors agreed to do this film 0 
the chefs were friendly and did a good job 1 
there are so many problems i dont know where to start 0 
these products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet 0 
that company is a joke 0 
the service was extremely slow 0 
love the margaritas too 1 
i am a fan of his this movie sucked really bad 0 
i did not have any problem with this item and would order it again if needed 1 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
nothing at all to recommend 0 
i let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this bad idea we both hated it 0 
we had so much to say about the place before we walked in that he expected it to be amazing but was quickly disappointed 0 
freezes frequently4 0 
so anyone near you will hear part of your conversation 0 
my gyro was basically lettuce only 0 
this place is like chipotle but better 1 
appears to actually outperform the original battery from china that came with my v325i 1 
its like a bad two hour tv movie 0
