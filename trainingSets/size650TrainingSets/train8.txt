there is a lot of beautiful places 1 
so bad 0 
his use of the colours of the french flag in the three films was nothing short of incredible every shot every scene was like a work of art 1 
love the margaritas too 1 
my wife had the lobster bisque soup which was lukewarm 0 
imdb ratings only go as low 1 for awful its time to get some negative numbers in there for cases such as these 0 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
they have a plethora of salads and sandwiches and everything ive tried gets my seal of approval 1 
it was a very superficial movie and it gave me the feeling that i was watching play rather than a film 0 
it was an inexpensive piece but i would still have expected better quality 0 
this is truly an art movieit actually has a lot of art in it 1 
i have eaten here multiple times and each time the food was delicious 1 
o my gosh the best phone i have ever had 1 
their menu is diverse and reasonably priced 1 
food was good service was good prices were good 1 
the potato chip order was sad i could probably count how many chips were in that box and it was probably around 12 0 
they are so easy to love but even more easy to identify with 1 
give this one a look 1 
the movie is littered with overt racial slurs towards the black cast members and in return the whites are depicted as morons and boobs 0 
not loud enough and doesnt turn on like it should 0 
del taco is pretty nasty and should be avoided if possible 0 
the music in the film is really nice too 1 
what a waste of money and time 0 
but it picked up speed and got right to the point 1 
so good i am going to have to review this place twice once hereas a tribute to the place and once as a tribute to an event held here last night 1 
so in a nutshell 1 the restaraunt smells like a combination of a dirty fish market and a sewer 0 
i love lane but ive never seen her in a movie this lousy 0 
the construction of the headsets is poor 0 
i could care less the interior is just beautiful 1 
ive owned this phone for 7 months now and can say that its the best mobile phone ive had 1 
very clear quality sound and you dont have to mess with the sound on your ipod since you have the sound buttons on the headset 1 
i would definitely recommend the jabra bt250v for those who are looking for comfort clarity and a great price 1 
go to place for gyros 1 
my 810 score is mostly for the plot 1 
the acting was bad 0 
the football scenes at the end were perplexing 0 
it had some average acting from the main person and it was a low budget as you clearly can see 0 
it fits my ear well and is comfortable on 1 
we ordered some old classics and some new dishes after going there a few times and were sorely disappointed with everything 0 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
so far so good 1 
this phone tries very hard to do everything but fails at its very ability to be a phone 0 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
the football scenes at the end were perplexing 0 
the story line is just awful 0 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
im so happy to be here 1 
perabo has a nice energy level and is obviously very comfortable in front of a camera 1 
this is a bad film with bad writing and good actorsan ugly cartoon crafted by paul haggis for people who cant handle anything but the bold strokes in storytellinga picture painted with crayons 0 
soyo technology sucks 0 
i am so pleased to know such a modern day genius is out there letting is passion for art drive him and taking us as an audience with him 1 
but it picked up speed and got right to the point 1 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
this if the first movie ive given a 10 to in years 1 
i recommend this for everyone who loves film movies anythinga work of art 1 
the phone was unusable and was not new 0 
thats how id describe this painfully dreary timewaster of a film 0 
this is a great little item 1 
i would have casted her in that role after ready the script 1 
it crackles with an unpredictable youthful energy but honestly i found it hard to follow and concentrate on it meanders so badly 0 
this was one of the worst films i have ever seen 0 
overall the film is interesting and thoughtprovoking 1 
so dont go there if you are looking for good food 0 
worthless product 0 
we ordered some old classics and some new dishes after going there a few times and were sorely disappointed with everything 0 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
another thing i didnt really like is when a character got punched in the face a gallon of blood would spew forth soon after 0 
its like a bad two hour tv movie 0 
great product for the price 1 
all in all ha long bay was a bit of a flop 0 
the films sole bright spot was jonah hill who will look almost unrecognizable to fans of the recent superbad due to the amount of weight he lost in the interim 1 
elias koteasjack palance play good roles angelina is hot and gets nakedbilly drago appears in this and is cool as usual a cameo by sven ole thorsen helps make this a very enjoyable movie with good acting and a decent budget 1 
great software for motorolas 1 
i like armand assante my cable companys summary sounded interesting so i watched it twice already and probably will again 1 
just as good as when i had it more than a year ago 1 
you cant beat the price on these 1 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
loved itfriendly servers great food wonderful and imaginative menu 1 
check it out 1 
i would give this television series a 10 plus if i could 1 
i swung in to give them a try but was deeply disappointed 0 
i received my headset in good time and was happy with it 1 
seller shipped quickly and much cheaper than the competitors 1 
bluetooth range is good a few days ago i left my phone in the trunk got a call and carried the conversation without a hitch 1 
a week later after i activated it it suddenly died 0 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
for 40 bucks a head i really expect better food 0 
it shouldnt take 30 min for pancakes and eggs 0 
if this premise sound stupid thats because it is 0 
we have gotten a lot of compliments on it 1 
the majority of the logitech earbud headsets failed 0 
i love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it 1 
i tried talking real loud but shouting on the telephone gets old and i was still told it wasnt great 0 
was not happy 0 
paolo sorrentino has written a wonderful story about loneliness and tony has built one of the most unforgettable characters seen in movies in recent years 1 
lifetime does not air it enough so if anyone knows what store sells it let me know because this is a musthave 1 
useless phone simply deaf 0 
server did a great job handling our large rowdy table 1 
nice case feels good in your hands 1 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
this one works and was priced right 1 
the steak was amazingrge fillet relleno was the best seafood plate i have ever had 1 
be sure to order dessert even if you need to pack it togo the tiramisu and cannoli are both to die for 1 
this is by far the worst purchase ive made on amazon 0 
if only someone involved with it knew how to string together narrative 0 
we made the drive all the way from north scottsdale and i was not one bit disappointed 1 
i would definitely recommend the jabra bt250v for those who are looking for comfort clarity and a great price 1 
every time he opened his mouth you expect to hear you see kids pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show 0 
never got it 0 
this is a beautiful phone 1 
this place should honestly be blown up 0 
total letdown i would much rather just go to the camelback flower shop and cartel coffee 0 
good product good seller 1 
waaaaaayyyyyyyyyy over rated is all i am saying 0 
now this dish was quite flavourful 1 
dont waste your money 0 
crisp and clear 1 
john garfield ann revere lilli plmer william conrad canada leeand filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screenjames wong howe 1 
unfortunately cover girl is an example of how hollywood used to exploit women for financial gain 0 
the visual effects were awful 0 
i love my 350 headset my jabra350 bluetooth headset is great the reception is very good and the ear piece is a comfortable fit 1 
i was so insulted 0 
personally i think it shows that people should learn to find a compromise them self without involving other people into issue 1 
i had to wait over 30 minutes to get my drink and longer to get 2 arepas 0 
also were served hot bread and butter and home made potato chips with bacon bits on topvery original and very good 1 
now this is a movie i really dislike 0 
it only recognizes the phone as its storage device 0 
they refuse to refund or replace 0 
there was a warm feeling with the service and i felt like their guest for a special treat 1 
the lighting is awful 0 
none of it works just dont buy it 0 
main thing i didnt enjoy is that the crowd is of older crowd around mid 30s and up 0 
he was terrible 0 
excellent phone 1 
what a disappointment 0 
almost everyone involved must be return to school acting is utterly predictable and bad script is pile of garbage all round 0 
we ordered some old classics and some new dishes after going there a few times and were sorely disappointed with everything 0 
i really do recommend this place you can go wrong with this donut place 1 
this one works and was priced right 1 
that one didnt work either 0 
horrible 0 
kris kristoffersen is good in this movie and really makes a difference 1 
it probably would have been better if the director hadnt spent most of the movie showcasing his own art work which really isnt that noteworthy 0 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
my 810 score is mostly for the plot 1 
excellent product for the price 1 
the restaurant is very clean and has a family restaurant feel to it 1 
the waitress was friendly and happy to accomodate for veganveggie options 1 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
he surely doesnt know how to make a coherent action movie from the screenwriter of air force one who was only obliged to write the script just for a big sum of money 0 
coming here is like experiencing an underwhelming relationship where both parties cant wait for the other person to ask to break up 0 
the whole experience was underwhelming and i think well just go to ninja sushi next time 0 
the feel of the dining room was more college cooking course than high class dining and the service was slow at best 0 
not recommended 0 
i believe the screenwriter did a good job of tying up the loose ends 1 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
the plot doesnt hang together at all and the acting is absolutely appalling 0 
the memories are murky but i can only say that i enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show 1 
nothing at all to recommend 0 
how can that bethe audio quality is poor 0 
excellent hands free tool 1 
plug was the wrong size 0 
the lighting is awful 0 
i would not recommend this place 0 
i did not have any problem with this item and would order it again if needed 1 
service is quick and even to go orders are just like we like it 1 
highly unprofessional and rude to a loyal patron 0 
overall i would recommend this phone over the new walkman 1 
i do think tom hanks is a good actor 1 
im using it with an iriver spinn with case and it fits fine 1 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
very disappointed 0 
he is almost unbearable to watch on screen he has little to no charisma and terrible comedic timing 0 
their onscreen chemistry critical to the entire film is genuine 1 
i think that it is a must see older john wayne film 1 
it was horrendous 0 
overall i wasnt very impressed with noca 0 
if you are looking for a good quality motorola headset keep looking this isnt it 0 
i recently tried caballeros and i have been back every week since 1 
this movie is greatespecially if you enjoy visual arts 1 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
i dont know what the big deal is about this place but i wont be back yaall 0 
the movie is not completely perfect but titta di girolamo will stay with you for a long time after the vision of the movie 1 
we have gotten a lot of compliments on it 1 
then scene where they debated whether or not to sack the trumpeter who falsely was accused for the murder is pure horror really stupid 0 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
only pros large seating area nice bar area great simple drink menu the best brick oven pizza with homemade dough 1 
they work about 2 weeks then break 0 
lets start with all the problemsthe acting especially from the lead professor was very very bad 0 
love it great armband 1 
this is the phone to get for 2005 i just bought my s710a and all i can say is wow 1 
headset works great was packaged nicely to avoid any damage 1 
i got the car charger and not even after a week the charger was brokeni went to plug it in and it started smoking 0 
her lines seem to have been written by a fifteen year old though they are trying oh so so hard to sound like how a fifteen year old would really um you know well talk 0 
battery chargelife is quite long 1 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
it was a riot to see hugo weaving play a sexobsessed gay real estate salesman who uses his clients houses for his trysts with the flaming darren tom hollander 1 
im super pissd 0 
weve tried to like this place but after 10 times i think were done with them 0 
there arent death scenes like in previous movies and the fx are terrible 0 
does not work for listening to music with the cingular 8125 0 
its the one movie that never ceases to interest me simply because it keeps me alert as i try to attempt to decipher its meanings 1 
think of the film being like a dream 1 
every time he opened his mouth you expect to hear you see kids pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show 0 
another note about this phones appearance is that it really looks rather bland especially in the all black model 0 
dont waste your time 0 
i was totally fascinated by the music the dancing everything 1 
ordered a double cheeseburger got a single patty that was falling apart picture uploaded yeah still sucks 0 
the film is way too long 0 
you will leave the theater wanting to go out and dance under the stars 1 
overall i would recommend this phone over the new walkman 1 
it is a really good show to watch 1 
but i thought his acting was skilled 1 
simply beautiful 1 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
stay away from the q 0 
happy so far 1 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
they refuse to refund or replace 0 
the service was meh 0 
what a waste of time 0 
i had to go to a store and bought a new nokia phone which is working great 1 
and the accents are absolutely abysmal 0 
having to humour him just to get by and get through the day was so apt 1 
also difficult to put onid recommend avoiding this product 0 
after charging overnight these batteries work great 1 
there were too many close ups 0 
a good time 1 
the 12 mega pixel camera being a part of a phone is reasonably good7 1 
the awful dialogue and hopeless overacting by everyone who gets shot top off a real waste of space and time 0 
not what i wanted 0 
i own 2 of these cases and would order another 1 
the explosion of the gas tanks at the end was just as awful 0 
first of all there are enough racial stereotypes and racial jokes to offend everyone 0 
the movie was very interesting from beginning to the end 1 
better than new 1 
i use this product in a motor control center where there is a lot of high voltage humming from the equipment and it works great 1 
none of it works just dont buy it 0 
the film is way too long 0 
bad fit way too big 0 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
the chefs were friendly and did a good job 1 
im translating movies for a living and this is the first movie in my 5year working experience that i found offensive to my intelligence 0 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
it only recognizes the phone as its storage device 0 
this is cool because most cases are just open there allowing the screen to get all scratched up 1 
he is almost unbearable to watch on screen he has little to no charisma and terrible comedic timing 0 
i am pairing this with my iphone and i could not be happier with it so far 1 
omelets are to die for 1 
the plot was the same as pretty much every other cheap horror 0 
the reception has been generally good 1 
everything was perfect the night we were in 1 
wed definitely go back here again 1 
by this time our side of the restaurant was almost empty so there was no excuse 0 
simple lightweight and great fit 1 
strike 2 who wants to be rushed 0 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
i really recommend this faceplates since it looks very nice elegant and cool 1 
performed awful muffled tinny incoming sound and severe echo for those on the other end of the call 0 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
nice ambiance 1 
if you are reading this please dont go there 0 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
after the first charge kept going dead after 12 minutes 0 
this is a great product sure beats using your fingers 1 
i would definitely recommend the jabra bt250v for those who are looking for comfort clarity and a great price 1 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
it sure does beat the nachos at the movies but i would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant 0 
great earpiece 1 
this is a really fantastic thai restaurant which is definitely worth a visit 1 
the plot well i said id let that one go 0 
tonight i had the elk filet specialand it sucked 0 
definitely worth seeing its the sort of thought provoking film that forces you to question your own threshold of loneliness 1 
im not sure how long we stood there but it was long enough for me to begin to feel awkwardly out of place 0 
a piece of cinematic garbage captured on celluloid 0 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
the service was meh 0 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
i wear it everyday and it holds up very well 1 
the refried beans that came with my meal were dried out and crusty and the food was bland 0 
perabo has a nice energy level and is obviously very comfortable in front of a camera 1 
headset works great was packaged nicely to avoid any damage 1 
then scene where they debated whether or not to sack the trumpeter who falsely was accused for the murder is pure horror really stupid 0 
theres also enough hypocrisy in this film to make me vomit 0 
it was horrendous 0 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
this place is disgusting 0 
an amazing finale to possibly the best trilogy of all time 1 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
lame would be the best way to describe it 0 
everything about this product is wrongfirst 0 
the story itself is just predictable and lazy 0 
people who like european films and art movies will like this movie 1 
im pleased 1 
the telephone repair man was really funny and his reactions to the nuts and bitchy boss were truly genuine 1 
i like armand assante my cable companys summary sounded interesting so i watched it twice already and probably will again 1 
none of the three sizes they sent with the headset would stay in my ears 0 
product is useless since it does not have enough charging current to charge the 2 cellphones i was planning to use it with 0 
delete this film from your mind 0 
the meat was pretty dry i had the sliced brisket and pulled pork 0 
speaking of the music it is unbearably predictably and kitchy 0 
it sure does beat the nachos at the movies but i would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant 0 
it was too predictable even for a chick flick 0 
as always the evening was wonderful and the food delicious 1 
i dont like this nokia either 0 
wont ever go here again 0 
it was so boring 0 
the service was a little slow considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace 0 
hence the whole story lacks a certain energy 0 
also were served hot bread and butter and home made potato chips with bacon bits on topvery original and very good 1 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
i saw mirrormask last night and it was an unsatisfactory experience 0 
similarly the delivery man did not say a word of apology when our food was 45 minutes late 0 
i give it 2 thumbs down 0 
he cant act one of the least scary villains i have ever seen he cant write did he write this damn movie in his sleep 0 
there is simply no excuse for something this poorly done 0 
nicest chinese restaurant ive been in a while 1 
excellent product for the price 1 
yes i am simplifying things here for the sake of brevity for this really is at the core of the problems with this film it has too much going on without any real fulfilling explanation 0 
gave up trying to eat any of the crust teeth still sore 0 
overall a delight 1 
this is some seriously good pizza and im an expertconnisseur on the topic 1 
really bad 0 
i ordered the voodoo pasta and it was the first time id had really excellent pasta since going gluten free several years ago 1 
definitely worth checking out 1 
i was so insulted 0 
rip off over charge shipping 0 
the show would begin with smart ass ed comments to each other that would be totally off the wall and uncalled for 0 
and dont even get me started on the jerky camerawork 0 
this is a great place to eat 1 
editing the editing of this film was phenomenal in my opinion 1 
the soundtrack wasnt terrible either 1 
this place is like chipotle but better 1 
the cast of veteran actors are more than just a nostalgia trip 1 
this was a different cut than the piece the other day but still wonderful and tender s well as well flavored 1 
jamie foxx absolutely is ray charles 1 
improper description i had to return it 0 
we are so glad we found this place 1 
awesome service and food 1 
however the ear pads come off easily and after only one week i lost one 0 
the visual effects were awful 0 
and the accents are absolutely abysmal 0 
mobile phone tools are a must have 1 
ill put this gem up against any movie in terms of screenplay cinematography acting postproduction editing directing or any other aspect of filmmaking 1 
every thing on phone work perfectly she like it 1 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
the plug did not work very well 0 
my girlfriends veal was very bad 0 
totally believable 1 
the dialogue sucked 0 
by far the best cheesecurds we have ever had 1 
stay away from the q 0 
the dialogue sucked 0 
small sleek impressive looking practical setup with ample storage in place 1 
i know this is not like the other restaurants at all something is very off here 0 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
the nano stated itmy son was dissapointed 0 
excellent service 1 
what this film lacks is a convincing script 0 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
the manager was the worst 0 
gets a signal when other verizon phones wont 1 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
i love the camera its really pretty good quality 1 
not good for the money 0 
unless youre just out to visually collect all extant films of austens work you can skip this one 0 
food is way overpriced and portions are fucking small 0 
i understand that its supposed to be a cheap popcorn comedy but that doesnt mean that it has to completely insult our intelligence and have writing so incredibly hackneyed that it borders on offensive 0 
this is a really fantastic thai restaurant which is definitely worth a visit 1 
horrible dont waste your time and money 0 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
i love lane but ive never seen her in a movie this lousy 0 
i ordered the voodoo pasta and it was the first time id had really excellent pasta since going gluten free several years ago 1 
this movie is bad 0 
very good quality though 1 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
it is light has plenty of battery capacity and is very confortable to wear for somewhat extended periods of time 1 
the lighting is awful 0 
how this piece of trash was ever released is beyond me the acting the story the characters the supposedly special effects etcits all wrong 0 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
the film has great actors a master director a significant themeat least a wouldbe significant theme undertone of fifties existential worldweariness aerial scenes that ought to have thrilled both senses and imagination and characters about which one might deeply care 1 
the phone loads super 1 
and service was super friendly 1 
an instant classic with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits 1 
if she had not rolled the eyes we may have stayed not sure if we will go back and try it again 0 
they were excellent 1 
the earpiece on this is too large or too heavyit keeps falling out of my ear 0 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
so bad 0 
god and i can never get that 90 minutes back 0 
the film has an ultracheap look to it 0 
plus it was wellpaced and suited its relatively short run time 1 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
we would recommend these to others 1 
the malta settings are as dry and as barren as the dialogue 0 
not only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic but it also managed to give away the entire movie and im not exaggerating every moment every plot point every joke is told in the trailer 0 
nice headphones for the price and they work great 1 
the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach 0 
i was so insulted 0 
it is a true classic 1 
favorite place in town for shawarrrrrrma 1 
service stinks here 0 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
i was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar not only because the quality is great but the service is fast and the food impeccable 1 
im big fan of rpg games too but this movie its a disgrace to any selfrespecting rpger there is 0 
i dont each much pasta but i love the homemade hand made pastas and thin pizzas here 1 
join the club and get awesome offers via email 1 
from here on the widmark character turns unintentionally comical 0 
great steak great sides great wine amazing desserts 1 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
that one didnt work either 0 
it had some average acting from the main person and it was a low budget as you clearly can see 0 
i had a salad with the wings and some ice cream for dessert and left feeling quite satisfied 1 
i wont spoil it but the ending in pretty amazing 1 
long whiny and pointless 0 
that being said for a phone the camera is very nice many cool effects to play with and video is decent as well 1 
but the actingeven that of such professionals as drago and debbie rochonwas terrible the directing worse perhaps contributory to the former the dialog chimplike and the camera work barely tolerable 0 
you truly take this journey through the eyes and soul of a child 1 
hell no will i go back 0 
this is a beautiful phone 1 
omit watching this 0 
must have been an off night at this place 0 
walked in and the place smelled like an old grease trap and only 2 others there eating 0 
went for lunch service was slow 0 
this movie was kind of long in length but i enjoyed every minute of it 1 
also makes it easier to hold on to 1 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
the sound quality is excellent as well 1 
it plays louder than any other speaker of this size the price is so low that most would think the quality is lacking however its not 1 
if you hate earbugs avoid this phone by all means 0 
we definately enjoyed ourselves 1 
the burger i got the gold standard a 17 burger and was kind of disappointed 0 
good protection and does not make phone too bulky 1 
im a big fan of this series mostly due to anne rices style sensitivities and treatments 1 
and i really did find them funny 1 
and it was way to expensive 0 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
imdb ratings only go as low 1 for awful its time to get some negative numbers in there for cases such as these 0 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
which has more depth and character than the man underneath it 0 
waitress was a little slow in service 0 
itll be a regular stop on my trips to phoenix 1 
we got the food and apparently they have never heard of salt and the batter on the fish was chewy 0 
will go back next trip out 1 
it was attached to a gas station and that is rarely a good sign 0 
it was packed 0 
great headset very impressed h500 1 
disappointing 0 
these are the central themes of the film and they are handled ineptly stereotypically and with no depth of imagination 0 
tonight i had the elk filet specialand it sucked 0 
server did a great job handling our large rowdy table 1 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
i can take a little bad service but the food sucks 0 
this one wants to surf on the small wave of space movies in 1998 deep impact and armageddon and this one fails everywhere 0 
to be honest with you this is unbelievable nonsense and very foolish 0 
the waiter wasnt helpful or friendly and rarely checked on us 0 
i even dropped this phone into a stream and it was submerged for 15 seconds and it still works great 1 
service is quick and friendly 1 
cute quaint simple honest 1 
once you get inside youll be impressed with the place 1 
the best electronics of the available fm transmitters 1 
i asked multiple times for the wine list and after some time of being ignored i went to the hostess and got one myself 0 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
we got sitting fairly fast but ended up waiting 40 minutes just to place our order another 30 minutes before the food arrived 0 
its just lame 0

the best part about nurse betty is its unpredictability 1 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
also the story and acting were weak 0 
i am glad i purchased it 1 
waste of 13 bucks 0 
the food was outstanding and the prices were very reasonable 1 
but other than that the movie seemed to drag and the heroes didnt really work for their freedom 0 
see it with your kids if you have a chanceit will open up some amazing dialog about how far race relations have come in the last 50 years 1 
case was more or less an extra that i originally put on but later discarded because it scratched my ear 0 
there are massive levels massive unlockable characters its just a massive game 1 
this film tries to be a serious and sophisticated thrillerhorror flick and it fails miserably 0 
damian is so talented and versatile in so many ways of writing and portraying different characters on screen 1 
wed definitely go back here again 1 
however my girl was complain that some time the phone doesnt wake up like normal phone does 0 
at any rate this film stinks its not funny and fulci should have stayed with giallo and supernatural zombie movies 0 
it probably would have been better if the director hadnt spent most of the movie showcasing his own art work which really isnt that noteworthy 0 
the fries were great too 1 
the crêpe was delicate and thin and moist 1 
the movie is full of wonderful dancing hence the title 1 
im glad i found this product on amazon it is hard to find it wasnt high priced 1 
but i thought his acting was skilled 1 
no buyers remorse on this one 0

i was deeply impressed with the character he played 1 
the waitress was friendly and happy to accomodate for veganveggie options 1 
it also took her forever to bring us the check when we asked for it 0 
and the rest of it just sits there being awful with soldiers singing songs about the masculinity they pledge themselves to hairsplitting about purity the admiration of swords etc 0

then a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use 0 
there were several moments in the movie that just didnt need to be there and were excruciatingly slow moving 0 
exactly what i wanted 1 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
so anyone near you will hear part of your conversation 0 
probably never coming back and wouldnt recommend it 0 
love this product 1 
brilliant 1 
if you see it you should probably just leave it on the shelf 0 
the keyboard is a nice compromise between a full qwerty and the basic cell phone number keypad 1 
the films dialogue is natural real to life 1 
not much dialogue not much music the whole film was shot as elaborately and aesthetically like a sculpture 1 
the acting sucks the music sucks the script sucks the pacing sucks the special fx suck the directing sucks basically this movie sucks 0 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
im so sorry but i really cant recommend it to anyone 0

they keep getting better and better this is my third one and ive had numerous palms too 1 
babie bop is very cute 1 
the football scenes at the end were perplexing 0 
he is almost unbearable to watch on screen he has little to no charisma and terrible comedic timing 0 
definitely worth seeing its the sort of thought provoking film that forces you to question your own threshold of loneliness 1 
it has a great camera thats 2mp and the pics are nice and clear with great picture quality 1 
great movie 1 
the camera on the phone may be used as a dustpan when indoors id rather be using a disposable then this 0 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1

sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
i liked it 1 
i was deeply impressed with the character he played 1 
i really liked that 1 
however i recently watched the whole thing again on dvd and i was completely struck by how extremely stupid the storyline was how it contained holes inconsistencies and frankly a whole lot of crap and how horrid the dancing was 0 
hes a national treasure 1 
all in all id expected a better consumer experience from motorola 0 
the plot simply rumbles on like a machine desperately depending on the addition of new scenes 0 
this place is not quality sushi it is not a quality restaurant 0

worst phone ever 0 
too bad cause i know its family owned i really wanted to like this place 0 
the movie was so boring that i sometimes found myself occupied peaking in the paper instead of watching never happened during a columbo movie before 0 
personally i think it shows that people should learn to find a compromise them self without involving other people into issue 1 
not sure who was more lost the flat characters or the audience nearly half of whom walked out 0 
bad purchase 0 
i will continue to come here on ladies night andddd date night highly recommend this place to anyone who is in the area 1 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1

overall a delight 1 
theres barely a boring moment in the film and there are plenty of humorous parts 1 
this item is great installed it let it charged up overnite and it has been working good every since with no problems 1 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
this is the place where i first had pho and it was amazing 1 
the secondary plot line is incomprehensible and its relation to the primary plot line is mystifying 0 
i could not understand what kind of idiot would produce this mess in the first place not to mention several season 0 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
i was very disappointed in the movie 0 
waaaaaayyyyyyyyyy over rated is all i am saying 0 
we had so much to say about the place before we walked in that he expected it to be amazing but was quickly disappointed 0 
im probably one of the few people to ever go to ians and not like it 0 
phone now holds charge like it did when it was new 1 
the phone was unusable and was not new 0 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
the film is way too long 0 
cute quaint simple honest 1 
then i exchanged for the same phone even that had the same problem 0 
go and see it 1 
everyone is treated equally special 1 
i had a salad with the wings and some ice cream for dessert and left feeling quite satisfied 1

i liked this movie way too much 1 
the price was very good and with the free shipping and all it was a good purchase 1 
i loved it it was really scary 1 
i am very happy 1

all in all ha long bay was a bit of a flop 0 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
this was a poor remake of my best friends wedding 0 
the worst one of the series 0 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
if you look for authentic thai food go else where 0 
great price too 1 
there are the usual hitchcock logic flaws 0 
the phone was unusable and was not new 0 
if that bug never showed up i would have given a 4 for sure but on the other side of the wall where this bug was climbing was the kitchen 0 
an italian reviewer called this a small great film and thats right 1 
total waste of time 0 
i thought it was bad 0 
a very very very slowmoving aimless movie about a distressed drifting young man 0 
you cant relate with them hell you barely can understand them 0 
i would avoid this place if you are staying in the mirage 0 
his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic 1 
i loved their mussels cooked in this wine reduction the duck was tender and their potato dishes were delicious 1 
trumbull on i love lucy 1 
he really didnt seem to want to be hosting his voiceovers were monotonous didnt get involved with the guests 0

fits comfortably came with three sizes of earbud tips 1 
all in all an excellent restaurant highlighted by great service a unique menu and a beautiful setting 1 
i let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this bad idea we both hated it 0 
it is light has plenty of battery capacity and is very confortable to wear for somewhat extended periods of time 1 
the soundtrack sucked 0 
so anyone near you will hear part of your conversation 0 
dont waste your time here 0 
dont buy it 0 
totally different with loads of understatement and black comedy this is a film few get to see but those who do will remember it 1 
adapter does not provide enough charging current 0 
its like a really sexy party in your mouth where youre outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party 1 
its pure brilliance 1 
the only downside is the service 0 
this is one of peter watkins most accessible films 1 
this allows the possibility of double booking for the same date and time after the first 0 
macbeth jason connery moved me to tears with his final monolog out brief candle outhe gave the sphere of moral decay and dark forces a human face which makes it the more interesting 1
