but now i was completely grossed out 0 
plantronics bluetooth excelent buy 1 
horrible 0 
an hour and a half i wish i could bring back 0 
i have to use the smallest earpieces provided but it stays on pretty well 1 
what a waste of time 0 
as for the service i thought it was good 1 
we are sending it back 0 
yeah the movie pretty much sucked 0 
excellent service 1 
excellent 1 
this is probably the most irritating show i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
i wasnt the least bit interested 0 
go to place for gyros 1 
i got it because it was so small and adorable 1 
that being said for a phone the camera is very nice many cool effects to play with and video is decent as well 1 
i find wasting food to be despicable but this just wasnt food 0 
dont miss it 1 
doesnt hold charge 0 
i found this move beautiful enjoyable and uplifting 1 
you cant beat the price on these 1 
owners are really great people 1 
nice ambiance 1 
maybe its just their vegetarian fare but ive been twice and i thought it was average at best 0 
phone now holds charge like it did when it was new 1 
the film is way too long 0 
loved itfriendly servers great food wonderful and imaginative menu 1 
this phone works great 1 
this item is great installed it let it charged up overnite and it has been working good every since with no problems 1 
i came over from verizon because cingulair has nicer cell phones the first thing i noticed was the really bad service 0 
back to good bbq lighter fare reasonable pricing and tell the public they are back to the old ways 1 
frozen pucks of disgust with some of the worst people behind the register 0 
is it possible for a movie to get any worse than this 0 
he deserves 5 stars 1 
but in terms of the writing its very fresh and bold 1 
very good quality though 1 
the camera although rated at an impressive 13 megapixels renders images that fall well below expectations of such a relatively high resolution 0 
having trouble with volume 0 
adapter does not provide enough charging current 0 
i ordered this for sony ericsson w810i but i think it only worked once thats when i first used it 0 
treo and tmobile refused to replace it again and forced me to buy another phone without any kind of upgrade discount 0 
overall i would recommend this phone over the new walkman 1 
each day of the week they have a different deal and its all so delicious 1 
he deserves 5 stars 1 
i cannot believe that the actors agreed to do this film 0 
nice leather 1 
incredible 1 
elias koteasjack palance play good roles angelina is hot and gets nakedbilly drago appears in this and is cool as usual a cameo by sven ole thorsen helps make this a very enjoyable movie with good acting and a decent budget 1 
uncomfortable in the ear dont use with lg vx9900 env 0 
overall i wasnt very impressed with noca 0 
not good enough for the price 0 
lightweight and works well 1 
the macarons here are insanely good 1 
good price 1 
totally different with loads of understatement and black comedy this is a film few get to see but those who do will remember it 1 
i found this move beautiful enjoyable and uplifting 1 
five star plus plus 1 
the service here leaves a lot to be desired 0 
the best part about nurse betty is its unpredictability 1 
5 stars for the brick oven bread app 1 
im so sorry but i really cant recommend it to anyone 0 
the best electronics of the available fm transmitters 1 
dont buy it 0 
i like steiners because its dark and it feels like a bar 1 
the chicken dishes are ok the beef is like shoe leather 0 
its hard not to fall headoverheels in love with that girl 1 
the acting as youd expect from this cast is top notch 1 
all the other cases ive tried normally fall apart after a few months but this one seems to be in for the long haul 1 
its a fresh subtle and rather sublime effect 1 
we waited for thirty minutes to be seated although there were 8 vacant tables and we were the only folks waiting 0 
not good by any stretch of the imagination 0 
by this time our side of the restaurant was almost empty so there was no excuse 0 
the only thing that i think could improve is the sound leaks out from the headset 0 
i got this phone on reccomendation from a relative and im glad i did 1 
overall i like there food and the service 1 
always a great time at dos gringos 1 
the new characters werent all that memorable and i found myself forgetting who was who 0 
the ambiance was incredible 1 
seafood was limited to boiled shrimp and crab legs but the crab legs definitely did not taste fresh 0 
i used bitpim a free program you can find on the internetto transfer data to the phonethe price of the cable was excellent 1 
and the red curry had so much bamboo shoots and wasnt very tasty to me 0 
someone shouldve invented this sooner 1 
steamboat willie is an amazingly important film to our cinema history 1 
shrimp when i unwrapped it i live only 12 a mile from brushfire it was literally ice cold 0 
it has northern humour and positive about the community it represents 1 
returned 8 hours later 0 
the least said about the acting the better 0 
when my mom and i got home she immediately got sick and she only had a few bites of salad 0 
he deserves 5 stars 1 
i cannot believe that the actors agreed to do this film 0 
dont buy this product 0 
i would recommend it 1 
exactly what i wanted 1 
food was good service was good prices were good 1 
very easy to use 1 
i use this product in a motor control center where there is a lot of high voltage humming from the equipment and it works great 1 
we arent ones to make a scene at restaurants but i just dont get itdefinitely lost the love after this one 0 
its one of the movies i need to see whenever it comes on tvnever mind the fact that i already have it memorized 1 
then i had to continue pairing it periodically since it somehow kept dropping 0 
sprint charges for this service 0 
i purcashed this for the car charger and it does not work 0 
the jabra eargels fit my ears very well 1 
its the one movie that never ceases to interest me simply because it keeps me alert as i try to attempt to decipher its meanings 1 
i will not be eating there again 0 
if you dont find it too bad as again the unit comes with one earpad onlyi would not recommend this to anyone 0 
my fianc√© and i came in the middle of the day and we were greeted and seated right away 1 
schrader has made a resume full of lousy amateurish films 0 
we thought youd have to venture further away to get good sushi but this place really hit the spot that night 1 
the charger worked for about a week and then completely stopped charging my phone 0 
the tracfonewebsite is user friendly and makes it easy toactivate etc 1 
the descriptions said yum yum sauce and another said eel sauce yet another said spicy mayowell none of the rolls had sauces on them 0 
i love the pho and the spring rolls oh so yummy you have to try 1 
product is useless since it does not have enough charging current to charge the 2 cellphones i was planning to use it with 0 
i wont spoil it but the ending in pretty amazing 1 
i would advise to not purchase this item it never worked very well 0 
im returning them 0 
great pork sandwich 1 
i think i was one of the people who found this another one of roths pearls 1 
their chow mein is so good 1 
why are these sad little vegetables so overcooked 0 
the phone crashed completely and now i have to get it replaced 0 
omelets are to die for 1 
i have two more years left in this contract and i hate this phone 0 
all in all im quite satisfied with this purchase 1 
now we were chosen to be tortured with this disgusting piece of blatant american propaganda 0 
about half way through this film i started to dislike it 0 
the two main characters may be two of the most believable children i ever saw put on screen 1 
this battery is an excellent bargain 1 
poor product 0 
never heard of any of them except cole who was totally unbelievable in the part 0 
will definitely be back 1 
i totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is 1 
motorola finally got the voice quality of a bluetooth headset right 1 
the screen size is big key pad lit well enough and the camera quality is excellent for a camera phone 1 
but i definitely would not eat here again 0 
ill give this film 10 out of 10 1 
this convention never worked well in the past and certainly doesnt work here 0 
i saw it as a child on tv back in 1973 when it was the stranger and i loved it 1 
poor quality 0 
simple lightweight and great fit 1 
i can think of no other film where something vitally important occurs every other minute 1 
i know this is not like the other restaurants at all something is very off here 0 
for sushi on the strip this is the place to go 1 
what the hell kind of crap is that 0 
do not make the same mistake as me 0 
its like a really sexy party in your mouth where youre outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party 1 
would recommend this item 1 
but the premise of the film was so ridiculous that the president of the us 0 
the burger is good beef cooked just right 1 
the restaurant atmosphere was exquisite 1 
the biggest complaint i have is the battery drains superfast 0 
for the price on amazon it is an excellent product which i would highly recommend 1 
the warm beer didnt help 0 
four stars for the food the guy in the blue shirt for his great vibe still letting us in to eat 1 
it is a very well acted and done tv movie 1 
i dont like this nokia either 0 
this mostly routine factbased tv drama gets a boost from the fine performance by cole 1 
im pleased 1 
and generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode 0 
after i pulled up my car i waited for another 15 minutes before being acknowledged 0 
say bye bye to your tip lady 0 
great food and great service in a clean and friendly setting 1 
first off the reception sucks i have never had more than 2 bars ever 0 
my sanyo has survived dozens of drops on blacktop without ill effect 1 
the pairing of the two devices was so easy it barely took a couple minutes before i started making calls with the voice dialing feature 1 
the cast is always entertaining as usual 1 
i checked everywhere and there is no feature for it which is really disappointing 0 
lordy the khao soi is a dish that is not to be missed for curry lovers 1 
im terribly disappointed that this film would receive so many awards and accolades especially when there are far more deserving works of film out there 0 
this is a witty and delightful adaptation of the dr seuss book brilliantly animated by upas finest and thoroughly deserving of its academy award 1 
and generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode 0 
the battery is working well as a replacement for the original that came with the phone over 2 years ago 1 
what this film lacks is a convincing script 0 
it was horrendous 0 
i really liked that 1 
i like design and look of jabra behing the ear headsets and 5020 is pretty comfortible to wear 24 hours a day without pain in the ear 1 
seafood was limited to boiled shrimp and crab legs but the crab legs definitely did not taste fresh 0 
delicious and i will absolutely be back 1 
the steak and the shrimp are in my opinion the best entrees at gc 1 
join the club and get awesome offers via email 1 
which has more depth and character than the man underneath it 0 
the phone crashed completely and now i have to get it replaced 0 
razr battery good buy 1 
see it with your kids if you have a chanceit will open up some amazing dialog about how far race relations have come in the last 50 years 1 
it has northern humour and positive about the community it represents 1 
the pizza selections are good 1 
i would highly recommend this 1 
recommend with confidence 1 
my husband and i ate lunch here and were very disappointed with the food and service 0 
waste of 13 bucks 0 
i highly recommend this movie for anyone interested in art poetry theater politics or japanese history 1 
he deserves 5 stars 1 
the screen does get smudged easily because it touches your ear and face 0 
every thing on phone work perfectly she like it 1 
i am also very happy with the price 1 
its a fresh subtle and rather sublime effect 1 
end of days is one of the worst bigbudget action movies ive ever seen 0 
i have been very happy with the 510 and have had no complaints from any one regarding my sound quality on their end 1 
after two i felt disgusting 0 
piece of trash 0 
this is probably one of the least effective and utterly unoriginal films i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
the only thing that i think could improve is the sound leaks out from the headset 0 
i love the scream movies and all horror movies and this one ranks way up there 1 
i always order from the vegetarian menu during dinner which has a wide array of options to choose from 1 
absolutely great 1 
the jamaican mojitos are delicious 1 
ample portions and good prices 1 
i had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get some relief 0 
there were too many close ups 0 
i did not have any problem with this item and would order it again if needed 1 
this phone is pretty sturdy and ive never had any large problems with it 1 
this blueant supertooth handsfree phone speaker is awesome 1 
i have only had it for a few weeks but so far so good 1 
perfect for the ps3 1 
food was great and so was the serivce 1 
phone falls out easily 0 
its a gloriously fun fast paced and fairly accurate portrayal of the night of a raver 1 
the color is even prettier than i thought it would be and the graphics are incredibly sharp 1 
i was deeply impressed with the character he played 1 
the place was fairly clean but the food simply wasnt worth it 0 
the poor actors 0 
despite the pans of reviewers i liked this movie 1 
took an hour to get our food only 4 tables in restaurant my food was luke warm our sever was running around like he was totally overwhelmed 0 
you also cannot take pictures with it in the case because the lense is covered 0 
if you want a real scare rent this one 1 
its really easy 1 
the bottowm lineanother worthless cheap gimmick from sprint 0 
the battery runs down quickly 0 
2 thumbs up 1 
this movie is possibly one of the most creative works of horror ever 1 
great product fast shipping 1 
i dont think well be going back anytime soon 0 
bad script bad direction and horrible acting make this one plain bad 0 
i gave it 5 stars because of the sound quality 1 
i came over from verizon because cingulair has nicer cell phones the first thing i noticed was the really bad service 0 
it was equally awful 0 
after 20 minutes wait i got a table 0 
i was bored throughout the whole damn thing 0 
today was my first taste of a buldogis gourmet hot dog and i have to tell you it was more than i ever thought possible 1 
this place should honestly be blown up 0 
the instruction manual is lacking 0 
very good quality though 1 
ive bought 5 wired headphones that sound better than these 0 
the buttons for on and off are bad 0 
what did bother me was the slow service 0 
i can barely ever hear on it and am constantly saying what 0 
i wouldnt return 0 
i felt asleep the first time i watched it so i can recommend it for insomniacs 0 
love this product 1 
despite how hard i rate businesses its actually rare for me to give a 1 star 0 
small sleek impressive looking practical setup with ample storage in place 1 
bad reception 0 
doesnt work 0 
spend your money and time some place else 0 
not tasty and the texture was just nasty 0 
do not waste your money here 0 
superb phone on a great network 1 
we loved the place 1 
there arent death scenes like in previous movies and the fx are terrible 0 
the script is a big flawed mess 0 
whatever prompted such a documentary is beyond me 0 
used and dirty 0 
on the good side the staff was genuinely pleasant and enthusiastic a real treat 1 
it is a very well acted and done tv movie 1 
a great touch 1 
the phone gets extremely hot 0 
highly recommend for any one who has a blue tooth phone 1 
the cashier had no care what so ever on what i had to say it still ended up being wayyy overpriced 0 
the chips that came out were dripping with grease and mostly not edible 0 
avoid this establishment 0 
not good by any stretch of the imagination 0 
very good though 1 
however the ear pads come off easily and after only one week i lost one 0 
i really recommend this faceplates since it looks very nice elegant and cool 1 
their chow mein is so good 1 
i wear it everyday and it holds up very well 1 
great place to eat reminds me of the little mom and pop shops in the san francisco bay area 1 
the story line is just awful 0 
this isnt a small family restaurant this is a fine dining establishment 1 
for the price on amazon it is an excellent product which i would highly recommend 1 
the owners really really need to quit being soooooo cheap let them wrap my freaking sandwich in two papers not one 0 
a truly truly bad film 0 
very good food great atmosphere1 1 
unreliable im giving up 0 
fans of the genre will be in heaven 1 
it is worth the drive 1 
wed definitely go back here again 1 
the nano stated itmy son was dissapointed 0 
the holster that arrived did not match the photo in the ad 0 
john wayne did an incredible job for being so young in the movie industry 1 
if there was ever a movie that needed wordofmouth to promote this is it 1 
great case and price 1 
their menu is diverse and reasonably priced 1 
and generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode 0 
i would recommend saving room for this 1 
there is no real plot 0 
definitely not worth the 3 i paid 0 
their steaks are 100 recommended 1 
i got the car charger and not even after a week the charger was brokeni went to plug it in and it started smoking 0 
the biggest complaint i have is the battery drains superfast 0 
worst foodservice ive had in a while 0 
i was not happy with this item 0 
this battery is an excellent bargain 1 
i think the most wonderful parts literally full of wonder are the excerpts from his works 1 
its very slow 0 
pretty cool i would say 1 
the script is bad very bad ¬ñ it contains both cheesiness and unethical joke that you normally see in rated r or nc17 movie 0 
the cow tongue and cheek tacos are amazing 1 
i didnt realize how wonderful the short really is until the last two scenes 1 
this place deserves no stars 0 
however bt headsets are currently not good for real time games like firstperson shooters since the audio delay messes me up 0 
there is no plot here to keep you going in the first place 0 
the keyboard is a nice compromise between a full qwerty and the basic cell phone number keypad 1 
a pretty good product 1 
the handsfree part works fine but then the car tries to download the address book and the treo rebootsoverall i still rate this device high 1 
in addition it feels amp looks as if the phone is all lightweight cheap plastic 0 
it was a drive to get there 0 
his use of the colours of the french flag in the three films was nothing short of incredible every shot every scene was like a work of art 1 
the food was delicious our bartender was attentive and personable and we got a great deal 1 
linked to my phone without effort 1 
that was funny 1 
i would have casted her in that role after ready the script 1 
it has been a winner for us 1 
i believe that pitch black was done well 1 
i guess i liked the details of his dysfunctionhe was believable 1 
have been going since 2007 and every meal has been awesome 1 
all i can do is whine on the internet so here it goesthe more i use the thing the less i like it 0 
terrible management 0 
i am sorry i made this purchase 0 
it was a drive to get there 0 
cumbersome design 0 
id love to go back 1 
it fits my ear well and is comfortable on 1 
it was either too cold not enough flavor or just bad 0 
i do love sushi but i found kabuki to be overpriced overhip and underservices 0 
the only good thing was our waiter he was very helpful and kept the bloddy marys coming 1 
the plot well i said id let that one go 0 
the staff is always super friendly and helpful which is especially cool when you bring two small boys and a baby 1 
10 out of 10 for both the movie and trilogy 1 
food arrived quickly 1 
it plays louder than any other speaker of this size the price is so low that most would think the quality is lacking however its not 1 
the sound is clear and the people i talk to on it are amazed at the quality too 1 
this isnt a small family restaurant this is a fine dining establishment 1 
im not really sure how joeys was voted best hot dog in the valley by readers of phoenix magazine 0 
the bipolarity of the ruthless thug one minute a ruthless killer the next minute a luvs diaper commercial is completely unconvincing 0 
after charging overnight these batteries work great 1 
the movie lacks visual interest drama expression of feeling and celebration of the very patriotism that underlines the narrative 0 
these are certainly very comfortable and functionality is decent 1 
when i saw it in the theater i thought i was going to be sick 0 
we will not be coming back 0 
what a mistake that was 0 
john garfield ann revere lilli plmer william conrad canada leeand filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screenjames wong howe 1 
the acting is fantastic the stories are seamlessly woven together and the dogs are splendid a must rent view or see 1 
the yellowtail carpaccio was melt in your mouth fresh 1 
it was forced like everything in this movie 0 
however paul schrader has indeed made a film about mishima that is both superb complex 1 
overall i was not impressed and would not go back 0 
voice quality signal strength dropped calls 0 
it just blew 0 
now the pizza itself was good the peanut sauce was very tasty 1 
rip off over charge shipping 0 
this was my first and only vegas buffet and it did not disappoint 1 
i really enjoyed eating here 1 
strike 2 who wants to be rushed 0 
service was very prompt 1 
my rating just 3 out of 10 0 
not a good item it worked for a while then started having problems in my auto reverse tape player 0 
the characters are fleshed out surprisingly well particularly grimes and blake and all the actors deliver their sharply scripted lines with just the right amount of deadpan tongue in cheek to make the dialogue both hilarious and realistic 1 
also the phone doesnt seem to accept anything except cbr mp3s preferably ripped by windows media player 0 
piece of junk 0 
do not buy do not buyit sucks 0 
the best place to go for a tasty bowl of pho 1 
on three different occasions i asked for well done or medium well and all three times i got the bloodiest piece of meat on my plate 0 
stopped by during the late may bank holiday off rick steve recommendation and loved it 1 
the tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu 0 
people couldnt hear me talk and i had to pull out the earphone and talk on the phone 0 
i never walked out of a movie faster 0 
they really want to make your experience a good one 1 
favorite place in town for shawarrrrrrma 1 
this is a masterful piece of filmmaking with many themes simmering and occasionally boiling over in this warts and all study of the poets bohemian selfindulgent wartime years that span the aerial bombardments of london and the outward tranquillity of a welsh coastal retreat the borderlines between friendship lust and love dedication to art and experience versus practical concerns jealousy rivalry cowardice and egotism versus heroism and selfsacrifice and more 1 
i had high hopes for this place since the burgers are cooked over a charcoal grill but unfortunately the taste fell flat way flat 0 
i am very happy 1 
bela lugosi was totally extraneous intoning odd lines 0 
fantastic earphones 1 
bad characters bad story and bad acting 0 
poor talk time performance 0 
they have a really nice atmosphere 1 
will not be back 0 
blue ant is easy to use 1 
my headset works just peachykeen 1 
a fly was in my apple juice a fly 0 
by this time our side of the restaurant was almost empty so there was no excuse 0 
service stinks here 0 
the steak was amazingrge fillet relleno was the best seafood plate i have ever had 1 
dessert panna cotta was amazing 1 
there are the usual hitchcock logic flaws 0 
the memories are murky but i can only say that i enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show 1 
great price also 1 
we had so much to say about the place before we walked in that he expected it to be amazing but was quickly disappointed 0 
all in all im quite satisfied with this purchase 1 
this film offers many delights and surprises 1 
an interesting premise and billy drago is always good as a dangerous nutbag side note id love to see drago stephen mchattie and lance hendrikson in a flick together talk about raging cheekbones 1 
the phone gets extremely hot 0 
rude inconsiderate management 0 
in summary this was a largely disappointing dining experience 0 
the food was delicious our bartender was attentive and personable and we got a great deal 1 
awful 0 
a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it 1 
anne heche was utterly convincing 1 
id advise anyone to go and see it 1 
very funny 1 
horrible dont waste your time and money 0 
i put the latest os on it v115g and it now likes to slow to a crawl and lock up every once in a while 0 
ray charles life provided excellent biographical material for the film which goes well beyond being just another movie about a musician 1 
on the ground right next to our table was a large smeared beensteppedinandtrackedeverywhere pile of green bird poop 0 
tom wilkinson broke my heart at the end and everyone elses judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike 1 
the staff was very attentive 1 
so for our enjoyment we get to see them run around play games and be dangerous 1 
the best place to go for a tasty bowl of pho 1 
delicious 1 
then i exchanged for the same phone even that had the same problem 0 
i dont each much pasta but i love the homemade hand made pastas and thin pizzas here 1 
my 5year old nokia 2160 from tracfone holds the charge a lot better than this 0 
im not impressed with the concept or the food 0 
this is actually a very smart movie 1 
plantronics bluetooth excelent buy 1 
it will drive you barking mad 0 
every time he opened his mouth you expect to hear you see kids pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show 0 
i hope this place sticks around 1 
everything from acting to cinematography was solid 1 
one more thing i can tolerate political incorrectness very well im all for artistic freedom and suspension of disbelief but the slavic female character was just too much 0 
fast service 1 
the only thing really worth watching was the scenery and the house because it is beautiful 1 
really bad 0 
the burger had absolutely no flavor the meat itself was totally bland the burger was overcooked and there was no charcoal flavor 0 
i have purchased these for both family and friends and all enjoy their clarity and ease of use 1 
very good quality though 1 
this movie is a good and humorous comment on life in 2006 1 
great phone 1 
its kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly its embarrassing how childlike the company is 0 
the chips and sals a here is amazing 1 
ordered burger rare came in well done 0 
ray charles life provided excellent biographical material for the film which goes well beyond being just another movie about a musician 1 
i dont each much pasta but i love the homemade hand made pastas and thin pizzas here 1 
very good phone 1 
his losing his marbles so early in the proceedings is totally implausible and unconvincing 0 
i was particularly pleased with the acting ability of dwight schultz 1 
i could not stand to even watch it for very long for fear of losing iq 0 
very cheap plastic creaks like an old wooden floor 0 
the han nan chicken was also very tasty 1 
would not reccommend 0 
just reading on the specs alone makes you say wow 1 
five star plus plus 1 
his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic 1 
i am a fan of his this movie sucked really bad 0 
would recommend this item 1 
service was fantastic 1 
amazon sucks 0 
best tater tots in the southwest 1 
my sanyo has survived dozens of drops on blacktop without ill effect 1 
the yellowtail carpaccio was melt in your mouth fresh 1 
i thoroughly enjoyed it when christopher eccleston took control of the tardis and the continuation of the series 1 
excellent 1 
this is a great little item 1 
it was awesome 1 
not much dialogue not much music the whole film was shot as elaborately and aesthetically like a sculpture 1 
not much dialogue not much music the whole film was shot as elaborately and aesthetically like a sculpture 1 
otherwise dont even waste your time on this 0 
its fits like a glove and is strong secure and durable 1 
at first glance it is a lovely bakery cafe nice ambiance clean friendly staff 1 
really good product 1 
the servers went back and forth several times not even so much as an are you being helped 0 
is pretty funny 1 
it does everything the description said it would 1 
this is such a fun and funny movie 1 
i ate there twice on my last visit and especially enjoyed the salmon salad 1 
this phone might well be the worst ive ever had in any brand 0 
main thing i didnt enjoy is that the crowd is of older crowd around mid 30s and up 0 
and it was boring 0 
great price also 1 
i paid the bill but did not tip because i felt the server did a terrible job 0 
seriously flavorful delights folks 1 
do not waste your money here 0 
the guys all had steaks and our steak loving son who has had steak at the best and worst places said it was the best steak hes ever eaten 1 
the show would begin with smart ass ed comments to each other that would be totally off the wall and uncalled for 0 
it is a joy to use 1 
dee snider just plain sucks 0 
it doesnt work in europe or asia 0 
ryans bar is definitely one edinburgh establishment i wont be revisiting 0 
a drive thru means you do not want to wait around for half an hour for your food but somehow when we end up going here they make us wait and wait 0 
would come back again if i had a sushi craving while in vegas 1 
but when i check voice mail at night the keypad backlight turns off a few seconds into the first message and then im lost 0 
it is wonderful and inspiring to watch and i hope that it gets released again on to video or dvd 1 
the chips and sals a here is amazing 1 
no actress has been worse used that june allison in this movie 0 
on the ground right next to our table was a large smeared beensteppedinandtrackedeverywhere pile of green bird poop 0 
so i bought about 10 of these and saved alot of money 1 
awesome service and food 1 
the staff is great the food is delish and they have an incredible beer selection 1 
better than expected 1 
point your finger at any item on the menu order it and you wont be disappointed 1 
this wonderful experience made this place a muststop whenever we are in town again 1 
an italian reviewer called this a small great film and thats right 1 
the bottowm lineanother worthless cheap gimmick from sprint 0 
is pretty funny 1 
the script is a big flawed mess 0 
the chips and sals a here is amazing 1 
comfortable nice range good battery life 1 
the jabra eargels fit my ears very well 1 
i especially love the long battery life 1 
when im on this side of town this will definitely be a spot ill hit up again 1 
they have horrible attitudes towards customers and talk down to each one when customers dont enjoy their food 0 
this item worked great but it broke after 6 months of use 0 
after trying many many handsfree gadgets this is the one that finally works well 1 
overall the film is interesting and thoughtprovoking 1 
the instruction manual is lacking 0 
the bartender was also nice 1 
its extremely slow and takes forever to do anything with it 0 
i got home to see the driest damn wings ever 0 
it was a drive to get there 0 
poorly contstruct hinge 0 
almost all of the songs in cover girl are oldfashioned and not very tuneful 0 
the range is very decent ive been able to roam around my house with the phone in the living room with no receptionsound quality issues 1 
the real disappointment was our waiter 0 
best of all is the rotating feature very helpful 1 
go to place for gyros 1 
very prompt service 1 
about half way through this film i started to dislike it 0 
we arent ones to make a scene at restaurants but i just dont get itdefinitely lost the love after this one 0 
this second appearance of mickey mouse following the silent plane crazy earlier that year is probably his most famous filmmostly because it was so groundbreaking 1 
we were promptly greeted and seated 1 
it is an excellent drama an excellent thriller and an excellent film 1 
the movie had you on the edge of your seat and made you somewhat afraid to go to your car at the end of the night 1 
an amazing finale to possibly the best trilogy of all time 1 
it also took her forever to bring us the check when we asked for it 0 
an hour and a half i wish i could bring back 0 
check it out 1 
no ear loop needed its tiny and the sound is great 1 
what on earth is irons doing in this film 0 
the film gives meaning to the phrase never in the history of human conflict has so much been owed by so many to so few 1 
well never go again 0 
alexander nevsky is a great film 1 
about ten minutes into this film i started having second thoughts 0 
again lame 0 
i would definitely recommend the jabra bt250v for those who are looking for comfort clarity and a great price 1 
id rather eat airline food seriously 0 
very clear quality sound and you dont have to mess with the sound on your ipod since you have the sound buttons on the headset 1 
the buttons for on and off are bad 0 
its kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly its embarrassing how childlike the company is 0 
wow loved this place 1 
bad reception 0 
only pros large seating area nice bar area great simple drink menu the best brick oven pizza with homemade dough 1 
the pizza tasted old super chewy in not a good way 0 
maybe its just their vegetarian fare but ive been twice and i thought it was average at best 0 
if you have not seen this movie i definitely recommend it 1 
but now i was completely grossed out 0 
the price was very good and with the free shipping and all it was a good purchase 1 
now this is a movie i really dislike 0 
chinese forgeries abound 0 
he was terrible 0 
horrible had to switch 3 times 0 
will never ever go back and have told many people what had happened 0 
attempting artiness with black white and clever camera angles the movie disappointed became even more ridiculous as the acting was poor and the plot and lines almost nonexistent 0 
barney is definitely super de duper 1 
plus it was wellpaced and suited its relatively short run time 1 
the dialogue sucked 0 
overall a delight 1 
this is such a fun and funny movie 1 
everyone is treated equally special 1 
bluetooth does not work phone locks up screens just flash up and now it just makes calls randomly while in my pocket locked 0 
the macarons here are insanely good 1 
i ordered the voodoo pasta and it was the first time id had really excellent pasta since going gluten free several years ago 1 
delicious and i will absolutely be back 1 
his losing his marbles so early in the proceedings is totally implausible and unconvincing 0 
its one of the most boring horror movies from the 90s mainly because it starts slow and centers in a boring atmosphere 0 
everything about it is fine and reasonable for the price ie 1 
it was so cool 1 
the explosion of the gas tanks at the end was just as awful 0 
probably not in a hurry to go back 0 
the holster that arrived did not match the photo in the ad 0 
the delivery was on time 1 
now this is a movie i really dislike 0 
this place is pretty good nice little vibe in the restaurant 1 
you cant relate with them hell you barely can understand them 0 
what a mistake that was 0 
not much dialogue not much music the whole film was shot as elaborately and aesthetically like a sculpture 1 
works good 1 
none of the new ones have ever quite worked properly 0 
good item low price 1 
the only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port irda 0 
the atmosphere was great with a lovely duo of violinists playing songs we requested 1 
the characters are interesting and you want to find out more about them the longer the movie goes on and i think people will be surprised by who does and doesnt make it 1 
i purcashed this for the car charger and it does not work 0 
i think i was one of the people who found this another one of roths pearls 1 
i own 2 of these cases and would order another 1 
the worst experience ever 0 
we asked for the bill to leave without eating and they didnt bring that either 0 
i didnt know pulled pork could be soooo delicious 1 
to be honest with you this is unbelievable nonsense and very foolish 0 
couldnt figure it out 0 
my 810 score is mostly for the plot 1 
and generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode 0 
great headset very impressed h500 1 
the building itself seems pretty neat the bathroom is pretty trippy but i wouldnt eat here again 0 
it has a great camera thats 2mp and the pics are nice and clear with great picture quality 1 
i dont think ill be running back to carlys anytime soon for food 0 
does not fit 0 
dont make the same mistake i did 0 
im a bit disappointed 0 
it is perfect for a sitdown family meal or get together with a few friends 1 
the acting by the whole cast could be put on a scale and balanced perfectly between overacting and underacting 0 
aailiyah was pretty good as akasha in places compelling her first entrance and mini dance scene 1 
never got it 0 
delicious nyc bagels good selections of cream cheese real lox with capers even 1 
a standout scene 1 
the films sole bright spot was jonah hill who will look almost unrecognizable to fans of the recent superbad due to the amount of weight he lost in the interim 1 
integrated seamlessly with the motorola razr phone 1 
having to humour him just to get by and get through the day was so apt 1 
the service here leaves a lot to be desired 0 
the incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film 1 
it is very comfortable to wear as well which is probably the most important aspect about using a case 1 
both films are terrible but to the credit of the 1986 version it was watchable 0 
terrible my car will not accept this cassette 0 
this is hands down the best phone ive ever had 1 
i will be back many times soon 1 
im super pissd 0 
totally believable 1 
this film has no redeeming features 0 
punishment park is a brilliant piece of cinema 1 
editing the editing of this film was phenomenal in my opinion 1 
amazon sucks 0 
in fact its hard to remember that the part of ray charles is being acted and not played by the man himself 1 
the steak and the shrimp are in my opinion the best entrees at gc 1 
the server was very negligent of our needs and made us feel very unwelcome i would not suggest this place 0 
works fine 1 
unfortunately the ability to actually know you are receiving a call is a rather important feature and this phone is pitiful in that respect 0 
the best scene in the movie was when gerardo is trying to find a song that keeps running through his head 1 
the tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu 0 
the acting helps the writing along very well maybe the idiotsavant sister could have been played better and it is a real joy to watch 1 
headset works great was packaged nicely to avoid any damage 1 
by far the best cheesecurds we have ever had 1 
the only thing i wasnt too crazy about was their guacamole as i dont like it pur√©ed 0 
i hope this place sticks around 1 
the sweet potato tots were good but the onion rings were perfection or as close as i have had 1 
sending it back 0 
service is also cute 1 
i give it 2 thumbs down 0 
ive missed numerous calls because of this reason 0 
great phone 1 
needless to say we will never be back here again 0
