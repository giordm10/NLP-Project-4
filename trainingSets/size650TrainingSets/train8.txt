lame would be the best way to describe it 0 
your servers suck wait correction our server heimer sucked 0 
waitress was a little slow in service 0 
the staff is friendly and the joint is always clean 1 
im terribly disappointed that this film would receive so many awards and accolades especially when there are far more deserving works of film out there 0 
i found the product to be easy to set up and use 1 
i immediately said i wanted to talk to the manager but i did not want to talk to the guy who was doing shots of fireball behind the bar 0 
and there wasnt a single sour note struck actingwise either some surprisingly solid casting here 1 
i went on motorolas website and followed all directions but could not get it to pair again 0 
doesnt last long 0 
i am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this 1 
disappointment i hate anything that goes in my ear 0 
it is an hour and half waste of time following a bunch of very pretty high schoolers whine and cry about life 0 
but even the talented carrell cant save this 0 
i saw it as a child on tv back in 1973 when it was the stranger and i loved it 1 
it felt like a very gripping intelligent stage play but without the overly theatrical feeling one actually gets from watching people on a stage which plays on everyones terror of a white lie escalating to monstrous consequences 1 
it is super charged up for use as a small hybrid palmtopcameracellphone and excels in those roles 1 
painful on the ear 0 
the plot has more holes than a pair of fishnet stockings and the direction and editing is astonishingly ham fisted 0 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
wont ever go here again 0 
after the disappointing dinner we went elsewhere for dessert 0 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
this movie is excellentangel is beautiful and scamp is adorablehis little yelps when hes scaredand the funniest parts are whenscamp is caught under the curtain and when angel and scamp are singing ive never had this feeling beforei totally recommend this movieits coming out on special edition on june 20the cover has scamp on a garbage can and angel underneath the lid 1 
good case excellent value 1 
there was a warm feeling with the service and i felt like their guest for a special treat 1 
this is the place where i first had pho and it was amazing 1 
my boyfriend and i came here for the first time on a recent trip to vegas and could not have been more pleased with the quality of food and service 1 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
plug was the wrong size 0 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
is pretty funny 1 
too politically correct 0 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
we ordered some old classics and some new dishes after going there a few times and were sorely disappointed with everything 0 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
waste of money 0 
the battery is completely useless to me 0 
easily none other cartoon made me laugh in a tender way before getting into dark sitcoms oriented for teenagers 1 
motorola finally got the voice quality of a bluetooth headset right 1 
there is simply no excuse for something this poorly done 0 
i was so insulted 0 
the film gives meaning to the phrase never in the history of human conflict has so much been owed by so many to so few 1 
the story is also both funny and poignant at times 1 
there is no real plot 0 
att is not clear sound is very distorted and you have to yell when you talk 0 
this fixes all the problems 1 
lame would be the best way to describe it 0 
not tasty and the texture was just nasty 0 
it lasts less than 3o minutes if i actually try to use the phonemy wife has the same phone with the same problem 0 
i use this product in a motor control center where there is a lot of high voltage humming from the equipment and it works great 1 
very good quality though 1 
cant store anything but phone numbers to sim 0 
when it opens the battery connection is broken and the device is turned off 0 
excellent product for the price 1 
the cashier had no care what so ever on what i had to say it still ended up being wayyy overpriced 0 
the acting by the whole cast could be put on a scale and balanced perfectly between overacting and underacting 0 
stay away from the q 0 
there are massive levels massive unlockable characters its just a massive game 1 
in fact i liked it better than interview with a vampire and i liked this lestat stuart townsend better than cruises attempt 1 
now i know that i made a wise decision 1 
the battery life is highly unacceptable 0 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
first off the reception sucks i have never had more than 2 bars ever 0 
due to this happening on every call i was forced to stop using this headset 0 
really good product 1 
1 long lasting battery you dont have to recharge it as frequentyly as some of the flip phones2 0 
i dont think you will be disappointed 1 
but other than that the movie seemed to drag and the heroes didnt really work for their freedom 0 
bad fit way too big 0 
now we were chosen to be tortured with this disgusting piece of blatant american propaganda 0 
to sum the film up breeders is a terrible cheaply made horror movie that should be avoided like the ebola virus 0 
everything is appalling 0 
excellent phone 1 
a truly truly bad film 0 
however after about a year the fliptop started to get loose and wobbly and eventually my screen went black and i couldnt receive and place calls 0 
jabra ear gels r the best 1 
if there was ever an indication of a writer and a directors ability to meld two highly volatile temperaments into a seamless union of creativity then this is it 1 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
would not go back 0 
for service i give them no stars 0 
total waste of time 0 
yes i am simplifying things here for the sake of brevity for this really is at the core of the problems with this film it has too much going on without any real fulfilling explanation 0 
excellent 1 
so i had to take the battery out of the phone put it all back together and then restart it 0 
we had fantastic service and were pleased by the atmosphere 1 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
why are these sad little vegetables so overcooked 0 
give this one a look 1 
dont go here 0 
my brother in law who works at the mall ate here same day and guess what he was sick all night too 0 
i recommend this for everyone who loves film movies anythinga work of art 1 
do not buy if you want to use the holster 0 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
then a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use 0 
i purcashed this for the car charger and it does not work 0 
and the accents are absolutely abysmal 0 
product is useless since it does not have enough charging current to charge the 2 cellphones i was planning to use it with 0 
i did not expect this to be so good 1 
the service was outshining i definitely recommend the halibut 1 
i have to jiggle the plug to get it to line up right to get decent volume 0 
they have a really nice atmosphere 1 
the acting is like watching wooden puppets moving around and reading from a book thats how bad it is 0 
thus far have only visited twice and the food was absolutely delicious each time 1 
i let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this bad idea we both hated it 0 
this is an outstanding little restaurant with some of the best food i have ever tasted 1 
the attempts at humor were pitiful and story is so awful it dosent bear thinking about which basically involves a vulcan stealing the enterprise to find god seriously i just didnt care about any of this film and oh not to mention uhura does a belly dance to distract male guards 0 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
the poor actors 0 
food was so gooodd 1 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
one of the best mexican movies ever and one of the less understood even by mexican themselves no matter how identified the should have felt with it 1 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
all things considered a job very well done 1 
i love the look and feel of samsung flipphones 1 
sweetest phone 1 
i love their fries and their beans 1 
the bt headset was such a disapoinment 0 
its a fresh subtle and rather sublime effect 1 
this is an outstanding little restaurant with some of the best food i have ever tasted 1 
the design might be ergonomic in theory but i could not stand having these in my ear 0 
thanks good a movie like this was done and released 1 
also notable is john baileys fine crisp beautifully colored cinematography and the great production design costumes by eiko ishioka who went on to do the memorable costumes for coppolas dracula for which she received a well deserved oscar 1 
i could eat their bruschetta all day it is devine 1 
never got it 0 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
of all the dishes the salmon was the best but all were great 1 
this is a great phone 1 
howeverthe riingtones are not the best and neither are the games 0 
really really good rice all the time 1 
the instructions didnt explain that a microphone jack could be used 0 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
best headset ever 1 
jabra ear gels r the best 1 
the loudspeaker option is great the bumpers with the lights is very appealing 0 
works great when my cat attacked the phone he scratched the protective strip instead of destroying the screen 1 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
service was very prompt 1 
went for lunch service was slow 0 
you cant beat that 1 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
this is a great restaurant at the mandalay bay 1 
all the actors give a wonderful performance especially jennifer rubin as jamie harris who changes from the nervous starlet in the beginning through the strange events she is part of to the cool star 1 
this case seems well made 1 
the restaurant is very clean and has a family restaurant feel to it 1 
my girlfriends veal was very bad 0 
were jerks on the phone 0 
they have a really nice atmosphere 1 
excellent starter wireless headset 0 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
it is cheap and it feel and look just as cheap 0 
the cinematographyif it can be called thatsucked 0 
very disappointing 0 
the movie has almost no action scenes in it and very little comedy 0 
how awful she is 0 
they have great dinners 1 
however paul schrader has indeed made a film about mishima that is both superb complex 1 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
no one at the table thought the food was above average or worth the wait that we had for it 0 
not sure who was more lost the flat characters or the audience nearly half of whom walked out 0 
restored my phone to like new performance 1 
the waiter wasnt helpful or friendly and rarely checked on us 0 
it was that year however that reminded us that huston was still at the top of his game as evinced by his faithful adaptation of james joyces acclaimed novella the dead 1 
its not user friendly 0 
i did not bother contacting the company for few dollar product but i learned the lesson that i should not have bought this form online anyway 0 
i believe the screenwriter did a good job of tying up the loose ends 1 
the use of slowmotion needlessly repeats itself throughout the movie but is well backed up by bad acting and bad is a kind word here no continuity scenes that are thrown in for no reason whatsoever vehicles that looked like they were made from a corn flakes box and a directorial style that bordered on stupidity 0 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
i like the fact that it rests lightly against your ear rather than inside 1 
both of the egg rolls were fantastic 1 
must have been an off night at this place 0 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
however my girl was complain that some time the phone doesnt wake up like normal phone does 0 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
it holds a charge for a long time is reasonably comfortable under longwearing conditions and the quality of sound is tremendous 1 
the entire audience applauded at the conclusion of the film 1 
the whole experience was underwhelming and i think well just go to ninja sushi next time 0 
very pleased with this headset 1 
just as good as when i had it more than a year ago 1 
the chips that came out were dripping with grease and mostly not edible 0 
muddy low quality sound and the casing around the wires insert was poorly super glued and slid off 0 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
its like a bad two hour tv movie 0 
after a year the battery went completely dead on my headset 0 
comes with a strong light that you can use to light up your camera shots and even flash sos signals seriously 1 
sorry i will not be getting food from here anytime soon 0 
i highly recommend this modest priced cellular phone 1 
the jalapeno bacon is soooo good 1 
disappointment i hate anything that goes in my ear 0 
did not like at all 0 
maybe if they werent cold they would have been somewhat edible 0 
i would definitely recommend the jabra bt250v for those who are looking for comfort clarity and a great price 1 
very satisifed with that 1 
very good lunch spot 1 
the owners are super friendly and the staff is courteous 1 
not what i wanted 0 
i dont think well be going back anytime soon 0 
if there were zero stars i would give it zero stars 0 
it was a long time that i didnt see a so charismatic actor on screen 1 
works fine 1 
the acting was bad 0 
this place is pretty good nice little vibe in the restaurant 1 
his performance as awarded was stunning 1 
the live music on fridays totally blows 0 
great for the jawbone 1 
my 810 score is mostly for the plot 1 
then as if i hadnt wasted enough of my life there they poured salt in the wound by drawing out the time it took to bring the check 0 
a disappointment 0 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
the poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying 0 
good product incredible value 1 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
another thing i didnt really like is when a character got punched in the face a gallon of blood would spew forth soon after 0 
the lighting is awful 0 
of all the dishes the salmon was the best but all were great 1 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
i believe that this place is a great stop for those with a huge belly and hankering for sushi 1 
everything was good and tasty 1 
lewis blacks considerable talent is wasted here too as he is at his most incendiary when he is unrestrained which the pg13 rating certainly wont allow 0 
its uncomfortable and the sound quality is quite poor compared with the phone razr or with my previous wired headset that plugged into an lg 0 
after the first charge kept going dead after 12 minutes 0 
this little device has transformed my organizational capability and made my life a whole lot easier 1 
that company is a joke 0 
i had to wait over 30 minutes to get my drink and longer to get 2 arepas 0 
ill be looking for a new earpiece 0 
lifetime does not air it enough so if anyone knows what store sells it let me know because this is a musthave 1 
the pancake was also really good and pretty large at that 1 
this is just a great movie 1 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
kind of flops around 0 
that movie was bad 0 
overall i am psyched to have a phone which has all my appointments and contacts in and gets great reception 1 
as for the service i thought it was good 1 
yes its that bad 0 
even in my bmw 3 series which is fairly quiet i have trouble hearing what the other person is saying 0 
the directing and the cinematography arent quite as good 0 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
just whatever you do avoid groove as its the antithesis of all that is good about human traffic 0 
its welldesigned and very sharp the blue is a very nice color 1 
disappointed 0 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
i highly recommend this movie for anyone interested in art poetry theater politics or japanese history 1 
he really didnt seem to want to be hosting his voiceovers were monotonous didnt get involved with the guests 0 
the first thing that happened was that the tracking was off 0 
frankly after cotton club and unfaithful it was kind of embarrassing to watch lane and gere in this film because it is bad 0 
exceptionally bad 0 
the phone crashed completely and now i have to get it replaced 0 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
for people who are first timers in film making i think they did an excellent job 1 
what a waste of time 0 
when it opens the battery connection is broken and the device is turned off 0 
spend your money and time some place else 0 
i was amazed at the quick arrival of the two original lg cell phone batteries and and at a fraction of the price 1 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
the plot doesnt hang together at all and the acting is absolutely appalling 0 
the script is horrendously stupid 0 
i advise you to look out for it 1 
worst service to boot but that is the least of their worries 0 
ambience is perfect 1 
the only thing that i think could improve is the sound leaks out from the headset 0 
nice leather 1 
being a 90s child i truly enjoyed this show and i can proudly say that i enjoyed it big time and even more than the classical wb cartoons 1 
this was utterly confusing at first which caused me to lose a couple of very very important contacts 0 
the real disappointment was our waiter 0 
an amazing finale to possibly the best trilogy of all time 1 
for people who are first timers in film making i think they did an excellent job 1 
and dont even get me started on the jerky camerawork 0 
then i exchanged for the same phone even that had the same problem 0 
this is an extraordinary film 1 
i hope this place sticks around 1 
the ripped banana was not only ripped but petrified and tasteless 0 
this frog phone charm is adorable and very eye catching 1 
everyone is treated equally special 1 
one of my favorite purchases ever 1 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
not much seafood and like 5 strings of pasta at the bottom 0 
the turkey and roast beef were bland 0 
last time buying from you 0 
it didnt make me scared horrified or make me sympathetic towards the characters it was simply annoying 0 
this little device has transformed my organizational capability and made my life a whole lot easier 1 
this movie is bad 0 
this is hands down the best phone ive ever had 1 
everything was good and tasty 1 
i had ordered a motorola data cable got a very well finished and working product 1 
looks great and is strong 1 
i loved it 1 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
we waited an hour for what was a breakfast i could have done 100 times better at home 0 
its a piece of crap 0 
the buttons for on and off are bad 0 
ill give this film 10 out of 10 1 
the characters are interesting and you want to find out more about them the longer the movie goes on and i think people will be surprised by who does and doesnt make it 1 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
he really didnt seem to want to be hosting his voiceovers were monotonous didnt get involved with the guests 0 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
dont waste your time watching this rubbish nonresearched film 0 
as a sushi lover avoid this place by all means 0 
a drive thru means you do not want to wait around for half an hour for your food but somehow when we end up going here they make us wait and wait 0 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
best tater tots in the southwest 1 
doesnt work at all i bougth it for my l7c and its not working 0 
pretty cool i would say 1 
but the duet between the astronaut and his doctor at the beginning of the movie is a perfect exchange if one considers that this movie was made well into the cold war and the astronauts biggest fear is that he has crashed in the ussr 1 
great price too 1 
owners are really great people 1 
and the red curry had so much bamboo shoots and wasnt very tasty to me 0 
my only complaint is the standard sound volume is a little low even when turned up to 5of 5 0 
again lame 0 
and those baby owls were adorable 1 
as for the service i thought it was good 1 
i highly recommend this device to everyone 1 
i use this product in a motor control center where there is a lot of high voltage humming from the equipment and it works great 1 
i had a seriously solid breakfast here 1 
just reading on the specs alone makes you say wow 1 
but when i check voice mail at night the keypad backlight turns off a few seconds into the first message and then im lost 0 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
i dont like this nokia either 0 
it was also the right balance of war and love 1 
the puppets look really cheesy not in a good way like in the puppet master 80s flicks 0 
too bad you have to pay up to a month for the service 0 
my rating just 3 out of 10 0 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
great phone 1 
the croutons also taste homemade which is an extra plus 1 
the food was excellent and service was very good 1 
it was equally awful 0 
exceptionally bad 0 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
every time he opened his mouth you expect to hear you see kids pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show 0 
the acting was decidely wooden though no worse than a period universal b movie 0 
this case seems well made 1 
i had to go to a store and bought a new nokia phone which is working great 1 
however bt headsets are currently not good for real time games like firstperson shooters since the audio delay messes me up 0 
even in my bmw 3 series which is fairly quiet i have trouble hearing what the other person is saying 0 
arrived quickly and much less expensive than others being sold 1 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
aside from its terrible lead this film has loads of other debits 0 
the chicken wings contained the driest chicken meat i have ever eaten 0 
great pork sandwich 1 
everything about this movie is stupid 0 
really bad 0 
the visual effects were awful 0 
the grilled chicken was so tender and yellow from the saffron seasoning 1 
the biggest complaint i have is the battery drains superfast 0 
i understand that its supposed to be a cheap popcorn comedy but that doesnt mean that it has to completely insult our intelligence and have writing so incredibly hackneyed that it borders on offensive 0 
this fixes all the problems 1 
i searched the internet and found this one to be the best value 1 
my 5year old nokia 2160 from tracfone holds the charge a lot better than this 0 
not to mention the combination of pears almonds and bacon is a big winner 1 
whatever the producer was going for he missed entirely 0 
cool phone 1 
its a gloriously fun fast paced and fairly accurate portrayal of the night of a raver 1 
not good for the money 0 
we had so much to say about the place before we walked in that he expected it to be amazing but was quickly disappointed 0 
thanks again to amazon for having the things i need for a good price 1 
regrettably the film fails 0 
very tough and very short on flavor 0 
the story starts too fast with absolutely no suspense or buildup in the slightest 0 
waaaaaayyyyyyyyyy over rated is all i am saying 0 
my order was not correct 0 
overall i would recommend this phone over the new walkman 1 
i didnt know pulled pork could be soooo delicious 1 
service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is vegas and located inside the crystals shopping mall by aria 1 
very disappointed 0 
i would highly recommend this product 1 
someone shouldve invented this sooner 1 
the best scene in the movie was when gerardo is trying to find a song that keeps running through his head 1 
the instructions didnt explain that a microphone jack could be used 0 
almost everyone involved must be return to school acting is utterly predictable and bad script is pile of garbage all round 0 
this was such an awesome movie that i bought it off of ebay 1 
and the accents are absolutely abysmal 0 
some may say this buffet is pricey but i think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot 1 
in particular the relationship between the bakery assistant and the waitress just didnt work for me at all 0 
this phone tries very hard to do everything but fails at its very ability to be a phone 0 
needless to say we will never be back here again 0 
first time there and might just be the last 0 
i think the most wonderful parts literally full of wonder are the excerpts from his works 1 
low quality 0 
at least think to refill my water before i struggle to wave you over for 10 minutes 0 
i as well wouldve given godfathers zero stars if possible 0 
im really disappointed all i have now is a charger that doesnt work 0 
the acting was bad the dialogs were extremely shallow and insincere 0 
its so stupid to have to keep buying new chargers car chargers cradles headphones and car kits every time a new phone comes out 0 
no im going to eat the potato that i found some strangers hair in it 0 
so dont go there if you are looking for good food 0 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
beautiful styling though 1 
it is not good 0 
bad choice 0 
this movie is excellentangel is beautiful and scamp is adorablehis little yelps when hes scaredand the funniest parts are whenscamp is caught under the curtain and when angel and scamp are singing ive never had this feeling beforei totally recommend this movieits coming out on special edition on june 20the cover has scamp on a garbage can and angel underneath the lid 1 
if there were zero stars i would give it zero stars 0 
what did bother me was the slow service 0 
really really good rice all the time 1 
but now i was completely grossed out 0 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
i would definitely recommend the jabra bt250v for those who are looking for comfort clarity and a great price 1 
bacon is hella salty 1 
there is no plot or storyline 0 
superb phone on a great network 1 
it is a joy to use 1 
having trouble with volume 0 
im translating movies for a living and this is the first movie in my 5year working experience that i found offensive to my intelligence 0 
phone falls out easily 0 
loved itfriendly servers great food wonderful and imaginative menu 1 
it felt too light and tinny 0 
the steak and the shrimp are in my opinion the best entrees at gc 1 
the sound quality is excellent as well 1 
even in my bmw 3 series which is fairly quiet i have trouble hearing what the other person is saying 0 
dont bother coming here 0 
i recently tried caballeros and i have been back every week since 1 
but storm trooper is not even bad enough to make it to the list of wonderfully terrible movies 0 
the service here leaves a lot to be desired 0 
they have been around for years and carries the highest quality of antiglare screen protector that i have found to date 1 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
i would recommend it 1 
they do not care about the consumer one bit 0 
all in all an excellent restaurant highlighted by great service a unique menu and a beautiful setting 1 
this place is overpriced not consistent with their boba and it really is overpriced 0 
mic doesnt work 0 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
i can barely ever hear on it and am constantly saying what 0 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
service was good and the company was better 1 
this place was such a nice surprise 1 
happy so far 1 
never heard of any of them except cole who was totally unbelievable in the part 0 
id advise anyone to go and see it 1 
great hands free device 1 
the performances are not improved by improvisation because the actors now have twice as much to worry about not only whether theyre delivering the line well but whether the line itself is any good 0 
2 thumbs up to this seller 1 
this is hands down the best phone ive ever had 1 
not good when wearing a hat or sunglasses 0 
unfortunately this is a bad movie that is just plain bad 0 
the film is well paced understated and one of the best courtroom documentaries ive seen 1 
i really enjoyed eating here 1 
the performances are real and gripping the crocdodile is extremely well done indeed if the black water website is to be believed thats because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous 1 
a piece of cinematic garbage captured on celluloid 0 
i was sitting in my vehicle with the cradle on my belt and the headset lost signal 0 
restaurant is always full but never a wait 1 
i had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get some relief 0 
this movie is a good and humorous comment on life in 2006 1 
this movie does an excellent job of revealing the complexity of the task and the incredible challenges facing south africa 1 
this is an extraordinary film 1 
that was done in the second movie 0 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
so i basically threw my money out the window for nothing 0 
this may be the only bad film he ever made 0 
i understand that its supposed to be a cheap popcorn comedy but that doesnt mean that it has to completely insult our intelligence and have writing so incredibly hackneyed that it borders on offensive 0 
it looks very nice 1 
finally after three or four times the spring of the latch broke and i could not use it any longer on the visor 0 
its kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly its embarrassing how childlike the company is 0 
was not happy 0 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
the selection on the menu was great and so were the prices 1 
the art style has the appearance of crayonpencil drawings and is wonderfully colorful and fanciful 1 
i ordered the voodoo pasta and it was the first time id had really excellent pasta since going gluten free several years ago 1 
waste your money on this game 1 
not only did the software do a great job of this i could also make my own ringtones form my existing cds without an internet connection 1 
the scripting of the subtle comedy is unmatched by any movie in recent years 1 
customer service was terrible 0 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
none of the new ones have ever quite worked properly 0 
it was a drive to get there 0 
this gets a 1 out of 10 simply because theres nothing lower 0 
sam shepards portrayal of a gung ho marine was sobering 1 
the ambiance isnt much better 0 
not tasty and the texture was just nasty 0 
highly entertaining at all angles 1 
personally i think it shows that people should learn to find a compromise them self without involving other people into issue 1 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
and the rest of it just sits there being awful with soldiers singing songs about the masculinity they pledge themselves to hairsplitting about purity the admiration of swords etc 0 
it was that loudglad to say that the plantronics 510 maintains a flawless connection to my cell and with no static during normal use 1 
the good cinematography also makes her and monica bellucci look very beautiful 1 
heres where the movie really pied me off 0 
the only thing that i think could improve is the sound leaks out from the headset 0 
very convenient since we were staying at the mgm 1 
the nokia ca42 usb cable did not work with my phone 0 
seems like a good quick place to grab a bite of some familiar pub food but do yourself a favor and look elsewhere 0 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
even worse than ticker 0 
today the graphics are crap 0 
i was bored throughout the whole damn thing 0 
being a 90s child i truly enjoyed this show and i can proudly say that i enjoyed it big time and even more than the classical wb cartoons 1 
never got it 0 
and service was super friendly 1 
the malta settings are as dry and as barren as the dialogue 0 
sauce was tasteless 0 
best service and food ever maria our server was so good and friendly she made our day 1 
best service and food ever maria our server was so good and friendly she made our day 1 
the point is the journey a journey that touches every member of the family 1 
what a waste of time 0 
ive had this bluetoooth headset for some time now and still not comfortable with the way it fits on the ear 0 
i had high hopes for this place since the burgers are cooked over a charcoal grill but unfortunately the taste fell flat way flat 0 
will definitely be back 1 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
cant upload ringtones from a third party 0 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
for 40 bucks a head i really expect better food 0 
how can you call yourself a steakhouse if you cant properly cook a steak i dont understand 0 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
the service was a bit lacking 0 
a must study for anyone interested in the worst sins of industrial design 0 
great phone 1 
i give it 2 thumbs down 0 
im really disappointed all i have now is a charger that doesnt work 0 
dont waste your money 0 
my salad had a bland vinegrette on the baby greens and hearts of palm 0 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
its so bad its actually worth seeing just for that reason 0 
dont buy it 0 
very disappointed and wondered how it could be in the oscar shortlist 0 
you truly take this journey through the eyes and soul of a child 1 
think of the film being like a dream 1 
the bipolarity of the ruthless thug one minute a ruthless killer the next minute a luvs diaper commercial is completely unconvincing 0 
during several different 2 minute calls i experienced 5 drops and it was in an area that had 5 bars 0 
you wont be disappointed 1 
everything on the menu is terrific and we were also thrilled that they made amazing accommodations for our vegetarian daughter 1 
cinematography the film was shot in an interesting way 1 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
great for ipods too 1 
crash is a depressing little nothing that provokes emotion but teaches you nothing if you already know racism and prejudice are bad things 0 
being a 90s child i truly enjoyed this show and i can proudly say that i enjoyed it big time and even more than the classical wb cartoons 1 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
definitely will come back here again 1 
if it was to turn my good day feeling into a night of disturbing memories than i guess he succeeded 0 
we had 7 at our table and the service was pretty fast 1 
i love it 1 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
this place is good 1 
piece of trash 0 
there still are good actors around 1 
it is a joy to use 1 
this is the phone to get for 2005 i just bought my s710a and all i can say is wow 1 
good case excellent value 1 
battery life is also great 1 
bland not a liking this place for a number of reasons and i dont want to waste time on bad reviewing ill leave it at that 0 
now i know that i made a wise decision 1 
worked very well paired with a treo 700w and as a skype headset on my pc using a usb bluetooth transceiver 1 
the chips and salsa were really good the salsa was very fresh 1 
i hope this place sticks around 1 
the puppets look really cheesy not in a good way like in the puppet master 80s flicks 0 
best headset ever 1 
i like steiners because its dark and it feels like a bar 1 
this frog phone charm is adorable and very eye catching 1 
nice ambiance 1 
if there is a wind it is completely useless 0 
waaaaaayyyyyyyyyy over rated is all i am saying 0 
a truly truly bad film 0 
this is high adventure at its best 1 
saw the movie today and thought it was a good effort good messages for kids 1 
the pizza tasted old super chewy in not a good way 0 
but this movie is definitely a below average rent 0 
i love this cable it allows me to connect any miniusb device to my pc 1 
i gave it 5 stars then and im giving it 5 stars now 1 
having to humour him just to get by and get through the day was so apt 1 
you share general loewenhielms exquisite joy in his partaking of the cailles en sarcophage even though you are just watching a movie but you do wish for just a small sample to savor 1 
so flavorful and has just the perfect amount of heat 1 
i know he was a contract player with little control over his scripts but the acting was as bad as the script 0 
id love to go back 1 
once you get inside youll be impressed with the place 1 
i could care less the interior is just beautiful 1 
after two i felt disgusting 0 
all of the main players are mesmerising 1 
best tacos in town by far 1 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
the management is rude 0 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
i bought this to use with my kindle fire and absolutely loved it 1 
this is a simple little phone to use but the breakage is unacceptible 0 
with great sound effects and impressive special effects i cant recommend this movie enough 1 
it had some average acting from the main person and it was a low budget as you clearly can see 0 
it features an outlandish array of memorable psychotic but lovable nuts 1 
i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
i just cant explain this movie more than romanticcharminghilariousand adorablethe junkyard scenes are funnyall the junkyard dogs have something specialtoo funny i laughedkids will love itbuy it when it comes outit has new features 1 
the chicken wings contained the driest chicken meat i have ever eaten 0 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
its an empty hollow shell of a movie 0 
plus its only 8 bucks 1 
i like the fact that it rests lightly against your ear rather than inside 1 
does not work 0 
any grandmother can make a roasted chicken better than this one 0 
on the ground right next to our table was a large smeared beensteppedinandtrackedeverywhere pile of green bird poop 0 
reasonably priced also 1 
i believe every one should see this movie as i think few people outside of south africa understand its past and what is being attempted in the truth and reconciliation process 1 
i will never forget it now 1 
great choice 1 
filmiing was less expansive 0 
my only problem is i thought the actor playing the villain was a low rent michael ironside 0 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
good works fine 1 
the budget was evidently very limited 0 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
and service was super friendly 1 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
you wont regret it 1 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
i was disgusted because i was pretty sure that was human hair 0 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
i guess i should have known that this place would suck because it is inside of the excalibur but i didnt use my common sense 0 
being a 90s child i truly enjoyed this show and i can proudly say that i enjoyed it big time and even more than the classical wb cartoons 1 
if it were possible to give them zero stars theyd have it 0 
i didnt realize how wonderful the short really is until the last two scenes 1 
im in az all the time and now have my new spot 1 
but she is still a bad actress repeating her robotic face moves in each of her pictures 0 
he deserves 5 stars 1 
essentially you can forget microsofts tech support 0 
there is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again 0 
it was a pale color instead of nice and char and has no flavor 0 
lange had become a great actress 1 
i think not again 0 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
fits comfortably came with three sizes of earbud tips 1 
as many people complained i found this headsets microphone was very weak 0 
the fact is this film is a wonderful heartwarming tale about two people chasing their dreams 1 
it felt too light and tinny 0 
the success of the film depends on the casting of sydney greenstreet as the alexander yardley character 1 
you truly take this journey through the eyes and soul of a child 1 
the volume switch rocketed out of the unit to a destination unknown 0 
the roast beef sandwich tasted really good 1 
in particular the relationship between the bakery assistant and the waitress just didnt work for me at all 0 
a piece of junk that broke after being on my phone for 2 days 0 
perfect for someone me who only likes beer ice cold or in this case even colder 1 
the han nan chicken was also very tasty 1 
my rating just 3 out of 10 0 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
it was way over fried 0 
the story which was told so eloquently by francis ford coppola 25 years earlier really unfolds gradually and leaves room for the characters to develop 1 
director paul matthews who also wrotedirected the weak 1995 monster movie grim clearly doesnt know how to pace his films 0 
and the accents are absolutely abysmal 0 
not recommended 0 
my boyfriend tried the mediterranean chicken salad and fell in love 1 
this place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver 0 
the aerial scenes were welldone 1 
you share general loewenhielms exquisite joy in his partaking of the cailles en sarcophage even though you are just watching a movie but you do wish for just a small sample to savor 1 
if you do go see this movie bring a pillow or a girlfriendboyfriend to keep you occupied through out 0 
1 hour 54 minutes of sheer tedium melodrama and horrible acting a mess of a script and a sinking feeling of good lord what were they thinking 0 
i was bored throughout the whole damn thing 0 
it just blew 0 
after two i felt disgusting 0 
the warmth it generates is in contrast to its austere backdrop 1 
i have to mention this and it is a huge spoiler i loved the ending how all the characters of the three films were the remaining survivors of the ferry disaster with valentine and the young judge together and the old man watching it on her tv solidifying his happiness over the suffering which he dealt with for those many years 1
