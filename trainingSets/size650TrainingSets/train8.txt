the best scene in the movie was when gerardo is trying to find a song that keeps running through his head 1 
there was so much hype over this phone that i assumed it was the best my mistake 0 
this is a stunning movie 1 
it is simple to use and i like it 1 
we got sitting fairly fast but ended up waiting 40 minutes just to place our order another 30 minutes before the food arrived 0 
the music in the film is really nice too 1 
this movie is possibly one of the most creative works of horror ever 1 
love this phone 1 
after arguing with verizon regarding the dropped calls we returned the phones after two days 0 
adapter does not provide enough charging current 0 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
definitely a bargain 1 
i like the fact that it rests lightly against your ear rather than inside 1 
this is one of peter watkins most accessible films 1 
for a product that costs as much as this one does i expect it to work far better and with greater ease than this thing does 0 
exactly what i wanted 1 
i received my orders well within the shipping timeframe everything was in good working order and overall i am very excited to have this source 1 
warning stay away 0 
great food and awesome service 1 
magical help 1 
the phone is sturdy and waterproof 1 
love it great armband 1 
this scene is very strong and unpleasant 0 
you also cannot take pictures with it in the case because the lense is covered 0 
i wont be back 0 
dont do it 0 
that being said for a phone the camera is very nice many cool effects to play with and video is decent as well 1 
youll love how thin it is 1 
comfortable in my hand 1 
unfortunately it was not good 0 
the only thing i wasnt too crazy about was their guacamole as i dont like it puréed 0 
their research and development division obviously knows what theyre doing 1 
the chains which im no fan of beat this place easily 0 
star trek v the final frontier is the worst in the series 0 
the first thing that happened was that the tracking was off 0 
very prompt service 1 
the macarons here are insanely good 1 
then i watched it again two sundays ago march 20th 2005 and i began to really enjoy it and this time i taped the entire thing 1 
by the time the film ended i not only disliked it i despised it 0 
this is an outstanding little restaurant with some of the best food i have ever tasted 1 
i rather enjoyed it 1 
awesome selection of beer 1 
highly recommended a 1 
we watched our waiter pay a lot more attention to other tables and ignore us 0 
as a courtroom drama its compelling as an indictment on the american justice system its frightening 1 
do not waste your time 0 
i would advise to not purchase this item it never worked very well 0 
all in all im quite satisfied with this purchase 1 
definitely worth checking out 1 
if you simply want a small flip phone look elsewhere as the extra bells whistles are mediocre 0 
absolutel junk 0 
there are many continuity errors one other user commented on different cars in the garage joes glassesthe one that got to me the most was the fact joes facial hair configuration seemed to change from scene to scene 0 
this scene is very strong and unpleasant 0 
the stories were as unbelievable as the actors 0 
not easy to watch 0 
con spotty service 0 
the steak was amazingrge fillet relleno was the best seafood plate i have ever had 1 
pretty piece of junk 0 
horrible horrible protector 0 
10 out of 10 for both the movie and trilogy 1 
oh the charger seems to work fine 1 
the fried rice was dry as well 0 
i received my supposedly new motorola 375 and apparently there was not a match between the phone and the charger 0 
not nearly as good looking as the amazon picture makes it look 0 
never again will i be dining at this place 0 
five star plus plus 1 
i especially liked the noncliche choices with the parents in other movies i could predict the dialog verbatim but the writing in this movie made better selections 1 
the owners are super friendly and the staff is courteous 1 
the roast beef sandwich tasted really good 1 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
i didnt want the clip going over the top of my ear causing discomfort 0 
so there is no way for me to plug it in here in the us unless i go by a converter 0 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
could not get strong enough signal 0 
worked perfectly 1 
nice headset priced right 1 
on the negative its insipid enough to cause regret for another 2 hours of life wasted in front of the screen 0 
but now that it is out of warranty the same problems reoccurebottom line put your money somewhere else cingular will not support it 0 
hands down my favorite italian restaurant 1 
i didnt know pulled pork could be soooo delicious 1 
nothing short of magnificent photographycinematography in this film 1 
battery is terrible 0 
this film offers many delights and surprises 1 
bt50 battery junk 0 
dont waste your time here 0 
this movie has a cutting edge to it 1 
the plot doesnt hang together at all and the acting is absolutely appalling 0 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
i go to far too many places and ive never seen any restaurant that serves a 1 egg breakfast especially for 400 0 
great hands free device 1 
sprint charges for this service 0 
the sound quality is good and functionality is awesome 1 
they were goldencrispy and delicious 1 
worst phone ever 0 
i use this product in a motor control center where there is a lot of high voltage humming from the equipment and it works great 1 
the plot well i said id let that one go 0 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
however bt headsets are currently not good for real time games like firstperson shooters since the audio delay messes me up 0 
it always cuts out and makes a beep beep beep sound then says signal failed 0 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
blue ant is easy to use 1 
restored my phone to like new performance 1 
i am so tired of clichés that is just lazy writing and here they come in thick and fast 0 
but this movie is definitely a below average rent 0 
also its slim enough to fit into my alarm clock docking station without removing the case 1 
i could barely stomach the meal but didnt complain because it was a business lunch 0 
the movie is terribly boring in places 0 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
the characters are interesting and you really care for them 1 
it was horrendous 0 
think of the film being like a dream 1 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
the music in the film is really nice too 1 
lately they have been extremely nice and helpful on the phone 1 
it is just the sort of pap that is screened in the afternoon to punish the unemployed for not having jobs 0 
hands down my favorite italian restaurant 1 
id advise anyone to go and see it 1 
what possesed me to get this junk i have no idea 0 
my fiancé and i came in the middle of the day and we were greeted and seated right away 1 
none of the three sizes they sent with the headset would stay in my ears 0 
today the graphics are crap 0 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
both films are terrible but to the credit of the 1986 version it was watchable 0 
however after finally watching this film i realized that not only had i had a closed mind to the brilliance it depicts i also found myself watching it over and over again 1 
phone now holds charge like it did when it was new 1 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
the acting sucked 0 
the cast was great 1 
hitchcock is a great director 1 
waaaaaayyyyyyyyyy over rated is all i am saying 0 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
i went to bachi burger on a friends recommendation and was not disappointed 1 
he was terrible 0 
lucy bell is so much higher than this crap and for her to sink this low is quite depressing 0 
and it was way to expensive 0 
crostini that came with the salad was stale 0 
the price was very good and with the free shipping and all it was a good purchase 1 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
i have had this phone for over a year now and i will tell you its not that great 0 
then the film just dropped the ball 0 
the service was a bit lacking 0 
the crêpe was delicate and thin and moist 1 
but when someone strives for greatness and poetry but delivers a muddled and often ridiculous story a bunch of disparate scenes pretentious dialogue then you get the worst kind of a movie that some other reviewer very accurately defined as pretentious crap 0 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
you can watch them preparing the delicious food 1 
leopard print is wonderfully wild 1 
which has more depth and character than the man underneath it 0 
much less than the jawbone i was going to replace it with 1 
ive had this for nearly 2 years and it has worked great for me 1 
comfort for our whole family 1 
del taco is pretty nasty and should be avoided if possible 0 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
motorola finally got the voice quality of a bluetooth headset right 1 
great case and price 1 
in fact its hard to remember that the part of ray charles is being acted and not played by the man himself 1 
the guys all had steaks and our steak loving son who has had steak at the best and worst places said it was the best steak hes ever eaten 1 
i saw it as a child on tv back in 1973 when it was the stranger and i loved it 1 
lovely little thriller from hitchcock with lots of nice shenanigans surrounding a murdered spy a kidnapped child a nasty church a foreign plot and some random taxidermists 1 
we had 7 at our table and the service was pretty fast 1 
battery is holding up well 1 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
avoid at all cost 0 
it is light easy to use and has very clear reception and transmission 1 
and those baby owls were adorable 1 
it only recognizes the phone as its storage device 0 
great price also 1 
i will come back here every time im in vegas 1 
will definitely be back 1 
lots of holes in the script 0 
the only very disappointing thing was there was no speakerphone 0 
overall the film is interesting and thoughtprovoking 1 
the good cinematography also makes her and monica bellucci look very beautiful 1 
the ri style calamari was a joke 0 
i even fully charged it before i went to bed and turned off blue tooth and wifi and noticed that it only had 20 left in the morning 0 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
lordy the khao soi is a dish that is not to be missed for curry lovers 1 
ive missed numerous calls because of this reason 0 
the jerky camera movements were also annoying 0 
the things that the four kids get themselves into is absolutely hilarious to watch 1 
really good product 1 
the waitresses are very friendly 1 
and there wasnt a single sour note struck actingwise either some surprisingly solid casting here 1 
i mean this in a terrible way 0 
the jalapeno bacon is soooo good 1 
not much seafood and like 5 strings of pasta at the bottom 0 
the film gives meaning to the phrase never in the history of human conflict has so much been owed by so many to so few 1 
personally i think it shows that people should learn to find a compromise them self without involving other people into issue 1 
i received my supposedly new motorola 375 and apparently there was not a match between the phone and the charger 0 
very easy to use 1 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
i was disgusted because i was pretty sure that was human hair 0 
i especially liked the noncliche choices with the parents in other movies i could predict the dialog verbatim but the writing in this movie made better selections 1 
also the area where my unit broke im not too fond of the magnetic strap 0 
horrible 0 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
i received my supposedly new motorola 375 and apparently there was not a match between the phone and the charger 0 
i paid too much 0 
the lead man is charismafree 0 
great product and price 1 
everything was gross 0 
great bluetooth 1 
its a gloriously fun fast paced and fairly accurate portrayal of the night of a raver 1 
very well made and fits my surefire gx2 perfectly 1 
perhaps i caught them on an off night judging by the other reviews but im not inspired to go back 0 
food quality has been horrible 0 
how can you call yourself a steakhouse if you cant properly cook a steak i dont understand 0 
disappointed 0 
bacon is hella salty 1 
good service very clean and inexpensive to boot 1 
elias koteasjack palance play good roles angelina is hot and gets nakedbilly drago appears in this and is cool as usual a cameo by sven ole thorsen helps make this a very enjoyable movie with good acting and a decent budget 1 
service stinks here 0 
this phone works great 1 
phone is sturdy as all nokia bar phones are 1 
what makes this story different are the terrific production values faultless photography composition and editing the terrific casting the underappreciated brian keith playing a bully teddy and vivid history 1 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
theres barely a boring moment in the film and there are plenty of humorous parts 1 
took an hour to get our food only 4 tables in restaurant my food was luke warm our sever was running around like he was totally overwhelmed 0 
today was my first taste of a buldogis gourmet hot dog and i have to tell you it was more than i ever thought possible 1 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
great food and awesome service 1 
youll love it 1 
jawbone era is awesome too 1 
i found this move beautiful enjoyable and uplifting 1 
i got this phone on reccomendation from a relative and im glad i did 1 
youll love it 1 
i have read others reviews here but i havent had any problem with it 1 
you wont forget this movie 1 
with great sound effects and impressive special effects i cant recommend this movie enough 1 
the service was not up to par either 0 
the ri style calamari was a joke 0 
the range is very decent ive been able to roam around my house with the phone in the living room with no receptionsound quality issues 1 
our server was super nice and checked on us many times 1 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
as always the evening was wonderful and the food delicious 1 
this really is how vegas fine dining used to be right down to the menus handed to the ladies that have no prices listed 1 
the cashier was friendly and even brought the food out to me 1 
the service was poor and thats being nice 0 
i think that it is a must see older john wayne film 1 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
the pleather case doesnt fit 0 
looks great and is strong 1 
characters are onedimensional even the good guys and especially the bad guys 0 
definitely worth seeing its the sort of thought provoking film that forces you to question your own threshold of loneliness 1 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
very bad performance plays angela bennett a computer expert who is at home all the time 0 
of course the footage from the 70s was grainy but that only enhanced the film 1 
the only thing really worth watching was the scenery and the house because it is beautiful 1 
if you are reading this please dont go there 0 
nice docking station for home or work 1 
what the hell kind of crap is that 0 
yes its that bad 0 
this is an extraordinary film 1 
works great when my cat attacked the phone he scratched the protective strip instead of destroying the screen 1 
waitress was good though 1 
that movie was bad 0 
doesnt do the job 0 
the burger i got the gold standard a 17 burger and was kind of disappointed 0 
highly recommended 1 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
awesome service and food 1 
the concert sequences just sucked 0 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
all the characters in this film are tremendously well played 1 
the scenes are often funny and occasionally touching as the characters evaluate their lives and where they are going 1 
if she had not rolled the eyes we may have stayed not sure if we will go back and try it again 0 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
it has a great camera thats 2mp and the pics are nice and clear with great picture quality 1 
what possesed me to get this junk i have no idea 0 
the dialogue sucked 0 
kieslowski never ceases to amaze me 1 
used and dirty 0 
it is shameful 0 
im super pissd 0 
this place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver 0 
the songs were the best and the muppets were so hilarious 1 
tom wilkinson broke my heart at the end and everyone elses judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike 1 
the nano stated itmy son was dissapointed 0 
my husband said she was very rude did not even apologize for the bad food or anything 0 
then as if i hadnt wasted enough of my life there they poured salt in the wound by drawing out the time it took to bring the check 0 
lately they have been extremely nice and helpful on the phone 1 
the crêpe was delicate and thin and moist 1 
you get extra minutes so that you can carry out the call and not get cut off 1 
and there wasnt a single sour note struck actingwise either some surprisingly solid casting here 1 
a lot of websites have been rating this a very good phone and so do i 1 
this is a bad film with bad writing and good actorsan ugly cartoon crafted by paul haggis for people who cant handle anything but the bold strokes in storytellinga picture painted with crayons 0 
110 and only because there is no setting for 010 0 
the foreigner is not worth one second of your time 0 
i immediately said i wanted to talk to the manager but i did not want to talk to the guy who was doing shots of fireball behind the bar 0 
as a sushi lover avoid this place by all means 0 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
50 down the drain 0 
i received it quickly and it works great 1 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
the only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port irda 0 
great product fast shipping 1 
gets the job done 1 
an hour and a half i wish i could bring back 0 
i have always used corded headsets and the freedom from the wireless is very helpful 1 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
wow very spicy but delicious 1 
the story starts too fast with absolutely no suspense or buildup in the slightest 0 
its not user friendly 0 
totally different with loads of understatement and black comedy this is a film few get to see but those who do will remember it 1 
ample portions and good prices 1 
hitchcock is a great director 1 
no one at the table thought the food was above average or worth the wait that we had for it 0 
im glad the film didnt go for the most obvious choice as a lesser film certainly would have 1 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
the jerky camera movements were also annoying 0 
on the up side their cafe serves really good food 1 
the scenes are often funny and occasionally touching as the characters evaluate their lives and where they are going 1 
be sure to order dessert even if you need to pack it togo the tiramisu and cannoli are both to die for 1 
however my girl was complain that some time the phone doesnt wake up like normal phone does 0 
i bought this battery with a coupon from amazon and im very happy with my purchase 1 
it will drive you barking mad 0 
the buffet at bellagio was far from what i anticipated 0 
this is probably one of the least effective and utterly unoriginal films i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
i can assure you that you wont be disappointed 1 
crisp and clear 1 
but the service was beyond bad 0 
the writer gorman bechard undoubtedly did his homework because all references are industry and characterage appropriate 1 
hard to judge whether these sides were good because we were grossed out by the melted styrofoam and didnt want to eat it for fear of getting sick 0 
it was quite comfortable in the ear 1 
really pleased with this product so far 1 
arrived quickly and much less expensive than others being sold 1 
this early film from future goremeister lucio fulci is a very good addition to the giallo subgenre 1 
i go to far too many places and ive never seen any restaurant that serves a 1 egg breakfast especially for 400 0 
we are sending it back 0 
we have tried 2 units and they both failed within 2 months pros 0 
essentially you can forget microsofts tech support 0 
for a self proclaimed coffee cafe i was wildly disappointed 0 
every thing on phone work perfectly she like it 1 
the food was barely lukewarm so it must have been sitting waiting for the server to bring it out to us 0 
a good film by a great director 1 
it has everything i need and i couldnt ask for more 1 
the staff is friendly and the joint is always clean 1 
the 12 mega pixel camera being a part of a phone is reasonably good7 1 
this is by far the worst purchase ive made on amazon 0 
voice quality signal strength dropped calls 0 
if you check the directors filmography on this site you will see why this film didnt have a chance 0 
i keep watching it over and over 1 
excellent starter wireless headset 0 
everything about this film is simply incredible 1 
food was really boring 0 
i like the fact that it rests lightly against your ear rather than inside 1 
everything was fresh and delicious 1 
i think the most wonderful parts literally full of wonder are the excerpts from his works 1 
the attention given to every character and complex psychological portrayals detailing loyalty treachery love and hope are tremendous 1 
this mostly routine factbased tv drama gets a boost from the fine performance by cole 1 
disappointing accessory from a good manufacturer 0 
so bad 0 
all in all an excellent restaurant highlighted by great service a unique menu and a beautiful setting 1 
first of all there are enough racial stereotypes and racial jokes to offend everyone 0 
i think i was one of the people who found this another one of roths pearls 1 
which are small and not worth the price 0 
very satisifed with that 1 
lucy bell is so much higher than this crap and for her to sink this low is quite depressing 0 
if you are razr owneryou must have this 1 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
the use of slowmotion needlessly repeats itself throughout the movie but is well backed up by bad acting and bad is a kind word here no continuity scenes that are thrown in for no reason whatsoever vehicles that looked like they were made from a corn flakes box and a directorial style that bordered on stupidity 0 
judith light is one of my favorite actresses and i think she does a superb job in this film 1 
this movie was kind of long in length but i enjoyed every minute of it 1 
his performance as awarded was stunning 1 
nice ambiance 1 
we arent ones to make a scene at restaurants but i just dont get itdefinitely lost the love after this one 0 
this is a disgrace 0 
i dont think ill be running back to carlys anytime soon for food 0 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
the live music on fridays totally blows 0 
the entire audience applauded at the conclusion of the film 1 
really pleased with this product so far 1 
i received my supposedly new motorola 375 and apparently there was not a match between the phone and the charger 0 
wasted two hours 0 
the fact is this film is a wonderful heartwarming tale about two people chasing their dreams 1 
i highly recommend these and encourage people to give them a try 1 
i gave it 5 stars then and im giving it 5 stars now 1 
the mic there is a joke and the volume is quite low 0 
also the phone doesnt seem to accept anything except cbr mp3s preferably ripped by windows media player 0 
also makes it easier to hold on to 1 
some highlights great quality nigiri here 1 
we also ordered the spinach and avocado salad the ingredients were sad and the dressing literally had zero taste 0 
the building itself seems pretty neat the bathroom is pretty trippy but i wouldnt eat here again 0 
so for our enjoyment we get to see them run around play games and be dangerous 1 
this movie contained an allstar cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i havent seen before 1 
comfortable fit you need your headset to be comfortable for at least an hour at a time if not for an entire day 1 
plug was the wrong size 0 
excellent dualpurpose headset 1 
love this headset 1 
one character is totally annoying with a voice that gives me the feeling of fingernails on a chalkboard 0 
bad fit way too big 0 
cant store anything but phone numbers to sim 0 
great time family dinner on a sunday night 1 
unreliable im giving up 0 
it definitely was not as good as my s11 1 
didnt laugh or even smile once 0 
i purchased this and within 2 days it was no longer working 0 
honeslty it didnt taste that fresh 0 
this is an extraordinary film 1 
does not work for listening to music with the cingular 8125 0 
theres barely a boring moment in the film and there are plenty of humorous parts 1 
the acting was bad 0 
this place is disgusting 0 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
the bt headset was such a disapoinment 0 
having to humour him just to get by and get through the day was so apt 1 
the selection of food was not the best 0 
camerawork again bad 0 
this case seems well made 1 
item does not match picture 0 
i do not know if this was emilio estevezs directorial debut but the pacing the interplay and development of the characters as well as some clever camera work surrounding the character estevez plays all suggest a natural eye 1 
the wind and the lion is well written and superbly acted 1 
the price was very good and with the free shipping and all it was a good purchase 1 
not good by any stretch of the imagination 0 
horrible dont waste your time and money 0 
the greek dressing was very creamy and flavorful 1 
her lines seem to have been written by a fifteen year old though they are trying oh so so hard to sound like how a fifteen year old would really um you know well talk 0 
the price is reasonable and the service is great 1 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
the battery is completely useless to me 0 
i contacted the company and they told me that although the unit was still under warranty if i couldnt produce my receipt i was out of luck 0 
sending it back 0 
im super pissd 0 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
when i placed my treo into the case not only was it not snug but there was a lot of extra room on the sides 0 
love this place hits the spot when i want something healthy but not lacking in quantity or flavor 1 
this place is great 1 
a great film by a great director 1 
also its slim enough to fit into my alarm clock docking station without removing the case 1 
it had some average acting from the main person and it was a low budget as you clearly can see 0 
the jerky camera movements were also annoying 0 
this place receives stars for their appetizers 1 
the food was terrible 0 
the entire audience applauded at the conclusion of the film 1 
just really good so far probably the best bt headset i have ever had 1 
if this premise sound stupid thats because it is 0 
his performance is simply genius 1 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
the awful dialogue and hopeless overacting by everyone who gets shot top off a real waste of space and time 0 
it was so boring 0 
food arrived quickly 1 
dont do it 0 
bland not a liking this place for a number of reasons and i dont want to waste time on bad reviewing ill leave it at that 0 
the scenes with the ohsomature neighbourgirl are a misplace 0 
food was good service was good prices were good 1 
its a case of so bad it is laughable 0 
stopped by during the late may bank holiday off rick steve recommendation and loved it 1 
this review is long overdue since i consider a tale of two sisters to be the single greatest film ever made 1 
he was very impressed when going from the original battery to the extended battery 1 
will be back again 1 
i wont be back 0 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
sauce was tasteless 0 
this is one of peter watkins most accessible films 1 
i could not recommend these more 0 
food arrived quickly 1 
even worse than ticker 0 
unreliable im giving up 0 
this is essentially a communications tool that does not communicate 0 
lame would be the best way to describe it 0 
an interesting premise and billy drago is always good as a dangerous nutbag side note id love to see drago stephen mchattie and lance hendrikson in a flick together talk about raging cheekbones 1 
my headset works just peachykeen 1 
this particular model would not work with my motorola q smartphone 0 
i never come again 0 
after 3 months screen just went black all of a sudden 0 
i love all the features and form factor 1 
the structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema 1 
then a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use 0 
the last 15 minutes of movie are also not bad as well 1 
waitress was sweet and funny 1 
i did not have any problem with this item and would order it again if needed 1 
my girlfriends veal was very bad 0 
that was done in the second movie 0 
the acting was bad 0 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
i received my headset in good time and was happy with it 1 
ambience is perfect 1 
the cashier was friendly and even brought the food out to me 1 
shes poised and amazing 1 
once your food arrives its meh 0 
i have 23 bars on my cell phone when i am home but you cant not hear anything 0 
walked in and the place smelled like an old grease trap and only 2 others there eating 0 
this place lacked style 0 
i own a jabra earset and was very happy with it but the sound quality especially outgoing on this is better 1 
how awful she is 0 
but even the talented carrell cant save this 0 
the food was terrible 0 
amazon sucks 0 
there are the usual hitchcock logic flaws 0 
i dont each much pasta but i love the homemade hand made pastas and thin pizzas here 1 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
the battery runs down quickly 0 
why are these sad little vegetables so overcooked 0 
ill give this film 10 out of 10 1 
thus far have only visited twice and the food was absolutely delicious each time 1 
disappointed 0 
i mean in a realistic world she would never have gotten into that ballet repertory the whole thing was quite pathetic 0 
its not what it says it is 0 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
horrible phone 0 
his losing his marbles so early in the proceedings is totally implausible and unconvincing 0 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
treo and tmobile refused to replace it again and forced me to buy another phone without any kind of upgrade discount 0 
but if you liked movies like the matrix and better yet their sequels i think youll appreciate the thought provoking mindblowing experience this film will give you 1 
and if that isnt enough of a mess of a movie for you the picture is also marred with a constant use of studio sets and indoor exteriors 0 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
this place is like chipotle but better 1 
all in all im quite satisfied with this purchase 1 
this place is awesome if you want something light and healthy during the summer 1 
what a piece of junk i lose more calls on this phone 0 
the cow tongue and cheek tacos are amazing 1 
save your money ive had this item for 11 months now 0 
this is an excellent film 1 
i ate there twice on my last visit and especially enjoyed the salmon salad 1 
everyone is very attentive providing excellent customer service 1 
lifetime does not air it enough so if anyone knows what store sells it let me know because this is a musthave 1 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
sauce was tasteless 0 
the vegetables are so fresh and the sauce feels like authentic thai 1 
im glad i found this product on amazon it is hard to find it wasnt high priced 1 
thanks again to amazon for having the things i need for a good price 1 
mediocre food 0 
voice recognition is tremendous 1 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
the problem i have is that they charge 1199 for a sandwich that is no bigger than a subway sub which offers better and more amount of vegetables 0 
linksys should have some way to exchange a bad phone for a refurb unit or something 0 
at any rate this film stinks its not funny and fulci should have stayed with giallo and supernatural zombie movies 0 
poor product 0 
it was a riot to see hugo weaving play a sexobsessed gay real estate salesman who uses his clients houses for his trysts with the flaming darren tom hollander 1 
the burger i got the gold standard a 17 burger and was kind of disappointed 0 
it was a riot to see hugo weaving play a sexobsessed gay real estate salesman who uses his clients houses for his trysts with the flaming darren tom hollander 1 
overall a great experience 1 
but i definitely would not eat here again 0 
definitely a turn off for me i doubt ill be back unless someone else is buying 0 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
great food and awesome service 1 
returned 8 hours later 0 
my mother and brother had to do thiswhen i saw robert ryan portraying this type of man it was a very good imitation of this type of individual and i was impressed 1 
so there is no way for me to plug it in here in the us unless i go by a converter 0 
great phone 1 
same evening him and i are both drastically sick 0 
its kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly its embarrassing how childlike the company is 0 
ive seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie 0 
i love their fries and their beans 1 
there still are good actors around 1 
highly recommended a 1 
highly unprofessional and rude to a loyal patron 0 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
ambience is perfect 1 
i really do recommend this place you can go wrong with this donut place 1 
totally different with loads of understatement and black comedy this is a film few get to see but those who do will remember it 1 
the selection on the menu was great and so were the prices 1 
the real disappointment was our waiter 0 
also makes it easier to hold on to 1 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
the movie has almost no action scenes in it and very little comedy 0 
battery has no life 0 
by the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant i was bored and didnt care what happened next and so i switched off 0 
i was so insulted 0 
we ordered the duck rare and it was pink and tender on the inside with a nice char on the outside 1 
it was packed 0 
best tater tots in the southwest 1 
also were served hot bread and butter and home made potato chips with bacon bits on topvery original and very good 1 
this movie is greatespecially if you enjoy visual arts 1 
i guess i liked the details of his dysfunctionhe was believable 1 
nothing at all to recommend 0 
his losing his marbles so early in the proceedings is totally implausible and unconvincing 0 
very windresistant 1 
i tried the cape cod ravoli chickenwith cranberrymmmm 1 
and his subtle connections between the three films are awesome 1 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
the cast is always entertaining as usual 1 
the steak was amazingrge fillet relleno was the best seafood plate i have ever had 1 
it is an hour and half waste of time following a bunch of very pretty high schoolers whine and cry about life 0 
really ugly 0 
the restaurant is very clean and has a family restaurant feel to it 1 
we ordered the duck rare and it was pink and tender on the inside with a nice char on the outside 1 
i wasnt expecting oscar material but this 0 
best ive found so far ive tried 2 other bluetooths and this one has the best quality for both me and the listener as well as ease of using 1 
service is perfect and the family atmosphere is nice to see 1 
well just if you keep thinking how bad it is 0 
the best place to go for a tasty bowl of pho 1 
what did bother me was the slow service 0 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
it dit not work most of the time with my nokia 5320 0 
i know this is not like the other restaurants at all something is very off here 0 
their frozen margaritas are way too sugary for my taste 0 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
everything about this movie is stupid 0 
youd have to have the iq of particularly stupid mollusk not to see that one coming 0 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
every thing on phone work perfectly she like it 1 
also if your phone is dropped this case is not going to save it specially when dropped face down 0 
things that went wrong they burned the saganaki 0 
probably not in a hurry to go back 0 
i bought this phone as a replacement for my startac and have regretted it since 0 
i have two more years left in this contract and i hate this phone 0 
unreliable im giving up 0 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
there is simply no excuse for something this poorly done 0 
what a waste of time 0 
so badwellits just bad 0 
avoid at all cost 0 
works great 1 
she carries the movie well 1 
like the other reviewer said you couldnt pay me to eat at this place again 0 
the film has great actors a master director a significant themeat least a wouldbe significant theme undertone of fifties existential worldweariness aerial scenes that ought to have thrilled both senses and imagination and characters about which one might deeply care 1 
id love to go back 1 
food was good service was good prices were good 1 
their menu is diverse and reasonably priced 1 
perhaps my phone is defective but people cannot hear me when i use this 0 
all the bread is made inhouse 1 
after watching this film i wanted to learn more about the works of this artist 1 
i saw mirrormask last night and it was an unsatisfactory experience 0 
it was so bad i had lost the heart to finish it 0 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
the sound quality is good and functionality is awesome 1 
this allows the possibility of double booking for the same date and time after the first 0 
anyways the food was definitely not filling at all and for the price you pay you should expect more 0 
the very idea of it was lame take a minor character from a mediocre pg13 film and make a complete nonsequel while changing its tone to a pgrated family movie 0 
i find wasting food to be despicable but this just wasnt food 0 
totally different with loads of understatement and black comedy this is a film few get to see but those who do will remember it 1 
the food wasnt good 0 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
at first glance it is a lovely bakery cafe nice ambiance clean friendly staff 1 
the story which was told so eloquently by francis ford coppola 25 years earlier really unfolds gradually and leaves room for the characters to develop 1 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
what possesed me to get this junk i have no idea 0 
you get extra minutes so that you can carry out the call and not get cut off 1 
everything about this movie is stupid 0 
it was an inexpensive piece but i would still have expected better quality 0 
the movie had you on the edge of your seat and made you somewhat afraid to go to your car at the end of the night 1 
the decor is nice and the piano music soundtrack is pleasant 1 
then as if i hadnt wasted enough of my life there they poured salt in the wound by drawing out the time it took to bring the check 0 
ill definitely be in soon again 1 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
i find wasting food to be despicable but this just wasnt food 0 
about ten minutes into this film i started having second thoughts 0 
this movie now joins revenge of the boogeyman and zombiez as part of the hellish trinity of horror films 0 
works good 1 
wed definitely go back here again 1 
highly recommended a 1 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
it also took her forever to bring us the check when we asked for it 0 
their research and development division obviously knows what theyre doing 1 
the characters are interesting even if a bit predictable 1
