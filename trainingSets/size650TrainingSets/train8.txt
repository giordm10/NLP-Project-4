very nice and relaxing late night viewing 1 
appears to actually outperform the original battery from china that came with my v325i 1 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
poor quality 0 
not recommended 0 
what the hell kind of crap is that 0 
her role was played well 1 
thank you for wasting my money 0 
for 40 bucks a head i really expect better food 0 
the cashier was friendly and even brought the food out to me 1 
the desserts were a bit strange 0 
its fits like a glove and is strong secure and durable 1 
i checked everywhere and there is no feature for it which is really disappointing 0 
comes with a strong light that you can use to light up your camera shots and even flash sos signals seriously 1 
highly entertaining at all angles 1 
other than that the leather is nice and soft the fit is very tight the cut out for the face is a good shape 1 
the football scenes at the end were perplexing 0 
battery is holding up well 1 
excellent service 1 
seriously flavorful delights folks 1 
the only good thing was that it fits comfortably on small ears 1 
they do not care about the consumer one bit 0 
this place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver 0 
fast service 1 
i dont think well be going back anytime soon 0 
dont buy this product 0 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
it was a huge awkward 15lb piece of cow that was 34ths gristle and fat 0 
i must say i have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again 1 
im happy about this purchase good quality and low price 1 
reaching for the bottom row is uncomfortable and the send and end keys are not where i expect them to be3 0 
your servers suck wait correction our server heimer sucked 0 
do not buy for d807wrongly advertised for d807 0 
as an earlier review noted plug in this charger and nothing happens 0 
this was a poor remake of my best friends wedding 0 
this gets a 1 out of 10 simply because theres nothing lower 0 
it always cuts out and makes a beep beep beep sound then says signal failed 0 
i also decided not to send it back because our waitress looked like she was on the verge of having a heart attack 0 
what this film lacks is a convincing script 0 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
the phone crashed completely and now i have to get it replaced 0 
the chicken i got was definitely reheated and was only ok the wedges were cold and soggy 0 
any grandmother can make a roasted chicken better than this one 0 
im super pissd 0 
the buttons for on and off are bad 0 
due to this happening on every call i was forced to stop using this headset 0 
at a time when it seems that film animation has been dominated by disneypixars cgi masterpieces it is both refreshing and comforting to know that miyazaki is still relying on traditional handdrawn animation to tell his charming and enchanting stories 1 
i guess that nobody at the network that aired this dribble watched it before putting it on 0 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
all in all i think it was a good investment 1 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
great service and food 1 
your staff spends more time talking to themselves than me 0 
this is probably one of the least effective and utterly unoriginal films i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
very good product well made 1 
seriously killer hot chai latte 1 
they have been around for years and carries the highest quality of antiglare screen protector that i have found to date 1 
however bt headsets are currently not good for real time games like firstperson shooters since the audio delay messes me up 0 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
not my thing 0 
the block was amazing 1 
being a 90s child i truly enjoyed this show and i can proudly say that i enjoyed it big time and even more than the classical wb cartoons 1 
i purcashed this for the car charger and it does not work 0 
if you want a real scare rent this one 1 
the battery is working well as a replacement for the original that came with the phone over 2 years ago 1 
the directing and the cinematography arent quite as good 0 
same problem as others have mentioned 0 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
lastly the mozzarella sticks they were the best thing we ordered 1 
i checked everywhere and there is no feature for it which is really disappointing 0 
do not waste your time 0 
i own 2 of these cases and would order another 1 
i have recommended it to friends 1 
a week later after i activated it it suddenly died 0 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
i highly recommend this movie for anyone interested in art poetry theater politics or japanese history 1 
the cinematography is simply stunning to say the least and the fx are nothing if not stateoftheart 1 
great choice 1 
the good cinematography also makes her and monica bellucci look very beautiful 1 
never going back 0 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
i cannot believe that the actors agreed to do this film 0 
the lines the cuts the audio everything is wrong 0 
what a piece of junk i lose more calls on this phone 0 
very disappointed 0 
its so bad its actually worth seeing just for that reason 0 
unfortunately it was not good 0 
highly entertaining at all angles 1 
its fits like a glove and is strong secure and durable 1 
sooooo good 1 
absolutel junk 0 
but its just not funny 0 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
it was delicious 1 
its a campy sort of film thats a joy to watch 1 
all in all i think it was a good investment 1 
worked very well paired with a treo 700w and as a skype headset on my pc using a usb bluetooth transceiver 1 
so badwellits just bad 0 
by the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant i was bored and didnt care what happened next and so i switched off 0 
i was so insulted 0 
an italian reviewer called this a small great film and thats right 1 
i have bought this nokia cell phone a few weeks ago and it was a nightmare 0 
i am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this 1 
great phone 1 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
putting the race card aside lets look at the major flaw in the film they destroy latifas character 0 
as an earlier review noted plug in this charger and nothing happens 0 
i dont think ive ever gone to a movie and disliked it as much 0 
i wear glasses and it fits fine with them 1 
it was awesome 1 
my side greek salad with the greek dressing was so tasty and the pita and hummus was very refreshing 1 
and i just love the colors 1 
however paul schrader has indeed made a film about mishima that is both superb complex 1 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
the waitress was friendly and happy to accomodate for veganveggie options 1 
very satisifed with that 1 
check it out 1 
this pda rocks 1 
dont buy this product 0 
last time buying from you 0 
the food came out at a good pace 1 
gave up trying to eat any of the crust teeth still sore 0 
it was just too horrible 0 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
bought mainly for the charger which broke soon after purchasing 0 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
id rather eat airline food seriously 0 
the live music on fridays totally blows 0 
this phone is slim and light and the display is beautiful 1 
if you love authentic mexican food and want a whole bunch of interesting yet delicious meats to choose from you need to try this place 1 
my headset works just peachykeen 1 
i paid the bill but did not tip because i felt the server did a terrible job 0 
the only consistent thread holding the series together were the amazing performances of leni parker and anita laselva as the two taelons in quiet idealogical conflict 0 
but the convoluted plot just didnt convince me and much of the film was watched with a weird questioning glance 0 
good audio quality 1 
this pda rocks 1 
thanks again to amazon for having the things i need for a good price 1 
its a case of so bad it is laughable 0 
terrible my car will not accept this cassette 0 
a must study for anyone interested in the worst sins of industrial design 0 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
when my mom and i got home she immediately got sick and she only had a few bites of salad 0 
its just painful 0 
my boyfriend and i sat at the bar and had a completely delightful experience 1 
i bought two of them and neither will charge 0 
all i have to say is the food was amazing 1 
its very slow 0 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
the story is beyond stupid 0 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
plug was the wrong size 0 
it holds a charge for a long time is reasonably comfortable under longwearing conditions and the quality of sound is tremendous 1 
i could care less the interior is just beautiful 1 
the refried beans that came with my meal were dried out and crusty and the food was bland 0 
so i basically threw my money out the window for nothing 0 
this is a chilly unremarkable movie about an author livingworking in a chilly abstruse culture 0 
the malta settings are as dry and as barren as the dialogue 0 
i would have casted her in that role after ready the script 1 
i would advise to not purchase this item it never worked very well 0 
the worst one of the series 0 
disappointed 0 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
this was like the final blow 0 
seller shipped quickly and much cheaper than the competitors 1 
the only good thing was that it fits comfortably on small ears 1 
for the price on amazon it is an excellent product which i would highly recommend 1 
i advise everyone do not be fooled 0 
worst phone ever 0 
ive had no trouble accessing the internet downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions 1 
it was a riot to see hugo weaving play a sexobsessed gay real estate salesman who uses his clients houses for his trysts with the flaming darren tom hollander 1 
this was one of the worst films i have ever seen 0 
lame would be the best way to describe it 0 
it has northern humour and positive about the community it represents 1 
eew this location needs a complete overhaul 0 
the chefs were friendly and did a good job 1 
only had this a month but its worked flawlessly so far 1 
the cg opening sequence in space looked like it could have been created on microsoft slideshow for gods sake 0 
the concert sequences just sucked 0 
this case seems well made 1 
when my mom and i got home she immediately got sick and she only had a few bites of salad 0 
service is also cute 1 
also the story and acting were weak 0 
couldnt use the unit with sunglasses not good in texas 0 
the phone takes forever to charge like 2 to 5 hours literally 0 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
omg i felt like i had never eaten thai food until this dish 1 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
we recently witnessed her poor quality of management towards other guests as well 0 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
poor quality and service 0 
otherwise dont even waste your time on this 0 
in fact this stinker smells like a directtovideo release 0 
the script is horrendously stupid 0 
reception is terrible and full of static 0 
fans of the genre will be in heaven 1 
great product and price 1 
i liked this movie way too much 1 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
an hour and a half i wish i could bring back 0 
it is the best charger i have seen on the market yet 1 
the chicken i got was definitely reheated and was only ok the wedges were cold and soggy 0 
i know this is not like the other restaurants at all something is very off here 0 
go watch it 1 
what a mistake that was 0 
we literally sat there for 20 minutes with no one asking to take our order 0 
both do good jobs and are quite amusing 1 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
the chips and sals a here is amazing 1 
i really hope the team behind this movie makes more movies and that they will continue to do so in their own some kinda weird style 1 
very cheap plastic creaks like an old wooden floor 0 
disappointed 0 
at no point in the proceedings does it look remotely like america 0 
schrader has made a resume full of lousy amateurish films 0 
their research and development division obviously knows what theyre doing 1 
do not buy for d807wrongly advertised for d807 0 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
hayao miyazakis latest and eighth film for studio ghibili gake no ue no ponyo ponyo on the cliff by the sea is a wonderfully fun and imaginative look at childhood 1 
but it does get better reception and clarity than any phone ive had before 1 
the service was a bit lacking 0 
ordered an appetizer and took 40 minutes and then the pizza another 10 minutes 0 
nothing special 0 
brilliant 1 
so good i am going to have to review this place twice once hereas a tribute to the place and once as a tribute to an event held here last night 1 
rating 010 grade z note the show is so bad that even mother of the cast pull her daughter out of the show 0 
lame would be the best way to describe it 0 
for that its worth checking out 1 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
i think not again 0 
i hate those things as much as cheap quality black olives 0 
have been going since 2007 and every meal has been awesome 1 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
it is unusable in a moving car at freeway speed 0 
the fries were great too 1 
makes it easier to keep up with my bluetooth when im not wearing it 0 
by the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant i was bored and didnt care what happened next and so i switched off 0 
do not buy for d807wrongly advertised for d807 0 
the only very disappointing thing was there was no speakerphone 0 
we wont be returning 0 
the story itself is just predictable and lazy 0 
dont buy this product it fails 0 
i literally vomited while watching this film 0 
the manager was the worst 0 
mobile phone tools are a must have 1 
definitely worth seeing its the sort of thought provoking film that forces you to question your own threshold of loneliness 1 
comfortable in my hand 1 
i hate movies like that 0 
also the phone doesnt seem to accept anything except cbr mp3s preferably ripped by windows media player 0 
youll love it 1 
the poor actors 0 
the black eyed peas and sweet potatoes unreal 1 
not recommended 0 
i would advise to not purchase this item it never worked very well 0 
i guess maybe we went on an off night but it was disgraceful 0 
these were so good we ordered them twice 1 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
this place deserves one star and 90 has to do with the food 0 
well packaged arrived on time and works as intended 1 
exceptionally bad 0 
i might have gotten a defect but i would not risk buying it again because of the built quality alone 0 
it is wonderful and inspiring to watch and i hope that it gets released again on to video or dvd 1 
you get what you pay for i guess 0 
youll love how thin it is 1 
great charger 1 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
was not happy 0 
the staff are also very friendly and efficient 1 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
i was totally fascinated by the music the dancing everything 1 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
loved itfriendly servers great food wonderful and imaginative menu 1 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
the movie is full of wonderful dancing hence the title 1 
this does not fit the palm tungsten e2 and it broke the first time i tried to plug it in 0 
do not purchase this phone 0 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
im still trying to get over how bad it was 0 
the film is way too long 0 
however after finally watching this film i realized that not only had i had a closed mind to the brilliance it depicts i also found myself watching it over and over again 1 
buyerbe very careful 0 
their onscreen chemistry critical to the entire film is genuine 1 
best fish ive ever had in my life 1 
i love this phone it is very handy and has a lot of features 1 
otherwise dont even waste your time on this 0 
he owns the film just as spacek owned coal miners daughter and quaid owned great balls of fire 1 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
it was pretty gross 0 
another note about this phones appearance is that it really looks rather bland especially in the all black model 0 
while you dont yet hear mickey speak there are tons of sound effects and music throughout the filmsomething we take for granted now but which was a huge crowd pleaser in 1928 1 
i dont have very many words to say about this place but it does everything pretty well 1 
they were excellent 1 
however bt headsets are currently not good for real time games like firstperson shooters since the audio delay messes me up 0 
the worst phone from samsungcrap this crappy samsung e715 is the worst i have ever seeen 0 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
if you are razr owneryou must have this 1 
what i really like there is the crepe station 1 
dont waste your money and time 0 
at first glance it is a lovely bakery cafe nice ambiance clean friendly staff 1 
i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
camera color balance is awful 0 
the most annoying thing about cover girl is the way in which rita hayworth is put up on a pedestal 0 
if you have not seen this movie i definitely recommend it 1 
very unreliable service from tmobile 0 
i felt insulted and disrespected how could you talk and judge another human being like that 0 
i totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is 1 
i went on motorolas website and followed all directions but could not get it to pair again 0 
everyone is treated equally special 1 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
this is the kind of money that is wasted properly 1 
i recommend this for everyone who loves film movies anythinga work of art 1 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
you also cannot take pictures with it in the case because the lense is covered 0 
i guess that nobody at the network that aired this dribble watched it before putting it on 0 
it was horrible 0 
if you stay in vegas you must get breakfast here at least once 1 
at no point in the proceedings does it look remotely like america 0 
returned 8 hours later 0 
the aerial scenes were welldone 1 
they could be used as exemplars for any set designer 1 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
i really wanted the plantronics 510 to be the right one but it has too many issues for methe good 0 
it makes very strange ticking noises before it ends the call 0 
go to place for gyros 1 
if youre not familiar check it out 1 
highly recommend for any one who has a blue tooth phone 1 
its practically perfect in all of them  a true masterpiece in a sea of faux masterpieces 1 
we ordered the duck rare and it was pink and tender on the inside with a nice char on the outside 1 
treo and tmobile refused to replace it again and forced me to buy another phone without any kind of upgrade discount 0 
okay i like to consider myself a fair critic so ill give credit where credits duethe creature effects were actually pretty cool 1 
for readers who have already seen one of miyazakis films he is still in top form and made another worthwhile experience 1 
the warm beer didnt help 0 
design flaw 0 
the waitress was friendly and happy to accomodate for veganveggie options 1 
i came over from verizon because cingulair has nicer cell phones the first thing i noticed was the really bad service 0 
the holster that arrived did not match the photo in the ad 0 
dont buy this product 0 
unfortunately it did not work 0 
none of it works just dont buy it 0 
the only suspense i was feeling was the frustration at just how retarded the girls were 0 
painful on the ear 0 
i was left shattered from the experience of watching this film and i took a good two hours to fully recover 0 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
talk about useless customer service 0 
very unreliable service from tmobile 0 
it was just too horrible 0 
this place is amazing 1 
the service was a bit lacking 0 
i would avoid this place if you are staying in the mirage 0 
an hour and a half i wish i could bring back 0 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
there are so many problems i dont know where to start 0 
it wasnt busy at all and now we know why 0 
i dont have to be an accountant to know im getting screwed 0 
total brunch fail 0 
we ordered some old classics and some new dishes after going there a few times and were sorely disappointed with everything 0 
the delivery was on time 1 
the stories were as unbelievable as the actors 0 
he is one of my favourite directors and one of the most talented directors in the history of cinema 1 
the ri style calamari was a joke 0 
dont buy this product it fails 0 
now we were chosen to be tortured with this disgusting piece of blatant american propaganda 0 
but kevin spacey is an excellent verbal tsunami as buddy ackerman  and totally believable because he is a great actor 1 
product is exactly as described 1 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
if you want a sandwich just go to any firehouse 1 
jamie foxx absolutely is ray charles 1 
its the best headset i have used 1 
arrived quickly and much less expensive than others being sold 1 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
i am glad i purchased it 1 
this is a simple little phone to use but the breakage is unacceptible 0 
so i had to take the battery out of the phone put it all back together and then restart it 0 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
so just beware 0 
after the first charge kept going dead after 12 minutes 0 
the worst was the salmon sashimi 0 
dont make the same mistake i did 0 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
performed awful muffled tinny incoming sound and severe echo for those on the other end of the call 0 
it was a pale color instead of nice and char and has no flavor 0 
but this movie really got to me 1 
cant get the software to work with my computer 0 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
essentially you can forget microsofts tech support 0 
and the red curry had so much bamboo shoots and wasnt very tasty to me 0 
i dont understand how this garbage got on the shelves of the movie store its not even a real movie 0 
excellent product for the price 1 
but kevin spacey is an excellent verbal tsunami as buddy ackerman  and totally believable because he is a great actor 1 
it showed exactly how the government and the scientist argued for humanity and the reasons of the gadget 1 
the film succeeds despite or perhaps because of an obviously meagre budget 1 
ill definitely be in soon again 1 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
the movie is full of wonderful dancing hence the title 1 
the restaurant is very clean and has a family restaurant feel to it 1 
the success of the film depends on the casting of sydney greenstreet as the alexander yardley character 1 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
its not user friendly 0 
perfect for the ps3 1 
it plays louder than any other speaker of this size the price is so low that most would think the quality is lacking however its not 1 
the stories were powerful explorations of the nature of man and of art 1 
ambience is perfect 1 
good food good service 1 
the acting is beyond abysmal 0 
its too bad the food is so damn generic 0 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
the film succeeds despite or perhaps because of an obviously meagre budget 1 
his use of the colours of the french flag in the three films was nothing short of incredible every shot every scene was like a work of art 1 
i waited and waited 0 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
the characters were all funny and had the peculiarity of not having a true lead character 1 
seller shipped quickly and much cheaper than the competitors 1 
the only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port irda 0 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
they do not last forever but is not overly expensive to replaceeasy to operate and the sound is much better than others i have tried 1 
great case and price 1 
i swung in to give them a try but was deeply disappointed 0 
yes its shiny on front side and i love it 1 
so good i am going to have to review this place twice once hereas a tribute to the place and once as a tribute to an event held here last night 1 
does not work for listening to music with the cingular 8125 0 
good works fine 1 
their onscreen chemistry critical to the entire film is genuine 1 
saggy floppy piece of junk 0 
the cast was great 1 
i do think tom hanks is a good actor 1 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
the plot well i said id let that one go 0 
a lot of websites have been rating this a very good phone and so do i 1 
well never go again 0 
the attempts at humor were pitiful and story is so awful it dosent bear thinking about which basically involves a vulcan stealing the enterprise to find god seriously i just didnt care about any of this film and oh not to mention uhura does a belly dance to distract male guards 0 
if you see it you should probably just leave it on the shelf 0 
all in all id expected a better consumer experience from motorola 0 
the battery runs down quickly 0 
i recommend this for everyone who loves film movies anythinga work of art 1 
doesnt last long 0 
but now that it is out of warranty the same problems reoccurebottom line put your money somewhere else cingular will not support it 0 
the plot well i said id let that one go 0 
i was mortified 0 
i was very disappointed 0 
the foreigner is not worth one second of your time 0 
this film tries to be a serious and sophisticated thrillerhorror flick and it fails miserably 0 
i advise everyone do not be fooled 0 
but whatever it was that cost them so much it didnt translate to quality thats for sure 0 
the secondary plot line is incomprehensible and its relation to the primary plot line is mystifying 0 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
it was a pale color instead of nice and char and has no flavor 0 
i am so tired of clichés that is just lazy writing and here they come in thick and fast 0 
spend your money and time some place else 0 
wont go back 0 
omit watching this 0 
the service was terrible food was mediocre 0 
i highly recommend this case 1 
i rather enjoyed it 1 
i recently tried caballeros and i have been back every week since 1 
took an hour to get our food only 4 tables in restaurant my food was luke warm our sever was running around like he was totally overwhelmed 0 
the battery is completely useless to me 0 
sauce was tasteless 0 
absolutel junk 0 
not much flavor to them and very poorly constructed 0 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
great place to relax and have an awesome burger and beer 1 
the earpiece on this is too large or too heavyit keeps falling out of my ear 0 
the building itself seems pretty neat the bathroom is pretty trippy but i wouldnt eat here again 0 
not what i wanted 0 
im not really sure how joeys was voted best hot dog in the valley by readers of phoenix magazine 0 
one more thing i can tolerate political incorrectness very well im all for artistic freedom and suspension of disbelief but the slavic female character was just too much 0 
i was very pleased to see that i could replace my well travled swivel holster for my blackberry flip 1 
but other than that the movie seemed to drag and the heroes didnt really work for their freedom 0 
we ordered some old classics and some new dishes after going there a few times and were sorely disappointed with everything 0 
any ring toneoverall good phone to buy 1 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
jabra ear gels r the best 1 
the malta settings are as dry and as barren as the dialogue 0 
its fits like a glove and is strong secure and durable 1 
this place is disgusting 0 
yeah the movie pretty much sucked 0 
this is my new fav vegas buffet spot 1 
the kids are annoying 0 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
the sweet potato fries were very good and seasoned well 1 
the decor is nice and the piano music soundtrack is pleasant 1 
piece of trash 0 
this is essentially a communications tool that does not communicate 0 
i just wanted to leave 0

his losing his marbles so early in the proceedings is totally implausible and unconvincing 0 
server did a great job handling our large rowdy table 1 
the bartender was also nice 1 
muddy low quality sound and the casing around the wires insert was poorly super glued and slid off 0 
a greasy unhealthy meal 0 
i bought two of them and neither will charge 0 
excellent product 1 
considering the relations off screen between taylor and stanwyck it was surprising how little chemistry there was on screen between the two of them 0 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
everyone is very attentive providing excellent customer service 1 
the only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port irda 0 
i dont know what kind it is but they have the best iced tea 1 
the majority of the logitech earbud headsets failed 0 
i consider this theft 0 
never going back 0 
my experience was terrible this was my fourth bluetooth headset and while it was much more comfortable than my last jabra which i hated 0 
not a good bargain 0 
this is a very average phone with bad battery life that operates on a weak network 0 
this film and i use that word loosely is an insult to the moviegoing public 0 
bluetooth does not work phone locks up screens just flash up and now it just makes calls randomly while in my pocket locked 0 
the movie is full of wonderful dancing hence the title 1 
a greasy unhealthy meal 0 
lets start with all the problemsthe acting especially from the lead professor was very very bad 0 
avoid at any and all costs 0 
this hole in the wall has great mexican street tacos and friendly staff 1 
considering the relations off screen between taylor and stanwyck it was surprising how little chemistry there was on screen between the two of them 0 
it does everything the description said it would 1 
i didnt want the clip going over the top of my ear causing discomfort 0 
try them in the airport to experience some tasty food and speedy friendly service 1 
really really good rice all the time 1 
if you stay in vegas you must get breakfast here at least once 1 
the headset fulfills my requirements so i am happy with my purchase 1 
i wear glasses and it fits fine with them 1 
furthermore you cant even find hours of operation on the website 0 
there were too many close ups 0 
also the story and acting were weak 0 
just as good as when i had it more than a year ago 1 
i probably wont be coming back here 0 
i tried the cape cod ravoli chickenwith cranberrymmmm 1 
almost everyone involved must be return to school acting is utterly predictable and bad script is pile of garbage all round 0 
love the margaritas too 1 
think it over when you plan to own this onethis sure is the last moto phone for me 0 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
good works fine 1 
we had 7 at our table and the service was pretty fast 1 
verizons bills however are difficult to understand even though their pricing plans are simple 0 
it felt like a very gripping intelligent stage play but without the overly theatrical feeling one actually gets from watching people on a stage which plays on everyones terror of a white lie escalating to monstrous consequences 1 
you need two hands to operate the screenthis software interface is decade old and cannot compete with new software designs 0 
very very fun chef 1 
it also had a new problem 0 
not worth it 0 
even worse than ticker 0 
the acting was decidely wooden though no worse than a period universal b movie 0 
after the first charge kept going dead after 12 minutes 0 
i paid the bill but did not tip because i felt the server did a terrible job 0 
this is a great restaurant at the mandalay bay 1 
the sets especially designed to work with the camera are amazingstylized beautiful and effective 1 
weird vibe from owners 0 
hes a national treasure 1 
the desserts were a bit strange 0 
then a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use 0 
unfortunately it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees 0 
overall i was not impressed and would not go back 0 
everything captain howdy says is either laughable or just plain stupid 0 
the food wasnt good 0 
the success of the film depends on the casting of sydney greenstreet as the alexander yardley character 1 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
o my gosh the best phone i have ever had 1 
i love this device 1 
i tried the cape cod ravoli chickenwith cranberrymmmm 1 
everything is appalling 0 
i felt insulted and disrespected how could you talk and judge another human being like that 0 
the food is not tasty at all not to say its real traditional hunan style 0 
it has kept up very well 1 
it was not good 0 
i give it 2 thumbs down 0 
the service here is fair at best 0 
its really easy 1 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
by this time our side of the restaurant was almost empty so there was no excuse 0 
if she had not rolled the eyes we may have stayed not sure if we will go back and try it again 0 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
the story starts too fast with absolutely no suspense or buildup in the slightest 0 
great software for motorolas 1 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
you get incredibly fresh fish prepared with care 1 
the only thing i wasnt too crazy about was their guacamole as i dont like it puréed 0 
the poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying 0 
well im satisfied 1 
i love this phone it is very handy and has a lot of features 1 
the cast was great 1 
doesnt hold charge 0 
i wear glasses and it fits fine with them 1 
i was so insulted 0 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
damian is so talented and versatile in so many ways of writing and portraying different characters on screen 1 
the death row scenes were entirely unmoving 0 
the staff is great the food is delish and they have an incredible beer selection 1 
great place fo take out or eat in 1 
this was like the final blow 0 
the fish is badly made and some of its underwater shots are repeated a thousand times in the film 0 
my 5year old nokia 2160 from tracfone holds the charge a lot better than this 0 
thanks good a movie like this was done and released 1 
i love that they put their food in nice plastic containers as opposed to cramming it in little paper takeout boxes 1 
a standout scene 1 
i was very disappointed 0 
exactly what i wanted 1 
not a good item it worked for a while then started having problems in my auto reverse tape player 0 
this one is simply a disappointment 0 
the acting sucked 0 
about ten minutes into this film i started having second thoughts 0 
but storm trooper is not even bad enough to make it to the list of wonderfully terrible movies 0 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
the flat reenactments dont hold your attention because they are emotionally adrift and stagy 0 
there is so much good food in vegas that i feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to rice and company 0 
ill be looking for a new earpiece 0 
the story is also both funny and poignant at times 1 
the poor actors 0 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
their menu is diverse and reasonably priced 1 
poor quality 0 
i wont be back 0 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
i have to use the smallest earpieces provided but it stays on pretty well 1 
bad quality 0 
ill be looking for a new earpiece 0 
often the dialogue doesnt really follow from one line to another or fit the surroundings 0 
if you simply want a small flip phone look elsewhere as the extra bells whistles are mediocre 0 
only pros large seating area nice bar area great simple drink menu the best brick oven pizza with homemade dough 1 
that being said for a phone the camera is very nice many cool effects to play with and video is decent as well 1 
this movie is bad 0 
service was good and the company was better 1 
lets start with all the problemsthe acting especially from the lead professor was very very bad 0 
rude inconsiderate management 0 
camera color balance is awful 0 
a good film by a great director 1 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
he is almost unbearable to watch on screen he has little to no charisma and terrible comedic timing 0 
the steaks are all well trimmed and also perfectly cooked 1 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
if you see it you should probably just leave it on the shelf 0 
john wayne did an incredible job for being so young in the movie industry 1 
i love the look and feel of samsung flipphones 1 
lot of holes in the plot theres nothing about how he became the emperor nothing about where he spend 20 years between his childhood and mature age 0 
john wayne did an incredible job for being so young in the movie industry 1 
it was so cool 1
