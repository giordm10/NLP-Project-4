the shower area is outside so you can only rinse not take a full shower unless you dont mind being nude for everyone to see 0 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
there are so many problems i dont know where to start 0 
i thought errol flynn was brilliant as custer and has since become my favourite actor 1 
the staff is friendly and the joint is always clean 1 
however after finally watching this film i realized that not only had i had a closed mind to the brilliance it depicts i also found myself watching it over and over again 1 
i only hear garbage for audio 0 
up there with the best of melville 1 
i probably would not go here again 0 
i love this phone it is very handy and has a lot of features 1 
it is a joy to use 1 
the warm beer didnt help 0 
its this pandering to the audience that sabotages most of his films 0 
though the wind and the lion is told largely through the eyes of the son every member of the family can identify with one of the characters whether it be sean connerys noble brigand candace bergens feisty heroine john hustons wily john hay or steve kanalys spiffy radiant ruthless cando lieutenant roosevelts big stick 1 
just what i wanted 1 
my experience was terrible this was my fourth bluetooth headset and while it was much more comfortable than my last jabra which i hated 0 
not easy to watch 0 
this is a great restaurant at the mandalay bay 1 
the sound is clear and the people i talk to on it are amazed at the quality too 1 
so i am here to warn youdo not rent this movie it is the dumbest thing you have never seen 0 
i love the look and feel of samsung flipphones 1 
its pure brilliance 1 
you get what you pay for i guess 0 
as always the evening was wonderful and the food delicious 1 
i dont think it would hold it too securly on your belt 0 
i enjoyed reading this book to my children when they were little 1 
this company charge me a restocking fee and still not given me my refund back 0 
i cannot make calls at certain places 0 
i seriously cannot believe that the owner has so many unexperienced employees that all are running around like chickens with their heads cut off 0 
often the dialogue doesnt really follow from one line to another or fit the surroundings 0 
the tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu 0 
after arguing with verizon regarding the dropped calls we returned the phones after two days 0 
see it 1 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
we had a group of 70 when we claimed we would only have 40 and they handled us beautifully 1 
good servicecheck 1 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
not sure who was more lost the flat characters or the audience nearly half of whom walked out 0 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
horrible horrible protector 0 
good show samsung 1 
people couldnt hear me talk and i had to pull out the earphone and talk on the phone 0 
it has been a winner for us 1 
that being said for a phone the camera is very nice many cool effects to play with and video is decent as well 1 
after the first charge kept going dead after 12 minutes 0 
these are certainly very comfortable and functionality is decent 1 
will order from them again 1 
the inside is really quite nice and very clean 1 
this film tries to be a serious and sophisticated thrillerhorror flick and it fails miserably 0 
last night was my second time dining here and i was so happy i decided to go back 1 
the scenery that the two daughters paint and photograph are beautiful 1 
i could not stand to even watch it for very long for fear of losing iq 0 
the vanilla ice cream was creamy and smooth while the profiterole choux pastry was fresh enough 1 
this is was due to the fact that it took 20 minutes to be acknowledged then another 35 minutes to get our foodand they kept forgetting things 0 
if you see it you should probably just leave it on the shelf 0 
im so sorry but i really cant recommend it to anyone 0 
the reception has been generally good 1 
greatno problems at all 1 
very slow at seating even with reservation 0 
the story line is just awful 0 
ive had this for nearly 2 years and it has worked great for me 1 
now this is a movie i really dislike 0 
we got the food and apparently they have never heard of salt and the batter on the fish was chewy 0 
this is definitely a cult classic well worth viewing and sharing with others 1 
this movie suffered because of the writing it needed more suspense 0 
they are so cool 1 
as for the mains also uninspired 0 
the camera really likes her in this movie 1 
the whole experience was underwhelming and i think well just go to ninja sushi next time 0 
thats how id describe this painfully dreary timewaster of a film 0 
the charger arrived within the promised timeframe but it did not work 0 
penne vodka excellent 1 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
i connected my wifes bluetoothmotorola hs850 to my phone and it worked like a charm whether the phone was in my pocket or the case 1 
must have been an off night at this place 0 
at around 4 pm i bought it at around 8pm i started to watch at around 815pm i fast forwarded the remaining film to see if there was anything left watchable for a human being with a brain but there wasnt 0 
food was average at best 0 
the first thing that happened was that the tracking was off 0 
great hands free device 1 
you could drive a semi truck into these holes 0 
they have a plethora of salads and sandwiches and everything ive tried gets my seal of approval 1 
i really dont see how anyone could enjoy this movie 0 
ill put this gem up against any movie in terms of screenplay cinematography acting postproduction editing directing or any other aspect of filmmaking 1 
the food is rich so order accordingly 1 
i didnt want the clip going over the top of my ear causing discomfort 0 
on the negative its insipid enough to cause regret for another 2 hours of life wasted in front of the screen 0 
to call this movie a drama is ridiculous 0 
im still trying to get over how bad it was 0 
i came back today since they relocated and still not impressed 0 
it presents a idyllic yet serious portrayal of the ups and downs of the characters lives 1 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
the real disappointment was our waiter 0 
the only place good for this film is in the garbage 0 
really awful 0 
overall a great experience 1 
i always order from the vegetarian menu during dinner which has a wide array of options to choose from 1 
the bathroom is just next door and very nice 1 
service sucks 0 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
there is no real plot 0 
host staff were for lack of a better word bitches 0 
an hour seriously 0 
on the good side the staff was genuinely pleasant and enthusiastic a real treat 1 
before i go in to why i gave a 1 star rating please know that this was my third time eating at bachi burger before writing a review 0 
special thanks to dylan t for the recommendation on what to order all yummy for my tummy 1 
so far it has worked like a charm 1 
i was totally fascinated by the music the dancing everything 1 
ill definitely be in soon again 1 
another thing i didnt really like is when a character got punched in the face a gallon of blood would spew forth soon after 0 
sweetest phone 1 
the phone crashed completely and now i have to get it replaced 0 
loved the casting of jimmy buffet as the science teacher 1 
i was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar not only because the quality is great but the service is fast and the food impeccable 1 
i give wirefly 1 stari will contact cingularatt and inform them of this practice 0 
a usable keyboard actually turns a pda into a realworld useful machine instead of just a neat gadget 1 
sucked most of the stuff does not work with my phone 0 
phone is sturdy as all nokia bar phones are 1 
the script is bad very bad  it contains both cheesiness and unethical joke that you normally see in rated r or nc17 movie 0 
none of it works just dont buy it 0 
used and dirty 0 
i was shocked because no signs indicate cash only 0 
before i go in to why i gave a 1 star rating please know that this was my third time eating at bachi burger before writing a review 0 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
with the originality and freshness of the first movie now spent this remake had little else to offer 0 
the seasonal fruit was fresh white peach puree 1 
jamie foxx absolutely is ray charles 1 
black water is a thriller that manages to completely transcend its limitations its an indie flick by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience 1 
hence the whole story lacks a certain energy 0 
it didnt charge for me 0 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
it is super charged up for use as a small hybrid palmtopcameracellphone and excels in those roles 1 
simple lightweight and great fit 1 
the songs were the best and the muppets were so hilarious 1 
no one at the table thought the food was above average or worth the wait that we had for it 0 
imdb ratings only go as low 1 for awful its time to get some negative numbers in there for cases such as these 0 
the good cinematography also makes her and monica bellucci look very beautiful 1 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
you could only take 2 videos at a time and the quality was very poor 0 
great product 1 
yet plantronincs continues to use the same flawed charger design 0 
it never condescends all the characters have good genuine hearts and believable problems 1 
you could only take 2 videos at a time and the quality was very poor 0 
bt50 battery junk 0 
totally different with loads of understatement and black comedy this is a film few get to see but those who do will remember it 1 
only like 3 or 4 buildings used a couple of locations maybe poor hummh 0 
by the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant i was bored and didnt care what happened next and so i switched off 0 
waste your money on this game 1 
good servicecheck 1 
this case has passed the one year mark and while it shows signs of wear it is 100 functional 1 
great bluetooth 1 
definitely not worth the 3 i paid 0 
ambience is perfect 1 
my 5year old nokia 2160 from tracfone holds the charge a lot better than this 0 
soggy and not good 0 
i do think tom hanks is a good actor 1 
the bose noise cancelling is amazing which is very important for a nyc commuter 1 
the food wasnt good 0 
frankly after cotton club and unfaithful it was kind of embarrassing to watch lane and gere in this film because it is bad 0 
i have to use the smallest earpieces provided but it stays on pretty well 1 
the use of slowmotion needlessly repeats itself throughout the movie but is well backed up by bad acting and bad is a kind word here no continuity scenes that are thrown in for no reason whatsoever vehicles that looked like they were made from a corn flakes box and a directorial style that bordered on stupidity 0 
im not eating here 0 
as a sushi lover avoid this place by all means 0 
this place is disgusting 0 
in fact i liked it better than interview with a vampire and i liked this lestat stuart townsend better than cruises attempt 1 
the worst one of the series 0 
i especially liked the noncliche choices with the parents in other movies i could predict the dialog verbatim but the writing in this movie made better selections 1 
case was more or less an extra that i originally put on but later discarded because it scratched my ear 0 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
graphics is far from the best part of the game 0 
the plastic breaks really easy on this clip 0 
does not fit 0 
point your finger at any item on the menu order it and you wont be disappointed 1 
i had the mac salad and it was pretty bland so i will not be getting that again 0 
will never ever go back 0 
i cannot make calls at certain places 0 
does not fit 0 
thus far have only visited twice and the food was absolutely delicious each time 1 
the nokia ca42 usb cable did not work with my phone 0 
absolutely great 1 
this little device has transformed my organizational capability and made my life a whole lot easier 1 
the soundtrack wasnt terrible either 1 
iam very pleased with my purchase 1 
after the disappointing dinner we went elsewhere for dessert 0 
the cable looks so thin and flimsy it is scary 0 
i am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this 1 
what the hell kind of crap is that 0 
we had fantastic service and were pleased by the atmosphere 1 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
dont waste your time here 0 
on the negative its insipid enough to cause regret for another 2 hours of life wasted in front of the screen 0 
bad choice 0 
the plot was the same as pretty much every other cheap horror 0 
you need two hands to operate the screenthis software interface is decade old and cannot compete with new software designs 0 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
i mean really how do you get so famous for your fish and chips when its so terrible 0 
terrible service 0 
doesnt hold charge 0 
the sound is clear and the people i talk to on it are amazed at the quality too 1 
definitely a bargain 1 
and the red curry had so much bamboo shoots and wasnt very tasty to me 0 
total waste of time 0 
great price too 1 
the food was great as always compliments to the chef 1 
i really loved the story line and the poler bear was kinda cutebut if anyone has a question about fort steele just ask away 1 
kind of hard to mess up a steak but they did 0 
i love all the features and form factor 1 
id advise anyone to go and see it 1 
if you havent choked in your own vomit by the end by all the cheap drama and worthless dialogue youve must have bored yourself to death with this waste of time 0 
its very attractive and appears to be of good quality 1 
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 
but i definitely would not eat here again 0 
their steaks are 100 recommended 1 
barney is definitely super de duper 1 
great food and great service in a clean and friendly setting 1 
im not eating here 0 
there is no plot here to keep you going in the first place 0 
it was quite comfortable in the ear 1 
good prices 1 
worst service to boot but that is the least of their worries 0 
the puppets look really cheesy not in a good way like in the puppet master 80s flicks 0 
also great directing and photography 1 
battery is holding up well 1 
del taco is pretty nasty and should be avoided if possible 0 
im so happy to be here 1 
worst hour and a half of my lifeoh my gosh 0 
the directing seems too pretentious 0 
the tracfonewebsite is user friendly and makes it easy toactivate etc 1 
the voice recognition thru the handset is excellent 1 
both the hot sour the egg flower soups were absolutely 5 stars 1 
there is a totally unnecessary trainroller coaster scene 0 
used and dirty 0 
works as described 1 
worst customer service 0 
it has a great camera thats 2mp and the pics are nice and clear with great picture quality 1 
to sum the film up breeders is a terrible cheaply made horror movie that should be avoided like the ebola virus 0 
the cable looks so thin and flimsy it is scary 0 
its pretty easy 1 
my breakfast was perpared great with a beautiful presentation of 3 giant slices of toast lightly dusted with powdered sugar 1 
the story line is just awful 0 
the visual effects were awful 0 
beautiful styling though 1 
his use of the colours of the french flag in the three films was nothing short of incredible every shot every scene was like a work of art 1 
the seller is very understanding and patient i would definitely buy from them again 1 
i highly recommend this movie for anyone interested in art poetry theater politics or japanese history 1 
we received a white colored battery that goes dead after a couple hoursthe original used to last a week but still lasts longer than thereplacement 0 
often the dialogue doesnt really follow from one line to another or fit the surroundings 0 
this place is amazing 1 
food was so gooodd 1 
i loved their mussels cooked in this wine reduction the duck was tender and their potato dishes were delicious 1 
this case seems well made 1 
im so sorry but i really cant recommend it to anyone 0 
if that bug never showed up i would have given a 4 for sure but on the other side of the wall where this bug was climbing was the kitchen 0 
product was excellent and works better than the verizon one and boy was it cheaper 1 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
yes its shiny on front side and i love it 1 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
the kids are very cool too 1 
the acting was decidely wooden though no worse than a period universal b movie 0 
i dont know what kind it is but they have the best iced tea 1 
highly recommended a 1 
hackneyed writing certainly but made even worse by the bad directing 0 
i thought it was bad 0 
the ambiance isnt much better 0 
it isnt even an achievement as a sobaditsgood or sobaditsmemorable movie 0 
we made the drive all the way from north scottsdale and i was not one bit disappointed 1 
last time buying from you 0 
though the wind and the lion is told largely through the eyes of the son every member of the family can identify with one of the characters whether it be sean connerys noble brigand candace bergens feisty heroine john hustons wily john hay or steve kanalys spiffy radiant ruthless cando lieutenant roosevelts big stick 1 
you will leave the theater wanting to go out and dance under the stars 1 
initially the local sites in the film which was filmed here in buffalo intrigued me 1 
verizons bills however are difficult to understand even though their pricing plans are simple 0 
the reception has been generally good 1 
it never condescends all the characters have good genuine hearts and believable problems 1 
i especially love the long battery life 1 
still waiting im sure this item would work well if i ever recieve it 0 
i have to use the smallest earpieces provided but it stays on pretty well 1 
i love it 1 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
then the film just dropped the ball 0 
oh yeah and the storyline was pathetic too 0 
yes i am simplifying things here for the sake of brevity for this really is at the core of the problems with this film it has too much going on without any real fulfilling explanation 0 
i left the theater with a lilt in my step joy in my heart and hope for the human race 1 
if you do go see this movie bring a pillow or a girlfriendboyfriend to keep you occupied through out 0 
its quite simply the highest most superlative form of cinema imaginable 1 
lots of holes in the script 0 
probably not in a hurry to go back 0 
delicious and i will absolutely be back 1 
it is indescribably the most annoying and idiotic show i have ever seen 0 
on the negative its insipid enough to cause regret for another 2 hours of life wasted in front of the screen 0 
and the beans and rice were mediocre at best 0 
the food was great as always compliments to the chef 1 
good product incredible value 1 
happy so far 1 
i wasnt expecting oscar material but this 0 
im a big fan of this series mostly due to anne rices style sensitivities and treatments 1 
the service was poor and thats being nice 0 
it always cuts out and makes a beep beep beep sound then says signal failed 0 
overall i was not impressed and would not go back 0 
it was a drive to get there 0 
not impressed 0 
not as good as i had hoped 0 
it has everything i need and i couldnt ask for more 1 
this is the first phone ive had that has been so cheaply made 0 
i just dont know how this place managed to served the blandest food i have ever eaten when they are preparing indian cuisine 0 
i dont know exactly what it is about this movie but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our familys memories 1 
im not sure what he was trying to do with this film 0 
the restaurant is very clean and has a family restaurant feel to it 1 
and finally after all that we get to an ending that wouldve been great had it been handled by competent people and not jerry falwell 0 
the transfers are very good 1 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
these products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet 0 
they have a plethora of salads and sandwiches and everything ive tried gets my seal of approval 1 
the service was outshining i definitely recommend the halibut 1 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
the story itself is just predictable and lazy 0 
it was an inexpensive piece but i would still have expected better quality 0 
will be back again 1 
it was attached to a gas station and that is rarely a good sign 0 
i enjoyed reading this book to my children when they were little 1 
level 5 spicy was perfect where spice didnt overwhelm the soup 1 
we ordered the duck rare and it was pink and tender on the inside with a nice char on the outside 1 
these headphones were a great find and i think they are perhaps the best purchase ive made in the last several years seriously 1 
i ended up sliding it on the edge of my pants or back pockets instead 1 
that movie was bad 0 
this was a different cut than the piece the other day but still wonderful and tender s well as well flavored 1 
i enjoyed reading this book to my children when they were little 1 
it looses connection to the phone even when it is within a couple feet between the two 0 
i use this product in a motor control center where there is a lot of high voltage humming from the equipment and it works great 1 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
it is wonderful and inspiring to watch and i hope that it gets released again on to video or dvd 1 
good product good seller 1 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
att is not clear sound is very distorted and you have to yell when you talk 0 
judith light is one of my favorite actresses and i think she does a superb job in this film 1 
overall i like this place a lot 1 
this place is good 1 
the microphone also works well but according to people i have called it applifies everything 1 
the writers were smack on and i think the best actors and actresses were a bonus to the showthese characters were so real 1 
its not user friendly 0 
this movie was kind of long in length but i enjoyed every minute of it 1 
favorite place in town for shawarrrrrrma 1 
the writer gorman bechard undoubtedly did his homework because all references are industry and characterage appropriate 1 
owners are really great people 1 
the jamaican mojitos are delicious 1 
its reception is very very poor 0 
the flat reenactments dont hold your attention because they are emotionally adrift and stagy 0 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
i wish i could enter negative values admins 0 
definitely worth checking out 1 
this is a simple little phone to use but the breakage is unacceptible 0 
as always the evening was wonderful and the food delicious 1 
this is a simple little phone to use but the breakage is unacceptible 0 
first time there and might just be the last 0 
barney is definitely super de duper 1 
rating 1 out of 10 0 
after my phone got to be about a year old its been slowly breaking despite much care on my part 0 
if you see it you should probably just leave it on the shelf 0 
duris has a wholesome appearance and gives a fine performance 1 
the only thing i did like was the prime rib and dessert section 1 
very clear quality sound and you dont have to mess with the sound on your ipod since you have the sound buttons on the headset 1 
the story which was told so eloquently by francis ford coppola 25 years earlier really unfolds gradually and leaves room for the characters to develop 1 
dont do it 0 
the story starts too fast with absolutely no suspense or buildup in the slightest 0 
always a great time at dos gringos 1 
it has northern humour and positive about the community it represents 1 
everything was perfect the night we were in 1 
it feels poorly constructed the menus are difficult to navigate and the buttons are so recessed that it is difficult to push them 0 
bad quality 0 
good protection and does not make phone too bulky 1 
a good quality bargain i bought this after i bought a cheapy from big lots that sounded awful and people on the other end couldnt hear me 1 
sprint charges for this service 0 
however paul schrader has indeed made a film about mishima that is both superb complex 1 
also were served hot bread and butter and home made potato chips with bacon bits on topvery original and very good 1 
now imagine that every single one of those decisions was made wrong 0 
crisp and clear 1 
the turkey and roast beef were bland 0 
her lines seem to have been written by a fifteen year old though they are trying oh so so hard to sound like how a fifteen year old would really um you know well talk 0 
i will not be eating there again 0 
worst phone ever 0 
the film is well paced understated and one of the best courtroom documentaries ive seen 1 
the songs were the best and the muppets were so hilarious 1 
for service i give them no stars 0 
i have tried these cables with my computer and my ipod and it works just fine 1 
the live music on fridays totally blows 0 
special mention should be made of the superb music score and sound effects which are an integral element in helping to make this such a memorable and enjoyable cartoon 1 
so badwellits just bad 0 
its a great tool for entertainment communication and data managementoh be sure to use activesync 42 for optimal data synchronization results 1 
hitchcock is a great director 1 
when my order arrived one of the gyros was missing 0 
a good time 1 
they are so easy to love but even more easy to identify with 1 
not a good bargain 0 
this is definitely one of the better documentaries i have seen looking at family relationships and marriage 1 
when achille and philippa beautifully sing a duet from don giovanni that perfectly describes their situation in the movie you appreciate the subtle layers of this excellent film 1 
total waste of time 0 
generous portions and great taste 1 
we were promptly greeted and seated 1 
when my mom and i got home she immediately got sick and she only had a few bites of salad 0 
the file browser offers all the options that one needshandsfree is great 1 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
this is a good joint 1 
we were promptly greeted and seated 1 
we watched our waiter pay a lot more attention to other tables and ignore us 0 
the fries were great too 1 
a drive thru means you do not want to wait around for half an hour for your food but somehow when we end up going here they make us wait and wait 0 
none of the three sizes they sent with the headset would stay in my ears 0 
i have had tmobile service for 2 or 3 years now and i am pretty happy with it 1 
i felt as though her going to ireland did absolutely nothing whatsoever 0 
worst customer service 0 
nice blanket of moz over top but i feel like this was done to cover up the subpar food 1 
this fixes all the problems 1 
the chips that came out were dripping with grease and mostly not edible 0 
great audio 1 
the menu is always changing food quality is going down service is extremely slow 0 
its pretty surprising that this wonderful film was made in 1949 as hollywood generally had its collective heads in the sand concerning black and white issues at that time 1 
you share general loewenhielms exquisite joy in his partaking of the cailles en sarcophage even though you are just watching a movie but you do wish for just a small sample to savor 1 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
this is a masterful piece of filmmaking with many themes simmering and occasionally boiling over in this warts and all study of the poets bohemian selfindulgent wartime years that span the aerial bombardments of london and the outward tranquillity of a welsh coastal retreat the borderlines between friendship lust and love dedication to art and experience versus practical concerns jealousy rivalry cowardice and egotism versus heroism and selfsacrifice and more 1 
generally it just lacked imagination 0 
what a big waste of time 0 
about 30 minutes of footage is wasted to show mediocre elderly actors awkwardly babbling overwrought pseudosatanic gibberish corny enough to make a teen goth blush almost always in olde english and sometimes in latin that may or may not be made up words 0 
first the bathrooms at this location were dirty seat covers were not replenished just plain yucky 0 
10 out of 10 for both the movie and trilogy 1 
dont waste your money 0 
looks great and is strong 1 
trying to make a call on these is an exercise in frustration 0 
the service here is fair at best 0 
they could be used as exemplars for any set designer 1 
a greasy unhealthy meal 0 
by far the best cheesecurds we have ever had 1 
it is perfect for a sitdown family meal or get together with a few friends 1 
by the time the film ended i not only disliked it i despised it 0 
i have to mention this and it is a huge spoiler i loved the ending how all the characters of the three films were the remaining survivors of the ferry disaster with valentine and the young judge together and the old man watching it on her tv solidifying his happiness over the suffering which he dealt with for those many years 1 
the only thing i wasnt too crazy about was their guacamole as i dont like it puréed 0 
overall the film is interesting and thoughtprovoking 1 
thank you for wasting my money 0 
the film is well paced understated and one of the best courtroom documentaries ive seen 1 
avoid this film at all costs 0 
it will drive you barking mad 0 
people couldnt hear me talk and i had to pull out the earphone and talk on the phone 0 
this movie was kind of long in length but i enjoyed every minute of it 1 
however i needed some better instructions 0 
the live music on fridays totally blows 0 
now the pizza itself was good the peanut sauce was very tasty 1 
the folks at otto always make us feel so welcome and special 1 
the macarons here are insanely good 1 
very funny 1 
in fact i liked it better than interview with a vampire and i liked this lestat stuart townsend better than cruises attempt 1 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
this is an excellent film 1 
if you are razr owneryou must have this 1 
we had fantastic service and were pleased by the atmosphere 1 
however my girl was complain that some time the phone doesnt wake up like normal phone does 0 
but i thought his acting was skilled 1 
its a little geeky but i think thats its sex on toast and it rocks and oozes sex right down to its battery embedded sleek stylish leather case 1 
im trying to return it for a refund 0 
was not happy 0 
the kids are annoying 0 
they really want to make your experience a good one 1 
what on earth is irons doing in this film 0 
works for me 1 
the least said about the acting the better 0 
both of the egg rolls were fantastic 1 
it was pretty gross 0 
doesnt hold charge 0 
im still trying to get over how bad it was 0 
couldnt ask for a more satisfying meal 1 
excellent product for the price 1 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
im still infatuated with this phone 1 
nice ambiance 1 
do not waste your money here 0 
we were promptly greeted and seated 1 
say bye bye to your tip lady 0 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
her role was played well 1 
in addition to having one of the most lovely songs ever written french cancan also boasts one of the cutest leading ladies ever to grace the screen 1 
we watched our waiter pay a lot more attention to other tables and ignore us 0 
great sound and service 1 
i was deeply impressed with the character he played 1 
then the film just dropped the ball 0 
uncomfortable in the ear dont use with lg vx9900 env 0 
but what really made it unwatchable was the direction 0 
the characters are interesting even if a bit predictable 1 
it will drive you barking mad 0 
but its just not funny 0 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
at first glance it is a lovely bakery cafe nice ambiance clean friendly staff 1 
i wont spoil it but the ending in pretty amazing 1 
i was so insulted 0 
unfortunately inexperience of direction meant that scene after scene passed with little in the way of dramatic tension or conflict 0 
after charging overnight these batteries work great 1 
the waitress and manager are so friendly 1 
just dont know why they were so slow 0 
the incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film 1 
really ugly 0 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
this greedy corporation will never see another dime from me 0 
this film tries to be a serious and sophisticated thrillerhorror flick and it fails miserably 0 
there still are good actors around 1 
i especially liked the noncliche choices with the parents in other movies i could predict the dialog verbatim but the writing in this movie made better selections 1 
i had absolutely no problem with this headset linking to my 8530 blackberry curve 1 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
treo and tmobile refused to replace it again and forced me to buy another phone without any kind of upgrade discount 0 
highly unprofessional and rude to a loyal patron 0 
this item is fantastic and works perfectly 1 
i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
anyway the plot flowed smoothly and the malebonding scenes were a hoot 1 
linked to my phone without effort 1 
i have always used corded headsets and the freedom from the wireless is very helpful 1 
after charging overnight these batteries work great 1 
very windresistant 1 
an hour and a half i wish i could bring back 0 
im a big fan of this series mostly due to anne rices style sensitivities and treatments 1 
down the drain because of a weak snap 0 
ive dropped my phone more times than i can say even on concrete and my phone is still great knock on wood 1 
i would avoid this place if you are staying in the mirage 0 
im in az all the time and now have my new spot 1 
makes it easier to keep up with my bluetooth when im not wearing it 0 
the instructions didnt explain that a microphone jack could be used 0 
the fried rice was dry as well 0 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
the sound quality is good and functionality is awesome 1 
there is no plot or storyline 0 
feelings thoughtsgabriels discomfort during the danceall these intangibles leap to life and come within the viewers grasp in hustons portrayal 1 
lucy bell is so much higher than this crap and for her to sink this low is quite depressing 0 
the result is a powerhouse achievement made more timely now perhaps because of our cultures disturbing fascination with celebrity and its distorted interpretations of fame 1 
it is shameful 0 
conclusion very filling meals 1 
this movie suffered because of the writing it needed more suspense 0 
food was really good and i got full petty fast 1 
you cant relate with them hell you barely can understand them 0 
it didnt make me scared horrified or make me sympathetic towards the characters it was simply annoying 0 
the sangria was about half of a glass wine full and was 12 ridiculous 0 
initially the local sites in the film which was filmed here in buffalo intrigued me 1 
it was so cool 1 
no plot whatsoever 0 
awesome service and food 1 
this is definitely one of the better documentaries i have seen looking at family relationships and marriage 1 
highly recommended a 1 
it was a long time that i didnt see a so charismatic actor on screen 1 
the selection on the menu was great and so were the prices 1 
i am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this 1 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
waited 2 hours never got either of our pizzas as many other around us who came in later did 0 
this was one of the worst films i have ever seen 0 
echo problemvery unsatisfactory 0 
i vomited in the bathroom mid lunch 0 
terrible my car will not accept this cassette 0 
all the pretty pictures in the world cannot make up for a piece of work that is flawed at the core 0 
definitely not worth the 3 i paid 0 
very bad performance plays angela bennett a computer expert who is at home all the time 0 
very comfortable 1 
this place is awesome if you want something light and healthy during the summer 1 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
we ordered some old classics and some new dishes after going there a few times and were sorely disappointed with everything 0 
i will not return 0 
i believe that pitch black was done well 1 
i want to first say our server was great and we had perfect service 1 
the owners are super friendly and the staff is courteous 1 
they have a plethora of salads and sandwiches and everything ive tried gets my seal of approval 1 
the cashier was friendly and even brought the food out to me 1 
the use of slowmotion needlessly repeats itself throughout the movie but is well backed up by bad acting and bad is a kind word here no continuity scenes that are thrown in for no reason whatsoever vehicles that looked like they were made from a corn flakes box and a directorial style that bordered on stupidity 0 
im not eating here 0 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
the food was very good 1 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
i paid the bill but did not tip because i felt the server did a terrible job 0 
probably never coming back and wouldnt recommend it 0 
i thought errol flynn was brilliant as custer and has since become my favourite actor 1 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
it quit working after id used it for about 18 months so i just purchased another one because this is the best headset ive ever owned 1 
the plot doesnt hang together at all and the acting is absolutely appalling 0 
what possesed me to get this junk i have no idea 0 
both great 1 
it looks very nice 1 
it is easy to turn on and off when you are in the car and the volume controls are quite accessable 1 
simple lightweight and great fit 1 
ryans bar is definitely one edinburgh establishment i wont be revisiting 0 
the croutons also taste homemade which is an extra plus 1 
they really want to make your experience a good one 1 
not good for the money 0 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
there is so much good food in vegas that i feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to rice and company 0 
everything about it is just bad 0 
they could serve it with just the vinaigrette and it may make for a better overall dish but it was still very good 1 
im super pissd 0 
yes this film does require a rather significant amount of puzzlesolving but the pieces fit together to create a beautiful picture 1 
of all the dishes the salmon was the best but all were great 1 
does not fit 0 
the design might be ergonomic in theory but i could not stand having these in my ear 0 
theres also enough hypocrisy in this film to make me vomit 0 
but kevin spacey is an excellent verbal tsunami as buddy ackerman  and totally believable because he is a great actor 1 
i love my 350 headset my jabra350 bluetooth headset is great the reception is very good and the ear piece is a comfortable fit 1 
the sound quality is excellent as well 1 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
its a gloriously fun fast paced and fairly accurate portrayal of the night of a raver 1 
but now that it is out of warranty the same problems reoccurebottom line put your money somewhere else cingular will not support it 0 
this was reflected not only in the cast but also in the belowpar script which borrowed much from the earlier classic 0 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
1010 1 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
i found this move beautiful enjoyable and uplifting 1 
freezes frequently4 0 
not good for the money 0 
if you love authentic mexican food and want a whole bunch of interesting yet delicious meats to choose from you need to try this place 1 
terrible management 0 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
the only place good for this film is in the garbage 0 
rating 1 out of 10 0 
save your money ive had this item for 11 months now 0 
a piece of junk that broke after being on my phone for 2 days 0 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
nice ambiance 1 
the igo chargers and tips are really great 1 
black water is a thriller that manages to completely transcend its limitations its an indie flick by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience 1 
putting the race card aside lets look at the major flaw in the film they destroy latifas character 0 
pretty piece of junk 0 
very very disappointed ordered the 35 big bay plater 0 
to sum the film up breeders is a terrible cheaply made horror movie that should be avoided like the ebola virus 0 
food was average at best 0 
i went on motorolas website and followed all directions but could not get it to pair again 0 
the battery is completely useless to me 0 
this is actually a very smart movie 1 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
food was really boring 0 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
there was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth but it didnt really work into the rest of the plot 0 
great time family dinner on a sunday night 1 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
now you know why i gave it a 10 1 
pricing is a bit of a concern at mellow mushroom 0 
i have bought this nokia cell phone a few weeks ago and it was a nightmare 0 
i live in the neighborhood so i am disappointed i wont be back here because it is a convenient location 0 
the croutons also taste homemade which is an extra plus 1 
the acting was bad 0 
the han nan chicken was also very tasty 1 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
its also great to see that renowned silent screenwriter frances marion hasnt missed a step going from silent to sound 1 
i will come back here every time im in vegas 1 
worthless product 0 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
mediocre food 0
