they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
the only thing i did like was the prime rib and dessert section 1 
tom wilkinson broke my heart at the end and everyone elses judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike 1 
what a mistake that was 0 
my husband said she was very rude did not even apologize for the bad food or anything 0 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
but the actingeven that of such professionals as drago and debbie rochonwas terrible the directing worse perhaps contributory to the former the dialog chimplike and the camera work barely tolerable 0 
if you do go see this movie bring a pillow or a girlfriendboyfriend to keep you occupied through out 0 
we had fantastic service and were pleased by the atmosphere 1 
i am not a filmmaker nor am i a director but i would hide my head in the sand if id spent whatever amount of money and time on this movie 0 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
the acting from all involved and that includes those like shatner and nimoy is bad and washed out and making them seem as old as they look in real life the special effects are tacky like when spock has to rescue kirk on a jet pack when he falls down from a mountain 0 
being a 90s child i truly enjoyed this show and i can proudly say that i enjoyed it big time and even more than the classical wb cartoons 1 
not much flavor to them and very poorly constructed 0 
this movie contained an allstar cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i havent seen before 1 
damn good steak 1 
they could serve it with just the vinaigrette and it may make for a better overall dish but it was still very good 1 
the microphone also works well but according to people i have called it applifies everything 1 
also were served hot bread and butter and home made potato chips with bacon bits on topvery original and very good 1 
i was mortified 0 
the camera although rated at an impressive 13 megapixels renders images that fall well below expectations of such a relatively high resolution 0 
it was way over fried 0 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
an absolute must visit 1 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
worst customer service 0 
great time family dinner on a sunday night 1 
then as if i hadnt wasted enough of my life there they poured salt in the wound by drawing out the time it took to bring the check 0 
not to mention the combination of pears almonds and bacon is a big winner 1 
we waited for thirty minutes to be seated although there were 8 vacant tables and we were the only folks waiting 0 
the chicken dishes are ok the beef is like shoe leather 0 
i have always used corded headsets and the freedom from the wireless is very helpful 1 
there is a totally unnecessary trainroller coaster scene 0 
aside from its terrible lead this film has loads of other debits 0 
you wont regret it 1 
we are so glad we found this place 1 
crash is a depressing little nothing that provokes emotion but teaches you nothing if you already know racism and prejudice are bad things 0 
definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly will return next time im in vegas 1 
end of days is one of the worst bigbudget action movies ive ever seen 0 
the movie is not completely perfect but titta di girolamo will stay with you for a long time after the vision of the movie 1 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
the characters are interesting even if a bit predictable 1 
appears to actually outperform the original battery from china that came with my v325i 1 
service was fantastic 1 
loved itfriendly servers great food wonderful and imaginative menu 1 
this film highlights the fundamental flaws of the legal process that its not about discovering guilt or innocence but rather is about who presents better in court 1 
comfort for our whole family 1 
the writer gorman bechard undoubtedly did his homework because all references are industry and characterage appropriate 1 
its the one movie that never ceases to interest me simply because it keeps me alert as i try to attempt to decipher its meanings 1 
otherwise dont even waste your time on this 0 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
sucked most of the stuff does not work with my phone 0 
hard to judge whether these sides were good because we were grossed out by the melted styrofoam and didnt want to eat it for fear of getting sick 0 
has been working great 1 
service is friendly and inviting 1 
overall i like this place a lot 1 
food is way overpriced and portions are fucking small 0 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
well packaged arrived on time and works as intended 1 
good item low price 1 
the camera on the phone may be used as a dustpan when indoors id rather be using a disposable then this 0 
i advise everyone do not be fooled 0 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
kieslowski never ceases to amaze me 1 
my fiancé and i came in the middle of the day and we were greeted and seated right away 1 
i gave it 5 stars then and im giving it 5 stars now 1 
all the characters in this film are tremendously well played 1 
rip off over charge shipping 0 
i particularly remember my senses being assaulted by strident cords of music that would blare out with very little warning and even less meaning 0 
what makes this story different are the terrific production values faultless photography composition and editing the terrific casting the underappreciated brian keith playing a bully teddy and vivid history 1 
have been going since 2007 and every meal has been awesome 1 
very disappointing 0 
then i watched it again two sundays ago march 20th 2005 and i began to really enjoy it and this time i taped the entire thing 1 
what a disappointment 0 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
barney is definitely super de duper 1 
the plot such as it is is so derivative and predictable that the ending is like a mercy killing 0 
i wont say any more i dont like spoilers so i dont want to be one but i believe this film is worth your time 1 
and the chef was generous with his time even came around twice so we can take pictures with him 1 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
really bad 0 
good value great food great service 1 
when i received my pita it was huge it did have a lot of meat in it so thumbs up there 1 
fantastic service here 1 
iam very pleased with my purchase 1 
you need at least 3 mins to get to your phone book from the time you first turn on the phonebattery life is short 0 
today was my first taste of a buldogis gourmet hot dog and i have to tell you it was more than i ever thought possible 1 
it was attached to a gas station and that is rarely a good sign 0 
in the summer you can dine in a charming outdoor patio so very delightful 1 
the restaurant is very clean and has a family restaurant feel to it 1 
the aerial scenes were welldone 1 
this does not fit the palm tungsten e2 and it broke the first time i tried to plug it in 0 
try them in the airport to experience some tasty food and speedy friendly service 1 
the film is way too long 0 
highly unprofessional and rude to a loyal patron 0 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
logitech bluetooth headset is a 10 1 
highly recommended a 1 
i love this place 1 
worst martini ever 0 
this product is great it makes working a lot easier i can go to the copier while waiting on hold for something 1 
now this is a movie i really dislike 0 
in my house i was getting dropped coverage upstairs and no coverage in my basement 0 
i purchased this and within 2 days it was no longer working 0 
i just wanted to leave 0 
eew this location needs a complete overhaul 0 
this place is good 1 
this is a great restaurant at the mandalay bay 1 
the earpiece on this is too large or too heavyit keeps falling out of my ear 0 
ive had this for nearly 2 years and it has worked great for me 1 
i guess i liked the details of his dysfunctionhe was believable 1 
great earpiece 1 
i dont have to be an accountant to know im getting screwed 0 
it only recognizes the phone as its storage device 0 
terrible service 0 
bela lugosi was totally extraneous intoning odd lines 0 
now this dish was quite flavourful 1 
the only thing really worth watching was the scenery and the house because it is beautiful 1 
doesnt work at all i bougth it for my l7c and its not working 0 
the movie was very interesting from beginning to the end 1 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
the food is good 1 
i highly recommend this device to everyone 1 
but the actingeven that of such professionals as drago and debbie rochonwas terrible the directing worse perhaps contributory to the former the dialog chimplike and the camera work barely tolerable 0 
very good lunch spot 1 
does not fit 0 
its uncomfortable and the sound quality is quite poor compared with the phone razr or with my previous wired headset that plugged into an lg 0 
at first i thought i was grtting a good deal at 744 until i plugged it into my phone v3c razr 0 
we literally sat there for 20 minutes with no one asking to take our order 0 
they have been around for years and carries the highest quality of antiglare screen protector that i have found to date 1 
the story is beyond stupid 0 
very poor service 0 
this is one of the best italian thrillers of the early 70s 1 
i got the aluminum case for my new palm vx and it worked really wellit has protected my handheld perfectly so far 1 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
the worst piece of crap ever along with the verizon customer service 0 
the food was great as always compliments to the chef 1 
after trying many many handsfree gadgets this is the one that finally works well 1 
1010 1 
the cast of veteran actors are more than just a nostalgia trip 1 
nice ambiance 1 
my brother in law who works at the mall ate here same day and guess what he was sick all night too 0 
this is an excellent film 1 
excellent sound quality 1 
it was so funny 1 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
what on earth is irons doing in this film 0 
best tacos in town by far 1 
the service was a little slow considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace 0 
very nice and relaxing late night viewing 1 
clever and a real crowdpleaserthis film still ranks among mickeys best films even after 80 wonderful years 1 
the only good thing was that it fits comfortably on small ears 1 
the worst one of the series 0 
which has more depth and character than the man underneath it 0 
poor sound quality 0 
car charger as well as ac charger are included to make sure you never run out of juicehighy recommended 1 
he came running after us when he realized my husband had left his sunglasses on the table 1 
drinks took close to 30 minutes to come out at one point 0 
this allows the possibility of double booking for the same date and time after the first 0 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
food was below average 0 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
the pairing of the two devices was so easy it barely took a couple minutes before i started making calls with the voice dialing feature 1 
i use this product in a motor control center where there is a lot of high voltage humming from the equipment and it works great 1 
however the keypads are so tinny that i sometimes reach the wrong buttons 0 
if that bug never showed up i would have given a 4 for sure but on the other side of the wall where this bug was climbing was the kitchen 0 
nevertheless yet another wonderful film from the great masters stable 1 
great product and price 1 
not what i wanted 0 
the only thing i wasnt too crazy about was their guacamole as i dont like it puréed 0 
they made this case too small and is very difficult to install 0 
i dont know exactly what it is about this movie but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our familys memories 1 
much less than the jawbone i was going to replace it with 1 
however i recently watched the whole thing again on dvd and i was completely struck by how extremely stupid the storyline was how it contained holes inconsistencies and frankly a whole lot of crap and how horrid the dancing was 0 
the cashier had no care what so ever on what i had to say it still ended up being wayyy overpriced 0 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
easily none other cartoon made me laugh in a tender way before getting into dark sitcoms oriented for teenagers 1 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
however after finally watching this film i realized that not only had i had a closed mind to the brilliance it depicts i also found myself watching it over and over again 1 
which are small and not worth the price 0 
ive had no trouble accessing the internet downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions 1 
bad script bad direction and horrible acting make this one plain bad 0 
the reception is excellent 1 
mobile phone tools are a must have 1 
not sure who was more lost the flat characters or the audience nearly half of whom walked out 0 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
do not make the same mistake as me 0 
unfortunately the ability to actually know you are receiving a call is a rather important feature and this phone is pitiful in that respect 0 
there is no plot or storyline 0 
ive had this for nearly 2 years and it has worked great for me 1 
with great sound effects and impressive special effects i cant recommend this movie enough 1 
there was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters 0 
this is the first phone ive had that has been so cheaply made 0 
good quality 1 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
plus it was wellpaced and suited its relatively short run time 1 
there is no plot or storyline 0 
i have been to very few places to eat that under no circumstances would i ever return to and this tops the list 0 
everything from acting to cinematography was solid 1 
these were so good we ordered them twice 1 
ill give this film 10 out of 10 1 
mediocre food 0 
the headset fulfills my requirements so i am happy with my purchase 1 
so dont go there if you are looking for good food 0 
not much dialogue not much music the whole film was shot as elaborately and aesthetically like a sculpture 1 
waste of 13 bucks 0 
how can anyone in their right mind ask for anything more from a movie than this 1 
the entire audience applauded at the conclusion of the film 1 
all in all i can assure you ill be back 1 
there is nothing authentic about this place 0 
i rate this movie 910 1 
the scripting of the subtle comedy is unmatched by any movie in recent years 1 
although i very much liked the look and sound of this place the actual experience was a bit disappointing 0 
im very disappointed with my decision 0 
treo and tmobile refused to replace it again and forced me to buy another phone without any kind of upgrade discount 0 
these products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet 0 
best tater tots in the southwest 1 
the classic maine lobster roll was fantastic 1 
terrible my car will not accept this cassette 0 
terrible my car will not accept this cassette 0 
the first time i ever came here i had an amazing experience i still tell people how awesome the duck was 1 
it showed exactly how the government and the scientist argued for humanity and the reasons of the gadget 1 
im a bit disappointed 0 
otherwise dont even waste your time on this 0 
we loved the place 1 
new battery works great in phone 1 
it was pretty gross 0 
too bad cause i know its family owned i really wanted to like this place 0 
i am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this 1 
highly unprofessional and rude to a loyal patron 0 
what a great double cheeseburger 1 
i wont spoil it but the ending in pretty amazing 1 
yeah the movie pretty much sucked 0 
is it possible for a movie to get any worse than this 0 
jawbone era is awesome too 1 
i got home to see the driest damn wings ever 0 
all in all im quite satisfied with this purchase 1 
the chains which im no fan of beat this place easily 0 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
treo and tmobile refused to replace it again and forced me to buy another phone without any kind of upgrade discount 0 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
beautiful styling though 1 
i guess i should have known that this place would suck because it is inside of the excalibur but i didnt use my common sense 0 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
for sushi on the strip this is the place to go 1 
disappointed 0 
bluetooth range is good a few days ago i left my phone in the trunk got a call and carried the conversation without a hitch 1 
not tasty and the texture was just nasty 0 
funny clever hip just like prays previous film hype 1 
total letdown i would much rather just go to the camelback flower shop and cartel coffee 0 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
their regular toasted bread was equally satisfying with the occasional pats of butter mmmm 1 
everything was gross 0 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
prosgood camera very nice pictures also has cool styles like black and white and more 1 
im not sure how long we stood there but it was long enough for me to begin to feel awkwardly out of place 0 
we were promptly greeted and seated 1 
the fact is this film is a wonderful heartwarming tale about two people chasing their dreams 1 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
special mention should be made of the superb music score and sound effects which are an integral element in helping to make this such a memorable and enjoyable cartoon 1 
overall i am psyched to have a phone which has all my appointments and contacts in and gets great reception 1 
clever and a real crowdpleaserthis film still ranks among mickeys best films even after 80 wonderful years 1 
i would recommend it 1 
considering the relations off screen between taylor and stanwyck it was surprising how little chemistry there was on screen between the two of them 0 
i can assure you that you wont be disappointed 1 
every element of this story was so over the top excessively phony and contrived that it was painful to sit through 0 
the burger had absolutely no flavor the meat itself was totally bland the burger was overcooked and there was no charcoal flavor 0 
motorola finally got the voice quality of a bluetooth headset right 1 
the football scenes at the end were perplexing 0 
the best place to go for a tasty bowl of pho 1 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
my ribeye steak was cooked perfectly and had great mesquite flavor 1 
never been to hard rock casino before will never ever step forward in it again 0 
you cant beat that 1 
the budget was evidently very limited 0 
seafood was limited to boiled shrimp and crab legs but the crab legs definitely did not taste fresh 0 
10 out of 10 for both the movie and trilogy 1 
the server was very negligent of our needs and made us feel very unwelcome i would not suggest this place 0 
also were served hot bread and butter and home made potato chips with bacon bits on topvery original and very good 1 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
perfect for the ps3 1 
judith light is one of my favorite actresses and i think she does a superb job in this film 1 
big disappointment with calendar sync 0 
the greek dressing was very creamy and flavorful 1 
i thoroughly enjoyed it when christopher eccleston took control of the tardis and the continuation of the series 1 
fantastic service here 1 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
i enjoyed reading this book to my children when they were little 1 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
very disappointed in accessoryone 0 
these products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet 0 
im not eating here 0 
ive only had my bluetooth for a few weeks but i really like it 1 
i felt as though her going to ireland did absolutely nothing whatsoever 0 
did not like at all 0 
though the wind and the lion is told largely through the eyes of the son every member of the family can identify with one of the characters whether it be sean connerys noble brigand candace bergens feisty heroine john hustons wily john hay or steve kanalys spiffy radiant ruthless cando lieutenant roosevelts big stick 1 
reception is terrible and full of static 0 
i recently had problems where i could not stay connected for more than 10 minutes before being disconnected 0 
waitress was sweet and funny 1 
i cannot believe that the actors agreed to do this film 0 
but then they came back cold 0 
the food is about on par with dennys which is to say not good at all 0 
love this phone 1 
whatever prompted such a documentary is beyond me 0 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
razr battery good buy 1 
its really easy 1 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
see both films if you can 1 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
crostini that came with the salad was stale 0 
there still are good actors around 1 
hitchcock is a great director 1 
itll be a regular stop on my trips to phoenix 1 
it kept getting worse and worse so now im officially done 0 
i paid too much 0 
i like the fact that it rests lightly against your ear rather than inside 1 
we had 7 at our table and the service was pretty fast 1 
i wear it everyday and it holds up very well 1 
waited and waited and waited 0 
how this piece of trash was ever released is beyond me the acting the story the characters the supposedly special effects etcits all wrong 0 
i got home to see the driest damn wings ever 0 
we got the food and apparently they have never heard of salt and the batter on the fish was chewy 0 
the selection on the menu was great and so were the prices 1 
but now that it is out of warranty the same problems reoccurebottom line put your money somewhere else cingular will not support it 0 
we had a group of 70 when we claimed we would only have 40 and they handled us beautifully 1 
the results well are a shame 0 
it is an hour and half waste of time following a bunch of very pretty high schoolers whine and cry about life 0 
up there with the best of melville 1 
this movie suffered because of the writing it needed more suspense 0 
the chains which im no fan of beat this place easily 0 
the dialogue is composed of things that make little sense 0 
very good stuff for the price 1 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
it seems completely secure both holding on to my belt and keeping the iphone inside 1 
definitely worth checking out 1 
after a year the battery went completely dead on my headset 0 
the sides are delish mixed mushrooms yukon gold puree white corn beateous 1 
about ten minutes into this film i started having second thoughts 0 
this place is pretty good nice little vibe in the restaurant 1 
great food and great service in a clean and friendly setting 1 
the greek dressing was very creamy and flavorful 1 
very windresistant 1 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
an hour and a half i wish i could bring back 0 
this really is how vegas fine dining used to be right down to the menus handed to the ladies that have no prices listed 1 
i would highly recommend this product 1 
due to this happening on every call i was forced to stop using this headset 0 
great it was new packaged nice works good no problems and it came in less time then i expected 1 
first of all there are enough racial stereotypes and racial jokes to offend everyone 0 
the volume switch rocketed out of the unit to a destination unknown 0 
very satisifed with that 1 
this is a beautiful phone 1 
the phone crashed completely and now i have to get it replaced 0 
truly awful 0 
utterly without merit on any level this is akin to torture 0 
this place is horrible and way overpriced 0 
i am also very happy with the price 1 
i love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it 1 
unfortunately any virtue in this films production work was lost on a regrettable script 0 
the chips and sals a here is amazing 1 
the chips that came out were dripping with grease and mostly not edible 0 
the guys all had steaks and our steak loving son who has had steak at the best and worst places said it was the best steak hes ever eaten 1 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
but the convoluted plot just didnt convince me and much of the film was watched with a weird questioning glance 0 
both do good jobs and are quite amusing 1 
would not go back 0 
this place is horrible and way overpriced 0 
another note about this phones appearance is that it really looks rather bland especially in the all black model 0 
and i just love the colors 1 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
the service was a little slow considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace 0 
this place deserves no stars 0 
echo problemvery unsatisfactory 0 
very pleased with this headset 1 
classywarm atmosphere fun and fresh appetizers succulent steaks baseball steak 1 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
i used bitpim a free program you can find on the internetto transfer data to the phonethe price of the cable was excellent 1 
what possesed me to get this junk i have no idea 0 
our server was very nice and even though he looked a little overwhelmed with all of our needs he stayed professional and friendly until the end 1 
nonlinear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well 1 
one of the most disappointing aspects is the lack of notable gore 0 
item does not match picture 0 
much better than the other ayce sushi place i went to in vegas 1 
its worth driving up from tucson 1 
when i placed my treo into the case not only was it not snug but there was a lot of extra room on the sides 0 
will order from them again 1 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
frozen pucks of disgust with some of the worst people behind the register 0 
does not fit 0 
does not work for listening to music with the cingular 8125 0 
nine out of ten for a truly lovely film 1 
i do love sushi but i found kabuki to be overpriced overhip and underservices 0 
i got this phone on reccomendation from a relative and im glad i did 1 
the guys all had steaks and our steak loving son who has had steak at the best and worst places said it was the best steak hes ever eaten 1 
i live in the neighborhood so i am disappointed i wont be back here because it is a convenient location 0 
this place is not quality sushi it is not a quality restaurant 0 
at any rate this film stinks its not funny and fulci should have stayed with giallo and supernatural zombie movies 0 
these are the central themes of the film and they are handled ineptly stereotypically and with no depth of imagination 0 
to be honest with you this is unbelievable nonsense and very foolish 0 
the story unfolds in 18th century jutland and the use of period music played on period instruments is just one more fine touch 1 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
regardless the film fails on most levels 0 
he was very impressed when going from the original battery to the extended battery 1 
but when i check voice mail at night the keypad backlight turns off a few seconds into the first message and then im lost 0 
yeah the movie pretty much sucked 0 
loved itfriendly servers great food wonderful and imaginative menu 1 
it ranks highly as a great noircrimedrama incredible performances by belmondo and lino ventura 1 
it ranks highly as a great noircrimedrama incredible performances by belmondo and lino ventura 1 
the sound quality is good and functionality is awesome 1 
i tried the cape cod ravoli chickenwith cranberrymmmm 1 
unfortunately it will not recharge my iphone 4s despite connecting it from multiple power sources imac external battery wall outlet etc 0 
overall i rate this movie a 10 out of a 110 scale 1 
does not work 0 
all the bread is made inhouse 1 
however the ear pads come off easily and after only one week i lost one 0 
the cashew cream sauce was bland and the vegetables were undercooked 0 
soyo technology sucks 0 
tasted like dirt 0 
dont go here 0 
i highly recommend this movie for anyone interested in art poetry theater politics or japanese history 1 
what a waste of money and time 0 
other than that the leather is nice and soft the fit is very tight the cut out for the face is a good shape 1 
integrated seamlessly with the motorola razr phone 1 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
1 long lasting battery you dont have to recharge it as frequentyly as some of the flip phones2 0 
and the accents are absolutely abysmal 0 
the vanilla ice cream was creamy and smooth while the profiterole choux pastry was fresh enough 1 
i totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is 1 
it was horrible 0 
not only did the software do a great job of this i could also make my own ringtones form my existing cds without an internet connection 1 
the bus boy on the other hand was so rude 0 
very good though 1 
nothing special 0 
the secondary plot line is incomprehensible and its relation to the primary plot line is mystifying 0 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
the concert sequences just sucked 0 
awsome device works great 1 
their research and development division obviously knows what theyre doing 1 
great sound and service 1 
the eargels channel the sound directly into your ear and seem to increase the sound volume and clarity 1 
so they performed 1 
but it wasnt until i watched this film that i realised how great he actually was 1 
and considering the two of us left there very full and happy for about 20 you just cant go wrong 1 
the plot was the same as pretty much every other cheap horror 0 
everything on the menu is terrific and we were also thrilled that they made amazing accommodations for our vegetarian daughter 1 
battery lasts only a few hours 0 
horrible had to switch 3 times 0 
but whatever it was that cost them so much it didnt translate to quality thats for sure 0 
the only thing i did like was the prime rib and dessert section 1 
none of it works just dont buy it 0 
the movie showed a lot of florida at its best made it look very appealing 1 
food is way overpriced and portions are fucking small 0 
i will not return 0 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
not to mention the combination of pears almonds and bacon is a big winner 1 
reasonably priced also 1 
is it possible for a movie to get any worse than this 0 
its not user friendly 0 
the cinematography is simply stunning to say the least and the fx are nothing if not stateoftheart 1 
awsome device works great 1 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
it sure does beat the nachos at the movies but i would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant 0 
so for our enjoyment we get to see them run around play games and be dangerous 1 
the cable looks so thin and flimsy it is scary 0 
its just lame 0 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
this place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver 0 
this place is disgusting 0 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
great pork sandwich 1 
the film has great actors a master director a significant themeat least a wouldbe significant theme undertone of fifties existential worldweariness aerial scenes that ought to have thrilled both senses and imagination and characters about which one might deeply care 1 
kind of flops around 0 
overall i am psyched to have a phone which has all my appointments and contacts in and gets great reception 1 
a very good film indeed about great and unconditional love 1 
razr battery good buy 1 
i hate writing bad reviews about films especially those in which i really like the star but this film is so bad i dont believe for one second that anyone could have been proud of it 0 
thats how id describe this painfully dreary timewaster of a film 0 
it sure does beat the nachos at the movies but i would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant 0 
the use of slowmotion needlessly repeats itself throughout the movie but is well backed up by bad acting and bad is a kind word here no continuity scenes that are thrown in for no reason whatsoever vehicles that looked like they were made from a corn flakes box and a directorial style that bordered on stupidity 0 
characters are onedimensional even the good guys and especially the bad guys 0 
this place is not quality sushi it is not a quality restaurant 0 
first the bathrooms at this location were dirty seat covers were not replenished just plain yucky 0 
none of the three sizes they sent with the headset would stay in my ears 0 
comfortable nice range good battery life 1 
we are sending it back 0 
this isnt a small family restaurant this is a fine dining establishment 1 
excellent hands free tool 1 
its too bad the food is so damn generic 0 
an amazing finale to possibly the best trilogy of all time 1 
i especially love the long battery life 1 
never heard of any of them except cole who was totally unbelievable in the part 0 
this was one of the worst films i have ever seen 0 
poor sound quality 0 
service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is vegas and located inside the crystals shopping mall by aria 1 
iam very pleased with my purchase 1 
the staff are great the ambiance is great 1 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
i wouldnt return 0 
it was a bit too sweet not really spicy enough and lacked flavor 0 
i love the camera its really pretty good quality 1 
what a great double cheeseburger 1 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
has been working great 1 
will never ever go back and have told many people what had happened 0 
if you do watch it however there are small consolations the actresses playing annes sisters each do a wonderful job with their roles 1 
only had this a month but its worked flawlessly so far 1 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
good product incredible value 1 
then scene where they debated whether or not to sack the trumpeter who falsely was accused for the murder is pure horror really stupid 0 
great place to eat reminds me of the little mom and pop shops in the san francisco bay area 1 
this is an extraordinary film 1 
this is hands down the best phone ive ever had 1 
the film gives meaning to the phrase never in the history of human conflict has so much been owed by so many to so few 1 
it definitely was not as good as my s11 1 
i immediately said i wanted to talk to the manager but i did not want to talk to the guy who was doing shots of fireball behind the bar 0 
i did not have any problem with this item and would order it again if needed 1 
about 30 minutes of footage is wasted to show mediocre elderly actors awkwardly babbling overwrought pseudosatanic gibberish corny enough to make a teen goth blush almost always in olde english and sometimes in latin that may or may not be made up words 0 
nevertheless yet another wonderful film from the great masters stable 1 
people couldnt hear me talk and i had to pull out the earphone and talk on the phone 0 
i tried talking real loud but shouting on the telephone gets old and i was still told it wasnt great 0 
this item is great installed it let it charged up overnite and it has been working good every since with no problems 1 
the shower area is outside so you can only rinse not take a full shower unless you dont mind being nude for everyone to see 0 
all the other cases ive tried normally fall apart after a few months but this one seems to be in for the long haul 1 
so badwellits just bad 0 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
food was great and so was the serivce 1 
very slow at seating even with reservation 0 
the classic maine lobster roll was fantastic 1 
battery life is also great 1 
it is shameful 0 
the movie is not completely perfect but titta di girolamo will stay with you for a long time after the vision of the movie 1 
works great 1 
this movie is possibly one of the most creative works of horror ever 1 
they do not last forever but is not overly expensive to replaceeasy to operate and the sound is much better than others i have tried 1 
it was a waste of my money 0 
mediocre food 0 
thank you for such great service 1 
waaaaaayyyyyyyyyy over rated is all i am saying 0 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
the kids are very cool too 1 
20th century foxs road house 1948 is not only quite a silly noir but is an implausible unmitigated bore of a movie 0 
then a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use 0 
the cocktails are all handmade and delicious 1 
it seems completely secure both holding on to my belt and keeping the iphone inside 1 
the handsfree part works fine but then the car tries to download the address book and the treo rebootsoverall i still rate this device high 1 
the service was terrible though 0 
i especially love the long battery life 1 
speaking of the music it is unbearably predictably and kitchy 0 
he is almost unbearable to watch on screen he has little to no charisma and terrible comedic timing 0 
will order from them again 1 
everything about this movie is stupid 0 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
its like a really sexy party in your mouth where youre outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party 1 
i definitly recommend 1 
service is also cute 1 
if that bug never showed up i would have given a 4 for sure but on the other side of the wall where this bug was climbing was the kitchen 0 
if there was ever a movie that needed wordofmouth to promote this is it 1 
the instruction manual is lacking 0 
greatno problems at all 1 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
however my girl was complain that some time the phone doesnt wake up like normal phone does 0 
one thing i hate is the mode set button at the side 0 
go to place for gyros 1 
i would highly recommend this product 1 
very funny 1 
loved itfriendly servers great food wonderful and imaginative menu 1 
arrived quickly and much less expensive than others being sold 1 
my first visit to hiro was a delight 1 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
sorry i will not be getting food from here anytime soon 0 
not good when wearing a hat or sunglasses 0 
brilliance indeed 1 
ill be looking for a new earpiece 0 
everything was perfect the night we were in 1 
and those baby owls were adorable 1 
but the service was beyond bad 0 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
the selection on the menu was great and so were the prices 1 
horrible phone 0 
absolutel junk 0 
nothing short of magnificent photographycinematography in this film 1 
iam very pleased with my purchase 1 
the film has great actors a master director a significant themeat least a wouldbe significant theme undertone of fifties existential worldweariness aerial scenes that ought to have thrilled both senses and imagination and characters about which one might deeply care 1 
left very frustrated 0 
if you plan to use this in a car forget about it 0 
wow loved this place 1 
the selection of food was not the best 0 
there is nothing authentic about this place 0 
great time family dinner on a sunday night 1 
the owner used to work at nobu so this place is really similar for half the price 1 
i dont know what the big deal is about this place but i wont be back yaall 0 
steve martin delivers a really funny performance of a middleaged upper class uptight white guy 1 
it was a waste of my money 0 
tonight i had the elk filet specialand it sucked 0 
well never go again 0 
does not fit 0 
the service here is fair at best 0 
this one wants to surf on the small wave of space movies in 1998 deep impact and armageddon and this one fails everywhere 0 
theres also enough hypocrisy in this film to make me vomit 0 
lucy bell is so much higher than this crap and for her to sink this low is quite depressing 0 
lifetime does not air it enough so if anyone knows what store sells it let me know because this is a musthave 1 
we recently witnessed her poor quality of management towards other guests as well 0 
soyo technology sucks 0 
the interplay between martin and emilio contains the same wonderful chemistry we saw in wall street with martin and charlie 1 
i recently tried caballeros and i have been back every week since 1 
damn good steak 1 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
the hockey scenes are terrible defensemen playing like theyre 5 years old goalies diving at shots that are 10 feet wide of the net etc 0 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
excellent hands free tool 1 
then as if i hadnt wasted enough of my life there they poured salt in the wound by drawing out the time it took to bring the check 0 
yes its shiny on front side and i love it 1 
all the other cases ive tried normally fall apart after a few months but this one seems to be in for the long haul 1 
easy to use 1 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
with great sound effects and impressive special effects i cant recommend this movie enough 1 
the reception is excellent 1 
great product for the price 1 
the sweet potato tots were good but the onion rings were perfection or as close as i have had 1 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
but i definitely would not eat here again 0 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
the servers are not pleasant to deal with and they dont always honor pizza hut coupons 0 
echo problemvery unsatisfactory 0 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
low quality 0 
this is one of the best italian thrillers of the early 70s 1 
im still infatuated with this phone 1 
prosgood camera very nice pictures also has cool styles like black and white and more 1 
about half way through this film i started to dislike it 0 
there are many continuity errors one other user commented on different cars in the garage joes glassesthe one that got to me the most was the fact joes facial hair configuration seemed to change from scene to scene 0 
great phone 1 
steer clear of this product and go with the genuine palm replacementr pens which come in a threepack 0 
all things considered a job very well done 1 
i rate this movie 910 1 
that just screams legit in my booksomethats also pretty rare here in vegas 1 
if she had not rolled the eyes we may have stayed not sure if we will go back and try it again 0 
worked great 1 
great audio 1 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1
