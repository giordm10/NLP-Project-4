great place to eat reminds me of the little mom and pop shops in the san francisco bay area 1 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
it is light has plenty of battery capacity and is very confortable to wear for somewhat extended periods of time 1 
so absolutley fantastic 1 
any grandmother can make a roasted chicken better than this one 0 
they have been around for years and carries the highest quality of antiglare screen protector that i have found to date 1 
bela lugosi was totally extraneous intoning odd lines 0 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
great phone 1 
the food was very good 1 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
the waitresses are very friendly 1 
great bluetooth 1 
i came over from verizon because cingulair has nicer cell phones the first thing i noticed was the really bad service 0 
join the club and get awesome offers via email 1 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
no complaints 1 
the movie in movie situations in the beginning and through the game that is played with her by the acting coach are fascinating 1 
the screen size is big key pad lit well enough and the camera quality is excellent for a camera phone 1 
i kept catching the cable on the seat and i had to pull the phone out to turn it on an off 0 
when im on this side of town this will definitely be a spot ill hit up again 1 
i tried the cape cod ravoli chickenwith cranberrymmmm 1 
this movie creates its own universe and is fascinating in every way 1 
if you see it you should probably just leave it on the shelf 0 
hated it 0 
very disappointing 0 
so bad 0 
i could not stand to even watch it for very long for fear of losing iq 0 
it ranks highly as a great noircrimedrama incredible performances by belmondo and lino ventura 1 
honeslty it didnt taste that fresh 0 
very slow at seating even with reservation 0 
about 30 minutes of footage is wasted to show mediocre elderly actors awkwardly babbling overwrought pseudosatanic gibberish corny enough to make a teen goth blush almost always in olde english and sometimes in latin that may or may not be made up words 0 
disapointing results 0 
we also ordered the spinach and avocado salad the ingredients were sad and the dressing literally had zero taste 0 
i could not recommend these more 0 
and the sound quality is great 1 
the staff are great the ambiance is great 1 
both do good jobs and are quite amusing 1 
i think this restaurant suffers from not trying hard enough 0 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in 0 
when my mom and i got home she immediately got sick and she only had a few bites of salad 0 
both the hot sour the egg flower soups were absolutely 5 stars 1 
saw the movie today and thought it was a good effort good messages for kids 1 
the acting sucked 0 
then scene where they debated whether or not to sack the trumpeter who falsely was accused for the murder is pure horror really stupid 0 
then as if i hadnt wasted enough of my life there they poured salt in the wound by drawing out the time it took to bring the check 0 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
waitress was good though 1 
i love this device 1 
its this pandering to the audience that sabotages most of his films 0 
the battery runs down quickly 0 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
it is practically useless and did not add any kind of boost to my reception after i bought it 0 
no plot whatsoever 0 
first of all there are enough racial stereotypes and racial jokes to offend everyone 0 
but it wasnt until i watched this film that i realised how great he actually was 1 
i do think tom hanks is a good actor 1 
my mother and brother had to do thiswhen i saw robert ryan portraying this type of man it was a very good imitation of this type of individual and i was impressed 1 
best ive found so far ive tried 2 other bluetooths and this one has the best quality for both me and the listener as well as ease of using 1 
if you do watch it however there are small consolations the actresses playing annes sisters each do a wonderful job with their roles 1 
really bad 0 
i dont like this nokia either 0 
the charger arrived within the promised timeframe but it did not work 0 
highly recommended for all ages although the younger set will probably not appreciate some of the more subtle references they will certainly appreciate one galley scene in particular 1 
battery is terrible 0 
dont waste your money 0 
this battery is an excellent bargain 1 
the worst experience ever 0 
is it possible for a movie to get any worse than this 0 
some may say this buffet is pricey but i think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot 1 
the directing seems too pretentious 0 
the kids are very cool too 1 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
internet is excrutiatingly slow 0 
once you get inside youll be impressed with the place 1 
i give wirefly 1 stari will contact cingularatt and inform them of this practice 0 
special thanks to dylan t for the recommendation on what to order all yummy for my tummy 1 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
each track commands sentiment actually contributing to the scenes and characters 1 
however paul schrader has indeed made a film about mishima that is both superb complex 1 
the turkey and roast beef were bland 0 
here in the wind and the lion we see a wonderful rendering of americas own imperial age 1 
generally it just lacked imagination 0 
hard to judge whether these sides were good because we were grossed out by the melted styrofoam and didnt want to eat it for fear of getting sick 0 
i ordered albondigas soup which was just warm and tasted like tomato soup with frozen meatballs 0 
i hope this place sticks around 1 
last time buying from you 0 
great time family dinner on a sunday night 1 
this was utterly confusing at first which caused me to lose a couple of very very important contacts 0 
this is an extraordinary film 1 
i really wanted the plantronics 510 to be the right one but it has too many issues for methe good 0 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
i was not impressed by this product 0 
this is one of the better buffets that i have been to 1 
i probably wont be coming back here 0 
if the food isnt bad enough for you then enjoy dealing with the worlds worstannoying drunk people 0 
i seriously cannot believe that the owner has so many unexperienced employees that all are running around like chickens with their heads cut off 0 
it felt too light and tinny 0 
great steak great sides great wine amazing desserts 1 
we had 7 at our table and the service was pretty fast 1 
stay away from the q 0 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
the reception is excellent 1 
it is well made easy to access the phone and has a handy detachable belt clip 1 
my sashimi was poor quality being soggy and tasteless 0 
dont waste your time here 0 
the sides are delish mixed mushrooms yukon gold puree white corn beateous 1 
its an empty hollow shell of a movie 0 
the buffet at bellagio was far from what i anticipated 0 
made very sturdy 1 
how awful she is 0 
product is useless since it does not have enough charging current to charge the 2 cellphones i was planning to use it with 0 
feelings thoughtsgabriels discomfort during the danceall these intangibles leap to life and come within the viewers grasp in hustons portrayal 1 
this blueant supertooth handsfree phone speaker is awesome 1 
i dont like this nokia either 0 
so flavorful and has just the perfect amount of heat 1 
there is no plot here to keep you going in the first place 0 
terrible my car will not accept this cassette 0 
but despite these few flaws this case is of exceptional quality and well worth the additional costs of owning an official oem product 1 
very easy to use 1 
this is cool because most cases are just open there allowing the screen to get all scratched up 1 
my gyro was basically lettuce only 0 
every time he opened his mouth you expect to hear you see kids pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show 0 
aside from its terrible lead this film has loads of other debits 0 
highly recommend for any one who has a blue tooth phone 1 
i can assure you that you wont be disappointed 1 
i heart this place 1 
very very fun chef 1 
we thought youd have to venture further away to get good sushi but this place really hit the spot that night 1 
i believe every one should see this movie as i think few people outside of south africa understand its past and what is being attempted in the truth and reconciliation process 1 
the acting sucked 0 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
its a total package 1 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
i had the mac salad and it was pretty bland so i will not be getting that again 0 
the jamaican mojitos are delicious 1 
avoid at all cost 0 
i dont think i will be back for a very long time 0 
definitely worth checking out 1 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
this is one of the best italian thrillers of the early 70s 1 
what makes this story different are the terrific production values faultless photography composition and editing the terrific casting the underappreciated brian keith playing a bully teddy and vivid history 1 
none of the new ones have ever quite worked properly 0 
i really wanted the plantronics 510 to be the right one but it has too many issues for methe good 0 
this phone might well be the worst ive ever had in any brand 0 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
oh this is such a thing of beauty this restaurant 1 
i would not recommend this place 0 
at a time when it seems that film animation has been dominated by disneypixars cgi masterpieces it is both refreshing and comforting to know that miyazaki is still relying on traditional handdrawn animation to tell his charming and enchanting stories 1 
despite how hard i rate businesses its actually rare for me to give a 1 star 0 
each day of the week they have a different deal and its all so delicious 1 
his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic 1 
last time buying from you 0 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
i am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this 1 
the chicken dishes are ok the beef is like shoe leather 0 
their rotating beers on tap is also a highlight of this place 1 
i think this restaurant suffers from not trying hard enough 0 
crostini that came with the salad was stale 0 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
the battery runs down quickly 0 
i am far from a sushi connoisseur but i can definitely tell the difference between good food and bad food and this was certainly bad food 0 
a standout scene 1 
i swung in to give them a try but was deeply disappointed 0 
i wasted my little money with this earpiece 0 
cant get the software to work with my computer 0 
i had absolutely no problem with this headset linking to my 8530 blackberry curve 1 
definitely a turn off for me i doubt ill be back unless someone else is buying 0 
bad purchase 0 
not good enough for the price 0 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
end of days is one of the worst bigbudget action movies ive ever seen 0 
this is essentially a communications tool that does not communicate 0 
the characters are fleshed out surprisingly well particularly grimes and blake and all the actors deliver their sharply scripted lines with just the right amount of deadpan tongue in cheek to make the dialogue both hilarious and realistic 1 
service is perfect and the family atmosphere is nice to see 1 
again no plot at all 0 
very cheap plastic creaks like an old wooden floor 0 
definitely will come back here again 1 
it is just the sort of pap that is screened in the afternoon to punish the unemployed for not having jobs 0 
the food was very good 1 
my brother in law who works at the mall ate here same day and guess what he was sick all night too 0 
the ear buds only play music in one ear 0 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
i was very disappointed in the movie 0 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
does not fit 0 
it presents a idyllic yet serious portrayal of the ups and downs of the characters lives 1 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
yes i am simplifying things here for the sake of brevity for this really is at the core of the problems with this film it has too much going on without any real fulfilling explanation 0 
the service was great even the manager came and helped with our table 1 
iam very pleased with my purchase 1 
some great music and terrific scenery 1 
furthermore you cant even find hours of operation on the website 0 
i recommend this for everyone who loves film movies anythinga work of art 1 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
i found a six inch long piece of wire in my salsa 0 
its extremely slow and takes forever to do anything with it 0 
talk about great customer service of course we will be back 1 
im glad i found this product on amazon it is hard to find it wasnt high priced 1 
i didnt realize how wonderful the short really is until the last two scenes 1 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
my phone doesnt slide around my car now and the grip prevents my phone from slipping out of my hand 1 
we ordered the duck rare and it was pink and tender on the inside with a nice char on the outside 1 
the staff is great the food is delish and they have an incredible beer selection 1 
i have purchased these for both family and friends and all enjoy their clarity and ease of use 1 
ill even say it again  this is torture 0 
not only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic but it also managed to give away the entire movie and im not exaggerating every moment every plot point every joke is told in the trailer 0 
this place is amazing 1 
if only someone involved with it knew how to string together narrative 0 
the selection was probably the worst ive seen in vegasthere was none 0 
all i have to say is the food was amazing 1 
this if the first movie ive given a 10 to in years 1 
go and see it 1 
horrible 0 
i also didnt like the on button it felt like it would crack with use 0 
both films are terrible but to the credit of the 1986 version it was watchable 0 
the food was delicious our bartender was attentive and personable and we got a great deal 1 
drinks took close to 30 minutes to come out at one point 0 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
my gyro was basically lettuce only 0 
yet plantronincs continues to use the same flawed charger design 0 
the feel of the dining room was more college cooking course than high class dining and the service was slow at best 0 
there is nothing privileged about workingeating there 0 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
the instruction manual is lacking 0 
started watching this but didnt believe in any of the characters 0 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
great product and price 1 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
clever and a real crowdpleaserthis film still ranks among mickeys best films even after 80 wonderful years 1 
great time family dinner on a sunday night 1 
great place fo take out or eat in 1 
its a gloriously fun fast paced and fairly accurate portrayal of the night of a raver 1 
1 long lasting battery you dont have to recharge it as frequentyly as some of the flip phones2 0 
perhaps i caught them on an off night judging by the other reviews but im not inspired to go back 0 
the cinematography is simply stunning to say the least and the fx are nothing if not stateoftheart 1 
left very frustrated 0 
the chicken i got was definitely reheated and was only ok the wedges were cold and soggy 0 
a piece of junk that broke after being on my phone for 2 days 0 
the greek dressing was very creamy and flavorful 1 
i swung in to give them a try but was deeply disappointed 0 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
design flaw 0 
the acting is terrible and the writing is worse 0 
well never go again 0 
no plot whatsoever 0 
couldnt use the unit with sunglasses not good in texas 0 
it is a true classic 1 
the movie seemed a little slow at first 0 
how can you call yourself a steakhouse if you cant properly cook a steak i dont understand 0 
the burrittos blah 0 
sauce was tasteless 0 
needless to say we will never be back here again 0 
great price too 1 
the directing seems too pretentious 0 
integrated seamlessly with the motorola razr phone 1 
the potato chip order was sad i could probably count how many chips were in that box and it was probably around 12 0 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
on the up side their cafe serves really good food 1 
the pizza tasted old super chewy in not a good way 0 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
the macarons here are insanely good 1 
i recommend this for everyone who loves film movies anythinga work of art 1 
the ear buds only play music in one ear 0 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
we recently witnessed her poor quality of management towards other guests as well 0 
dont buy this product 0 
similarly the delivery man did not say a word of apology when our food was 45 minutes late 0 
the acting is fantastic the stories are seamlessly woven together and the dogs are splendid a must rent view or see 1 
works great when my cat attacked the phone he scratched the protective strip instead of destroying the screen 1 
cinematography noteworthy including fine views of barcelona and its famed gaudi towers 1 
i love this place 1 
the staff are also very friendly and efficient 1 
great bluetooth 1 
the script is a big flawed mess 0 
dont waste your money and time 0 
there is so much good food in vegas that i feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to rice and company 0 
kind of flops around 0 
great brunch spot 1 
not worth it 0 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
dont do it 0 
this was a different cut than the piece the other day but still wonderful and tender s well as well flavored 1 
terrible my car will not accept this cassette 0 
you truly take this journey through the eyes and soul of a child 1 
if there is a wind it is completely useless 0 
the chains which im no fan of beat this place easily 0 
first of all it doesnt wear well 0 
never going back 0 
server did a great job handling our large rowdy table 1 
there is however some pretty good acting at least for this type of film 1 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
i cannot make calls at certain places 0 
i was amazed at the quick arrival of the two original lg cell phone batteries and and at a fraction of the price 1 
i own 2 of these cases and would order another 1 
ive had better not only from dedicated boba tea spots but even from jenni pho 0 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
those phones are working just fine now 1 
i got the car charger and not even after a week the charger was brokeni went to plug it in and it started smoking 0 
this was such an awesome movie that i bought it off of ebay 1 
i purcashed this for the car charger and it does not work 0 
this place is not worth your time let alone vegas 0 
the real killer is the volume and of course it breaking 0 
though the wind and the lion is told largely through the eyes of the son every member of the family can identify with one of the characters whether it be sean connerys noble brigand candace bergens feisty heroine john hustons wily john hay or steve kanalys spiffy radiant ruthless cando lieutenant roosevelts big stick 1 
saggy floppy piece of junk 0 
cant get the software to work with my computer 0 
this place lacked style 0 
i find wasting food to be despicable but this just wasnt food 0 
i really dont see how anyone could enjoy this movie 0 
i dont think there are any redeeming qualities in this remake 0 
if the food isnt bad enough for you then enjoy dealing with the worlds worstannoying drunk people 0 
buttons are too small 0 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
none of it works just dont buy it 0 
i am pairing this with my iphone and i could not be happier with it so far 1 
i know he was a contract player with little control over his scripts but the acting was as bad as the script 0 
this scene is very strong and unpleasant 0 
not good by any stretch of the imagination 0 
i am far from a sushi connoisseur but i can definitely tell the difference between good food and bad food and this was certainly bad food 0 
there was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters 0 
really good product 1 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
here in the wind and the lion we see a wonderful rendering of americas own imperial age 1 
the presentation of the food was awful 0 
excellent sound battery life and inconspicuous to boot 1 
the volume switch rocketed out of the unit to a destination unknown 0 
later i found myself lost in the power of the film 1 
but in any case the best part is you can download these pictures to your laptop using ir or even send pictures from your laptop to the phone 1 
i started this review with two stars but im editing it to give it only one 0 
wow loved this place 1 
the cashier had no care what so ever on what i had to say it still ended up being wayyy overpriced 0 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
dont go here 0 
its so stupid to have to keep buying new chargers car chargers cradles headphones and car kits every time a new phone comes out 0 
very cheap plastic creaks like an old wooden floor 0 
it is wonderful and inspiring to watch and i hope that it gets released again on to video or dvd 1 
a film not easily forgotten 1 
there was no chemistry between ben affleck and sandra bullock in this film and i couldnt understand why he would consider even leaving his wifetobe for this chick that he supposedly was knocked out by 0 
its a total package 1 
this phone works great 1 
hot dishes are not hot cold dishes are close to room tempi watched staff prepare food with bare hands no gloveseverything is deep fried in oil 0 
an awesome new look for fall 2000 1 
this particular model would not work with my motorola q smartphone 0 
everything was fresh and delicious 1 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
it is light has plenty of battery capacity and is very confortable to wear for somewhat extended periods of time 1 
i love the ringtones because they are so upbeat 1 
regardless the film fails on most levels 0 
this is truly an art movieit actually has a lot of art in it 1 
give this one a look 1 
im glad the film didnt go for the most obvious choice as a lesser film certainly would have 1 
there is really nothing for me at postinos hope your experience is better 0 
very much disappointed with this company 0 
it definitely was not as good as my s11 1 
not good for the money 0 
well im satisfied 1 
this may be the only bad film he ever made 0 
arrived quickly and much less expensive than others being sold 1 
i received my headset in good time and was happy with it 1 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
my salad had a bland vinegrette on the baby greens and hearts of palm 0 
integrated seamlessly with the motorola razr phone 1 
used and dirty 0 
we arent ones to make a scene at restaurants but i just dont get itdefinitely lost the love after this one 0 
thanks again to amazon for having the things i need for a good price 1 
if you dont find it too bad as again the unit comes with one earpad onlyi would not recommend this to anyone 0 
i got this phone on reccomendation from a relative and im glad i did 1 
another thing i didnt really like is when a character got punched in the face a gallon of blood would spew forth soon after 0 
always a great time at dos gringos 1 
from what my dinner companions told meeverything was very fresh with nice texture and taste 1 
poor product 0 
this pda rocks 1 
very good though 1 
defective crap 0 
product was excellent and works better than the verizon one and boy was it cheaper 1 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
too bad you have to pay up to a month for the service 0 
kris kristoffersen is good in this movie and really makes a difference 1 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
about ten minutes into this film i started having second thoughts 0 
the sound quality is good and functionality is awesome 1 
the aerial scenes were welldone 1 
this if the first movie ive given a 10 to in years 1 
after 3 months screen just went black all of a sudden 0 
battery has no life 0 
a pretty good product 1 
this place is not quality sushi it is not a quality restaurant 0 
sound quality on both end is excellent i use headset to call my wife and ask my wife to use headset to call me 2 1 
i gave it a 10 1 
i bought this phone as a replacement for my startac and have regretted it since 0 
this is a bad film with bad writing and good actorsan ugly cartoon crafted by paul haggis for people who cant handle anything but the bold strokes in storytellinga picture painted with crayons 0 
the bt headset was such a disapoinment 0 
i also didnt like the on button it felt like it would crack with use 0 
so they performed 1 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
needless to say we will never be back here again 0 
a piece of junk that broke after being on my phone for 2 days 0 
dont miss it 1 
it works 1 
very bad experience 0 
but it wasnt until i watched this film that i realised how great he actually was 1 
no complaints 1 
from what my dinner companions told meeverything was very fresh with nice texture and taste 1 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
this is definitely one of the better documentaries i have seen looking at family relationships and marriage 1 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
we definately enjoyed ourselves 1 
none of the three sizes they sent with the headset would stay in my ears 0 
if you see it you should probably just leave it on the shelf 0 
i could care less the interior is just beautiful 1 
cant say enough good things about this place 1 
the sound is clear and the people i talk to on it are amazed at the quality too 1 
we had 7 at our table and the service was pretty fast 1 
i advise you to look out for it 1 
battery lasts only a few hours 0 
omg i felt like i had never eaten thai food until this dish 1 
and then tragedy struck 0 
overall i would recommend this phone over the new walkman 1 
a good quality bargain i bought this after i bought a cheapy from big lots that sounded awful and people on the other end couldnt hear me 1 
it quit working after id used it for about 18 months so i just purchased another one because this is the best headset ive ever owned 1 
battery is terrible 0 
the real killer is the volume and of course it breaking 0 
your staff spends more time talking to themselves than me 0 
the seasonal fruit was fresh white peach puree 1 
waitress was sweet and funny 1 
when i opened the sandwich i was impressed but not in a good way 0 
i love this phone it is very handy and has a lot of features 1 
everyone is very attentive providing excellent customer service 1 
come hungry leave happy and stuffed 1 
but in any case the best part is you can download these pictures to your laptop using ir or even send pictures from your laptop to the phone 1 
plug was the wrong size 0 
whatever prompted such a documentary is beyond me 0 
however after seeing the short again after about 25 years i was amazed at how timeless the film actually is 1 
sweetest phone 1 
he was very impressed when going from the original battery to the extended battery 1 
so i basically threw my money out the window for nothing 0 
how this piece of trash was ever released is beyond me the acting the story the characters the supposedly special effects etcits all wrong 0 
worst ever 0 
if you do go see this movie bring a pillow or a girlfriendboyfriend to keep you occupied through out 0 
the scenes with the ohsomature neighbourgirl are a misplace 0 
i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
recommend with confidence 1 
things happen characters personalities change plot twists occur for no real reason other than that script calls for it 0 
but it is great i would really recommend it 1 
sounds good reasonably priced and effective its that simple 1 
before i go in to why i gave a 1 star rating please know that this was my third time eating at bachi burger before writing a review 0 
theres barely a boring moment in the film and there are plenty of humorous parts 1 
that was nice 1 
the performances are real and gripping the crocdodile is extremely well done indeed if the black water website is to be believed thats because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous 1 
the potatoes were great and so was the biscuit 1 
the headset fulfills my requirements so i am happy with my purchase 1 
cant get the software to work with my computer 0 
its a sad movie but very good 1 
that one didnt work either 0 
and the rest of it just sits there being awful with soldiers singing songs about the masculinity they pledge themselves to hairsplitting about purity the admiration of swords etc 0 
couldnt use the unit with sunglasses not good in texas 0 
this is infuriating 0 
nothing at all to recommend 0 
it makes very strange ticking noises before it ends the call 0 
its a campy sort of film thats a joy to watch 1 
i felt as though her going to ireland did absolutely nothing whatsoever 0 
it sure does beat the nachos at the movies but i would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant 0 
good product incredible value 1 
with great sound effects and impressive special effects i cant recommend this movie enough 1 
basically the service was very bad 0 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
in conclusion i will not bother with this movie because a volcano in los angeles is nothing but nonsense 0 
good price 1 
never been to hard rock casino before will never ever step forward in it again 0 
i know he was a contract player with little control over his scripts but the acting was as bad as the script 0 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
we had so much to say about the place before we walked in that he expected it to be amazing but was quickly disappointed 0 
the calls drop the phone comes on and off at will the screen goes black and the worst of all it stops ringing intermittently 0 
five star plus plus 1 
simply beautiful 1 
battery life is also great 1 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
bad day or not i have a very low tolerance for rude customer service people it is your job to be nice and polite wash dishes otherwise 0 
this company charge me a restocking fee and still not given me my refund back 0 
food was average at best 0 
i found a six inch long piece of wire in my salsa 0 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
it is very comfortable to wear as well which is probably the most important aspect about using a case 1 
being a 90s child i truly enjoyed this show and i can proudly say that i enjoyed it big time and even more than the classical wb cartoons 1 
despite how hard i rate businesses its actually rare for me to give a 1 star 0 
sam shepards portrayal of a gung ho marine was sobering 1 
it showed exactly how the government and the scientist argued for humanity and the reasons of the gadget 1 
really awful 0 
good case excellent value 1 
terrible my car will not accept this cassette 0 
what the hell kind of crap is that 0 
it was pretty gross 0 
interesting decor 1 
i highly recommend these and encourage people to give them a try 1 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
nice leather 1 
i gave it a 10 1 
the results well are a shame 0 
i gave it a 10 1 
its reception is very very poor 0 
i was seated immediately 1 
owners are really great people 1 
i got the aluminum case for my new palm vx and it worked really wellit has protected my handheld perfectly so far 1 
the only thing that i think could improve is the sound leaks out from the headset 0 
the nachos are a must have 1 
and dont even get me started on the jerky camerawork 0 
excellent dualpurpose headset 1 
for that its worth checking out 1 
best ive found so far ive tried 2 other bluetooths and this one has the best quality for both me and the listener as well as ease of using 1 
yeah the movie pretty much sucked 0 
couldnt use the unit with sunglasses not good in texas 0 
its pretty easy 1 
theres barely a boring moment in the film and there are plenty of humorous parts 1 
doesnt hold charge 0 
the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach 0 
i want my money back 0 
the tracfonewebsite is user friendly and makes it easy toactivate etc 1 
everything about this product is wrongfirst 0 
the jamaican mojitos are delicious 1 
we asked for the bill to leave without eating and they didnt bring that either 0 
and those baby owls were adorable 1 
just reading on the specs alone makes you say wow 1 
and the accents are absolutely abysmal 0 
it is a really good show to watch 1 
nargile i think you are great 1 
i might have gotten a defect but i would not risk buying it again because of the built quality alone 0 
it has all the features i want 1 
funny clever hip just like prays previous film hype 1 
it was pretty gross 0 
sprint charges for this service 0 
great phone 1 
this phone is pretty sturdy and ive never had any large problems with it 1 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
highly unrecommended 0 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
bad script bad direction and horrible acting make this one plain bad 0 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
it had some average acting from the main person and it was a low budget as you clearly can see 0 
excellent product for the price 1 
overall i wasnt very impressed with noca 0 
another thing i didnt really like is when a character got punched in the face a gallon of blood would spew forth soon after 0 
one nice thing was that they added gratuity on the bill since our party was larger than 6 or 8 and they didnt expect more tip than that 1 
generally it just lacked imagination 0 
im so sorry but i really cant recommend it to anyone 0 
after 3 months screen just went black all of a sudden 0 
we definately enjoyed ourselves 1 
i love my 350 headset my jabra350 bluetooth headset is great the reception is very good and the ear piece is a comfortable fit 1 
ordered a double cheeseburger got a single patty that was falling apart picture uploaded yeah still sucks 0 
recommend with confidence 1 
mark my words this is one of those cult films like evil dead 2 or phantasm that people will still be discovering and falling in love with 20 30 40 years down the line 1 
about ten minutes into this film i started having second thoughts 0 
the only suspense i was feeling was the frustration at just how retarded the girls were 0 
i received my supposedly new motorola 375 and apparently there was not a match between the phone and the charger 0 
bela lugosi was totally extraneous intoning odd lines 0 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
i wasted my little money with this earpiece 0 
despite how hard i rate businesses its actually rare for me to give a 1 star 0 
food quality has been horrible 0 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
not much flavor to them and very poorly constructed 0 
i would highly recommend this product 1 
well just if you keep thinking how bad it is 0 
what did bother me was the slow service 0 
this movie is bad 0 
i dont each much pasta but i love the homemade hand made pastas and thin pizzas here 1 
for that its worth checking out 1 
if you do watch it however there are small consolations the actresses playing annes sisters each do a wonderful job with their roles 1 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
appears to actually outperform the original battery from china that came with my v325i 1 
the phone is sturdy and waterproof 1 
either way it sucks 0 
both of the egg rolls were fantastic 1 
the scenery that the two daughters paint and photograph are beautiful 1 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
disappointed 0 
being a 90s child i truly enjoyed this show and i can proudly say that i enjoyed it big time and even more than the classical wb cartoons 1 
very disappointed 0 
i kept catching the cable on the seat and i had to pull the phone out to turn it on an off 0 
i ended up sliding it on the edge of my pants or back pockets instead 1 
not easy to watch 0 
horrible phone 0 
the real killer is the volume and of course it breaking 0 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
the menu is always changing food quality is going down service is extremely slow 0 
it showed exactly how the government and the scientist argued for humanity and the reasons of the gadget 1 
the writers were smack on and i think the best actors and actresses were a bonus to the showthese characters were so real 1 
the mic there is a joke and the volume is quite low 0 
after two i felt disgusting 0 
i promise they wont disappoint 1 
unfortunately the ability to actually know you are receiving a call is a rather important feature and this phone is pitiful in that respect 0 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
poor quality 0 
this second appearance of mickey mouse following the silent plane crazy earlier that year is probably his most famous filmmostly because it was so groundbreaking 1 
the volume switch rocketed out of the unit to a destination unknown 0 
there are the usual hitchcock logic flaws 0 
good servicecheck 1 
nice sound 1 
they were goldencrispy and delicious 1 
once you get inside youll be impressed with the place 1 
the flair bartenders are absolutely amazing 1 
if you want a real scare rent this one 1 
but when someone strives for greatness and poetry but delivers a muddled and often ridiculous story a bunch of disparate scenes pretentious dialogue then you get the worst kind of a movie that some other reviewer very accurately defined as pretentious crap 0 
problem is that the ear loops are made of weak material and break easily 0 
the film is way too long 0 
a great touch 1 
so i basically threw my money out the window for nothing 0 
this item is fantastic and works perfectly 1 
it is wonderful and inspiring to watch and i hope that it gets released again on to video or dvd 1 
during several different 2 minute calls i experienced 5 drops and it was in an area that had 5 bars 0 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
the only thing worse than taylors acting was stanwycks singing 0 
went in for happy hour great list of wines 1 
considering the relations off screen between taylor and stanwyck it was surprising how little chemistry there was on screen between the two of them 0 
the block was amazing 1 
highly recommended for all ages although the younger set will probably not appreciate some of the more subtle references they will certainly appreciate one galley scene in particular 1 
if you want a sandwich just go to any firehouse 1 
all i can do is whine on the internet so here it goesthe more i use the thing the less i like it 0 
the shipping time was also very quick 1 
this movie is terrible 0 
clever and a real crowdpleaserthis film still ranks among mickeys best films even after 80 wonderful years 1 
macbeth jason connery moved me to tears with his final monolog out brief candle outhe gave the sphere of moral decay and dark forces a human face which makes it the more interesting 1 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
the headsets are easy to use and everyone loves them 1 
people couldnt hear me talk and i had to pull out the earphone and talk on the phone 0 
performed awful muffled tinny incoming sound and severe echo for those on the other end of the call 0 
i gave it a 10 1 
kind of flops around 0 
in particular the relationship between the bakery assistant and the waitress just didnt work for me at all 0 
perfect for someone me who only likes beer ice cold or in this case even colder 1 
works well 1 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
all the bread is made inhouse 1 
the problem was the script 0 
the service here is fair at best 0 
clear skype calls long battery life long range 1 
i asked multiple times for the wine list and after some time of being ignored i went to the hostess and got one myself 0 
aside from its terrible lead this film has loads of other debits 0 
thanks good a movie like this was done and released 1 
long whiny and pointless 0 
razr battery good buy 1 
the ri style calamari was a joke 0
