the goat taco didnt skimp on the meat and wow what flavor 1 
i have to jiggle the plug to get it to line up right to get decent volume 0 
sound quality on both end is excellent i use headset to call my wife and ask my wife to use headset to call me 2 1 
the cashew cream sauce was bland and the vegetables were undercooked 0 
often the dialogue doesnt really follow from one line to another or fit the surroundings 0 
gets a signal when other verizon phones wont 1 
overall i was not impressed and would not go back 0 
with great sound effects and impressive special effects i cant recommend this movie enough 1 
i didnt want the clip going over the top of my ear causing discomfort 0 
small sleek impressive looking practical setup with ample storage in place 1 
i am going to have to be the first to negatively review this product 0 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
the holster that arrived did not match the photo in the ad 0 
definitely a turn off for me i doubt ill be back unless someone else is buying 0 
ryans bar is definitely one edinburgh establishment i wont be revisiting 0 
nonlinear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well 1 
there was no chemistry between ben affleck and sandra bullock in this film and i couldnt understand why he would consider even leaving his wifetobe for this chick that he supposedly was knocked out by 0 
no actress has been worse used that june allison in this movie 0 
left very frustrated 0 
the cashier had no care what so ever on what i had to say it still ended up being wayyy overpriced 0 
total waste of time 0 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
it was equally awful 0 
nice headset priced right 1 
i wasnt the least bit interested 0 
terrible service 0 
hell no will i go back 0 
i would recommend purchasing the jabra jx10 series 2 which works flawlessly with my moto q go figure 1 
i give wirefly 1 stari will contact cingularatt and inform them of this practice 0 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
it is worth the drive 1 
1 hour 54 minutes of sheer tedium melodrama and horrible acting a mess of a script and a sinking feeling of good lord what were they thinking 0 
the refried beans that came with my meal were dried out and crusty and the food was bland 0 
my sashimi was poor quality being soggy and tasteless 0 
they do not last forever but is not overly expensive to replaceeasy to operate and the sound is much better than others i have tried 1 
utter crap sound quality is terrible 0 
talk about great customer service of course we will be back 1 
the structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema 1 
the nokia ca42 usb cable did not work with my phone 0 
things happen characters personalities change plot twists occur for no real reason other than that script calls for it 0 
it was horrible 0 
i love their fries and their beans 1 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
frankly after cotton club and unfaithful it was kind of embarrassing to watch lane and gere in this film because it is bad 0 
things that went wrong they burned the saganaki 0 
this is a great deal 1 
see both films if you can 1 
it has kept up very well 1 
the potato chip order was sad i could probably count how many chips were in that box and it was probably around 12 0 
avoid this film at all costs 0 
i could care less the interior is just beautiful 1 
cumbersome design 0 
what a waste of money and time 0 
definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly will return next time im in vegas 1 
it was so bad i had lost the heart to finish it 0 
no real improvement 0 
even worse than ticker 0 
disappointing accessory from a good manufacturer 0 
the pancake was also really good and pretty large at that 1 
someone shouldve invented this sooner 1 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
avoid this one if you can 0 
everything was perfect the night we were in 1 
my sashimi was poor quality being soggy and tasteless 0 
crust is not good 0 
having trouble with volume 0 
that company is a joke 0 
the plug did not work very well 0 
for service i give them no stars 0 
a standout scene 1 
not a good item it worked for a while then started having problems in my auto reverse tape player 0 
i would avoid this place if you are staying in the mirage 0 
service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is vegas and located inside the crystals shopping mall by aria 1 
the vegetables are so fresh and the sauce feels like authentic thai 1 
at a time when it seems that film animation has been dominated by disneypixars cgi masterpieces it is both refreshing and comforting to know that miyazaki is still relying on traditional handdrawn animation to tell his charming and enchanting stories 1 
it definitely was not as good as my s11 1 
its so bad its actually worth seeing just for that reason 0 
could not get strong enough signal 0 
it definitely was not as good as my s11 1 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
this place was such a nice surprise 1 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
i didnt want the clip going over the top of my ear causing discomfort 0 
i especially liked the noncliche choices with the parents in other movies i could predict the dialog verbatim but the writing in this movie made better selections 1 
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
great it was new packaged nice works good no problems and it came in less time then i expected 1 
best ive found so far ive tried 2 other bluetooths and this one has the best quality for both me and the listener as well as ease of using 1 
overall a delight 1 
the service was meh 0 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
the menu had so much good stuff on it i could not decide 1 
and i really did find them funny 1 
waited and waited and waited 0 
the plot is nonsense that doesnt interest in the slightest way or have any uniqueness to it 0 
worked great 1 
say bye bye to your tip lady 0 
nargile i think you are great 1 
putting the race card aside lets look at the major flaw in the film they destroy latifas character 0 
poor quality 0 
it is very educational for children 1 to 8 years old 1 
this does not fit the palm tungsten e2 and it broke the first time i tried to plug it in 0 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
the bathroom is just next door and very nice 1 
dont do it 0 
things happen characters personalities change plot twists occur for no real reason other than that script calls for it 0 
the acting was decidely wooden though no worse than a period universal b movie 0 
do not buy for d807wrongly advertised for d807 0 
this one works and was priced right 1 
restaurant is always full but never a wait 1 
id like to return it 0 
i dont think ive ever gone to a movie and disliked it as much 0 
design flaw 0 
service is also cute 1 
hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in 0 
sending it back 0 
i left with a stomach ache and felt sick the rest of the day 0 
i also didnt like the on button it felt like it would crack with use 0 
i just cant explain this movie more than romanticcharminghilariousand adorablethe junkyard scenes are funnyall the junkyard dogs have something specialtoo funny i laughedkids will love itbuy it when it comes outit has new features 1 
a truly truly bad film 0 
but it wasnt anything at all just one big yawn 0 
after one bite i was hooked 1 
great pork sandwich 1 
avoid at any and all costs 0 
the story starts too fast with absolutely no suspense or buildup in the slightest 0 
the block was amazing 1 
i like design and look of jabra behing the ear headsets and 5020 is pretty comfortible to wear 24 hours a day without pain in the ear 1 
food was so gooodd 1 
no actress has been worse used that june allison in this movie 0 
great pizza and salads 1 
for that price i can think of a few place i would have much rather gone 0 
works for me 1 
this phone is pretty sturdy and ive never had any large problems with it 1 
when im on this side of town this will definitely be a spot ill hit up again 1 
the bt headset was such a disapoinment 0 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
thanks good a movie like this was done and released 1 
i like the fact that it rests lightly against your ear rather than inside 1 
after the disappointing dinner we went elsewhere for dessert 0 
he is one of my favourite directors and one of the most talented directors in the history of cinema 1 
it doesnt work in europe or asia 0 
i believe every one should see this movie as i think few people outside of south africa understand its past and what is being attempted in the truth and reconciliation process 1 
of course the acting is blah 0 
at no point in the proceedings does it look remotely like america 0 
the best phone in market 1 
the story is lame not interesting and never really explains the sinister origins of the puppets 0 
its the best headset i have used 1 
but when i check voice mail at night the keypad backlight turns off a few seconds into the first message and then im lost 0 
but now i was completely grossed out 0 
they keep getting better and better this is my third one and ive had numerous palms too 1 
it is an insane game 1 
there is a brilliant twist ending 1 
everything was fresh and delicious 1 
nice docking station for home or work 1 
the only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive 1 
i am a fan of his this movie sucked really bad 0 
def coming back to bowl next time 1 
this convention never worked well in the past and certainly doesnt work here 0 
big disappointment with calendar sync 0 
i ordered the voodoo pasta and it was the first time id had really excellent pasta since going gluten free several years ago 1 
im so sorry but i really cant recommend it to anyone 0 
five star plus plus 1 
overall a delight 1 
i would avoid this place if you are staying in the mirage 0 
not what i wanted 0 
simply beautiful 1 
does not fit 0 
and the rest of it just sits there being awful with soldiers singing songs about the masculinity they pledge themselves to hairsplitting about purity the admiration of swords etc 0 
it was a pale color instead of nice and char and has no flavor 0 
i was particularly pleased with the acting ability of dwight schultz 1 
the worst experience ever 0 
its a little geeky but i think thats its sex on toast and it rocks and oozes sex right down to its battery embedded sleek stylish leather case 1 
this is simply the best bluetooth headset for sound quality 1 
all the actors give a wonderful performance especially jennifer rubin as jamie harris who changes from the nervous starlet in the beginning through the strange events she is part of to the cool star 1 
highly unprofessional and rude to a loyal patron 0 
the phone gets extremely hot 0 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
the real killer is the volume and of course it breaking 0 
this is just a great movie 1 
it fits my ear well and is comfortable on 1 
the dialogue is composed of things that make little sense 0 
camera color balance is awful 0 
its like a really sexy party in your mouth where youre outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party 1 
greatno problems at all 1 
the chips that came out were dripping with grease and mostly not edible 0 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
the death row scenes were entirely unmoving 0 
item arrived quickly and works great with my metro pcs samsung schr450 slider phone and sony premium sound in ear plugs 1 
excellent dualpurpose headset 1 
despite the pans of reviewers i liked this movie 1 
frozen pucks of disgust with some of the worst people behind the register 0 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
to summarize the food was incredible nay transcendant but nothing brings me joy quite like the memory of the pneumatic condiment dispenser 1 
ample portions and good prices 1 
probably not in a hurry to go back 0 
the cashier was friendly and even brought the food out to me 1 
wont work right or atleast for me 0 
good servicecheck 1 
great pizza and salads 1 
it is unusable in a moving car at freeway speed 0 
the poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying 0 
this is one of the worst sandra bullock movie since speed 2 but not quite that bad 0 
doesnt last long 0 
as a sushi lover avoid this place by all means 0 
the food is rich so order accordingly 1 
lovely little thriller from hitchcock with lots of nice shenanigans surrounding a murdered spy a kidnapped child a nasty church a foreign plot and some random taxidermists 1 
if you havent choked in your own vomit by the end by all the cheap drama and worthless dialogue youve must have bored yourself to death with this waste of time 0 
the best place in vegas for breakfast just check out a sat or sun 1 
awsome device works great 1 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
very bad experience 0 
nonlinear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well 1 
i was bored throughout the whole damn thing 0 
i am very impressed with this headset from plantronics 1 
it clicks into place in a way that makes you wonder how long that mechanism would last 0 
we walked away stuffed and happy about our first vegas buffet experience 1 
give this one a look 1 
both of them were truly unbelievably good and i am so glad we went back 1 
the only place good for this film is in the garbage 0 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
i cant believe theres even a sequel to this 0 
the fries were great too 1 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
the menu had so much good stuff on it i could not decide 1 
the characters are interesting and you want to find out more about them the longer the movie goes on and i think people will be surprised by who does and doesnt make it 1 
i felt as though her going to ireland did absolutely nothing whatsoever 0 
i dont think ill be running back to carlys anytime soon for food 0 
i heart this place 1 
now we were chosen to be tortured with this disgusting piece of blatant american propaganda 0 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
terrible my car will not accept this cassette 0 
camera color balance is awful 0 
the result is a powerhouse achievement made more timely now perhaps because of our cultures disturbing fascination with celebrity and its distorted interpretations of fame 1 
avoid at all costs 0 
probably not in a hurry to go back 0 
clear skype calls long battery life long range 1 
does not fit 0 
big disappointment with calendar sync 0 
i thought errol flynn was brilliant as custer and has since become my favourite actor 1 
great brunch spot 1 
im still trying to get over how bad it was 0 
this game rocks 1 
service is friendly and inviting 1 
for people who are first timers in film making i think they did an excellent job 1 
i wasnt the least bit interested 0 
the warmth it generates is in contrast to its austere backdrop 1 
special thanks to dylan t for the recommendation on what to order all yummy for my tummy 1 
i advise you to look out for it 1 
this one is simply a disappointment 0 
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 
has been working great 1 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
so far it has worked like a charm 1 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
this movie is greatespecially if you enjoy visual arts 1 
dont buy this product 0 
battery is terrible 0 
my 810 score is mostly for the plot 1 
the cocktails are all handmade and delicious 1 
i recommend this for everyone who loves film movies anythinga work of art 1 
did not like at all 0 
the nano stated itmy son was dissapointed 0 
there is nothing authentic about this place 0 
this movie is excellentangel is beautiful and scamp is adorablehis little yelps when hes scaredand the funniest parts are whenscamp is caught under the curtain and when angel and scamp are singing ive never had this feeling beforei totally recommend this movieits coming out on special edition on june 20the cover has scamp on a garbage can and angel underneath the lid 1 
and there wasnt a single sour note struck actingwise either some surprisingly solid casting here 1 
i saw it as a child on tv back in 1973 when it was the stranger and i loved it 1 
it makes very strange ticking noises before it ends the call 0 
was not happy 0 
then the film just dropped the ball 0 
great place to relax and have an awesome burger and beer 1 
the worst phone from samsungcrap this crappy samsung e715 is the worst i have ever seeen 0 
with the originality and freshness of the first movie now spent this remake had little else to offer 0 
highly recommend for any one who has a blue tooth phone 1 
the crêpe was delicate and thin and moist 1 
the jamaican mojitos are delicious 1 
i saw this movie and i thought this is a stupid movie 0 
and the beans and rice were mediocre at best 0 
i had heard good things about this place but it exceeding every hope i could have dreamed of 1 
my order was not correct 0 
mediocre food 0 
you will leave the theater wanting to go out and dance under the stars 1 
i know that sounds funny but to me it seemed like sketchy technology that wouldnt work wellwell this one works great 1 
i own 2 of these cases and would order another 1 
this is a great deal 1 
pricing is a bit of a concern at mellow mushroom 0 
everything about this film is simply incredible 1 
i want my money back 0 
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
jamie foxx absolutely is ray charles 1 
poor voice clarity 0 
would not go back 0 
do not buy for d807wrongly advertised for d807 0 
artless camerawork endlessly presents us with the ugliest setting imaginable ie 0 
works great 1 
i did not expect this to be so good 1 
it is unusable in a moving car at freeway speed 0 
i had a salad with the wings and some ice cream for dessert and left feeling quite satisfied 1 
you need two hands to operate the screenthis software interface is decade old and cannot compete with new software designs 0 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
the soundtrack wasnt terrible either 1 
it is zillion times away from reality 0 
this scene is very strong and unpleasant 0 
it is easy to turn on and off when you are in the car and the volume controls are quite accessable 1 
i love this cable it allows me to connect any miniusb device to my pc 1 
the success of the film depends on the casting of sydney greenstreet as the alexander yardley character 1 
the characters were all funny and had the peculiarity of not having a true lead character 1 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
though the wind and the lion is told largely through the eyes of the son every member of the family can identify with one of the characters whether it be sean connerys noble brigand candace bergens feisty heroine john hustons wily john hay or steve kanalys spiffy radiant ruthless cando lieutenant roosevelts big stick 1 
i love my 350 headset my jabra350 bluetooth headset is great the reception is very good and the ear piece is a comfortable fit 1 
the potatoes were great and so was the biscuit 1 
terrible my car will not accept this cassette 0 
weve tried to like this place but after 10 times i think were done with them 0 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
it was either too cold not enough flavor or just bad 0 
i really loved the story line and the poler bear was kinda cutebut if anyone has a question about fort steele just ask away 1 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
in the span of an hour i had two people exclaim whoa is that the new phone on tv 1 
how can anyone in their right mind ask for anything more from a movie than this 1 
in my house i was getting dropped coverage upstairs and no coverage in my basement 0 
do not buy if you want to use the holster 0 
comfortable in my hand 1 
i waited and waited 0 
and it was boring 0 
i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
if you havent choked in your own vomit by the end by all the cheap drama and worthless dialogue youve must have bored yourself to death with this waste of time 0 
the worst experience ever 0 
it showed exactly how the government and the scientist argued for humanity and the reasons of the gadget 1 
logitech bluetooth headset is a 10 1 
the food amazing 1 
very convenient since we were staying at the mgm 1 
but now i was completely grossed out 0 
great it was new packaged nice works good no problems and it came in less time then i expected 1 
ordered burger rare came in well done 0 
i did not have any problem with this item and would order it again if needed 1 
if you want healthy authentic or ethic food try this place 1 
best breakfast buffet 1 
if you simply want a small flip phone look elsewhere as the extra bells whistles are mediocre 0 
tom wilkinson broke my heart at the end and everyone elses judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike 1 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
it was horrible 0 
first off the reception sucks i have never had more than 2 bars ever 0 
i was very disappointed 0 
but the movie makes a lot of serious mistakes 0 
i wasnt the least bit interested 0 
it was just too horrible 0 
i was sitting in my vehicle with the cradle on my belt and the headset lost signal 0 
the scenes with the ohsomature neighbourgirl are a misplace 0 
it didnt charge for me 0 
i have always used corded headsets and the freedom from the wireless is very helpful 1 
terrible product and waste of money 0 
lastly the mozzarella sticks they were the best thing we ordered 1 
all of the main players are mesmerising 1 
i got it because it was so small and adorable 1 
then a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use 0 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
lastly the mozzarella sticks they were the best thing we ordered 1 
good case excellent value 1 
this is one of the better buffets that i have been to 1 
the bathrooms are clean and the place itself is well decorated 1 
bad fit way too big 0 
great case and price 1 
the chips and sals a here is amazing 1 
i seriously cannot believe that the owner has so many unexperienced employees that all are running around like chickens with their heads cut off 0 
the chefs were friendly and did a good job 1 
come hungry leave happy and stuffed 1 
it was a very superficial movie and it gave me the feeling that i was watching play rather than a film 0 
the poor actors 0 
perabo has a nice energy level and is obviously very comfortable in front of a camera 1 
you can even take self portraits with the outside exterior display very cool 1 
this company charge me a restocking fee and still not given me my refund back 0 
the volume switch rocketed out of the unit to a destination unknown 0 
its worth driving up from tucson 1 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
i have purchased these for both family and friends and all enjoy their clarity and ease of use 1 
i struggle to find anything bad to say about it 1 
there are so many problems i dont know where to start 0 
this place was such a nice surprise 1 
good servicecheck 1 
voice recognition is tremendous 1 
seller shipped quickly and much cheaper than the competitors 1 
of all the dishes the salmon was the best but all were great 1 
my first visit to hiro was a delight 1 
also if your phone is dropped this case is not going to save it specially when dropped face down 0 
this place is overpriced not consistent with their boba and it really is overpriced 0 
howeverthe riingtones are not the best and neither are the games 0 
i can assure you that you wont be disappointed 1 
the story is also both funny and poignant at times 1 
always a great time at dos gringos 1 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
five star plus plus 1 
the aerial scenes were welldone 1 
total letdown i would much rather just go to the camelback flower shop and cartel coffee 0 
magical help 1 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
another thing i didnt really like is when a character got punched in the face a gallon of blood would spew forth soon after 0 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
the eargels channel the sound directly into your ear and seem to increase the sound volume and clarity 1 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
the tracfonewebsite is user friendly and makes it easy toactivate etc 1 
the screen size is big key pad lit well enough and the camera quality is excellent for a camera phone 1 
what a waste of money and time 0 
great product for the price 1 
they have been around for years and carries the highest quality of antiglare screen protector that i have found to date 1 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
even the squibs look awful 0 
this really is how vegas fine dining used to be right down to the menus handed to the ladies that have no prices listed 1 
in particular the relationship between the bakery assistant and the waitress just didnt work for me at all 0 
it looks very nice 1 
i just saw this film and i recommend it 1 
i have 23 bars on my cell phone when i am home but you cant not hear anything 0 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
i just saw this film and i recommend it 1 
doesnt do the job 0 
the characters were all funny and had the peculiarity of not having a true lead character 1 
mark my words this is one of those cult films like evil dead 2 or phantasm that people will still be discovering and falling in love with 20 30 40 years down the line 1 
highly recommended 1 
will order from them again 1 
this place is handsdown one of the best places to eat in the phoenix metro area 1 
if it was to turn my good day feeling into a night of disturbing memories than i guess he succeeded 0 
unfortunately any virtue in this films production work was lost on a regrettable script 0 
thus far have only visited twice and the food was absolutely delicious each time 1 
save your money ive had this item for 11 months now 0 
the block was amazing 1 
this movie is excellentangel is beautiful and scamp is adorablehis little yelps when hes scaredand the funniest parts are whenscamp is caught under the curtain and when angel and scamp are singing ive never had this feeling beforei totally recommend this movieits coming out on special edition on june 20the cover has scamp on a garbage can and angel underneath the lid 1 
great service and food 1 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
the food was barely lukewarm so it must have been sitting waiting for the server to bring it out to us 0 
food was really boring 0 
youd have to have the iq of particularly stupid mollusk not to see that one coming 0 
definitely worth seeing its the sort of thought provoking film that forces you to question your own threshold of loneliness 1 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
it worked very well 1 
but when someone strives for greatness and poetry but delivers a muddled and often ridiculous story a bunch of disparate scenes pretentious dialogue then you get the worst kind of a movie that some other reviewer very accurately defined as pretentious crap 0 
okay i like to consider myself a fair critic so ill give credit where credits duethe creature effects were actually pretty cool 1 
but the service was beyond bad 0 
ive never been more insulted or felt disrespected 0 
fantastic food 1 
highly recommended a 1 
on the up side their cafe serves really good food 1 
i saw this film over christmas and what a great film it was 1 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
seafood was limited to boiled shrimp and crab legs but the crab legs definitely did not taste fresh 0 
the staff is great the food is delish and they have an incredible beer selection 1 
hot dishes are not hot cold dishes are close to room tempi watched staff prepare food with bare hands no gloveseverything is deep fried in oil 0 
the memories are murky but i can only say that i enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show 1 
constantine gives everything the right intensity and seems to have a good understanding of the underlying psychological motivations 1 
for a product that costs as much as this one does i expect it to work far better and with greater ease than this thing does 0 
the food amazing 1 
garbo who showed right off the bat that her talents could carry over from the silent era i wanted to see some of her silent work but netflix doesnt seem to be stocking them 1 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
i gave it 5 stars because of the sound quality 1 
better than expected 1 
wonderful lil tapas and the ambience made me feel all warm and fuzzy inside 1 
i hate writing bad reviews about films especially those in which i really like the star but this film is so bad i dont believe for one second that anyone could have been proud of it 0 
razr battery good buy 1 
nice spicy and tender 1 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
tried to go here for lunch and it was a madhouse 0 
the cable looks so thin and flimsy it is scary 0 
this film highlights the fundamental flaws of the legal process that its not about discovering guilt or innocence but rather is about who presents better in court 1 
thats how id describe this painfully dreary timewaster of a film 0 
it failed to convey the broad sweep of landscapes that were a great part of the original 0 
while i managed to bend the leaf spring back in place the metal now has enough stress that it will break on the next drop 0 
about 30 minutes of footage is wasted to show mediocre elderly actors awkwardly babbling overwrought pseudosatanic gibberish corny enough to make a teen goth blush almost always in olde english and sometimes in latin that may or may not be made up words 0 
this company charge me a restocking fee and still not given me my refund back 0 
this item worked great but it broke after 6 months of use 0

overall i am psyched to have a phone which has all my appointments and contacts in and gets great reception 1 
after all the rave reviews i couldnt wait to eat herewhat a disappointment 0 
attempting artiness with black white and clever camera angles the movie disappointed became even more ridiculous as the acting was poor and the plot and lines almost nonexistent 0 
my only problem is i thought the actor playing the villain was a low rent michael ironside 0 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
both films are terrible but to the credit of the 1986 version it was watchable 0 
great charger 1 
kind of flops around 0 
i will never forget it now 1 
everything about this product is wrongfirst 0 
we made the drive all the way from north scottsdale and i was not one bit disappointed 1

great choice 1 
this film and i use that word loosely is an insult to the moviegoing public 0 
i can think of no other film where something vitally important occurs every other minute 1

great food and service huge portions and they give a military discount 1 
the charger arrived within the promised timeframe but it did not work 0

it is an hour and half waste of time following a bunch of very pretty high schoolers whine and cry about life 0 
this one wants to surf on the small wave of space movies in 1998 deep impact and armageddon and this one fails everywhere 0 
when a song could explain the emotions of the subjects better such as when jay adams unfortunate life was a subject of talk the song old man by neil young was played which evokes many emotions 1 
i didnt know pulled pork could be soooo delicious 1 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
while i managed to bend the leaf spring back in place the metal now has enough stress that it will break on the next drop 0 
having to humour him just to get by and get through the day was so apt 1 
you share general loewenhielms exquisite joy in his partaking of the cailles en sarcophage even though you are just watching a movie but you do wish for just a small sample to savor 1 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
works great 1 
very disappointing 0 
portable and it works 1 
it really is impressive that the place hasnt closed down 0 
the yellowtail carpaccio was melt in your mouth fresh 1 
awesome service and food 1 
motorola finally got the voice quality of a bluetooth headset right 1 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
20th century foxs road house 1948 is not only quite a silly noir but is an implausible unmitigated bore of a movie 0 
it was a waste of my money 0 
it plays louder than any other speaker of this size the price is so low that most would think the quality is lacking however its not 1 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
bad quality 0 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
worst service to boot but that is the least of their worries 0 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
do not buy if you want to use the holster 0 
i work in the hospitality industry in paradise valley and have refrained from recommending cibo any longer 0 
but despite these few flaws this case is of exceptional quality and well worth the additional costs of owning an official oem product 1 
i will not be eating there again 0 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
punishment park is a brilliant piece of cinema 1 
ryans bar is definitely one edinburgh establishment i wont be revisiting 0

i cant wait to go back 1 
the waitresses are very friendly 1 
excellent sound quality 1 
i ended up sliding it on the edge of my pants or back pockets instead 1 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
looks great and is strong 1 
worst hour and a half of my lifeoh my gosh 0 
if good intentions made a film great then this film might be one of the greatest films ever made 1 
if that bug never showed up i would have given a 4 for sure but on the other side of the wall where this bug was climbing was the kitchen 0 
excellent dualpurpose headset 1 
the screen does get smudged easily because it touches your ear and face 0 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
if you are looking for a good quality motorola headset keep looking this isnt it 0 
it was so funny 1 
i cant use this case because the smell is disgusting 0 
last time buying from you 0 
the characters were all funny and had the peculiarity of not having a true lead character 1 
the film is well paced understated and one of the best courtroom documentaries ive seen 1 
it is well made easy to access the phone and has a handy detachable belt clip 1 
however i recently watched the whole thing again on dvd and i was completely struck by how extremely stupid the storyline was how it contained holes inconsistencies and frankly a whole lot of crap and how horrid the dancing was 0 
i am also very happy with the price 1 
what a waste of money and time 0 
the classic maine lobster roll was fantastic 1 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
the malta settings are as dry and as barren as the dialogue 0 
kieslowski never ceases to amaze me 1 
you cant beat that 1 
the film is well paced understated and one of the best courtroom documentaries ive seen 1 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
gave up trying to eat any of the crust teeth still sore 0 
owners are really great people 1 
all the bread is made inhouse 1 
in particular the relationship between the bakery assistant and the waitress just didnt work for me at all 0 
exactly what i wanted 1 
these are certainly very comfortable and functionality is decent 1 
nice leather 1 
earbud piece breaks easily 0 
the story itself is just predictable and lazy 0 
the only thing i did like was the prime rib and dessert section 1 
the chips that came out were dripping with grease and mostly not edible 0 
the staff are great the ambiance is great 1 
good servicecheck 1 
i find this inexcusable and so will probably be returning this phone and perhaps changing carriers 0 
gave up trying to eat any of the crust teeth still sore 0 
i rather enjoyed it 1 
both of them were truly unbelievably good and i am so glad we went back 1 
totally believable 1 
i think this restaurant suffers from not trying hard enough 0 
omit watching this 0 
i was very excited to get this headset because i thought it was really cute 1 
worst hour and a half of my lifeoh my gosh 0 
as a courtroom drama its compelling as an indictment on the american justice system its frightening 1 
any ring toneoverall good phone to buy 1 
shes poised and amazing 1 
fast service 1 
coming here is like experiencing an underwhelming relationship where both parties cant wait for the other person to ask to break up 0 
and the accents are absolutely abysmal 0 
i guess i should have known that this place would suck because it is inside of the excalibur but i didnt use my common sense 0 
the sound quality for the device is unacceptableunless you are in a really quiet area you almost hear nothing 0 
the warm beer didnt help 0 
i liked the patio and the service was outstanding 1 
unfortunately it did not work 0 
really really good rice all the time 1 
did not like at all 0 
i will not return 0 
regardless the film fails on most levels 0 
earbud piece breaks easily 0 
nice docking station for home or work 1 
the film has an ultracheap look to it 0 
rude inconsiderate management 0 
avoid avoid avoid 0 
owners are really great people 1 
utter crap sound quality is terrible 0 
i liked this movie way too much 1 
seriously flavorful delights folks 1 
we loved the biscuits 1 
one of my favorite purchases ever 1 
similarly the delivery man did not say a word of apology when our food was 45 minutes late 0 
i dont recommend unless your car breaks down in front of it and you are starving 0 
ill even say it again  this is torture 0 
i wouldnt see this movie again for free 0 
the sides are delish mixed mushrooms yukon gold puree white corn beateous 1 
i put the latest os on it v115g and it now likes to slow to a crawl and lock up every once in a while 0 
will be back again 1 
light weight i hardly notice it is there 1 
i really liked that 1 
the price was very good and with the free shipping and all it was a good purchase 1 
it even has its sweet moments 1 
i recently had problems where i could not stay connected for more than 10 minutes before being disconnected 0 
its like a bad two hour tv movie 0 
i loved it 1 
i rather enjoyed it 1 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
the story which was told so eloquently by francis ford coppola 25 years earlier really unfolds gradually and leaves room for the characters to develop 1 
i ordered albondigas soup which was just warm and tasted like tomato soup with frozen meatballs 0 
every time he opened his mouth you expect to hear you see kids pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show 0 
im not sure what he was trying to do with this film 0 
the menu had so much good stuff on it i could not decide 1 
the veggitarian platter is out of this world 1 
the jamaican mojitos are delicious 1 
hot dishes are not hot cold dishes are close to room tempi watched staff prepare food with bare hands no gloveseverything is deep fried in oil 0 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0
