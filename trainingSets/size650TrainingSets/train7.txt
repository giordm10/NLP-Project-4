the black eyed peas and sweet potatoes unreal 1 
this case has passed the one year mark and while it shows signs of wear it is 100 functional 1 
youd have to have the iq of particularly stupid mollusk not to see that one coming 0 
main thing i didnt enjoy is that the crowd is of older crowd around mid 30s and up 0 
logitech bluetooth headset is a 10 1 
these are certainly very comfortable and functionality is decent 1 
the cable looks so thin and flimsy it is scary 0 
the folks at otto always make us feel so welcome and special 1 
you wont be disappointed 1 
even in my bmw 3 series which is fairly quiet i have trouble hearing what the other person is saying 0 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
i love it 1 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
the soundtrack wasnt terrible either 1 
but in any case the best part is you can download these pictures to your laptop using ir or even send pictures from your laptop to the phone 1 
this product is clearly not ready for prime time i dont care how cool it looks if you cant tell a call is coming in its worthless 0 
youll love how thin it is 1 
you never know if you pushed it hard enough or the right number of times for the function you want or not 0 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
the camera on the phone may be used as a dustpan when indoors id rather be using a disposable then this 0 
everything on the menu is terrific and we were also thrilled that they made amazing accommodations for our vegetarian daughter 1 
there is a totally unnecessary trainroller coaster scene 0 
seafood was limited to boiled shrimp and crab legs but the crab legs definitely did not taste fresh 0 
and there wasnt a single sour note struck actingwise either some surprisingly solid casting here 1 
i love the ringtones because they are so upbeat 1 
50 down the drain 0 
at least think to refill my water before i struggle to wave you over for 10 minutes 0 
all in all a great disappointment 0 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
i hope this place sticks around 1 
i had a salad with the wings and some ice cream for dessert and left feeling quite satisfied 1 
its a mediocre miserable hollow laughable and predictable piece of garbage 0 
i recently tried caballeros and i have been back every week since 1 
the chains which im no fan of beat this place easily 0 
the chips that came out were dripping with grease and mostly not edible 0 
my sister has one also and she loves it 1 
its fits like a glove and is strong secure and durable 1 
first of all there are enough racial stereotypes and racial jokes to offend everyone 0 
very dissapointing performance 0 
overall i wasnt very impressed with noca 0 
the worst experience ever 0 
do not buy do not buyit sucks 0 
the scenes with the ohsomature neighbourgirl are a misplace 0 
its a fresh subtle and rather sublime effect 1 
i am very impressed with this headset from plantronics 1 
avoid at all cost 0 
then i watched it again two sundays ago march 20th 2005 and i began to really enjoy it and this time i taped the entire thing 1 
eew this location needs a complete overhaul 0 
his performance is simply genius 1 
things that went wrong they burned the saganaki 0 
the potatoes were like rubber and you could tell they had been made up ahead of time being kept under a warmer 0 
these products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet 0 
i do think tom hanks is a good actor 1 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
the poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying 0 
used and dirty 0 
the plot was the same as pretty much every other cheap horror 0 
i was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar not only because the quality is great but the service is fast and the food impeccable 1 
this place was such a nice surprise 1 
dont buy it 0 
omg the food was delicioso 1 
all the actors give a wonderful performance especially jennifer rubin as jamie harris who changes from the nervous starlet in the beginning through the strange events she is part of to the cool star 1 
the phone takes forever to charge like 2 to 5 hours literally 0 
then our food came out disappointment ensued 0 
its really easy 1 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
you could drive a semi truck into these holes 0 
a good quality bargain i bought this after i bought a cheapy from big lots that sounded awful and people on the other end couldnt hear me 1 
youd have to have the iq of particularly stupid mollusk not to see that one coming 0 
so anyone near you will hear part of your conversation 0 
the ambiance isnt much better 0 
anne heche was utterly convincing 1 
went for lunch service was slow 0 
doesnt work at all i bougth it for my l7c and its not working 0 
it fits so securely that the ear hook does not even need to be used and the sound is better directed through your ear canal 1 
dont waste your time watching this rubbish nonresearched film 0 
i swung in to give them a try but was deeply disappointed 0 
i rate this movie 910 1 
excellent service 1 
raw and sublimely moving 1 
at least think to refill my water before i struggle to wave you over for 10 minutes 0 
it defeats the purpose of a bluetooth headset 0 
we made the drive all the way from north scottsdale and i was not one bit disappointed 1 
it was a bit too sweet not really spicy enough and lacked flavor 0 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
for a product that costs as much as this one does i expect it to work far better and with greater ease than this thing does 0 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
food was so gooodd 1 
i love this phone 1 
but when i check voice mail at night the keypad backlight turns off a few seconds into the first message and then im lost 0 
i was shocked because no signs indicate cash only 0 
great product fast shipping 1 
great phone 1 
i great reception all the time 1 
the movie has almost no action scenes in it and very little comedy 0 
either way it sucks 0 
the phone takes forever to charge like 2 to 5 hours literally 0 
absolutely great 1 
the cast of veteran actors are more than just a nostalgia trip 1 
the kids are annoying 0 
it quit working after id used it for about 18 months so i just purchased another one because this is the best headset ive ever owned 1 
the acting was bad the dialogs were extremely shallow and insincere 0 
i love their fries and their beans 1 
this is such a fun and funny movie 1 
improper description i had to return it 0 
used and dirty 0 
the cable looks so thin and flimsy it is scary 0 
when a song could explain the emotions of the subjects better such as when jay adams unfortunate life was a subject of talk the song old man by neil young was played which evokes many emotions 1 
im surprised this is a good quality car charger and theres not much reviews about it 1 
dont waste your time here 0 
however after about a year the fliptop started to get loose and wobbly and eventually my screen went black and i couldnt receive and place calls 0 
ive had no trouble accessing the internet downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions 1 
we have tried 2 units and they both failed within 2 months pros 0 
if i take a picture the battery drops a bar and starts beeping letting me know its dieing 0 
heres where the movie really pied me off 0 
lovely little thriller from hitchcock with lots of nice shenanigans surrounding a murdered spy a kidnapped child a nasty church a foreign plot and some random taxidermists 1 
the biggest complaint i have is the battery drains superfast 0 
i purchased this and within 2 days it was no longer working 0 
the movie in movie situations in the beginning and through the game that is played with her by the acting coach are fascinating 1 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
food is way overpriced and portions are fucking small 0 
we waited an hour for what was a breakfast i could have done 100 times better at home 0 
nice headphones for the price and they work great 1 
end of days is one of the worst bigbudget action movies ive ever seen 0 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
everything stinks 0 
i bought two of them and neither will charge 0 
if you do watch it however there are small consolations the actresses playing annes sisters each do a wonderful job with their roles 1 
i really recommend this faceplates since it looks very nice elegant and cool 1 
we started with the tuna sashimi which was brownish in color and obviously wasnt fresh 0 
i am very happy 1 
highly unprofessional and rude to a loyal patron 0 
but the convoluted plot just didnt convince me and much of the film was watched with a weird questioning glance 0 
the story is also both funny and poignant at times 1 
i just saw this film and i recommend it 1 
it was an inexpensive piece but i would still have expected better quality 0 
my side greek salad with the greek dressing was so tasty and the pita and hummus was very refreshing 1 
the sergeant pepper beef sandwich with auju sauce is an excellent sandwich as well 1 
its pretty easy 1 
every element of this story was so over the top excessively phony and contrived that it was painful to sit through 0 
great charger 1 
this is a great place to eat 1 
my side greek salad with the greek dressing was so tasty and the pita and hummus was very refreshing 1 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
they dropped more than the ball 0 
the pleather case doesnt fit 0 
it doesnt make you look cool 0 
a film not easily forgotten 1 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
there are so many problems i dont know where to start 0 
the acting sucked 0 
doesnt hold charge 0 
so far so good 1 
thank you for such great service 1 
director paul matthews who also wrotedirected the weak 1995 monster movie grim clearly doesnt know how to pace his films 0 
dont go here 0 
the film has great actors a master director a significant themeat least a wouldbe significant theme undertone of fifties existential worldweariness aerial scenes that ought to have thrilled both senses and imagination and characters about which one might deeply care 1 
i got it because it was so small and adorable 1 
if there was ever an indication of a writer and a directors ability to meld two highly volatile temperaments into a seamless union of creativity then this is it 1 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
if you want a real scare rent this one 1 
it is just the sort of pap that is screened in the afternoon to punish the unemployed for not having jobs 0 
the place was fairly clean but the food simply wasnt worth it 0 
the classic maine lobster roll was fantastic 1 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
50 down the drain 0 
duris has a wholesome appearance and gives a fine performance 1 
i have bought this nokia cell phone a few weeks ago and it was a nightmare 0 
i could not understand what kind of idiot would produce this mess in the first place not to mention several season 0 
i highly recommend this case 1 
they could serve it with just the vinaigrette and it may make for a better overall dish but it was still very good 1 
its just lame 0 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
this is an unbelievable bargain 1 
the football scenes at the end were perplexing 0 
what a piece of junk i lose more calls on this phone 0 
great service and food 1 
best fish ive ever had in my life 1 
you learn a lot about the real inside emotions of people in this movie and a lot about the movie business itself 1 
we loved the biscuits 1 
probably never coming back and wouldnt recommend it 0 
i especially love the long battery life 1 
the chips that came out were dripping with grease and mostly not edible 0 
cumbersome design 0 
this is definitely one of the better documentaries i have seen looking at family relationships and marriage 1 
pretty cool i would say 1 
unfortunately inexperience of direction meant that scene after scene passed with little in the way of dramatic tension or conflict 0 
i really loved the story line and the poler bear was kinda cutebut if anyone has a question about fort steele just ask away 1 
overall i would recommend this phone over the new walkman 1 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
my girlfriends veal was very bad 0 
the steak and the shrimp are in my opinion the best entrees at gc 1 
an absolute must visit 1 
great phone 1 
great pizza and salads 1 
this is infuriating 0 
both of them were truly unbelievably good and i am so glad we went back 1 
i will come back here every time im in vegas 1 
the plot such as it is is so derivative and predictable that the ending is like a mercy killing 0 
it ranks highly as a great noircrimedrama incredible performances by belmondo and lino ventura 1 
the screen size is big key pad lit well enough and the camera quality is excellent for a camera phone 1 
wont ever go here again 0 
theres barely a boring moment in the film and there are plenty of humorous parts 1 
the service was a bit lacking 0 
the movie is littered with overt racial slurs towards the black cast members and in return the whites are depicted as morons and boobs 0 
why are these sad little vegetables so overcooked 0 
this is one of the worst sandra bullock movie since speed 2 but not quite that bad 0 
also if your phone is dropped this case is not going to save it specially when dropped face down 0 
after charging overnight these batteries work great 1 
the headset fulfills my requirements so i am happy with my purchase 1 
they refuse to refund or replace 0 
the performances are not improved by improvisation because the actors now have twice as much to worry about not only whether theyre delivering the line well but whether the line itself is any good 0 
if youre not familiar check it out 1 
the food was very good 1 
funny clever hip just like prays previous film hype 1 
kris kristoffersen is good in this movie and really makes a difference 1 
try them in the airport to experience some tasty food and speedy friendly service 1 
someone shouldve invented this sooner 1 
a truly truly bad film 0 
their frozen margaritas are way too sugary for my taste 0 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
graphics is far from the best part of the game 0 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
overall i like there food and the service 1 
it is worth the drive 1 
tonight i had the elk filet specialand it sucked 0 
there was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters 0 
they know how to make them here 1 
overall i like there food and the service 1 
after 3 months screen just went black all of a sudden 0 
for those that havent seen it dont waste your time 0 
worst customer service 0 
their daily specials are always a hit with my group 1 
lastly the mozzarella sticks they were the best thing we ordered 1 
i totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is 1 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
well never go again 0 
duris has a wholesome appearance and gives a fine performance 1 
frozen pucks of disgust with some of the worst people behind the register 0 
as for the service im a fan because its quick and youre being served by some nice folks 1 
its reception is very very poor 0 
i have 23 bars on my cell phone when i am home but you cant not hear anything 0 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
we waited for forty five minutes in vain 0 
this hole in the wall has great mexican street tacos and friendly staff 1 
full of unconvincing cardboard characters it is blandly written by edward chodorov who also produced and is surprisingly directed by jean negulesco from whom one would expect a great deal more 0 
i would give this television series a 10 plus if i could 1 
cute quaint simple honest 1 
join the club and get awesome offers via email 1 
very tough and very short on flavor 0 
i ordered albondigas soup which was just warm and tasted like tomato soup with frozen meatballs 0 
it really is impressive that the place hasnt closed down 0 
they work about 2 weeks then break 0 
very disappointed 0 
come hungry leave happy and stuffed 1 
but what really made it unwatchable was the direction 0 
avoid at all costs 0 
four stars for the food the guy in the blue shirt for his great vibe still letting us in to eat 1 
their frozen margaritas are way too sugary for my taste 0 
yeah the movie pretty much sucked 0 
they keep getting better and better this is my third one and ive had numerous palms too 1 
the characters were all funny and had the peculiarity of not having a true lead character 1 
steamboat willie is an amazingly important film to our cinema history 1 
a very good film indeed about great and unconditional love 1 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
the sound is clear and the people i talk to on it are amazed at the quality too 1 
their daily specials are always a hit with my group 1 
the chips that came out were dripping with grease and mostly not edible 0 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
strike 2 who wants to be rushed 0 
this is essentially a communications tool that does not communicate 0 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
the acting helps the writing along very well maybe the idiotsavant sister could have been played better and it is a real joy to watch 1 
after the first charge kept going dead after 12 minutes 0 
it is an excellent drama an excellent thriller and an excellent film 1 
the only place good for this film is in the garbage 0 
howeverthe riingtones are not the best and neither are the games 0 
i think not again 0 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
tom wilkinson broke my heart at the end and everyone elses judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike 1 
i kept looking at the time and it had soon become 35 minutes yet still no food 0 
the turkey and roast beef were bland 0 
when my mom and i got home she immediately got sick and she only had a few bites of salad 0 
im not impressed with the concept or the food 0 
worth every penny 1 
this is a great deal 1 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
this may be the only bad film he ever made 0 
on the negative its insipid enough to cause regret for another 2 hours of life wasted in front of the screen 0 
my boyfriend and i sat at the bar and had a completely delightful experience 1 
alexander nevsky is a great film 1 
they never brought a salad we asked for 0 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
the story line is totally predictable 0 
you need at least 3 mins to get to your phone book from the time you first turn on the phonebattery life is short 0 
didnt laugh or even smile once 0 
go watch it 1 
if you dont find it too bad as again the unit comes with one earpad onlyi would not recommend this to anyone 0 
i ordered the lemon raspberry ice cocktail which was also incredible 1 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
the explosion of the gas tanks at the end was just as awful 0 
so anyone near you will hear part of your conversation 0 
but it wasnt anything at all just one big yawn 0 
very convenient since we were staying at the mgm 1 
great steak great sides great wine amazing desserts 1 
i wish i could enter negative values admins 0 
the majority of the logitech earbud headsets failed 0 
today was my first taste of a buldogis gourmet hot dog and i have to tell you it was more than i ever thought possible 1 
but when i check voice mail at night the keypad backlight turns off a few seconds into the first message and then im lost 0 
the lead man is charismafree 0 
i love the ringtones because they are so upbeat 1 
worst phone ever 0 
well just if you keep thinking how bad it is 0 
the entire audience applauded at the conclusion of the film 1 
back to good bbq lighter fare reasonable pricing and tell the public they are back to the old ways 1 
this is a great deal 1 
nothing special 0 
it has a great camera thats 2mp and the pics are nice and clear with great picture quality 1 
it was also the right balance of war and love 1 
often the dialogue doesnt really follow from one line to another or fit the surroundings 0 
give this one a look 1 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
i literally vomited while watching this film 0 
i really dont see how anyone could enjoy this movie 0 
the sergeant pepper beef sandwich with auju sauce is an excellent sandwich as well 1 
their rotating beers on tap is also a highlight of this place 1 
i was very excited to get this headset because i thought it was really cute 1 
i would give this television series a 10 plus if i could 1 
this is cool because most cases are just open there allowing the screen to get all scratched up 1 
this place is not worth your time let alone vegas 0 
only like 3 or 4 buildings used a couple of locations maybe poor hummh 0 
my drink was never empty and he made some really great menu suggestions 1 
the scenes with the ohsomature neighbourgirl are a misplace 0 
i wouldnt return 0 
her lines seem to have been written by a fifteen year old though they are trying oh so so hard to sound like how a fifteen year old would really um you know well talk 0 
my breakfast was perpared great with a beautiful presentation of 3 giant slices of toast lightly dusted with powdered sugar 1 
i hate to disagree with my fellow yelpers but my husband and i were so disappointed with this place 0 
the story line is totally predictable 0 
i can think of no other film where something vitally important occurs every other minute 1 
he was very impressed when going from the original battery to the extended battery 1 
the food amazing 1 
when achille and philippa beautifully sing a duet from don giovanni that perfectly describes their situation in the movie you appreciate the subtle layers of this excellent film 1 
i ended up sliding it on the edge of my pants or back pockets instead 1 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
it sure does beat the nachos at the movies but i would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant 0 
the restaurant is very clean and has a family restaurant feel to it 1 
i ordered albondigas soup which was just warm and tasted like tomato soup with frozen meatballs 0 
the awful dialogue and hopeless overacting by everyone who gets shot top off a real waste of space and time 0 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
what a waste 0 
i wasnt expecting oscar material but this 0 
this is definitely a cult classic well worth viewing and sharing with others 1 
better than youd expect 1 
this movie was kind of long in length but i enjoyed every minute of it 1 
i hate movies like that 0 
you will leave the theater wanting to go out and dance under the stars 1 
i could care less the interior is just beautiful 1 
i did not bother contacting the company for few dollar product but i learned the lesson that i should not have bought this form online anyway 0 
good audio quality 1 
comes with a strong light that you can use to light up your camera shots and even flash sos signals seriously 1 
the movie is terribly boring in places 0 
the acting was bad the dialogs were extremely shallow and insincere 0 
not a good item it worked for a while then started having problems in my auto reverse tape player 0 
host staff were for lack of a better word bitches 0 
i am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this 1 
the restaurant is very clean and has a family restaurant feel to it 1 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
so far so good 1 
i will come back here every time im in vegas 1 
simple lightweight and great fit 1 
i love this cable it allows me to connect any miniusb device to my pc 1 
the worst experience ever 0 
this phone is pretty sturdy and ive never had any large problems with it 1 
the entire audience applauded at the conclusion of the film 1 
there is so much good food in vegas that i feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to rice and company 0 
this isnt a small family restaurant this is a fine dining establishment 1 
because both ears are occupied background is not distracting at all 1 
the classic maine lobster roll was fantastic 1 
phenomenal food service and ambiance 1 
in my house i was getting dropped coverage upstairs and no coverage in my basement 0 
i also decided not to send it back because our waitress looked like she was on the verge of having a heart attack 0 
i saw this short film on hbo the other day and absolutely loved it 1 
ive missed numerous calls because of this reason 0 
the service was meh 0 
all the actors give a wonderful performance especially jennifer rubin as jamie harris who changes from the nervous starlet in the beginning through the strange events she is part of to the cool star 1 
it feels poorly constructed the menus are difficult to navigate and the buttons are so recessed that it is difficult to push them 0 
oh the charger seems to work fine 1 
reversible plug works great 1 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
im trying to return it for a refund 0 
this second appearance of mickey mouse following the silent plane crazy earlier that year is probably his most famous filmmostly because it was so groundbreaking 1 
i was very excited to get this headset because i thought it was really cute 1 
piece of trash 0 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
they could serve it with just the vinaigrette and it may make for a better overall dish but it was still very good 1 
best ive found so far ive tried 2 other bluetooths and this one has the best quality for both me and the listener as well as ease of using 1 
what is even more stupid is that who had thought an idea that there should be a volcano in los angeles 0 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
i gave it 5 stars because of the sound quality 1 
and the sound quality is great 1 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
the whole experience was underwhelming and i think well just go to ninja sushi next time 0 
the dining space is tiny but elegantly decorated and comfortable 1 
emily watsons character is very strong and she has only to give a quick glance and you understand everything 1 
great value 1 
this fixes all the problems 1 
the food sucked which we expected but it sucked more than we could have imagined 0 
thank you for such great service 1 
nargile i think you are great 1 
good item low price 1 
not a good bargain 0 
the service was outshining i definitely recommend the halibut 1 
talk about great customer service of course we will be back 1 
i received my headset in good time and was happy with it 1 
nonlinear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well 1 
i was very pleased to see that i could replace my well travled swivel holster for my blackberry flip 1 
well just if you keep thinking how bad it is 0 
mark my words this is one of those cult films like evil dead 2 or phantasm that people will still be discovering and falling in love with 20 30 40 years down the line 1 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
perfect for the ps3 1 
but when someone strives for greatness and poetry but delivers a muddled and often ridiculous story a bunch of disparate scenes pretentious dialogue then you get the worst kind of a movie that some other reviewer very accurately defined as pretentious crap 0 
i had a salad with the wings and some ice cream for dessert and left feeling quite satisfied 1 
these are certainly very comfortable and functionality is decent 1 
this product is great it makes working a lot easier i can go to the copier while waiting on hold for something 1 
for people who are first timers in film making i think they did an excellent job 1 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
both of them were truly unbelievably good and i am so glad we went back 1 
this place is amazing 1 
i wear glasses and it fits fine with them 1 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
this movie totally grates on my nerves 0 
which has more depth and character than the man underneath it 0 
the design is very odd as the ear clip is not very comfortable at all 0 
today the graphics are crap 0 
the directing seems too pretentious 0 
low quality 0 
disappointing experience 0 
tied to charger for conversations lasting more than 45 minutesmajor problems 0 
unfortunately the ability to actually know you are receiving a call is a rather important feature and this phone is pitiful in that respect 0 
the text messaging feature is really tricky to use 0 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
not recommended 0 
works great 1 
hayao miyazakis latest and eighth film for studio ghibili gake no ue no ponyo ponyo on the cliff by the sea is a wonderfully fun and imaginative look at childhood 1 
the structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema 1 
the accompanied software is almost brilliant 1 
gets a signal when other verizon phones wont 1 
my 810 score is mostly for the plot 1 
i highly recommend this device to everyone 1 
now this is a movie i really dislike 0 
the manager was the worst 0 
this phone is pretty sturdy and ive never had any large problems with it 1 
the waitress was friendly and happy to accomodate for veganveggie options 1 
a cheap and cheerless heist movie with poor characterisation lots of underbite style stoic emoting think chow yun fat in a better tomorrow and some cheesy clichés thrown into an abandoned factory ready for a few poorly executed flying judo rolls a la john woo 0 
its pretty easy 1 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
con spotty service 0 
do not buy if you want to use the holster 0 
this is a great place to eat 1 
the cashew cream sauce was bland and the vegetables were undercooked 0 
it worked very well 1 
bt50 battery junk 0 
this place lacked style 0 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
avoid at all costs 0 
the best place in vegas for breakfast just check out a sat or sun 1 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
i want my money back 0 
i had the mac salad and it was pretty bland so i will not be getting that again 0 
works great 1 
glad i didnt pay to see it 0 
definitely worth checking out 1 
they never brought a salad we asked for 0 
i was seated immediately 1 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
it is unusable in a moving car at freeway speed 0 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
i advise everyone do not be fooled 0 
an absolute must visit 1 
my salad had a bland vinegrette on the baby greens and hearts of palm 0 
i ate there twice on my last visit and especially enjoyed the salmon salad 1 
i have read others reviews here but i havent had any problem with it 1 
i particularly remember my senses being assaulted by strident cords of music that would blare out with very little warning and even less meaning 0 
my sashimi was poor quality being soggy and tasteless 0 
if you do watch it however there are small consolations the actresses playing annes sisters each do a wonderful job with their roles 1 
the awful dialogue and hopeless overacting by everyone who gets shot top off a real waste of space and time 0 
the owner used to work at nobu so this place is really similar for half the price 1 
the battery is completely useless to me 0 
i dont have to be an accountant to know im getting screwed 0 
the worst was the salmon sashimi 0 
the service was meh 0 
the acting sucks the music sucks the script sucks the pacing sucks the special fx suck the directing sucks basically this movie sucks 0 
please dont waste your money 0 
this case has passed the one year mark and while it shows signs of wear it is 100 functional 1 
very disappointed 0 
i cannot make calls at certain places 0 
i hate movies like that 0 
best fish ive ever had in my life 1 
great earpiece 1 
but now that it is out of warranty the same problems reoccurebottom line put your money somewhere else cingular will not support it 0 
this is not moviemaking 0 
car charger as well as ac charger are included to make sure you never run out of juicehighy recommended 1 
it isnt even an achievement as a sobaditsgood or sobaditsmemorable movie 0 
cheap but hey it works was pleasantly suprised given the low cost of this item 1 
for that price i can think of a few place i would have much rather gone 0 
god and i can never get that 90 minutes back 0 
please dont waste your money 0 
the meat was pretty dry i had the sliced brisket and pulled pork 0 
the first time i ever came here i had an amazing experience i still tell people how awesome the duck was 1 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
at a time when it seems that film animation has been dominated by disneypixars cgi masterpieces it is both refreshing and comforting to know that miyazaki is still relying on traditional handdrawn animation to tell his charming and enchanting stories 1 
a piece of cinematic garbage captured on celluloid 0 
only had this a month but its worked flawlessly so far 1 
i like armand assante my cable companys summary sounded interesting so i watched it twice already and probably will again 1 
bluetooth does not work phone locks up screens just flash up and now it just makes calls randomly while in my pocket locked 0 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
i left with a stomach ache and felt sick the rest of the day 0 
the presentation of the food was awful 0 
what on earth is irons doing in this film 0 
omg i felt like i had never eaten thai food until this dish 1 
the only downside is the service 0 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
the kids are annoying 0 
i love the camera its really pretty good quality 1 
do not purchase this phone 0 
weird vibe from owners 0 
piece of junk 0 
the worst piece of crap ever along with the verizon customer service 0 
great pocket pc phone combination 1 
this is truly an art movieit actually has a lot of art in it 1 
theres also enough hypocrisy in this film to make me vomit 0 
the attempts at humor were pitiful and story is so awful it dosent bear thinking about which basically involves a vulcan stealing the enterprise to find god seriously i just didnt care about any of this film and oh not to mention uhura does a belly dance to distract male guards 0 
the igo chargers and tips are really great 1 
we sat another ten minutes and finally gave up and left 0 
the mic is great 1 
lightweight and works well 1 
the handsfree part works fine but then the car tries to download the address book and the treo rebootsoverall i still rate this device high 1 
no one at the table thought the food was above average or worth the wait that we had for it 0 
it looked like a wonderful story 1 
the movie was very interesting from beginning to the end 1 
great movie 1 
i cannot believe that the actors agreed to do this film 0 
unfortunately cover girl is an example of how hollywood used to exploit women for financial gain 0 
i cannot believe that the actors agreed to do this film 0 
the staff are also very friendly and efficient 1 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
it only recognizes the phone as its storage device 0 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
everyone is treated equally special 1 
sucked most of the stuff does not work with my phone 0 
service stinks here 0 
thanks again to amazon for having the things i need for a good price 1 
the acting was decidely wooden though no worse than a period universal b movie 0 
amazon sucks 0 
its reception is very very poor 0 
to call this movie a drama is ridiculous 0 
lots of holes in the script 0 
avoid this film at all costs 0 
special thanks to dylan t for the recommendation on what to order all yummy for my tummy 1 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
their regular toasted bread was equally satisfying with the occasional pats of butter mmmm 1 
the descriptions said yum yum sauce and another said eel sauce yet another said spicy mayowell none of the rolls had sauces on them 0 
i only hear garbage for audio 0 
im so sorry but i really cant recommend it to anyone 0 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
cool phone 1 
however paul schrader has indeed made a film about mishima that is both superb complex 1 
the football scenes at the end were perplexing 0 
maybe if they werent cold they would have been somewhat edible 0 
itll be a regular stop on my trips to phoenix 1 
tom wilkinson broke my heart at the end and everyone elses judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike 1 
this place is overpriced not consistent with their boba and it really is overpriced 0 
what i really like there is the crepe station 1 
i got the car charger and not even after a week the charger was brokeni went to plug it in and it started smoking 0 
krussel always good 1 
i am very impressed with this headset from plantronics 1 
i can assure you that you wont be disappointed 1 
worst phone ever 0 
not a weekly haunt but definitely a place to come back to every once in a while 1 
but storm trooper is not even bad enough to make it to the list of wonderfully terrible movies 0 
i have never had such bland food which surprised me considering the article we read focused so much on their spices and flavor 0 
it didnt charge for me 0 
there is however some pretty good acting at least for this type of film 1 
this is one of the worst sandra bullock movie since speed 2 but not quite that bad 0 
i do think tom hanks is a good actor 1 
i guess i liked the details of his dysfunctionhe was believable 1 
the food is good 1 
i loved it it was really scary 1 
im terribly disappointed that this film would receive so many awards and accolades especially when there are far more deserving works of film out there 0 
the design might be ergonomic in theory but i could not stand having these in my ear 0 
there was a warm feeling with the service and i felt like their guest for a special treat 1 
it was packed 0 
the noise shield is incrediable 1 
also the fries are without a doubt the worst fries ive ever had 0 
it was quite comfortable in the ear 1 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
it was delicious 1 
best of luck to the rude and noncustomer service focused new management 0 
however after finally watching this film i realized that not only had i had a closed mind to the brilliance it depicts i also found myself watching it over and over again 1 
i really dont see how anyone could enjoy this movie 0 
avoid at all costs 0 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
great steak great sides great wine amazing desserts 1 
i have never had such bland food which surprised me considering the article we read focused so much on their spices and flavor 0 
but the convoluted plot just didnt convince me and much of the film was watched with a weird questioning glance 0 
magical help 1 
the pairing of the two devices was so easy it barely took a couple minutes before i started making calls with the voice dialing feature 1 
none of them are engaging or exciting 0 
all in all i can assure you ill be back 1 
it was a huge awkward 15lb piece of cow that was 34ths gristle and fat 0 
great product for the price 1 
overall i like this place a lot 1 
the phone was unusable and was not new 0 
i dont have very many words to say about this place but it does everything pretty well 1 
they refuse to refund or replace 0 
bluetooth range is good a few days ago i left my phone in the trunk got a call and carried the conversation without a hitch 1 
people couldnt hear me talk and i had to pull out the earphone and talk on the phone 0 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
what should have been a hilarious yummy christmas eve dinner to remember was the biggest fail of the entire trip for us 0 
what did bother me was the slow service 0 
food arrived quickly 1 
you also cannot take pictures with it in the case because the lense is covered 0 
probably never coming back and wouldnt recommend it 0 
filmiing was less expansive 0 
jabra ear gels r the best 1 
personally i think it shows that people should learn to find a compromise them self without involving other people into issue 1 
the scallop dish is quite appalling for value as well 0 
thank you for such great service 1 
you get extra minutes so that you can carry out the call and not get cut off 1 
will never ever go back and have told many people what had happened 0 
i like armand assante my cable companys summary sounded interesting so i watched it twice already and probably will again 1 
i saw this short film on hbo the other day and absolutely loved it 1 
and generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode 0 
about ten minutes into this film i started having second thoughts 0 
very easy to use 1 
stay away from the q 0 
characters are onedimensional even the good guys and especially the bad guys 0 
highly entertaining at all angles 1 
when achille and philippa beautifully sing a duet from don giovanni that perfectly describes their situation in the movie you appreciate the subtle layers of this excellent film 1 
the food was delicious our bartender was attentive and personable and we got a great deal 1 
easy to use 1 
this is a great restaurant at the mandalay bay 1 
it is simple to use and i like it 1 
great brunch spot 1 
hell no will i go back 0 
the flair bartenders are absolutely amazing 1 
i know he was a contract player with little control over his scripts but the acting was as bad as the script 0 
probably not in a hurry to go back 0
