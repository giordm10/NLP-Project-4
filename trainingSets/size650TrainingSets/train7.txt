when achille and philippa beautifully sing a duet from don giovanni that perfectly describes their situation in the movie you appreciate the subtle layers of this excellent film 1 
which are small and not worth the price 0 
worst martini ever 0 
i guess it was supposed to be clever twist then shed some light on the situation but it was just stupid 0 
better than new 1 
horrible dont waste your time and money 0 
after the disappointing dinner we went elsewhere for dessert 0 
the food sucked which we expected but it sucked more than we could have imagined 0 
the microphone also works well but according to people i have called it applifies everything 1 
i can barely ever hear on it and am constantly saying what 0 
today the graphics are crap 0 
the characters were all funny and had the peculiarity of not having a true lead character 1 
there is a lot of beautiful places 1 
bluetooth range is good a few days ago i left my phone in the trunk got a call and carried the conversation without a hitch 1 
there were too many close ups 0 
will not be back 0 
after one bite i was hooked 1 
and the chef was generous with his time even came around twice so we can take pictures with him 1 
the fried rice was dry as well 0 
the burrittos blah 0 
there are massive levels massive unlockable characters its just a massive game 1 
lots of holes in the script 0 
very true to shakespear and a must for all shakespear fans 1 
the chicken dishes are ok the beef is like shoe leather 0 
crash is a depressing little nothing that provokes emotion but teaches you nothing if you already know racism and prejudice are bad things 0 
for a product that costs as much as this one does i expect it to work far better and with greater ease than this thing does 0 
excellent sound battery life and inconspicuous to boot 1 
i cant believe theres even a sequel to this 0 
we waited an hour for what was a breakfast i could have done 100 times better at home 0 
i let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this bad idea we both hated it 0 
you wont regret it 1 
the awful dialogue and hopeless overacting by everyone who gets shot top off a real waste of space and time 0 
very much disappointed with this company 0 
the staff are great the ambiance is great 1 
sweetest phone 1 
the scallop dish is quite appalling for value as well 0 
constantine gives everything the right intensity and seems to have a good understanding of the underlying psychological motivations 1 
food was delicious 1 
this was such an awesome movie that i bought it off of ebay 1 
the directing seems too pretentious 0 
spend your money elsewhere 0 
great product and price 1 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
again lame 0 
very clear quality sound and you dont have to mess with the sound on your ipod since you have the sound buttons on the headset 1 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
ordered burger rare came in well done 0 
i dont think well be going back anytime soon 0 
i have seen many movies starring jaclyn smith but my god this was one of her best though it came out 12 years ago 1 
the reception is excellent 1 
the buffet at bellagio was far from what i anticipated 0 
hell no will i go back 0 
a piece of cinematic garbage captured on celluloid 0 
hated it 0 
this movie is excellentangel is beautiful and scamp is adorablehis little yelps when hes scaredand the funniest parts are whenscamp is caught under the curtain and when angel and scamp are singing ive never had this feeling beforei totally recommend this movieits coming out on special edition on june 20the cover has scamp on a garbage can and angel underneath the lid 1 
while you dont yet hear mickey speak there are tons of sound effects and music throughout the filmsomething we take for granted now but which was a huge crowd pleaser in 1928 1 
overall i wasnt very impressed with noca 0 
i am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this 1 
wow very spicy but delicious 1 
great headset very impressed h500 1 
i thought errol flynn was brilliant as custer and has since become my favourite actor 1 
highly unprofessional and rude to a loyal patron 0 
also difficult to put onid recommend avoiding this product 0 
waste your money on this game 1 
talk about great customer service of course we will be back 1 
this place is disgusting 0 
this frog phone charm is adorable and very eye catching 1 
this is not moviemaking 0 
otherwise dont even waste your time on this 0 
i dont know what kind it is but they have the best iced tea 1 
these are the nicest restaurant owners ive ever come across 1 
seriously its not worth wasting your or your kids time on 0 
superb phone on a great network 1 
the ngage is still lacking in earbuds 0 
disappointed with battery 0 
his use of the colours of the french flag in the three films was nothing short of incredible every shot every scene was like a work of art 1 
trying to make a call on these is an exercise in frustration 0 
so i had to take the battery out of the phone put it all back together and then restart it 0 
great brunch spot 1 
come hungry leave happy and stuffed 1 
excellent dualpurpose headset 1 
the service was terrible though 0 
the problem was the script 0 
this place is handsdown one of the best places to eat in the phoenix metro area 1 
buttons are too small 0 
if you want a sandwich just go to any firehouse 1 
adapter does not provide enough charging current 0 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
the portion was huge 1 
however my girl was complain that some time the phone doesnt wake up like normal phone does 0 
ive had this for nearly 2 years and it has worked great for me 1 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
i had a salad with the wings and some ice cream for dessert and left feeling quite satisfied 1 
it was a huge awkward 15lb piece of cow that was 34ths gristle and fat 0 
i was not impressed by this product 0 
just does not work 0 
i enjoyed it 1 
i even dropped this phone into a stream and it was submerged for 15 seconds and it still works great 1 
the owner used to work at nobu so this place is really similar for half the price 1 
the menu had so much good stuff on it i could not decide 1 
i purcashed this for the car charger and it does not work 0 
it has a great camera thats 2mp and the pics are nice and clear with great picture quality 1 
we had 7 at our table and the service was pretty fast 1 
anyways the food was definitely not filling at all and for the price you pay you should expect more 0 
i use this product in a motor control center where there is a lot of high voltage humming from the equipment and it works great 1 
this item is great installed it let it charged up overnite and it has been working good every since with no problems 1 
battery lasts only a few hours 0 
this may be the only bad film he ever made 0 
for readers who have already seen one of miyazakis films he is still in top form and made another worthwhile experience 1 
over rated 0 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
it plays louder than any other speaker of this size the price is so low that most would think the quality is lacking however its not 1 
i especially love the long battery life 1 
lasted one day and then blew up 0 
it has a great camera thats 2mp and the pics are nice and clear with great picture quality 1 
the acting was decidely wooden though no worse than a period universal b movie 0 
from here on the widmark character turns unintentionally comical 0 
sucked most of the stuff does not work with my phone 0 
the acting helps the writing along very well maybe the idiotsavant sister could have been played better and it is a real joy to watch 1 
overall i like there food and the service 1 
i cant tell you how disappointed i was 0 
50 down the drain 0 
restaurant is always full but never a wait 1 
omelets are to die for 1 
if it was to turn my good day feeling into a night of disturbing memories than i guess he succeeded 0 
lifetime does not air it enough so if anyone knows what store sells it let me know because this is a musthave 1 
i bought two of them and neither will charge 0 
it never condescends all the characters have good genuine hearts and believable problems 1 
it is indescribably the most annoying and idiotic show i have ever seen 0 
this is was due to the fact that it took 20 minutes to be acknowledged then another 35 minutes to get our foodand they kept forgetting things 0 
nice case feels good in your hands 1 
i was very disappointed in the movie 0 
its worth driving up from tucson 1 
but the movie makes a lot of serious mistakes 0 
great for the jawbone 1 
i took back my money and got outta there 0 
there are so many problems i dont know where to start 0 
really bad 0 
audio quality is poor very poor 0 
i even fully charged it before i went to bed and turned off blue tooth and wifi and noticed that it only had 20 left in the morning 0 
this case seems well made 1 
being a 90s child i truly enjoyed this show and i can proudly say that i enjoyed it big time and even more than the classical wb cartoons 1 
the battery is working well as a replacement for the original that came with the phone over 2 years ago 1 
the flair bartenders are absolutely amazing 1 
barney is definitely super de duper 1 
my sashimi was poor quality being soggy and tasteless 0 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
perhaps my phone is defective but people cannot hear me when i use this 0 
this phone is very fast with sending any kind of messages and web browsing is significantly faster than previous phones i have used 1 
delicious 1 
very good product well made 1 
it will drive you barking mad 0 
even if you love bad movies do not watch this movie 0 
new battery works great in phone 1 
one nice thing was that they added gratuity on the bill since our party was larger than 6 or 8 and they didnt expect more tip than that 1 
editing the editing of this film was phenomenal in my opinion 1 
otherwise dont even waste your time on this 0 
it plays louder than any other speaker of this size the price is so low that most would think the quality is lacking however its not 1 
the incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film 1 
phone falls out easily 0 
all of the tapas dishes were delicious 1 
magical help 1 
they keep getting better and better this is my third one and ive had numerous palms too 1 
this little device has transformed my organizational capability and made my life a whole lot easier 1 
it is an insane game 1 
a very very very slowmoving aimless movie about a distressed drifting young man 0 
their onscreen chemistry critical to the entire film is genuine 1 
just whatever you do avoid groove as its the antithesis of all that is good about human traffic 0 
this would not even be good as a made for tv flick 0 
i think i was one of the people who found this another one of roths pearls 1 
disappointed 0 
the meat was pretty dry i had the sliced brisket and pulled pork 0 
it also had a new problem 0 
this is a great phone 1 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
i highly recommend this movie for anyone interested in art poetry theater politics or japanese history 1 
this is a great place to eat 1 
you could only take 2 videos at a time and the quality was very poor 0 
they made this case too small and is very difficult to install 0 
id say that would be the hardest decision honestly all of ms dishes taste how they are supposed to taste amazing 1 
you truly take this journey through the eyes and soul of a child 1 
i love this thing 1 
if i take a picture the battery drops a bar and starts beeping letting me know its dieing 0 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
great product for the price 1 
not to mention the combination of pears almonds and bacon is a big winner 1 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
hackneyed writing certainly but made even worse by the bad directing 0 
graphics is far from the best part of the game 0 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
he cant act one of the least scary villains i have ever seen he cant write did he write this damn movie in his sleep 0 
enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film 1 
then i exchanged for the same phone even that had the same problem 0 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
all in all id expected a better consumer experience from motorola 0 
it quit working after id used it for about 18 months so i just purchased another one because this is the best headset ive ever owned 1 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
best ive found so far ive tried 2 other bluetooths and this one has the best quality for both me and the listener as well as ease of using 1 
the food is good 1 
if you love authentic mexican food and want a whole bunch of interesting yet delicious meats to choose from you need to try this place 1 
this phone might well be the worst ive ever had in any brand 0 
totally different with loads of understatement and black comedy this is a film few get to see but those who do will remember it 1 
the movie was very interesting from beginning to the end 1 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
then i watched it again two sundays ago march 20th 2005 and i began to really enjoy it and this time i taped the entire thing 1 
it has all the features i want 1 
camera color balance is awful 0 
this film has no redeeming features 0 
does not work 0 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
this is an excellent tool especially when paired with your phones autoanswer 1 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
some applause should be given to the prelude however 1 
my drink was never empty and he made some really great menu suggestions 1 
the salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop which was perfectly cooked 1 
great brunch spot 1 
say bye bye to your tip lady 0 
defective crap 0 
i enjoyed reading this book to my children when they were little 1 
the fries were not hot and neither was my burger 0 
i love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it 1 
i dont have to be an accountant to know im getting screwed 0 
updatewent back for a second time and it was still just as amazing 1 
sam shepards portrayal of a gung ho marine was sobering 1 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
a film not easily forgotten 1 
the accompanied software is almost brilliant 1 
it clicks into place in a way that makes you wonder how long that mechanism would last 0 
food is way overpriced and portions are fucking small 0 
if this premise sound stupid thats because it is 0 
damn good steak 1 
it features an outlandish array of memorable psychotic but lovable nuts 1 
now i know that i made a wise decision 1 
i have to jiggle the plug to get it to line up right to get decent volume 0 
and those baby owls were adorable 1 
my gyro was basically lettuce only 0 
motorola finally got the voice quality of a bluetooth headset right 1 
it feels poorly constructed the menus are difficult to navigate and the buttons are so recessed that it is difficult to push them 0 
now we were chosen to be tortured with this disgusting piece of blatant american propaganda 0 
this pair of headphones is the worst that i have ever had soundwise 0 
damn good steak 1 
her role was played well 1 
doesnt hold charge 0 
the only place good for this film is in the garbage 0 
the reception is excellent 1 
i love it 1 
both films are terrible but to the credit of the 1986 version it was watchable 0 
good show samsung 1 
i like the fact that it rests lightly against your ear rather than inside 1 
great phone 1 
best breakfast buffet 1 
it was pretty gross 0 
good case 1 
my mother and brother had to do thiswhen i saw robert ryan portraying this type of man it was a very good imitation of this type of individual and i was impressed 1 
it failed to convey the broad sweep of landscapes that were a great part of the original 0 
the bt headset was such a disapoinment 0 
a very good film indeed about great and unconditional love 1 
the only thing worse than taylors acting was stanwycks singing 0 
also great directing and photography 1 
so for our enjoyment we get to see them run around play games and be dangerous 1 
the guys all had steaks and our steak loving son who has had steak at the best and worst places said it was the best steak hes ever eaten 1 
i advise you to look out for it 1 
i as well wouldve given godfathers zero stars if possible 0 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
this one wants to surf on the small wave of space movies in 1998 deep impact and armageddon and this one fails everywhere 0 
do not make the same mistake as me 0 
she ordered a toasted english muffin that came out untoasted 0 
one of my favorite purchases ever 1 
gotta love those closeups of slimy drooling teeth 1 
i have tried these cables with my computer and my ipod and it works just fine 1 
great for the jawbone 1 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
only had this a month but its worked flawlessly so far 1 
i am sorry i made this purchase 0 
however the keypads are so tinny that i sometimes reach the wrong buttons 0 
very happy with this product 1 
ive only had my bluetooth for a few weeks but i really like it 1 
this movie has a cutting edge to it 1 
seafood was limited to boiled shrimp and crab legs but the crab legs definitely did not taste fresh 0 
i saw this film over christmas and what a great film it was 1 
would come back again if i had a sushi craving while in vegas 1 
it was awesome 1 
i would recommend this 1 
if you are razr owneryou must have this 1 
blue ant is easy to use 1 
they made this case too small and is very difficult to install 0 
this is so embarassing and also my ears hurt if i try to push the ear plug into my ear 0 
the ri style calamari was a joke 0 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
best tacos in town by far 1 
dont buy this product 0 
if good intentions made a film great then this film might be one of the greatest films ever made 1 
nargile i think you are great 1 
there is a lot of beautiful places 1 
how awful she is 0 
their frozen margaritas are way too sugary for my taste 0 
reception is terrible and full of static 0 
the story itself is just predictable and lazy 0 
i can assure you that you wont be disappointed 1 
it only recognizes the phone as its storage device 0 
happy so far 1 
this item is great installed it let it charged up overnite and it has been working good every since with no problems 1 
we recently witnessed her poor quality of management towards other guests as well 0 
her lines seem to have been written by a fifteen year old though they are trying oh so so hard to sound like how a fifteen year old would really um you know well talk 0 
love it great armband 1 
i love my 350 headset my jabra350 bluetooth headset is great the reception is very good and the ear piece is a comfortable fit 1 
the acting was decidely wooden though no worse than a period universal b movie 0 
this is the first phone ive had that has been so cheaply made 0 
i highly recommend this device to everyone 1 
headset works great was packaged nicely to avoid any damage 1 
battery has no life 0 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
the service was a bit lacking 0 
ray charles life provided excellent biographical material for the film which goes well beyond being just another movie about a musician 1 
although i very much liked the look and sound of this place the actual experience was a bit disappointing 0 
i was bored throughout the whole damn thing 0 
spend your money and time some place else 0 
absolutely great 1 
my mother and brother had to do thiswhen i saw robert ryan portraying this type of man it was a very good imitation of this type of individual and i was impressed 1 
i rate this movie 910 1 
the ngage is still lacking in earbuds 0 
have been going since 2007 and every meal has been awesome 1 
every element of this story was so over the top excessively phony and contrived that it was painful to sit through 0 
the fried rice was dry as well 0 
this greedy corporation will never see another dime from me 0 
go rent it 1 
each track commands sentiment actually contributing to the scenes and characters 1 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
oh this is such a thing of beauty this restaurant 1 
cinematography noteworthy including fine views of barcelona and its famed gaudi towers 1 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
it is wonderful and inspiring to watch and i hope that it gets released again on to video or dvd 1 
these headphones were a great find and i think they are perhaps the best purchase ive made in the last several years seriously 1 
we sat another ten minutes and finally gave up and left 0 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
my rating just 3 out of 10 0 
i left the theater with a lilt in my step joy in my heart and hope for the human race 1 
i just wanted to leave 0 
i received my orders well within the shipping timeframe everything was in good working order and overall i am very excited to have this source 1 
when my mom and i got home she immediately got sick and she only had a few bites of salad 0 
this is by far the worst purchase ive made on amazon 0 
alexander nevsky is a great film 1 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
think of the film being like a dream 1 
he cant act one of the least scary villains i have ever seen he cant write did he write this damn movie in his sleep 0 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
in the span of an hour i had two people exclaim whoa is that the new phone on tv 1 
i believe every one should see this movie as i think few people outside of south africa understand its past and what is being attempted in the truth and reconciliation process 1 
the 12 mega pixel camera being a part of a phone is reasonably good7 1 
lots of holes in the script 0 
the story unfolds in 18th century jutland and the use of period music played on period instruments is just one more fine touch 1 
this place receives stars for their appetizers 1 
nice sound 1 
star trek v the final frontier is the worst in the series 0 
the film is well paced understated and one of the best courtroom documentaries ive seen 1 
my order was not correct 0 
i ate there twice on my last visit and especially enjoyed the salmon salad 1 
highquality chicken on the chicken caesar salad 1 
ray charles life provided excellent biographical material for the film which goes well beyond being just another movie about a musician 1 
this is a beautiful phone 1 
sam shepards portrayal of a gung ho marine was sobering 1 
for a product that costs as much as this one does i expect it to work far better and with greater ease than this thing does 0 
the new characters werent all that memorable and i found myself forgetting who was who 0 
a bit predictable 0 
it was so cool 1 
the food sucked which we expected but it sucked more than we could have imagined 0 
perfect for someone me who only likes beer ice cold or in this case even colder 1 
i love the look and feel of samsung flipphones 1 
i liked the patio and the service was outstanding 1 
in a word it is embarrassing 0 
summary the witticisms werent witty 0 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
there are so many problems i dont know where to start 0 
as for the service i thought it was good 1 
another thing i didnt really like is when a character got punched in the face a gallon of blood would spew forth soon after 0 
i even dropped this phone into a stream and it was submerged for 15 seconds and it still works great 1 
theres also enough hypocrisy in this film to make me vomit 0 
i had ordered a motorola data cable got a very well finished and working product 1 
i love this bluetooth 1 
i wish i could enter negative values admins 0 
i guess i should have known that this place would suck because it is inside of the excalibur but i didnt use my common sense 0 
i didnt know pulled pork could be soooo delicious 1 
awesome selection of beer 1 
it felt too light and tinny 0 
for the price on amazon it is an excellent product which i would highly recommend 1 
service was very prompt 1 
and i just love the colors 1 
nice blanket of moz over top but i feel like this was done to cover up the subpar food 1 
its a mediocre miserable hollow laughable and predictable piece of garbage 0 
the kids are annoying 0 
all of the tapas dishes were delicious 1 
the food was great as always compliments to the chef 1 
service is quick and friendly 1 
con spotty service 0 
this is a stunning movie 1 
great service and food 1 
what makes this story different are the terrific production values faultless photography composition and editing the terrific casting the underappreciated brian keith playing a bully teddy and vivid history 1 
poorly contstruct hinge 0 
our server was super nice and checked on us many times 1 
i did not expect this to be so good 1 
people who like european films and art movies will like this movie 1 
new battery works great in phone 1 
highly recommended 1 
im trying to return it for a refund 0 
ill definitely be in soon again 1 
poorly contstruct hinge 0 
the explosion of the gas tanks at the end was just as awful 0 
despite how hard i rate businesses its actually rare for me to give a 1 star 0 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
is pretty funny 1 
echo problemvery unsatisfactory 0 
buyerbe very careful 0 
audio quality is poor very poor 0 
cant get the software to work with my computer 0 
the instruction manual is lacking 0 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
this place is amazing 1 
a very good film indeed about great and unconditional love 1 
in the span of an hour i had two people exclaim whoa is that the new phone on tv 1 
this is the phone to get for 2005 i just bought my s710a and all i can say is wow 1 
not nearly as good looking as the amazon picture makes it look 0 
but the actingeven that of such professionals as drago and debbie rochonwas terrible the directing worse perhaps contributory to the former the dialog chimplike and the camera work barely tolerable 0 
he came running after us when he realized my husband had left his sunglasses on the table 1 
each day of the week they have a different deal and its all so delicious 1 
trying to make a call on these is an exercise in frustration 0 
the service was terrible though 0 
sucked most of the stuff does not work with my phone 0 
a very very very slowmoving aimless movie about a distressed drifting young man 0 
it does everything the description said it would 1 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
at a time when it seems that film animation has been dominated by disneypixars cgi masterpieces it is both refreshing and comforting to know that miyazaki is still relying on traditional handdrawn animation to tell his charming and enchanting stories 1 
both rickman and stowe play their roles to the hilt in this tale of a childrens book writer who maybe has written a subversive tract 1 
i have to mention this and it is a huge spoiler i loved the ending how all the characters of the three films were the remaining survivors of the ferry disaster with valentine and the young judge together and the old man watching it on her tv solidifying his happiness over the suffering which he dealt with for those many years 1 
not good enough for the price 0 
but this movie really got to me 1 
ryans bar is definitely one edinburgh establishment i wont be revisiting 0 
i never walked out of a movie faster 0 
my rating just 3 out of 10 0 
avoid at any and all costs 0 
in an interesting part of town this place is amazing 1 
we ordered some old classics and some new dishes after going there a few times and were sorely disappointed with everything 0 
we sat another ten minutes and finally gave up and left 0 
however the keypads are so tinny that i sometimes reach the wrong buttons 0 
krussel always good 1 
her role was played well 1 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
plug was the wrong size 0 
i have recommended it to friends 1 
it really is impressive that the place hasnt closed down 0 
you wont forget this movie 1 
yet plantronincs continues to use the same flawed charger design 0 
i consider this theft 0 
the roast beef sandwich tasted really good 1 
this greedy corporation will never see another dime from me 0 
not nearly as good looking as the amazon picture makes it look 0 
rude inconsiderate management 0 
food was great and so was the serivce 1 
the attention given to every character and complex psychological portrayals detailing loyalty treachery love and hope are tremendous 1 
my only complaint is the standard sound volume is a little low even when turned up to 5of 5 0 
it was awesome 1 
everything was good and tasty 1 
highly recommend for any one who has a blue tooth phone 1 
all of the main players are mesmerising 1 
both actors truly understand and become their particular character delivering a convincing sincere performance 1 
paolo sorrentino has written a wonderful story about loneliness and tony has built one of the most unforgettable characters seen in movies in recent years 1 
elias koteasjack palance play good roles angelina is hot and gets nakedbilly drago appears in this and is cool as usual a cameo by sven ole thorsen helps make this a very enjoyable movie with good acting and a decent budget 1 
the characters are interesting and you want to find out more about them the longer the movie goes on and i think people will be surprised by who does and doesnt make it 1 
i loved it 1 
what a disappointment 0 
nice docking station for home or work 1 
definitely worth checking out 1 
its so stupid to have to keep buying new chargers car chargers cradles headphones and car kits every time a new phone comes out 0 
this is such a fun and funny movie 1 
i was mortified 0 
the poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying 0 
he deserves 5 stars 1 
one of the best mexican movies ever and one of the less understood even by mexican themselves no matter how identified the should have felt with it 1 
eew this location needs a complete overhaul 0 
then i watched it again two sundays ago march 20th 2005 and i began to really enjoy it and this time i taped the entire thing 1 
gets the job done 1 
trying to make a call on these is an exercise in frustration 0 
im glad the film didnt go for the most obvious choice as a lesser film certainly would have 1 
highly recommended a 1 
hated it 0 
bad characters bad story and bad acting 0 
1 long lasting battery you dont have to recharge it as frequentyly as some of the flip phones2 0 
nice spicy and tender 1 
my wife had the lobster bisque soup which was lukewarm 0 
i know this is not like the other restaurants at all something is very off here 0 
appears to actually outperform the original battery from china that came with my v325i 1 
how awful she is 0 
i rather enjoyed it 1 
earbud piece breaks easily 0 
hard to judge whether these sides were good because we were grossed out by the melted styrofoam and didnt want to eat it for fear of getting sick 0 
i love this thing 1 
i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
great hands free device 1 
hard to judge whether these sides were good because we were grossed out by the melted styrofoam and didnt want to eat it for fear of getting sick 0 
camera color balance is awful 0 
is pretty funny 1 
sweetest phone 1 
the wind and the lion is well written and superbly acted 1 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
all i have to say is the food was amazing 1 
crostini that came with the salad was stale 0 
there is nothing authentic about this place 0 
it was horrendous 0 
they dropped more than the ball 0 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
simple lightweight and great fit 1 
if you stay in vegas you must get breakfast here at least once 1 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
judith light is one of my favorite actresses and i think she does a superb job in this film 1 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
worked perfectly 1 
those phones are working just fine now 1 
i love their fries and their beans 1 
both of the egg rolls were fantastic 1 
i hope this place sticks around 1 
i know this is not like the other restaurants at all something is very off here 0 
only like 3 or 4 buildings used a couple of locations maybe poor hummh 0 
i kept looking at the time and it had soon become 35 minutes yet still no food 0 
im in az all the time and now have my new spot 1 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
rip off over charge shipping 0 
when i received my pita it was huge it did have a lot of meat in it so thumbs up there 1 
the fries were not hot and neither was my burger 0 
i can think of no other film where something vitally important occurs every other minute 1 
excellent product for the price 1 
barney is definitely super de duper 1 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
not nearly as good looking as the amazon picture makes it look 0 
mediocre food 0 
comfortable fit you need your headset to be comfortable for at least an hour at a time if not for an entire day 1 
at any rate this film stinks its not funny and fulci should have stayed with giallo and supernatural zombie movies 0 
how stupid is that 0 
best service and food ever maria our server was so good and friendly she made our day 1 
i would give this television series a 10 plus if i could 1 
you could drive a semi truck into these holes 0 
love this headset 1 
i have had this phone for over a year now and i will tell you its not that great 0 
horrible horrible protector 0 
great phone 1 
i will never forget it now 1 
not loud enough and doesnt turn on like it should 0 
cant store anything but phone numbers to sim 0 
has been working great 1 
not good enough for the price 0 
best ive found so far ive tried 2 other bluetooths and this one has the best quality for both me and the listener as well as ease of using 1 
the pancake was also really good and pretty large at that 1 
best headset ever 1 
the ngage is still lacking in earbuds 0 
still waiting im sure this item would work well if i ever recieve it 0 
im still trying to get over how bad it was 0 
however bt headsets are currently not good for real time games like firstperson shooters since the audio delay messes me up 0 
i can say that the desserts were yummy 1 
not only did the software do a great job of this i could also make my own ringtones form my existing cds without an internet connection 1 
it has all the features i want 1 
ive dropped my phone more times than i can say even on concrete and my phone is still great knock on wood 1 
excellent sound battery life and inconspicuous to boot 1 
by this time our side of the restaurant was almost empty so there was no excuse 0 
definitely a turn off for me i doubt ill be back unless someone else is buying 0 
classywarm atmosphere fun and fresh appetizers succulent steaks baseball steak 1 
it had some average acting from the main person and it was a low budget as you clearly can see 0 
the wind and the lion is well written and superbly acted 1 
the ngage is still lacking in earbuds 0 
wow what a bad film 0 
all it took was one drop from about 6 inches above the kitchen counter and it was crackedi am not impressed and i am not laughing 0 
all i have to say is the food was amazing 1 
its too bad the food is so damn generic 0 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
i do think tom hanks is a good actor 1 
its been my choice headset for yearsgreat sound good volume good noise cancellation 1 
not my thing 0 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
camerawork again bad 0 
great food 1 
the only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive 1 
an amazing finale to possibly the best trilogy of all time 1 
no plot whatsoever 0 
but she is still a bad actress repeating her robotic face moves in each of her pictures 0 
talk about useless customer service 0 
camera color balance is awful 0 
great price too 1 
happy so far 1 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
i searched the internet and found this one to be the best value 1 
favorite place in town for shawarrrrrrma 1 
definitely will come back here again 1 
phenomenal food service and ambiance 1 
the only downside is the service 0 
this case seems well made 1 
it will drive you barking mad 0 
it was pretty gross 0 
would not go back 0 
the least said about the acting the better 0 
this place is way too overpriced for mediocre food 0 
works like a charm it work the same as the one i got with the phone 1 
no real improvement 0 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
i am a fan of his this movie sucked really bad 0 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
a great film by a great director 1 
terrible phone holder 0 
i gave it 5 stars because of the sound quality 1 
both do good jobs and are quite amusing 1 
my only problem is i thought the actor playing the villain was a low rent michael ironside 0 
what is even more stupid is that who had thought an idea that there should be a volcano in los angeles 0 
the casting is also horrible cause all you see is a really really bad actors period 0 
delicious 1 
still waiting im sure this item would work well if i ever recieve it 0 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
if you havent gone here go now 1 
again lame 0 
the restaurant is very clean and has a family restaurant feel to it 1 
the worst phone ive ever had only had it for a few months 0 
in fact i liked it better than interview with a vampire and i liked this lestat stuart townsend better than cruises attempt 1 
you have to hold the phone at a particular angle for the other party to hear you clearly 0 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
weve have gotten a much better service from the pizza place next door than the services we received from this restaurant 0 
you wont regret it 1 
i liked this movie way too much 1 
i love lane but ive never seen her in a movie this lousy 0 
i love all the features and form factor 1 
avoid at all costs 0 
its too bad that everyone else involved didnt share crowes level of dedication to quality for if they did wed have a far better film on our hands than this subpar mess 0 
the chips and sals a here is amazing 1 
this is cool because most cases are just open there allowing the screen to get all scratched up 1 
there is so much good food in vegas that i feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to rice and company 0 
att is not clear sound is very distorted and you have to yell when you talk 0 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
great phone 1 
dont buy this product it fails 0 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
this is a bad film with bad writing and good actorsan ugly cartoon crafted by paul haggis for people who cant handle anything but the bold strokes in storytellinga picture painted with crayons 0 
worst customer service 0 
does not fit 0 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
very much disappointed with this company 0 
i felt asleep the first time i watched it so i can recommend it for insomniacs 0 
which has more depth and character than the man underneath it 0 
definitely will come back here again 1 
didnt laugh or even smile once 0 
very true to shakespear and a must for all shakespear fans 1 
great earpiece 1
