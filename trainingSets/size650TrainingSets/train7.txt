avoid this establishment 0 
i give wirefly 1 stari will contact cingularatt and inform them of this practice 0 
the shower area is outside so you can only rinse not take a full shower unless you dont mind being nude for everyone to see 0 
the crÃªpe was delicate and thin and moist 1 
the veggitarian platter is out of this world 1 
i liked it 1 
i am a fan of his this movie sucked really bad 0 
the scallop dish is quite appalling for value as well 0 
its a great item 1 
an hour seriously 0 
as for the mains also uninspired 0 
the characters are interesting and you really care for them 1 
this convention never worked well in the past and certainly doesnt work here 0 
both the hot sour the egg flower soups were absolutely 5 stars 1 
very unreliable service from tmobile 0 
small sleek impressive looking practical setup with ample storage in place 1 
the volume switch rocketed out of the unit to a destination unknown 0 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
yes its that bad 0 
dont make the same mistake i did 0 
the structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema 1 
they made this case too small and is very difficult to install 0 
unfortunately this is a bad movie that is just plain bad 0 
i wont be back 0 
setup went very smoothly 1 
bluetooth range is good a few days ago i left my phone in the trunk got a call and carried the conversation without a hitch 1 
dont waste your money 0 
it also took her forever to bring us the check when we asked for it 0 
we recently witnessed her poor quality of management towards other guests as well 0 
doesnt hold charge 0 
great food and great service in a clean and friendly setting 1 
perhaps i caught them on an off night judging by the other reviews but im not inspired to go back 0 
his losing his marbles so early in the proceedings is totally implausible and unconvincing 0 
good case 1 
my first visit to hiro was a delight 1 
i have had problems wit hit dropping signal and more 0 
frankly after cotton club and unfaithful it was kind of embarrassing to watch lane and gere in this film because it is bad 0 
i ordered the voodoo pasta and it was the first time id had really excellent pasta since going gluten free several years ago 1 
yet plantronincs continues to use the same flawed charger design 0 
definitely worth seeing its the sort of thought provoking film that forces you to question your own threshold of loneliness 1 
in the summer you can dine in a charming outdoor patio so very delightful 1 
i recently tried caballeros and i have been back every week since 1 
trouble is the writing and directing make it impossible to establish those things that make a movie watchable like character story theme and so on 0 
does not work for listening to music with the cingular 8125 0 
i do love sushi but i found kabuki to be overpriced overhip and underservices 0 
now i know that i made a wise decision 1 
after i pulled up my car i waited for another 15 minutes before being acknowledged 0 
this device is great in several situations1 1 
the burger had absolutely no flavor the meat itself was totally bland the burger was overcooked and there was no charcoal flavor 0 
i believe that pitch black was done well 1 
it also had a new problem 0 
we loved the biscuits 1 
punishment park is a brilliant piece of cinema 1 
dont waste your time 0 
also were served hot bread and butter and home made potato chips with bacon bits on topvery original and very good 1 
one nice thing was that they added gratuity on the bill since our party was larger than 6 or 8 and they didnt expect more tip than that 1 
its just painful 0 
both do good jobs and are quite amusing 1 
product is exactly as described 1 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
and there wasnt a single sour note struck actingwise either some surprisingly solid casting here 1 
clear skype calls long battery life long range 1 
this movie is bad 0 
the sangria was about half of a glass wine full and was 12 ridiculous 0 
we waited for thirty minutes to be seated although there were 8 vacant tables and we were the only folks waiting 0 
if you do go see this movie bring a pillow or a girlfriendboyfriend to keep you occupied through out 0 
ive had no trouble accessing the internet downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions 1 
on a positive note our server was very attentive and provided great service 1 
almost everyone involved must be return to school acting is utterly predictable and bad script is pile of garbage all round 0 
none of them are engaging or exciting 0 
this product had a strong rubberpetroleum smell that was unbearable after a while and caused me to return it 0 
very funny 1 
would not reccommend 0 
it was a long time that i didnt see a so charismatic actor on screen 1 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
awful 0 
as i said abovepretty useless 0 
while you dont yet hear mickey speak there are tons of sound effects and music throughout the filmsomething we take for granted now but which was a huge crowd pleaser in 1928 1 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
does everything it should and more 1 
excellent hands free tool 1 
ive also had problems with the phone reading the memory card in which i always turn it on and then off again 0 
things happen characters personalities change plot twists occur for no real reason other than that script calls for it 0 
thank you for such great service 1 
then as if i hadnt wasted enough of my life there they poured salt in the wound by drawing out the time it took to bring the check 0 
poor product 0 
dont buy this product it fails 0 
its just painful 0 
the success of the film depends on the casting of sydney greenstreet as the alexander yardley character 1 
everything stinks 0 
the story is beyond stupid 0 
i must say i have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again 1 
from here on the widmark character turns unintentionally comical 0 
service is quick and friendly 1 
i had a salad with the wings and some ice cream for dessert and left feeling quite satisfied 1 
the hockey scenes are terrible defensemen playing like theyre 5 years old goalies diving at shots that are 10 feet wide of the net etc 0 
rude inconsiderate management 0 
it kept getting worse and worse so now im officially done 0 
ive had this for nearly 2 years and it has worked great for me 1 
poorly contstruct hinge 0 
the characters were all funny and had the peculiarity of not having a true lead character 1 
things that went wrong they burned the saganaki 0 
the characters are fleshed out surprisingly well particularly grimes and blake and all the actors deliver their sharply scripted lines with just the right amount of deadpan tongue in cheek to make the dialogue both hilarious and realistic 1 
to sum the film up breeders is a terrible cheaply made horror movie that should be avoided like the ebola virus 0 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
the yellowtail carpaccio was melt in your mouth fresh 1 
what possesed me to get this junk i have no idea 0 
the service was outshining i definitely recommend the halibut 1 
this is a good battery and it got here really fast 1 
things that went wrong they burned the saganaki 0 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
i swung in to give them a try but was deeply disappointed 0 
basically the service was very bad 0 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
but the movie makes a lot of serious mistakes 0 
the phone loads super 1 
the pizza tasted old super chewy in not a good way 0 
predictable but not a bad watch 1 
this pda rocks 1 
ambience is perfect 1 
babie bop is very cute 1 
food was really boring 0 
waste of 13 bucks 0 
their menu is diverse and reasonably priced 1 
the script is a big flawed mess 0 
if good intentions made a film great then this film might be one of the greatest films ever made 1 
poor quality and service 0 
i have bought this nokia cell phone a few weeks ago and it was a nightmare 0 
easy to use 1 
very very fun chef 1 
enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film 1 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
the color is even prettier than i thought it would be and the graphics are incredibly sharp 1 
i am so pleased to know such a modern day genius is out there letting is passion for art drive him and taking us as an audience with him 1 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
there are the usual hitchcock logic flaws 0 
the camera although rated at an impressive 13 megapixels renders images that fall well below expectations of such a relatively high resolution 0 
im not eating here 0 
so far so good 1 
stopped by during the late may bank holiday off rick steve recommendation and loved it 1 
bluetooth does not work phone locks up screens just flash up and now it just makes calls randomly while in my pocket locked 0 
the jabra eargels fit my ears very well 1 
my only complaint is the standard sound volume is a little low even when turned up to 5of 5 0 
this place is great 1 
plus it was wellpaced and suited its relatively short run time 1 
i would have given no star if i was able 0 
the owners are super friendly and the staff is courteous 1 
ill put this gem up against any movie in terms of screenplay cinematography acting postproduction editing directing or any other aspect of filmmaking 1 
terrible phone holder 0 
the visual effects were awful 0 
i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
both of them were truly unbelievably good and i am so glad we went back 1 
its a shame to see good actors like thomerson and james make a living in a mess like this 0 
it looses connection to the phone even when it is within a couple feet between the two 0 
design flaw 0 
just does not work 0 
this is infuriating 0 
the handsfree part works fine but then the car tries to download the address book and the treo rebootsoverall i still rate this device high 1 
think it over when you plan to own this onethis sure is the last moto phone for me 0 
very cheap plastic creaks like an old wooden floor 0 
great phone 1 
this one works and was priced right 1 
what on earth is irons doing in this film 0 
the sides are delish mixed mushrooms yukon gold puree white corn beateous 1 
with great sound effects and impressive special effects i cant recommend this movie enough 1 
better than youd expect 1 
at first i thought i was grtting a good deal at 744 until i plugged it into my phone v3c razr 0 
a good quality bargain i bought this after i bought a cheapy from big lots that sounded awful and people on the other end couldnt hear me 1 
no real improvement 0 
in particular the relationship between the bakery assistant and the waitress just didnt work for me at all 0 
the opening sequence of this gem is a classic and the cat n mouse games that follow are a delight to watch 1 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
it is shameful 0 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
the film has an ultracheap look to it 0 
bad day or not i have a very low tolerance for rude customer service people it is your job to be nice and polite wash dishes otherwise 0 
spend your money elsewhere 0 
service was exceptional and food was a good as all the reviews 1 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
this product is great it makes working a lot easier i can go to the copier while waiting on hold for something 1 
sucked most of the stuff does not work with my phone 0 
the sound quality is good and functionality is awesome 1 
its a fresh subtle and rather sublime effect 1 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
as for the service i thought it was good 1 
there is nothing privileged about workingeating there 0 
before i go in to why i gave a 1 star rating please know that this was my third time eating at bachi burger before writing a review 0 
a usable keyboard actually turns a pda into a realworld useful machine instead of just a neat gadget 1 
total waste of time 0 
the plot simply rumbles on like a machine desperately depending on the addition of new scenes 0 
there are the usual hitchcock logic flaws 0 
the menu is always changing food quality is going down service is extremely slow 0 
horrible dont waste your time and money 0 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
it fits my ear well and is comfortable on 1 
this is some seriously good pizza and im an expertconnisseur on the topic 1 
the real killer is the volume and of course it breaking 0 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
what a piece of junk i lose more calls on this phone 0 
i dont know exactly what it is about this movie but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our familys memories 1 
this is one of the worst sandra bullock movie since speed 2 but not quite that bad 0 
highly unrecommended 0 
while i managed to bend the leaf spring back in place the metal now has enough stress that it will break on the next drop 0 
the ripped banana was not only ripped but petrified and tasteless 0 
great brunch spot 1 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
ive had better not only from dedicated boba tea spots but even from jenni pho 0 
great product and price 1 
this is an excellent film 1 
sending it back 0 
great for ipods too 1 
good product good seller 1 
110 and only because there is no setting for 010 0 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
i had about two bites and refused to eat anymore 0 
it plays louder than any other speaker of this size the price is so low that most would think the quality is lacking however its not 1 
the best electronics of the available fm transmitters 1 
a good time 1 
i had a seriously solid breakfast here 1 
the color is even prettier than i thought it would be and the graphics are incredibly sharp 1 
the script is was there a script 0 
small sleek impressive looking practical setup with ample storage in place 1 
this is probably the most irritating show i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
but in any case the best part is you can download these pictures to your laptop using ir or even send pictures from your laptop to the phone 1 
but it wasnt until i watched this film that i realised how great he actually was 1 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
what a big waste of time 0 
dont waste your time here 0 
it didnt work people can not hear me when i talk 0 
dont buy this product 0 
very disappointing 0 
this place receives stars for their appetizers 1 
the tracfonewebsite is user friendly and makes it easy toactivate etc 1 
i have bought this nokia cell phone a few weeks ago and it was a nightmare 0 
horrible phone 0 
it was absolutely amazing 1 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
overall i rate this movie a 10 out of a 110 scale 1 
voice recognition is tremendous 1 
now you know why i gave it a 10 1 
i do think tom hanks is a good actor 1 
everything captain howdy says is either laughable or just plain stupid 0 
poor quality and service 0 
i wont say any more i dont like spoilers so i dont want to be one but i believe this film is worth your time 1 
it dit not work most of the time with my nokia 5320 0 
bought mainly for the charger which broke soon after purchasing 0 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
ordered burger rare came in well done 0 
their menu is diverse and reasonably priced 1 
it even has its sweet moments 1 
poor quality 0 
just as good as when i had it more than a year ago 1 
integrated seamlessly with the motorola razr phone 1 
i went to bachi burger on a friends recommendation and was not disappointed 1 
i will come back here every time im in vegas 1 
at first glance it is a lovely bakery cafe nice ambiance clean friendly staff 1 
easy to pair with my samsung cell 1 
this really is how vegas fine dining used to be right down to the menus handed to the ladies that have no prices listed 1 
i have never had such bland food which surprised me considering the article we read focused so much on their spices and flavor 0 
a happy wonderful feel good ending 1 
great movie 1 
pretty piece of junk 0 
highquality chicken on the chicken caesar salad 1 
her role was played well 1 
i advise you to look out for it 1 
great product 1 
other than that the leather is nice and soft the fit is very tight the cut out for the face is a good shape 1 
painful on the ear 0 
this film has no redeeming features 0 
no additional ear gels provided and no instructions whatsoever 0 
how awesome is that 1 
one of the best mexican movies ever and one of the less understood even by mexican themselves no matter how identified the should have felt with it 1 
stopped by during the late may bank holiday off rick steve recommendation and loved it 1 
penne vodka excellent 1 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
the service was outshining i definitely recommend the halibut 1 
great product fast shipping 1 
the foreigner is not worth one second of your time 0 
works like a charm it work the same as the one i got with the phone 1 
you learn a lot about the real inside emotions of people in this movie and a lot about the movie business itself 1 
not impressed 0 
my breakfast was perpared great with a beautiful presentation of 3 giant slices of toast lightly dusted with powdered sugar 1 
very cheap plastic creaks like an old wooden floor 0 
we asked for the bill to leave without eating and they didnt bring that either 0 
very good though 1 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
the least said about the acting the better 0 
good case 1 
pretty good beer selection too 1 
i love lane but ive never seen her in a movie this lousy 0 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
when i received my pita it was huge it did have a lot of meat in it so thumbs up there 1 
love the margaritas too 1 
also the story and acting were weak 0 
overpriced for what you are getting 0 
omg the food was delicioso 1 
i had the chicken pho and it tasted very bland 0 
so there is no way for me to plug it in here in the us unless i go by a converter 0 
the acting is beyond abysmal 0 
bland not a liking this place for a number of reasons and i dont want to waste time on bad reviewing ill leave it at that 0 
it really created a unique feeling though 1 
great atmosphere friendly and fast service 1 
total letdown i would much rather just go to the camelback flower shop and cartel coffee 0 
the scenes are often funny and occasionally touching as the characters evaluate their lives and where they are going 1 
service is quick and even to go orders are just like we like it 1 
they are so easy to love but even more easy to identify with 1 
if you want a sandwich just go to any firehouse 1 
i dont think it would hold it too securly on your belt 0 
a drive thru means you do not want to wait around for half an hour for your food but somehow when we end up going here they make us wait and wait 0 
ive dropped my phone more times than i can say even on concrete and my phone is still great knock on wood 1 
the accompanied software is almost brilliant 1 
elias koteasjack palance play good roles angelina is hot and gets nakedbilly drago appears in this and is cool as usual a cameo by sven ole thorsen helps make this a very enjoyable movie with good acting and a decent budget 1 
i checked out this place a couple years ago and was not impressed 0 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
unfortunately it did not work 0 
and the red curry had so much bamboo shoots and wasnt very tasty to me 0 
it holds a charge for a long time is reasonably comfortable under longwearing conditions and the quality of sound is tremendous 1 
my headset works just peachykeen 1 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
razr battery good buy 1 
to those who find this movie intelligent or even masterful i can only say its your intelligence and your imagination you obviously used to try and make some sense of this pitiful attempt its in our human nature to try and make sense of things 0 
phone now holds charge like it did when it was new 1 
kris kristoffersen is good in this movie and really makes a difference 1 
so i am here to warn youdo not rent this movie it is the dumbest thing you have never seen 0 
nevertheless yet another wonderful film from the great masters stable 1 
but when i check voice mail at night the keypad backlight turns off a few seconds into the first message and then im lost 0 
this place deserves one star and 90 has to do with the food 0 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
i want to first say our server was great and we had perfect service 1 
the acting by the whole cast could be put on a scale and balanced perfectly between overacting and underacting 0 
does everything it should and more 1 
lately they have been extremely nice and helpful on the phone 1 
fantastic earphones 1 
then i exchanged for the same phone even that had the same problem 0 
the camera really likes her in this movie 1 
this is a masterful piece of filmmaking with many themes simmering and occasionally boiling over in this warts and all study of the poets bohemian selfindulgent wartime years that span the aerial bombardments of london and the outward tranquillity of a welsh coastal retreat the borderlines between friendship lust and love dedication to art and experience versus practical concerns jealousy rivalry cowardice and egotism versus heroism and selfsacrifice and more 1 
it was a long time that i didnt see a so charismatic actor on screen 1 
some may say this buffet is pricey but i think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot 1 
i know this is not like the other restaurants at all something is very off here 0 
very disappointing 0 
this isnt a small family restaurant this is a fine dining establishment 1 
great headset very impressed h500 1 
you also cannot take pictures with it in the case because the lense is covered 0 
unfortunately it did not work 0 
its so stupid to have to keep buying new chargers car chargers cradles headphones and car kits every time a new phone comes out 0 
all in all i can assure you ill be back 1 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
the plot has more holes than a pair of fishnet stockings and the direction and editing is astonishingly ham fisted 0 
the jalapeno bacon is soooo good 1 
the owners are super friendly and the staff is courteous 1 
my 810 score is mostly for the plot 1 
ample portions and good prices 1 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
the handsfree part works fine but then the car tries to download the address book and the treo rebootsoverall i still rate this device high 1 
the chicken dishes are ok the beef is like shoe leather 0 
nice headset priced right 1 
this is a great little item 1 
could not get strong enough signal 0 
works as described 1 
better than youd expect 1 
the text messaging feature is really tricky to use 0 
the service was outshining i definitely recommend the halibut 1 
every element of this story was so over the top excessively phony and contrived that it was painful to sit through 0 
tonight i had the elk filet specialand it sucked 0 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
its just painful 0 
not even a hello we will be right with you 0 
it felt like a very gripping intelligent stage play but without the overly theatrical feeling one actually gets from watching people on a stage which plays on everyones terror of a white lie escalating to monstrous consequences 1 
this is the first phone ive had that has been so cheaply made 0 
and finally after all that we get to an ending that wouldve been great had it been handled by competent people and not jerry falwell 0 
overall a delight 1 
its reception is very very poor 0 
went for lunch service was slow 0 
we literally sat there for 20 minutes with no one asking to take our order 0 
a very good film indeed about great and unconditional love 1 
conclusion very filling meals 1 
design flaw 0 
if it was to turn my good day feeling into a night of disturbing memories than i guess he succeeded 0 
waste of money 0 
item arrived quickly and works great with my metro pcs samsung schr450 slider phone and sony premium sound in ear plugs 1 
lately they have been extremely nice and helpful on the phone 1 
uncomfortable in the ear dont use with lg vx9900 env 0 
and considering the two of us left there very full and happy for about 20 you just cant go wrong 1 
i have been to very few places to eat that under no circumstances would i ever return to and this tops the list 0 
the vanilla ice cream was creamy and smooth while the profiterole choux pastry was fresh enough 1 
the jerky camera movements were also annoying 0 
happy so far 1 
appears to actually outperform the original battery from china that came with my v325i 1 
this greedy corporation will never see another dime from me 0 
a good film by a great director 1 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
ordered an appetizer and took 40 minutes and then the pizza another 10 minutes 0 
it isnt even an achievement as a sobaditsgood or sobaditsmemorable movie 0 
the service here is fair at best 0 
you wont regret it 1 
the movie is littered with overt racial slurs towards the black cast members and in return the whites are depicted as morons and boobs 0 
i paid too much 0 
great hands free device 1 
it has everything i need and i couldnt ask for more 1 
it didnt work people can not hear me when i talk 0 
and there wasnt a single sour note struck actingwise either some surprisingly solid casting here 1 
great product fast shipping 1 
doesnt do the job 0 
this place is like chipotle but better 1 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
dont buy this product it fails 0 
this one wants to surf on the small wave of space movies in 1998 deep impact and armageddon and this one fails everywhere 0 
it makes very strange ticking noises before it ends the call 0 
i seriously cannot believe that the owner has so many unexperienced employees that all are running around like chickens with their heads cut off 0 
it is just the sort of pap that is screened in the afternoon to punish the unemployed for not having jobs 0 
the script is horrendously stupid 0 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
there are so many problems i dont know where to start 0 
all in all a great disappointment 0 
i waited and waited 0 
this review is long overdue since i consider a tale of two sisters to be the single greatest film ever made 1 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
in summary this was a largely disappointing dining experience 0 
echo problemvery unsatisfactory 0 
i was hoping for more 0 
great pork sandwich 1 
unfortunately cover girl is an example of how hollywood used to exploit women for financial gain 0 
im really disappointed all i have now is a charger that doesnt work 0 
a piece of cinematic garbage captured on celluloid 0 
absolutely great 1 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
thank you for such great service 1 
design flaw 0 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
it rocked my world and is certainly a must see for anyone with no social or physical outlets 1 
easy to pair with my samsung cell 1 
my friend loved the salmon tartar 1 
i saw it as a child on tv back in 1973 when it was the stranger and i loved it 1 
i saw it as a child on tv back in 1973 when it was the stranger and i loved it 1 
its really easy 1 
overall i like there food and the service 1 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
works for me 1 
the charger worked for about a week and then completely stopped charging my phone 0 
it was probably dirt 0 
which has more depth and character than the man underneath it 0 
shes poised and amazing 1 
the secondary plot line is incomprehensible and its relation to the primary plot line is mystifying 0 
not good when wearing a hat or sunglasses 0 
linksys should have some way to exchange a bad phone for a refurb unit or something 0 
very slow at seating even with reservation 0 
after 3 months screen just went black all of a sudden 0 
does not work for listening to music with the cingular 8125 0 
i tried talking real loud but shouting on the telephone gets old and i was still told it wasnt great 0 
how awesome is that 1 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
never got it 0 
i must say i have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again 1 
i get absolutely horrible reception in my apartment where with other phones i have not had this problem 0 
great service and food 1 
five star plus plus 1 
the food was outstanding and the prices were very reasonable 1 
and the accents are absolutely abysmal 0 
the fried rice was dry as well 0 
still i do like this movie for its empowerment of women theres not enough movies out there like this one 1 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
recommend with confidence 1 
at a time when it seems that film animation has been dominated by disneypixars cgi masterpieces it is both refreshing and comforting to know that miyazaki is still relying on traditional handdrawn animation to tell his charming and enchanting stories 1 
the screen size is big key pad lit well enough and the camera quality is excellent for a camera phone 1 
very tough and very short on flavor 0 
the result is a powerhouse achievement made more timely now perhaps because of our cultures disturbing fascination with celebrity and its distorted interpretations of fame 1 
i have been very happy with the 510 and have had no complaints from any one regarding my sound quality on their end 1 
i probably wont be coming back here 0 
the steak was amazingrge fillet relleno was the best seafood plate i have ever had 1 
hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in 0 
this is actually a very smart movie 1 
this was utterly confusing at first which caused me to lose a couple of very very important contacts 0 
its a long time since i was so entertained by a movie 1 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
i wear glasses and it fits fine with them 1 
the volume for the ringer is real good you have choices how loud 1 
not enough volume 0 
i can say that the desserts were yummy 1 
beware this is not a trashy cult movie this is trash period 0 
the bipolarity of the ruthless thug one minute a ruthless killer the next minute a luvs diaper commercial is completely unconvincing 0 
my fiancÃ© and i came in the middle of the day and we were greeted and seated right away 1 
all in all ha long bay was a bit of a flop 0 
it clicks into place in a way that makes you wonder how long that mechanism would last 0 
great food and awesome service 1 
it didnt charge for me 0 
well never go again 0 
i was totally fascinated by the music the dancing everything 1 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
it will drive you barking mad 0 
absolutely great 1 
the servers went back and forth several times not even so much as an are you being helped 0 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
again lame 0 
lewis blacks considerable talent is wasted here too as he is at his most incendiary when he is unrestrained which the pg13 rating certainly wont allow 0 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
avoid at all costs 0 
it was a waste of my money 0 
so there is no way for me to plug it in here in the us unless i go by a converter 0 
spend your money and time some place else 0 
the characters are interesting even if a bit predictable 1 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
nice leather 1 
but if you liked movies like the matrix and better yet their sequels i think youll appreciate the thought provoking mindblowing experience this film will give you 1 
dont buy this product it fails 0 
classywarm atmosphere fun and fresh appetizers succulent steaks baseball steak 1 
appetite instantly gone 0 
the lighting is awful 0 
its kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly its embarrassing how childlike the company is 0 
by the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant i was bored and didnt care what happened next and so i switched off 0 
the only thing i wasnt too crazy about was their guacamole as i dont like it purÃ©ed 0 
i am so tired of clichÃ©s that is just lazy writing and here they come in thick and fast 0 
i saw it as a child on tv back in 1973 when it was the stranger and i loved it 1 
please dont waste your money 0 
i found the product to be easy to set up and use 1 
in short dont bother with this movie 0 
its a case of so bad it is laughable 0 
i let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this bad idea we both hated it 0 
i could eat their bruschetta all day it is devine 1 
horrible dont waste your time and money 0 
the characters were all funny and had the peculiarity of not having a true lead character 1 
nothing at all to recommend 0 
excellent short film 1 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
the cast of veteran actors are more than just a nostalgia trip 1 
the acting sucks the music sucks the script sucks the pacing sucks the special fx suck the directing sucks basically this movie sucks 0 
both actors truly understand and become their particular character delivering a convincing sincere performance 1 
i tried talking real loud but shouting on the telephone gets old and i was still told it wasnt great 0 
an awesome new look for fall 2000 1 
it wasnt busy at all and now we know why 0 
does everything it should and more 1 
the film succeeds despite or perhaps because of an obviously meagre budget 1 
finally after three or four times the spring of the latch broke and i could not use it any longer on the visor 0 
worst customer service ever 0 
what a disappointment 0 
definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly will return next time im in vegas 1 
i dont know what kind it is but they have the best iced tea 1 
this is simply the best bluetooth headset for sound quality 1 
not even good for camp value 0 
lot of holes in the plot theres nothing about how he became the emperor nothing about where he spend 20 years between his childhood and mature age 0 
it has all the features i want 1 
the football scenes at the end were perplexing 0 
damn good steak 1 
i have to use the smallest earpieces provided but it stays on pretty well 1 
the turkey and roast beef were bland 0 
the film is well paced understated and one of the best courtroom documentaries ive seen 1 
very poor service 0 
paolo sorrentino has written a wonderful story about loneliness and tony has built one of the most unforgettable characters seen in movies in recent years 1 
last time buying from you 0 
its a sad movie but very good 1 
weird vibe from owners 0 
the soundtrack sucked 0 
even when the women finally show up there is no sign of improvement the most expected things happen and by the time the film is over you might be far asleep 0 
food was so gooodd 1 
itll be a regular stop on my trips to phoenix 1 
the new characters werent all that memorable and i found myself forgetting who was who 0 
headset works great was packaged nicely to avoid any damage 1 
works good 1 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
i am sorry i made this purchase 0 
oh this is such a thing of beauty this restaurant 1 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
bad reception 0 
i really like this product over the motorola because it is allot clearer on the ear piece and the mic 1 
regrettably the film fails 0 
initially the local sites in the film which was filmed here in buffalo intrigued me 1 
i have bought this nokia cell phone a few weeks ago and it was a nightmare 0 
i left with a stomach ache and felt sick the rest of the day 0 
no shifting no bubbling no peeling not even a scratch nothingi couldnt be more happier with my new one for the droid 1 
i recommend igo to anyone with different brand cell phonesmp3 players in the family 1 
oh this is such a thing of beauty this restaurant 1 
they keep getting better and better this is my third one and ive had numerous palms too 1 
the salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop which was perfectly cooked 1 
this fixes all the problems 1 
not a weekly haunt but definitely a place to come back to every once in a while 1 
thus far have only visited twice and the food was absolutely delicious each time 1 
this is an excellent tool especially when paired with your phones autoanswer 1 
this film has no redeeming features 0 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
hell no will i go back 0 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
what i really like there is the crepe station 1 
how awful she is 0 
overall i like this place a lot 1 
good works fine 1 
i really wanted the plantronics 510 to be the right one but it has too many issues for methe good 0 
it holds a charge for a long time is reasonably comfortable under longwearing conditions and the quality of sound is tremendous 1 
i was not impressed by this product 0 
the cinematography is simply stunning to say the least and the fx are nothing if not stateoftheart 1 
i wish i could enter negative values admins 0 
in an interesting part of town this place is amazing 1 
disappointed with battery 0 
its just adorable seeing mickey playing turkey in the straw in a highly imaginative if occasionally cruel way 1 
the steaks are all well trimmed and also perfectly cooked 1 
the service was meh 0 
generally it just lacked imagination 0 
and i really did find them funny 1 
10 out of 10 for both the movie and trilogy 1 
the 12 mega pixel camera being a part of a phone is reasonably good7 1 
all in all its an insult to ones intelligence and a huge waste of money 0 
works as described 1 
woa talk about awful 0 
very funny 1 
ive had better not only from dedicated boba tea spots but even from jenni pho 0 
i would recommend saving room for this 1 
the burger had absolutely no flavor the meat itself was totally bland the burger was overcooked and there was no charcoal flavor 0 
there is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again 0 
the characters are interesting even if a bit predictable 1 
the service was terrible food was mediocre 0 
very disappointed in accessoryone 0 
we loved the biscuits 1 
great food and service huge portions and they give a military discount 1 
reasonably priced also 1 
i felt asleep the first time i watched it so i can recommend it for insomniacs 0 
the sergeant pepper beef sandwich with auju sauce is an excellent sandwich as well 1 
the worst one of the series 0 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
i bought this phone as a replacement for my startac and have regretted it since 0 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
this product had a strong rubberpetroleum smell that was unbearable after a while and caused me to return it 0 
only had this a month but its worked flawlessly so far 1 
but it wasnt until i watched this film that i realised how great he actually was 1 
it is not good 0 
design flaw 0 
i purcashed this for the car charger and it does not work 0 
nice headset priced right 1 
that was nice 1 
i also decided not to send it back because our waitress looked like she was on the verge of having a heart attack 0 
it has a very good plot it holds your complete attention the acting is superb tom wilkinson was fantastic and emily watson was also very good 1 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
the delivery was on time 1 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
although i very much liked the look and sound of this place the actual experience was a bit disappointing 0 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
they refuse to refund or replace 0 
waitress was sweet and funny 1 
to those who find this movie intelligent or even masterful i can only say its your intelligence and your imagination you obviously used to try and make some sense of this pitiful attempt its in our human nature to try and make sense of things 0 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
great phone 1 
no one at the table thought the food was above average or worth the wait that we had for it 0 
also the story and acting were weak 0 
disappointing experience 0 
its so bad its actually worth seeing just for that reason 0 
if there was ever a movie that needed wordofmouth to promote this is it 1
