im big fan of rpg games too but this movie its a disgrace to any selfrespecting rpger there is 0 
putting the race card aside lets look at the major flaw in the film they destroy latifas character 0 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
first of all there are enough racial stereotypes and racial jokes to offend everyone 0 
all i have to say is the food was amazing 1 
the phone was unusable and was not new 0 
the scenery that the two daughters paint and photograph are beautiful 1 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
i promise they wont disappoint 1 
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0 
great audio 1 
the hockey scenes are terrible defensemen playing like theyre 5 years old goalies diving at shots that are 10 feet wide of the net etc 0 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
juano hernandez an exceptional actor who played supporting roles in many films of the era is a proud black man who is accused of murdering a white man in the south 1 
if that bug never showed up i would have given a 4 for sure but on the other side of the wall where this bug was climbing was the kitchen 0 
this game rocks 1 
the best place in vegas for breakfast just check out a sat or sun 1 
often the dialogue doesnt really follow from one line to another or fit the surroundings 0 
i would recommend saving room for this 1 
despite how hard i rate businesses its actually rare for me to give a 1 star 0 
not to mention the combination of pears almonds and bacon is a big winner 1 
love this product 1 
sweetest phone 1 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
it clicks into place in a way that makes you wonder how long that mechanism would last 0 
lot of holes in the plot theres nothing about how he became the emperor nothing about where he spend 20 years between his childhood and mature age 0 
the text messaging feature is really tricky to use 0 
i love this phone it is very handy and has a lot of features 1 
an absolute must visit 1 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
if you plan to use this in a car forget about it 0 
the scenery that the two daughters paint and photograph are beautiful 1 
it was a drive to get there 0 
crust is not good 0 
nice case feels good in your hands 1 
for those that havent seen it dont waste your time 0 
the only thing i did like was the prime rib and dessert section 1 
brilliance indeed 1 
i can say that the desserts were yummy 1 
ill give this film 10 out of 10 1 
it was a great phone 1 
i have had mine for about a year and this christmas i bought some for the rest of the family 1 
they really want to make your experience a good one 1 
the chicken wings contained the driest chicken meat i have ever eaten 0 
its an empty hollow shell of a movie 0 
great phone 1 
an absolute must visit 1 
the chicken i got was definitely reheated and was only ok the wedges were cold and soggy 0 
poor reliability 0 
then theres the plot holes 0 
you have to hold the phone at a particular angle for the other party to hear you clearly 0 
this place is disgusting 0 
worst martini ever 0 
all in all i can assure you ill be back 1 
were jerks on the phone 0 
special mention should be made of the superb music score and sound effects which are an integral element in helping to make this such a memorable and enjoyable cartoon 1 
this is an outstanding little restaurant with some of the best food i have ever tasted 1 
never got it 0 
i love this place 1 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
took an hour to get our food only 4 tables in restaurant my food was luke warm our sever was running around like he was totally overwhelmed 0 
total brunch fail 0 
excellent phone 1 
i could not stand to even watch it for very long for fear of losing iq 0 
i do love sushi but i found kabuki to be overpriced overhip and underservices 0 
this wonderful experience made this place a muststop whenever we are in town again 1 
not only did the software do a great job of this i could also make my own ringtones form my existing cds without an internet connection 1 
we had a group of 70 when we claimed we would only have 40 and they handled us beautifully 1 
in conclusion i will not bother with this movie because a volcano in los angeles is nothing but nonsense 0 
awesome device 1 
arrived quickly and much less expensive than others being sold 1 
great value 1 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
the story which was told so eloquently by francis ford coppola 25 years earlier really unfolds gradually and leaves room for the characters to develop 1 
the jalapeno bacon is soooo good 1 
artless camerawork endlessly presents us with the ugliest setting imaginable ie 0 
both of them were truly unbelievably good and i am so glad we went back 1 
but i dont like it 0 
but it is great i would really recommend it 1 
i know this is not like the other restaurants at all something is very off here 0 
of course the acting is blah 0 
for that its worth checking out 1 
car charger as well as ac charger are included to make sure you never run out of juicehighy recommended 1 
wont go back 0 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
there was no chemistry between ben affleck and sandra bullock in this film and i couldnt understand why he would consider even leaving his wifetobe for this chick that he supposedly was knocked out by 0 
what a mistake 0 
oh this is such a thing of beauty this restaurant 1 
the use of slowmotion needlessly repeats itself throughout the movie but is well backed up by bad acting and bad is a kind word here no continuity scenes that are thrown in for no reason whatsoever vehicles that looked like they were made from a corn flakes box and a directorial style that bordered on stupidity 0 
we waited for thirty minutes to be seated although there were 8 vacant tables and we were the only folks waiting 0 
i still maintain that monkeys shouldnt make headphones we just obviously dont share enough dna to copy the design over to humans 0 
service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is vegas and located inside the crystals shopping mall by aria 1 
if you havent gone here go now 1 
it always cuts out and makes a beep beep beep sound then says signal failed 0 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
add betty white and jean smart and you have a great cast everyone played their parts really well 1 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
worst thai ever 0 
this greedy corporation will never see another dime from me 0 
she carries the movie well 1 
my headset works just peachykeen 1 
reasonably priced also 1 
about 30 minutes of footage is wasted to show mediocre elderly actors awkwardly babbling overwrought pseudosatanic gibberish corny enough to make a teen goth blush almost always in olde english and sometimes in latin that may or may not be made up words 0 
better than expected 1 
i think it was robert ryans best film because he portrayed someone like my father and he was a schizophrenic in real lifemy father although he never murdered anyone but was affected more so during the second world war which made him worse 1 
the handsfree part works fine but then the car tries to download the address book and the treo rebootsoverall i still rate this device high 1 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
i enjoyed it 1 
dont buy this product 0 
wont ever go here again 0 
to call this movie a drama is ridiculous 0 
this place should honestly be blown up 0 
lucy bell is so much higher than this crap and for her to sink this low is quite depressing 0 
you share general loewenhielms exquisite joy in his partaking of the cailles en sarcophage even though you are just watching a movie but you do wish for just a small sample to savor 1 
shes poised and amazing 1 
this was a different cut than the piece the other day but still wonderful and tender s well as well flavored 1 
the fries were great too 1 
this place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver 0 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurv√•g being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
a great film by a great director 1 
i would highly recommend this product 1 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
my drink was never empty and he made some really great menu suggestions 1 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
a piece of junk that broke after being on my phone for 2 days 0 
you get incredibly fresh fish prepared with care 1 
too politically correct 0 
went for lunch service was slow 0 
the attention given to every character and complex psychological portrayals detailing loyalty treachery love and hope are tremendous 1 
i tried the cape cod ravoli chickenwith cranberrymmmm 1 
yes this film does require a rather significant amount of puzzlesolving but the pieces fit together to create a beautiful picture 1 
to call this movie a drama is ridiculous 0 
the pairing of the two devices was so easy it barely took a couple minutes before i started making calls with the voice dialing feature 1 
the kids are annoying 0 
very disappointed and wondered how it could be in the oscar shortlist 0 
my breakfast was perpared great with a beautiful presentation of 3 giant slices of toast lightly dusted with powdered sugar 1 
it is the best charger i have seen on the market yet 1 
it has all the features i want 1 
as for the service im a fan because its quick and youre being served by some nice folks 1 
for a product that costs as much as this one does i expect it to work far better and with greater ease than this thing does 0 
very good though 1 
like the other reviewer said you couldnt pay me to eat at this place again 0 
in addition it feels amp looks as if the phone is all lightweight cheap plastic 0 
this is one of the better buffets that i have been to 1 
food was really good and i got full petty fast 1 
mic doesnt work 0 
the menu is always changing food quality is going down service is extremely slow 0 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
easy to pair with my samsung cell 1 
poor construction 0 
if good intentions made a film great then this film might be one of the greatest films ever made 1 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
he was very impressed when going from the original battery to the extended battery 1 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
im glad the film didnt go for the most obvious choice as a lesser film certainly would have 1 
in my house i was getting dropped coverage upstairs and no coverage in my basement 0 
i know this is not like the other restaurants at all something is very off here 0 
it probably would have been better if the director hadnt spent most of the movie showcasing his own art work which really isnt that noteworthy 0 
worthless product 0 
and service was super friendly 1 
i did not have any problem with this item and would order it again if needed 1 
dont make the same mistake that i did and please dont buy this phone 0 
hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in 0 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
a disappointment 0 
the food amazing 1 
the service was not up to par either 0 
i ended up sliding it on the edge of my pants or back pockets instead 1 
the cashier was friendly and even brought the food out to me 1 
i dont think you will be disappointed 1 
trouble is the writing and directing make it impossible to establish those things that make a movie watchable like character story theme and so on 0 
i would avoid this place if you are staying in the mirage 0 
nice sound 1 
there is no real plot 0 
totally different with loads of understatement and black comedy this is a film few get to see but those who do will remember it 1 
a good time 1 
this is my new fav vegas buffet spot 1 
go and see it 1 
you can watch them preparing the delicious food 1 
a truly truly bad film 0 
the service was terrible food was mediocre 0 
perfect for the ps3 1 
his costars dont fare much better with people like morgan freeman jonah hill and ed helms just wasted 0 
the lines the cuts the audio everything is wrong 0 
the opening sequence of this gem is a classic and the cat n mouse games that follow are a delight to watch 1 
its very slow 0 
no actress has been worse used that june allison in this movie 0 
i came back today since they relocated and still not impressed 0 
this film has no redeeming features 0 
it has all the features i want 1 
this is one of the better buffets that i have been to 1 
it quit working after id used it for about 18 months so i just purchased another one because this is the best headset ive ever owned 1 
if you havent gone here go now 1 
some may say this buffet is pricey but i think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot 1 
this place deserves one star and 90 has to do with the food 0 
the food was great as always compliments to the chef 1 
what a waste of money and time 0 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
i have eaten here multiple times and each time the food was delicious 1 
great for ipods too 1 
full of unconvincing cardboard characters it is blandly written by edward chodorov who also produced and is surprisingly directed by jean negulesco from whom one would expect a great deal more 0 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
this place was such a nice surprise 1 
and if that isnt enough of a mess of a movie for you the picture is also marred with a constant use of studio sets and indoor exteriors 0 
we ordered the duck rare and it was pink and tender on the inside with a nice char on the outside 1 
great it was new packaged nice works good no problems and it came in less time then i expected 1 
walked in and the place smelled like an old grease trap and only 2 others there eating 0 
i really loved the story line and the poler bear was kinda cutebut if anyone has a question about fort steele just ask away 1 
owners are really great people 1 
poor talk time performance 0 
lasted one day and then blew up 0 
this is was due to the fact that it took 20 minutes to be acknowledged then another 35 minutes to get our foodand they kept forgetting things 0 
awesome service and food 1 
i have had mine for about a year and this christmas i bought some for the rest of the family 1 
all in all i think it was a good investment 1 
i promise they wont disappoint 1 
my fella got the huevos rancheros and they didnt look too appealing 0 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
im terribly disappointed that this film would receive so many awards and accolades especially when there are far more deserving works of film out there 0 
service is perfect and the family atmosphere is nice to see 1 
you get incredibly fresh fish prepared with care 1 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
this was utterly confusing at first which caused me to lose a couple of very very important contacts 0 
but it does get better reception and clarity than any phone ive had before 1 
the cast is always entertaining as usual 1 
now we were chosen to be tortured with this disgusting piece of blatant american propaganda 0 
it definitely was not as good as my s11 1 
if there was ever an indication of a writer and a directors ability to meld two highly volatile temperaments into a seamless union of creativity then this is it 1 
lifetime does not air it enough so if anyone knows what store sells it let me know because this is a musthave 1 
i could care less the interior is just beautiful 1 
what is even more stupid is that who had thought an idea that there should be a volcano in los angeles 0 
the sound quality for the device is unacceptableunless you are in a really quiet area you almost hear nothing 0 
i sat riveted to the tv screen 1 
oh yeah and the storyline was pathetic too 0 
this is so embarassing and also my ears hurt if i try to push the ear plug into my ear 0 
this mostly routine factbased tv drama gets a boost from the fine performance by cole 1 
this isnt a small family restaurant this is a fine dining establishment 1 
i love the ownerchef his one authentic japanese cool dude 1 
his losing his marbles so early in the proceedings is totally implausible and unconvincing 0 
it was also the right balance of war and love 1 
see both films if you can 1 
this is so embarassing and also my ears hurt if i try to push the ear plug into my ear 0 
what happened next was prettyoff putting 0 
it kept getting worse and worse so now im officially done 0 
we asked for the bill to leave without eating and they didnt bring that either 0 
whatever the producer was going for he missed entirely 0 
however the ear pads come off easily and after only one week i lost one 0 
the food was terrible 0 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
however after seeing the short again after about 25 years i was amazed at how timeless the film actually is 1 
i let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this bad idea we both hated it 0 
not my thing 0 
20th century foxs road house 1948 is not only quite a silly noir but is an implausible unmitigated bore of a movie 0 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
poor product 0 
my order was not correct 0 
those burgers were amazing 1 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
dont waste your time 0 
its a mediocre miserable hollow laughable and predictable piece of garbage 0 
i thought it was bad 0 
my ribeye steak was cooked perfectly and had great mesquite flavor 1 
it was pretty gross 0 
the handsfree part works fine but then the car tries to download the address book and the treo rebootsoverall i still rate this device high 1 
greatno problems at all 1 
eclectic selection 1 
as a courtroom drama its compelling as an indictment on the american justice system its frightening 1 
but it is great i would really recommend it 1 
of all the dishes the salmon was the best but all were great 1 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
so far so good 1 
they keep getting better and better this is my third one and ive had numerous palms too 1 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
i have yet to run this new battery below two bars and thats three days without charging 1 
i would avoid this place if you are staying in the mirage 0 
this phone tries very hard to do everything but fails at its very ability to be a phone 0 
everything about this film is simply incredible 1 
cant upload ringtones from a third party 0 
one thing i hate is the mode set button at the side 0 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
this product is clearly not ready for prime time i dont care how cool it looks if you cant tell a call is coming in its worthless 0 
the portion was huge 1 
we recently witnessed her poor quality of management towards other guests as well 0 
the acting helps the writing along very well maybe the idiotsavant sister could have been played better and it is a real joy to watch 1 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
the ambiance was incredible 1 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
as for the service i thought it was good 1 
probably not in a hurry to go back 0 
ive had this for nearly 2 years and it has worked great for me 1 
the fried rice was dry as well 0 
this is infuriating 0 
when my mom and i got home she immediately got sick and she only had a few bites of salad 0 
i could not stand to even watch it for very long for fear of losing iq 0 
an hour and a half i wish i could bring back 0 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
excellent performance 1 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
beware this is not a trashy cult movie this is trash period 0 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
portable and it works 1 
i guess i liked the details of his dysfunctionhe was believable 1 
shrimp when i unwrapped it i live only 12 a mile from brushfire it was literally ice cold 0 
the service was extremely slow 0 
you wont regret it 1 
i go to far too many places and ive never seen any restaurant that serves a 1 egg breakfast especially for 400 0 
very windresistant 1 
razr battery good buy 1 
the seller is very understanding and patient i would definitely buy from them again 1 
great pizza and salads 1 
there is simply no excuse for something this poorly done 0 
it is cheap and it feel and look just as cheap 0 
but in terms of the writing its very fresh and bold 1 
do not purchase this phone 0 
the music in the film is really nice too 1 
each track commands sentiment actually contributing to the scenes and characters 1 
a week later after i activated it it suddenly died 0 
wont ever go here again 0 
food arrived quickly 1 
i know this is not like the other restaurants at all something is very off here 0 
how can that bethe audio quality is poor 0 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
like the other reviewer said you couldnt pay me to eat at this place again 0 
with the originality and freshness of the first movie now spent this remake had little else to offer 0 
too politically correct 0 
i would have given no star if i was able 0 
very dissapointing performance 0 
very tough and very short on flavor 0 
i like armand assante my cable companys summary sounded interesting so i watched it twice already and probably will again 1 
i had a seriously solid breakfast here 1 
would recommend this item 1 
the chips and sals a here is amazing 1 
i had a pretty satifying experience 1 
i wasnt really impressed with strip steak 0 
useless phone simply deaf 0 
excellent short film 1 
couldnt ask for a more satisfying meal 1 
it will drive you barking mad 0 
you need two hands to operate the screenthis software interface is decade old and cannot compete with new software designs 0 
honeslty it didnt taste that fresh 0 
the cow tongue and cheek tacos are amazing 1 
just spicy enough perfect actually 1 
simple lightweight and great fit 1 
nice ambiance 1 
i have bought this nokia cell phone a few weeks ago and it was a nightmare 0 
needless to say we will never be back here again 0 
there was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth but it didnt really work into the rest of the plot 0 
weird vibe from owners 0 
they know how to make them here 1 
they refuse to refund or replace 0 
the worst phone from samsungcrap this crappy samsung e715 is the worst i have ever seeen 0 
very disappointing 0 
i wish i could enter negative values admins 0 
i had the chicken pho and it tasted very bland 0 
my husband said she was very rude did not even apologize for the bad food or anything 0 
seller shipped quickly and much cheaper than the competitors 1 
it is just the sort of pap that is screened in the afternoon to punish the unemployed for not having jobs 0 
this phone tries very hard to do everything but fails at its very ability to be a phone 0 
this one wants to surf on the small wave of space movies in 1998 deep impact and armageddon and this one fails everywhere 0 
great phone 1 
being a 90s child i truly enjoyed this show and i can proudly say that i enjoyed it big time and even more than the classical wb cartoons 1 
on the negative its insipid enough to cause regret for another 2 hours of life wasted in front of the screen 0 
what a mistake 0 
the only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port irda 0 
the most annoying thing about cover girl is the way in which rita hayworth is put up on a pedestal 0 
great product for the price 1 
i use this product in a motor control center where there is a lot of high voltage humming from the equipment and it works great 1 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
their monster chicken fried steak and eggs is my all time favorite 1 
so far so good 1 
overall i like there food and the service 1 
this place is handsdown one of the best places to eat in the phoenix metro area 1 
star trek v the final frontier is the worst in the series 0 
iam very pleased with my purchase 1 
the script is bad very bad ¬ñ it contains both cheesiness and unethical joke that you normally see in rated r or nc17 movie 0 
honeslty it didnt taste that fresh 0 
how can you call yourself a steakhouse if you cant properly cook a steak i dont understand 0 
nice headset priced right 1 
the directing seems too pretentious 0 
my sashimi was poor quality being soggy and tasteless 0 
a fly was in my apple juice a fly 0 
also the fries are without a doubt the worst fries ive ever had 0 
this phone is pretty sturdy and ive never had any large problems with it 1 
the writers were smack on and i think the best actors and actresses were a bonus to the showthese characters were so real 1 
this convention never worked well in the past and certainly doesnt work here 0 
ive only had my bluetooth for a few weeks but i really like it 1 
someone shouldve invented this sooner 1 
i am very impressed with this headset from plantronics 1 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
walked in and the place smelled like an old grease trap and only 2 others there eating 0 
i think the most wonderful parts literally full of wonder are the excerpts from his works 1 
the ambiance isnt much better 0 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
superb phone on a great network 1 
a world better than 95 of the garbage in the theatres today 1 
the reception is excellent 1 
his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic 1 
director paul matthews who also wrotedirected the weak 1995 monster movie grim clearly doesnt know how to pace his films 0 
this movie is excellentangel is beautiful and scamp is adorablehis little yelps when hes scaredand the funniest parts are whenscamp is caught under the curtain and when angel and scamp are singing ive never had this feeling beforei totally recommend this movieits coming out on special edition on june 20the cover has scamp on a garbage can and angel underneath the lid 1 
i got to enjoy the seafood salad with a fabulous vinegrette 1 
i have recommended it to friends 1 
not recommended 0 
about ten minutes into this film i started having second thoughts 0 
aailiyah was pretty good as akasha in places compelling her first entrance and mini dance scene 1 
if good intentions made a film great then this film might be one of the greatest films ever made 1 
in addition it feels amp looks as if the phone is all lightweight cheap plastic 0 
the casting is also horrible cause all you see is a really really bad actors period 0 
i will continue to come here on ladies night andddd date night highly recommend this place to anyone who is in the area 1 
a film not easily forgotten 1 
excellent hands free tool 1 
wed definitely go back here again 1 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
i liked the patio and the service was outstanding 1 
gets a signal when other verizon phones wont 1 
aside from its terrible lead this film has loads of other debits 0 
dont waste your money and time 0 
the food was outstanding and the prices were very reasonable 1 
i might have gotten a defect but i would not risk buying it again because of the built quality alone 0 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
i really liked that 1 
and it was way to expensive 0 
my friend did not like his bloody mary 0 
if the food isnt bad enough for you then enjoy dealing with the worlds worstannoying drunk people 0 
the handsfree part works fine but then the car tries to download the address book and the treo rebootsoverall i still rate this device high 1 
from what my dinner companions told meeverything was very fresh with nice texture and taste 1 
at a time when it seems that film animation has been dominated by disneypixars cgi masterpieces it is both refreshing and comforting to know that miyazaki is still relying on traditional handdrawn animation to tell his charming and enchanting stories 1 
if this premise sound stupid thats because it is 0 
how can that bethe audio quality is poor 0 
great earpiece 1 
its too bad that everyone else involved didnt share crowes level of dedication to quality for if they did wed have a far better film on our hands than this subpar mess 0 
the films sole bright spot was jonah hill who will look almost unrecognizable to fans of the recent superbad due to the amount of weight he lost in the interim 1 
after trying many many handsfree gadgets this is the one that finally works well 1 
i dont think it would hold it too securly on your belt 0 
i got the aluminum case for my new palm vx and it worked really wellit has protected my handheld perfectly so far 1 
paolo sorrentino has written a wonderful story about loneliness and tony has built one of the most unforgettable characters seen in movies in recent years 1 
love it great armband 1 
we wont be going back 0 
waited and waited and waited 0 
i felt asleep the first time i watched it so i can recommend it for insomniacs 0 
all of the main players are mesmerising 1 
will not be back 0 
couldnt use the unit with sunglasses not good in texas 0 
chinese forgeries abound 0 
they refuse to refund or replace 0 
utterly without merit on any level this is akin to torture 0 
appetite instantly gone 0 
best tater tots in the southwest 1 
terrible management 0 
it plays louder than any other speaker of this size the price is so low that most would think the quality is lacking however its not 1 
not a good item it worked for a while then started having problems in my auto reverse tape player 0 
not a good bargain 0 
price is good too 1 
cinematography the film was shot in an interesting way 1 
it always cuts out and makes a beep beep beep sound then says signal failed 0 
this is so embarassing and also my ears hurt if i try to push the ear plug into my ear 0 
your servers suck wait correction our server heimer sucked 0 
works as described 1 
the characters are interesting and you want to find out more about them the longer the movie goes on and i think people will be surprised by who does and doesnt make it 1 
worst ever 0 
so good i am going to have to review this place twice once hereas a tribute to the place and once as a tribute to an event held here last night 1 
jabra ear gels r the best 1 
do not buy for d807wrongly advertised for d807 0 
the worst piece of crap ever along with the verizon customer service 0 
works great 1 
avoid avoid avoid 0 
horrible horrible protector 0 
portable and it works 1 
i checked out this place a couple years ago and was not impressed 0 
this place receives stars for their appetizers 1 
camerawork again bad 0 
too politically correct 0 
crust is not good 0 
i would not recommend this place 0 
the scallop dish is quite appalling for value as well 0 
when my order arrived one of the gyros was missing 0 
this scene is very strong and unpleasant 0 
however after finally watching this film i realized that not only had i had a closed mind to the brilliance it depicts i also found myself watching it over and over again 1 
steer clear of this product and go with the genuine palm replacementr pens which come in a threepack 0 
delicious nyc bagels good selections of cream cheese real lox with capers even 1 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
the potatoes were like rubber and you could tell they had been made up ahead of time being kept under a warmer 0 
the sweet potato fries were very good and seasoned well 1 
probably never coming back and wouldnt recommend it 0 
the acting by the whole cast could be put on a scale and balanced perfectly between overacting and underacting 0 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
does not fit 0 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
i wont be back 0 
highquality chicken on the chicken caesar salad 1 
i had heard good things about this place but it exceeding every hope i could have dreamed of 1 
hands down my favorite italian restaurant 1 
kris kristoffersen is good in this movie and really makes a difference 1 
it was a drive to get there 0 
another thing i didnt really like is when a character got punched in the face a gallon of blood would spew forth soon after 0 
in fact i liked it better than interview with a vampire and i liked this lestat stuart townsend better than cruises attempt 1 
it is a joy to use 1 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
voice quality signal strength dropped calls 0 
i can take a little bad service but the food sucks 0 
i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
i thoroughly enjoyed it when christopher eccleston took control of the tardis and the continuation of the series 1 
the only place good for this film is in the garbage 0 
too bad you have to pay up to a month for the service 0 
there was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters 0 
what did bother me was the slow service 0 
i dont know what the big deal is about this place but i wont be back yaall 0 
this is one of peter watkins most accessible films 1 
after the disappointing dinner we went elsewhere for dessert 0 
no complaints 1 
strike 2 who wants to be rushed 0 
i work in the hospitality industry in paradise valley and have refrained from recommending cibo any longer 0 
in my house i was getting dropped coverage upstairs and no coverage in my basement 0 
it is super charged up for use as a small hybrid palmtopcameracellphone and excels in those roles 1 
not recommended 0 
the sound quality for the device is unacceptableunless you are in a really quiet area you almost hear nothing 0 
i wouldnt return 0 
i go to far too many places and ive never seen any restaurant that serves a 1 egg breakfast especially for 400 0 
i find this inexcusable and so will probably be returning this phone and perhaps changing carriers 0 
the design is very odd as the ear clip is not very comfortable at all 0 
the plot simply rumbles on like a machine desperately depending on the addition of new scenes 0 
the screen does get smudged easily because it touches your ear and face 0 
unfortunately it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees 0 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
id like to return it 0 
they are so cool 1 
i am going to have to be the first to negatively review this product 0 
the han nan chicken was also very tasty 1 
they have been around for years and carries the highest quality of antiglare screen protector that i have found to date 1 
worst customer service 0 
ill put this gem up against any movie in terms of screenplay cinematography acting postproduction editing directing or any other aspect of filmmaking 1 
but it does get better reception and clarity than any phone ive had before 1 
for a self proclaimed coffee cafe i was wildly disappointed 0 
what a big waste of time 0 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
this item worked great but it broke after 6 months of use 0 
the food was excellent and service was very good 1 
i saw this film over christmas and what a great film it was 1 
my first visit to hiro was a delight 1 
this gets a 1 out of 10 simply because theres nothing lower 0 
this movie is a good and humorous comment on life in 2006 1 
the cast is good 1 
spoilers whatever else can or cant be said about it surface is superbly crafted 1 
ive dropped my phone more times than i can say even on concrete and my phone is still great knock on wood 1 
im really disappointed all i have now is a charger that doesnt work 0 
dont waste your time here 0 
the last 15 minutes of movie are also not bad as well 1 
cute quaint simple honest 1 
see both films if you can 1 
i love the scream movies and all horror movies and this one ranks way up there 1 
im happy about this purchase good quality and low price 1 
im translating movies for a living and this is the first movie in my 5year working experience that i found offensive to my intelligence 0 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
it is an excellent drama an excellent thriller and an excellent film 1 
oh this is such a thing of beauty this restaurant 1 
the only good thing was our waiter he was very helpful and kept the bloddy marys coming 1 
i really do recommend this place you can go wrong with this donut place 1 
unfortunately cover girl is an example of how hollywood used to exploit women for financial gain 0 
nice quality build unlike some cheap s out there 1 
good case excellent value 1 
friends pasta also bad he barely touched it 0 
there is a lot of beautiful places 1 
be sure to order dessert even if you need to pack it togo the tiramisu and cannoli are both to die for 1 
the battery life is highly unacceptable 0 
the seller is very understanding and patient i would definitely buy from them again 1 
we loved the biscuits 1 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
im not really sure how joeys was voted best hot dog in the valley by readers of phoenix magazine 0 
nice sound 1 
i love this bluetooth 1 
what i really like there is the crepe station 1 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
an instant classic with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits 1 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
bad characters bad story and bad acting 0 
only had this a month but its worked flawlessly so far 1 
we wont be going back 0 
their rotating beers on tap is also a highlight of this place 1 
yes its shiny on front side and i love it 1 
there is however some pretty good acting at least for this type of film 1 
seriously flavorful delights folks 1 
food was so gooodd 1 
everything from acting to cinematography was solid 1 
there is so much good food in vegas that i feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to rice and company 0 
a lot of websites have been rating this a very good phone and so do i 1 
if you are reading this please dont go there 0 
it is perfect for a sitdown family meal or get together with a few friends 1 
in fact its hard to remember that the part of ray charles is being acted and not played by the man himself 1 
if there is a wind it is completely useless 0 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
by the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant i was bored and didnt care what happened next and so i switched off 0 
it presents a idyllic yet serious portrayal of the ups and downs of the characters lives 1 
it makes very strange ticking noises before it ends the call 0 
did not like at all 0 
at a time when it seems that film animation has been dominated by disneypixars cgi masterpieces it is both refreshing and comforting to know that miyazaki is still relying on traditional handdrawn animation to tell his charming and enchanting stories 1 
a fantastic neighborhood gem 1 
a good time 1 
the food came out at a good pace 1 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
i searched the internet and found this one to be the best value 1 
now the burgers arent as good the pizza which used to be amazing is doughy and flavorless 0 
i think the most wonderful parts literally full of wonder are the excerpts from his works 1 
i hate writing bad reviews about films especially those in which i really like the star but this film is so bad i dont believe for one second that anyone could have been proud of it 0 
the phone takes forever to charge like 2 to 5 hours literally 0 
the pairing of the two devices was so easy it barely took a couple minutes before i started making calls with the voice dialing feature 1 
it looked like a wonderful story 1 
about half way through this film i started to dislike it 0 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
i will not return 0 
i cant use this case because the smell is disgusting 0 
the loudspeaker option is great the bumpers with the lights is very appealing 0 
being a 90s child i truly enjoyed this show and i can proudly say that i enjoyed it big time and even more than the classical wb cartoons 1 
ive had this for nearly 2 years and it has worked great for me 1 
the writer gorman bechard undoubtedly did his homework because all references are industry and characterage appropriate 1 
there is no plot or storyline 0 
light weight i hardly notice it is there 1 
still i do like this movie for its empowerment of women theres not enough movies out there like this one 1 
often the dialogue doesnt really follow from one line to another or fit the surroundings 0 
it kept getting worse and worse so now im officially done 0 
this convention never worked well in the past and certainly doesnt work here 0 
id like to return it 0 
i believe every one should see this movie as i think few people outside of south africa understand its past and what is being attempted in the truth and reconciliation process 1 
the movie showed a lot of florida at its best made it look very appealing 1 
i really like this product over the motorola because it is allot clearer on the ear piece and the mic 1 
itll be a regular stop on my trips to phoenix 1 
when i saw it in the theater i thought i was going to be sick 0 
friends pasta also bad he barely touched it 0 
appetite instantly gone 0 
those burgers were amazing 1 
overall the film is interesting and thoughtprovoking 1 
warning stay away 0 
after arguing with verizon regarding the dropped calls we returned the phones after two days 0 
instead we got a bore fest about a whiny spoiled brat babysitting 0 
incredible 1 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
it has northern humour and positive about the community it represents 1 
so far so good 1 
director paul matthews who also wrotedirected the weak 1995 monster movie grim clearly doesnt know how to pace his films 0 
not worth it 0 
the pizza selections are good 1 
total waste of time 0 
one of the best mexican movies ever and one of the less understood even by mexican themselves no matter how identified the should have felt with it 1 
at least think to refill my water before i struggle to wave you over for 10 minutes 0 
i love my 350 headset my jabra350 bluetooth headset is great the reception is very good and the ear piece is a comfortable fit 1
