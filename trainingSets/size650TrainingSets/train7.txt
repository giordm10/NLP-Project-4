in conclusion i will not bother with this movie because a volcano in los angeles is nothing but nonsense 0 
i was amazed at the quick arrival of the two original lg cell phone batteries and and at a fraction of the price 1 
hard to judge whether these sides were good because we were grossed out by the melted styrofoam and didnt want to eat it for fear of getting sick 0 
the movie lacks visual interest drama expression of feeling and celebration of the very patriotism that underlines the narrative 0 
i came back today since they relocated and still not impressed 0 
i felt asleep the first time i watched it so i can recommend it for insomniacs 0 
piece of junk 0 
bad script bad direction and horrible acting make this one plain bad 0 
i saw this film over christmas and what a great film it was 1 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
our server was super nice and checked on us many times 1 
this one works and was priced right 1 
it was a drive to get there 0 
there is no plot here to keep you going in the first place 0 
we had so much to say about the place before we walked in that he expected it to be amazing but was quickly disappointed 0 
they are so easy to love but even more easy to identify with 1 
1 long lasting battery you dont have to recharge it as frequentyly as some of the flip phones2 0 
ryans bar is definitely one edinburgh establishment i wont be revisiting 0 
yes its shiny on front side and i love it 1 
i love the scream movies and all horror movies and this one ranks way up there 1 
im not eating here 0 
i just cant explain this movie more than romanticcharminghilariousand adorablethe junkyard scenes are funnyall the junkyard dogs have something specialtoo funny i laughedkids will love itbuy it when it comes outit has new features 1 
these headphones were a great find and i think they are perhaps the best purchase ive made in the last several years seriously 1 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
the movie is full of wonderful dancing hence the title 1 
unfortunately it was not good 0 
excellent starter wireless headset 0 
thanks again to amazon for having the things i need for a good price 1 
once you get inside youll be impressed with the place 1 
on the negative its insipid enough to cause regret for another 2 hours of life wasted in front of the screen 0 
the eargels channel the sound directly into your ear and seem to increase the sound volume and clarity 1 
the result is a powerhouse achievement made more timely now perhaps because of our cultures disturbing fascination with celebrity and its distorted interpretations of fame 1 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
omg the food was delicioso 1 
i dont have very many words to say about this place but it does everything pretty well 1 
i waited and waited 0 
the ri style calamari was a joke 0 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
this movie is terrible 0 
unfortunately it was not good 0 
i got the aluminum case for my new palm vx and it worked really wellit has protected my handheld perfectly so far 1 
we are so glad we found this place 1 
food was really good and i got full petty fast 1 
im pleased 1 
comfortable in my hand 1 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
we ordered some old classics and some new dishes after going there a few times and were sorely disappointed with everything 0 
none of the new ones have ever quite worked properly 0 
with great sound effects and impressive special effects i cant recommend this movie enough 1 
we had 7 at our table and the service was pretty fast 1 
service stinks here 0 
the story itself is just predictable and lazy 0 
the reception has been generally good 1 
i immediately said i wanted to talk to the manager but i did not want to talk to the guy who was doing shots of fireball behind the bar 0 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
arrived quickly and much less expensive than others being sold 1 
there arent death scenes like in previous movies and the fx are terrible 0 
the turkey and roast beef were bland 0 
much better than the other ayce sushi place i went to in vegas 1 
and his subtle connections between the three films are awesome 1 
ample portions and good prices 1 
i love this device 1 
it felt too light and tinny 0 
first time going but i think i will quickly become a regular 1 
in a word it is embarrassing 0 
i love the camera its really pretty good quality 1 
low quality 0 
it seems completely secure both holding on to my belt and keeping the iphone inside 1 
really bad 0 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
will order from them again 1 
it has kept up very well 1 
the aerial scenes were welldone 1 
it never condescends all the characters have good genuine hearts and believable problems 1 
it fits so securely that the ear hook does not even need to be used and the sound is better directed through your ear canal 1 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
i wear glasses and it fits fine with them 1 
oh yeah and the storyline was pathetic too 0 
stopped by during the late may bank holiday off rick steve recommendation and loved it 1 
i really hope the team behind this movie makes more movies and that they will continue to do so in their own some kinda weird style 1 
this item is great installed it let it charged up overnite and it has been working good every since with no problems 1 
i am very impressed with the job that motorola did on the sturdiness of this phone 1 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
shrimp when i unwrapped it i live only 12 a mile from brushfire it was literally ice cold 0 
good prices 1 
jabra ear gels r the best 1 
the phone is sturdy and waterproof 1 
full of unconvincing cardboard characters it is blandly written by edward chodorov who also produced and is surprisingly directed by jean negulesco from whom one would expect a great deal more 0 
this is not moviemaking 0 
the ambiance isnt much better 0 
it features an outlandish array of memorable psychotic but lovable nuts 1 
often the dialogue doesnt really follow from one line to another or fit the surroundings 0 
its a long time since i was so entertained by a movie 1 
the shower area is outside so you can only rinse not take a full shower unless you dont mind being nude for everyone to see 0 
call me a nut but i think this is one of the best movies ever 1 
it was a riot to see hugo weaving play a sexobsessed gay real estate salesman who uses his clients houses for his trysts with the flaming darren tom hollander 1 
not tasty and the texture was just nasty 0 
today was my first taste of a buldogis gourmet hot dog and i have to tell you it was more than i ever thought possible 1 
the shipping time was also very quick 1 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
all this movie does is make you sick watching all these slackers make excuses for their stupid actions for 90 minutes 0 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
seems like a good quick place to grab a bite of some familiar pub food but do yourself a favor and look elsewhere 0 
also notable is john baileys fine crisp beautifully colored cinematography and the great production design costumes by eiko ishioka who went on to do the memorable costumes for coppolas dracula for which she received a well deserved oscar 1 
great pocket pc phone combination 1 
its a feelgood film and thats how i felt when i came out of the cinema 1 
these are the central themes of the film and they are handled ineptly stereotypically and with no depth of imagination 0 
my sanyo has survived dozens of drops on blacktop without ill effect 1 
seafood was limited to boiled shrimp and crab legs but the crab legs definitely did not taste fresh 0 
all in all i give this one a resounding 9 out of 10 1 
the fish is badly made and some of its underwater shots are repeated a thousand times in the film 0 
my boyfriend tried the mediterranean chicken salad and fell in love 1 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
now you know why i gave it a 10 1 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
the servers went back and forth several times not even so much as an are you being helped 0 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
great phone 1 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
im glad i found this product on amazon it is hard to find it wasnt high priced 1 
the mic is great 1 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
clear skype calls long battery life long range 1 
but the convoluted plot just didnt convince me and much of the film was watched with a weird questioning glance 0 
awful service 0 
the block was amazing 1 
great pizza and salads 1 
thank you for such great service 1 
this was a poor remake of my best friends wedding 0 
this movie is also revealing 1 
special thanks to dylan t for the recommendation on what to order all yummy for my tummy 1 
i had to go to a store and bought a new nokia phone which is working great 1 
love it great armband 1 
i probably would not go here again 0 
nothing new there 0 
some may say this buffet is pricey but i think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot 1 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
we will not be coming back 0 
what happened next was prettyoff putting 0 
i put the latest os on it v115g and it now likes to slow to a crawl and lock up every once in a while 0 
but i dont like it 0 
if you hate earbugs avoid this phone by all means 0 
the script is bad very bad  it contains both cheesiness and unethical joke that you normally see in rated r or nc17 movie 0 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
the least said about the acting the better 0 
food was really boring 0 
the real disappointment was our waiter 0 
phone falls out easily 0 
amazon sucks 0 
dont go here 0 
this is an extraordinary film 1 
so in a nutshell 1 the restaraunt smells like a combination of a dirty fish market and a sewer 0 
stopped by during the late may bank holiday off rick steve recommendation and loved it 1 
very friendly staff 1 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
gets a signal when other verizon phones wont 1 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
we arent ones to make a scene at restaurants but i just dont get itdefinitely lost the love after this one 0 
so good i am going to have to review this place twice once hereas a tribute to the place and once as a tribute to an event held here last night 1 
bland not a liking this place for a number of reasons and i dont want to waste time on bad reviewing ill leave it at that 0 
mobile phone tools are a must have 1 
penne vodka excellent 1 
the sets especially designed to work with the camera are amazingstylized beautiful and effective 1 
avoid avoid avoid 0 
loved itfriendly servers great food wonderful and imaginative menu 1 
oh yeah and the storyline was pathetic too 0 
terrible my car will not accept this cassette 0 
good audio quality 1 
food was average at best 0 
great price too 1 
omg i felt like i had never eaten thai food until this dish 1 
it is a very well acted and done tv movie 1 
very serious spoilers this movie was a huge disappointment 0 
i dont think i will be back for a very long time 0 
definitely not worth the 3 i paid 0 
the sweet potato fries were very good and seasoned well 1 
cinematography noteworthy including fine views of barcelona and its famed gaudi towers 1 
then our food came out disappointment ensued 0 
go to place for gyros 1 
the hockey scenes are terrible defensemen playing like theyre 5 years old goalies diving at shots that are 10 feet wide of the net etc 0 
and sometimes it was so embarrassing that i had to look away 0 
i saw this film over christmas and what a great film it was 1 
the chips that came out were dripping with grease and mostly not edible 0 
the noise shield is incrediable 1 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
this movie was kind of long in length but i enjoyed every minute of it 1 
verizon tech support walked my through a few procedures none of which worked and i ended up having to do a hard reset wiping out all my data 0 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
food was really boring 0 
i was disgusted because i was pretty sure that was human hair 0 
this allows the possibility of double booking for the same date and time after the first 0 
a very very very slowmoving aimless movie about a distressed drifting young man 0 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
tonight i had the elk filet specialand it sucked 0 
lets start with all the problemsthe acting especially from the lead professor was very very bad 0 
the bt headset was such a disapoinment 0 
i guess i should have known that this place would suck because it is inside of the excalibur but i didnt use my common sense 0 
the point is the journey a journey that touches every member of the family 1 
if only someone involved with it knew how to string together narrative 0 
the restaurant atmosphere was exquisite 1 
the live music on fridays totally blows 0 
worst customer service 0 
sounds good reasonably priced and effective its that simple 1 
one of the most disappointing aspects is the lack of notable gore 0 
all in all i give this one a resounding 9 out of 10 1 
the 12 mega pixel camera being a part of a phone is reasonably good7 1 
but the duet between the astronaut and his doctor at the beginning of the movie is a perfect exchange if one considers that this movie was made well into the cold war and the astronauts biggest fear is that he has crashed in the ussr 1 
this movie was kind of long in length but i enjoyed every minute of it 1 
i was very disappointed 0 
the story unfolds in 18th century jutland and the use of period music played on period instruments is just one more fine touch 1 
the owners really really need to quit being soooooo cheap let them wrap my freaking sandwich in two papers not one 0 
that said our mouths and bellies were still quite pleased 1 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
its like a bad two hour tv movie 0 
there is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again 0 
this is the phone to get for 2005 i just bought my s710a and all i can say is wow 1 
if you love death and decay and shakespears lyrics this is the one 1 
this was reflected not only in the cast but also in the belowpar script which borrowed much from the earlier classic 0 
during several different 2 minute calls i experienced 5 drops and it was in an area that had 5 bars 0 
this review is long overdue since i consider a tale of two sisters to be the single greatest film ever made 1 
dont miss it 1 
no im going to eat the potato that i found some strangers hair in it 0 
recommend with confidence 1 
needless to say we will never be back here again 0 
but in terms of the writing its very fresh and bold 1 
stopped by during the late may bank holiday off rick steve recommendation and loved it 1 
how can you call yourself a steakhouse if you cant properly cook a steak i dont understand 0 
if it was to turn my good day feeling into a night of disturbing memories than i guess he succeeded 0 
victor mclaglen was even bad and brian donlevy was almost unrecognizable 0 
very displeased 0 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
i could barely stomach the meal but didnt complain because it was a business lunch 0 
the only thing worse than taylors acting was stanwycks singing 0 
very satisifed with that 1 
yet i enjoy watching it 1 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
great place to eat reminds me of the little mom and pop shops in the san francisco bay area 1 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
jabra ear gels r the best 1 
i asked multiple times for the wine list and after some time of being ignored i went to the hostess and got one myself 0 
i as well wouldve given godfathers zero stars if possible 0 
you get incredibly fresh fish prepared with care 1 
i could not understand what kind of idiot would produce this mess in the first place not to mention several season 0 
utter crap sound quality is terrible 0 
i think the most wonderful parts literally full of wonder are the excerpts from his works 1 
i can think of no other film where something vitally important occurs every other minute 1 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
this place is amazing 1 
no actress has been worse used that june allison in this movie 0 
i love this bluetooth 1 
this was a different cut than the piece the other day but still wonderful and tender s well as well flavored 1 
both films are terrible but to the credit of the 1986 version it was watchable 0 
i believe every one should see this movie as i think few people outside of south africa understand its past and what is being attempted in the truth and reconciliation process 1 
they could be used as exemplars for any set designer 1 
the cast was great 1 
the worst one of the series 0 
if you havent gone here go now 1 
piece of junk 0 
the earpiece on this is too large or too heavyit keeps falling out of my ear 0 
but then they came back cold 0 
ive had better not only from dedicated boba tea spots but even from jenni pho 0 
its not user friendly 0 
finally after three or four times the spring of the latch broke and i could not use it any longer on the visor 0 
essentially you can forget microsofts tech support 0 
only like 3 or 4 buildings used a couple of locations maybe poor hummh 0 
all in all ha long bay was a bit of a flop 0 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
he surely doesnt know how to make a coherent action movie from the screenwriter of air force one who was only obliged to write the script just for a big sum of money 0 
waste of 13 bucks 0 
the food was very good 1 
this movie was kind of long in length but i enjoyed every minute of it 1 
today was my first taste of a buldogis gourmet hot dog and i have to tell you it was more than i ever thought possible 1 
great food 1 
the ambience is wonderful and there is music playing 1 
good case excellent value 1 
works fine 1 
small sleek impressive looking practical setup with ample storage in place 1 
very nice and relaxing late night viewing 1 
im pleased 1 
i did not bother contacting the company for few dollar product but i learned the lesson that i should not have bought this form online anyway 0 
my 810 score is mostly for the plot 1 
we had so much to say about the place before we walked in that he expected it to be amazing but was quickly disappointed 0 
this is hands down the best phone ive ever had 1 
tonight i had the elk filet specialand it sucked 0 
this is a witty and delightful adaptation of the dr seuss book brilliantly animated by upas finest and thoroughly deserving of its academy award 1 
does not work 0 
the loudspeaker option is great the bumpers with the lights is very appealing 0 
the price was very good and with the free shipping and all it was a good purchase 1 
very windresistant 1 
helen baxendale is a very credible lady macbeth who can be very cheerfull at times and sometimes she just looks like a naughty girl but deadly in her taste for blood and evil 1 
best tacos in town by far 1 
how can you call yourself a steakhouse if you cant properly cook a steak i dont understand 0 
this phone is pretty sturdy and ive never had any large problems with it 1 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
restored my phone to like new performance 1 
about half way through this film i started to dislike it 0 
almost everyone involved must be return to school acting is utterly predictable and bad script is pile of garbage all round 0 
almost all of the songs in cover girl are oldfashioned and not very tuneful 0 
there was hardly any meat 0 
the sweet potato fries were very good and seasoned well 1 
of course the acting is blah 0 
interesting decor 1 
the food was great as always compliments to the chef 1 
not impressed 0 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
but this movie really got to me 1 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
after the first charge kept going dead after 12 minutes 0 
bad quality 0 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
the cow tongue and cheek tacos are amazing 1 
you get incredibly fresh fish prepared with care 1 
the goat taco didnt skimp on the meat and wow what flavor 1 
the worst phone ive ever had only had it for a few months 0 
yes its shiny on front side and i love it 1 
it did not work in my cell phone plug i am very up set with the charger 0 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
the battery is working well as a replacement for the original that came with the phone over 2 years ago 1 
i wont say any more i dont like spoilers so i dont want to be one but i believe this film is worth your time 1 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
this place receives stars for their appetizers 1 
i think that it is a must see older john wayne film 1 
they have horrible attitudes towards customers and talk down to each one when customers dont enjoy their food 0 
it has all the features i want 1 
ill definitely be in soon again 1 
i found a six inch long piece of wire in my salsa 0 
the sides are delish mixed mushrooms yukon gold puree white corn beateous 1 
the file browser offers all the options that one needshandsfree is great 1 
the mic there is a joke and the volume is quite low 0 
the sound is clear and the people i talk to on it are amazed at the quality too 1 
service stinks here 0 
the cast of veteran actors are more than just a nostalgia trip 1 
i have to jiggle the plug to get it to line up right to get decent volume 0 
so flavorful and has just the perfect amount of heat 1 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
today the graphics are crap 0 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
if you have not seen this movie i definitely recommend it 1 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
it also had a new problem 0 
lets start with all the problemsthe acting especially from the lead professor was very very bad 0 
does everything it should and more 1 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
i have recommended it to friends 1 
all of the main players are mesmerising 1 
dont waste your money and time 0 
this movie contained an allstar cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i havent seen before 1 
we asked for the bill to leave without eating and they didnt bring that either 0 
we ordered some old classics and some new dishes after going there a few times and were sorely disappointed with everything 0 
in other words the content level of this film is enough to easily fill a dozen other films 1 
reasonably priced also 1 
would not recommend to others 0 
the aerial scenes were welldone 1 
the script is was there a script 0 
we recently witnessed her poor quality of management towards other guests as well 0 
i am pairing this with my iphone and i could not be happier with it so far 1 
linksys should have some way to exchange a bad phone for a refurb unit or something 0 
the service was terrible food was mediocre 0 
the restaurant is very clean and has a family restaurant feel to it 1 
you cant go wrong with any of the food here 1 
nothing special 0 
his performance as awarded was stunning 1 
i sat riveted to the tv screen 1 
always a great time at dos gringos 1 
never been to hard rock casino before will never ever step forward in it again 0 
nothing short of magnificent photographycinematography in this film 1 
i have two more years left in this contract and i hate this phone 0 
just spicy enough perfect actually 1 
it also took her forever to bring us the check when we asked for it 0 
and then tragedy struck 0 
horrible phone 0 
but the premise of the film was so ridiculous that the president of the us 0 
very good product well made 1 
give this one a look 1 
also its slim enough to fit into my alarm clock docking station without removing the case 1 
bad day or not i have a very low tolerance for rude customer service people it is your job to be nice and polite wash dishes otherwise 0 
the acting from all involved and that includes those like shatner and nimoy is bad and washed out and making them seem as old as they look in real life the special effects are tacky like when spock has to rescue kirk on a jet pack when he falls down from a mountain 0 
freezes frequently4 0 
you have to hold the phone at a particular angle for the other party to hear you clearly 0 
i want my money back 0 
i dont think ive ever gone to a movie and disliked it as much 0 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
i recently had problems where i could not stay connected for more than 10 minutes before being disconnected 0 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
i cant tell you how disappointed i was 0 
it kept getting worse and worse so now im officially done 0 
saw the movie today and thought it was a good effort good messages for kids 1 
this place is amazing 1 
it was horrendous 0 
much more interesting more action more suspense and less of the unneeded controversy 1 
never got it 0 
come hungry leave happy and stuffed 1 
almost everyone involved must be return to school acting is utterly predictable and bad script is pile of garbage all round 0 
that said our mouths and bellies were still quite pleased 1 
the salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop which was perfectly cooked 1 
their monster chicken fried steak and eggs is my all time favorite 1 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
join the club and get awesome offers via email 1 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
muddy low quality sound and the casing around the wires insert was poorly super glued and slid off 0 
in my house i was getting dropped coverage upstairs and no coverage in my basement 0 
and sometimes it was so embarrassing that i had to look away 0 
very disappointing 0 
graphics is far from the best part of the game 0 
we are so glad we found this place 1 
hitchcock is a great director 1 
great food and awesome service 1 
one nice thing was that they added gratuity on the bill since our party was larger than 6 or 8 and they didnt expect more tip than that 1 
battery chargelife is quite long 1 
i keep watching it over and over 1 
ordered a double cheeseburger got a single patty that was falling apart picture uploaded yeah still sucks 0 
these are certainly very comfortable and functionality is decent 1 
how stupid is that 0 
ive seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie 0 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
the battery runs down quickly 0 
it is an excellent drama an excellent thriller and an excellent film 1 
the football scenes at the end were perplexing 0 
i wasnt really impressed with strip steak 0 
excellent hands free tool 1 
none of it works just dont buy it 0 
it fits my ear well and is comfortable on 1 
your brain will attempt to shutdown as part of a primal impulse of selfpreservation 0 
i still maintain that monkeys shouldnt make headphones we just obviously dont share enough dna to copy the design over to humans 0 
great bluetooth 1 
no real improvement 0 
this really is how vegas fine dining used to be right down to the menus handed to the ladies that have no prices listed 1 
i recently had problems where i could not stay connected for more than 10 minutes before being disconnected 0 
all this movie does is make you sick watching all these slackers make excuses for their stupid actions for 90 minutes 0 
my friend loved the salmon tartar 1 
i have tried these cables with my computer and my ipod and it works just fine 1 
the servers are not pleasant to deal with and they dont always honor pizza hut coupons 0 
lasted one day and then blew up 0 
took an hour to get our food only 4 tables in restaurant my food was luke warm our sever was running around like he was totally overwhelmed 0 
so i basically threw my money out the window for nothing 0 
otherwise easy to install and use clear sound 1 
very true to shakespear and a must for all shakespear fans 1 
this pair of headphones is the worst that i have ever had soundwise 0 
the greek dressing was very creamy and flavorful 1 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
however paul schrader has indeed made a film about mishima that is both superb complex 1 
i must say i have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again 1 
waitress was sweet and funny 1 
pricing is a bit of a concern at mellow mushroom 0 
my boyfriend and i came here for the first time on a recent trip to vegas and could not have been more pleased with the quality of food and service 1 
walked in and the place smelled like an old grease trap and only 2 others there eating 0
