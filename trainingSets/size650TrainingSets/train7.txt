they made this case too small and is very difficult to install 0 
happy so far 1 
everything about it is just bad 0 
there are so many problems i dont know where to start 0 
how awful she is 0 
i am so tired of clich√©s that is just lazy writing and here they come in thick and fast 0 
food quality has been horrible 0 
what a mistake 0 
does not work for listening to music with the cingular 8125 0 
works good 1 
very nice and relaxing late night viewing 1 
all in all ha long bay was a bit of a flop 0 
the selection was probably the worst ive seen in vegasthere was none 0 
a great film by a great director 1 
we got sitting fairly fast but ended up waiting 40 minutes just to place our order another 30 minutes before the food arrived 0 
utterly without merit on any level this is akin to torture 0 
also the phone doesnt seem to accept anything except cbr mp3s preferably ripped by windows media player 0 
i immediately said i wanted to talk to the manager but i did not want to talk to the guy who was doing shots of fireball behind the bar 0 
this is probably one of the least effective and utterly unoriginal films i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
very prompt service 1 
my breakfast was perpared great with a beautiful presentation of 3 giant slices of toast lightly dusted with powdered sugar 1 
a film not easily forgotten 1 
oh and i forgot to also mention the weird color effect it has on your phone 0 
i could not understand what kind of idiot would produce this mess in the first place not to mention several season 0 
problem is that the ear loops are made of weak material and break easily 0 
we wont be returning 0 
verizon tech support walked my through a few procedures none of which worked and i ended up having to do a hard reset wiping out all my data 0 
the plot is nonsense that doesnt interest in the slightest way or have any uniqueness to it 0 
it probably would have been better if the director hadnt spent most of the movie showcasing his own art work which really isnt that noteworthy 0 
great headset very impressed h500 1 
spend your money and time some place else 0 
the jalapeno bacon is soooo good 1 
this gets a 1 out of 10 simply because theres nothing lower 0 
this is a simple little phone to use but the breakage is unacceptible 0 
all of the tapas dishes were delicious 1 
reasonably priced also 1 
the steak and the shrimp are in my opinion the best entrees at gc 1 
the plot well i said id let that one go 0 
we recently witnessed her poor quality of management towards other guests as well 0 
i did not expect this to be so good 1 
they have a plethora of salads and sandwiches and everything ive tried gets my seal of approval 1 
unfortunately the ability to actually know you are receiving a call is a rather important feature and this phone is pitiful in that respect 0 
i was mortified 0 
the movie showed a lot of florida at its best made it look very appealing 1 
extremely tasty 1 
the staff is always super friendly and helpful which is especially cool when you bring two small boys and a baby 1 
there is simply no excuse for something this poorly done 0 
i agree with jessica this movie is pretty bad 0 
the acting is beyond abysmal 0 
the cinematographyif it can be called thatsucked 0 
perhaps my phone is defective but people cannot hear me when i use this 0 
doesnt hold charge 0 
this is an excellent tool especially when paired with your phones autoanswer 1 
if you plan to use this in a car forget about it 0 
the worst phone ive ever had only had it for a few months 0 
today the graphics are crap 0 
youll love how thin it is 1 
good beer drink selection and good food selection 1 
about ten minutes into this film i started having second thoughts 0 
no shifting no bubbling no peeling not even a scratch nothingi couldnt be more happier with my new one for the droid 1 
maybe its just their vegetarian fare but ive been twice and i thought it was average at best 0 
lastly the mozzarella sticks they were the best thing we ordered 1 
their onscreen chemistry critical to the entire film is genuine 1 
what a great double cheeseburger 1 
if you are razr owneryou must have this 1 
but the service was beyond bad 0 
the potatoes were great and so was the biscuit 1 
great pork sandwich 1 
ive had no trouble accessing the internet downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions 1 
ive never been treated so bad 0 
then a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use 0 
i sat riveted to the tv screen 1 
by the time the film ended i not only disliked it i despised it 0 
the turkey and roast beef were bland 0 
although i very much liked the look and sound of this place the actual experience was a bit disappointing 0 
he cant act one of the least scary villains i have ever seen he cant write did he write this damn movie in his sleep 0 
the staff is friendly and the joint is always clean 1 
this is a disgrace 0 
just whatever you do avoid groove as its the antithesis of all that is good about human traffic 0 
the pizza selections are good 1 
the results well are a shame 0 
i advise you to look out for it 1 
theres also enough hypocrisy in this film to make me vomit 0 
i love my 350 headset my jabra350 bluetooth headset is great the reception is very good and the ear piece is a comfortable fit 1 
just whatever you do avoid groove as its the antithesis of all that is good about human traffic 0 
great food and great service in a clean and friendly setting 1 
it is zillion times away from reality 0 
and i just love the colors 1 
phone now holds charge like it did when it was new 1 
in short dont bother with this movie 0 
i always order from the vegetarian menu during dinner which has a wide array of options to choose from 1 
i guess i liked the details of his dysfunctionhe was believable 1 
the battery runs down quickly 0 
i dont recommend unless your car breaks down in front of it and you are starving 0 
however bt headsets are currently not good for real time games like firstperson shooters since the audio delay messes me up 0 
too bad cause i know its family owned i really wanted to like this place 0 
what a great double cheeseburger 1 
i have only had it for a few weeks but so far so good 1 
the meat was pretty dry i had the sliced brisket and pulled pork 0 
i guess maybe we went on an off night but it was disgraceful 0 
i am very impressed with this headset from plantronics 1 
all in all its an insult to ones intelligence and a huge waste of money 0 
by the time the film ended i not only disliked it i despised it 0 
predictable but not a bad watch 1 
by this time our side of the restaurant was almost empty so there was no excuse 0 
my friend loved the salmon tartar 1 
very friendly staff 1 
and finally after all that we get to an ending that wouldve been great had it been handled by competent people and not jerry falwell 0 
unfortunately cover girl is an example of how hollywood used to exploit women for financial gain 0 
all in all i can assure you ill be back 1 
emily watsons character is very strong and she has only to give a quick glance and you understand everything 1 
this place receives stars for their appetizers 1 
restaurant is always full but never a wait 1 
using all earpieces left or right this thing will not stay on my ear 0 
no im going to eat the potato that i found some strangers hair in it 0 
were jerks on the phone 0 
we recently witnessed her poor quality of management towards other guests as well 0 
fast service 1 
her lines seem to have been written by a fifteen year old though they are trying oh so so hard to sound like how a fifteen year old would really um you know well talk 0 
im in az all the time and now have my new spot 1 
the awful dialogue and hopeless overacting by everyone who gets shot top off a real waste of space and time 0 
i would have casted her in that role after ready the script 1 
i really loved the story line and the poler bear was kinda cutebut if anyone has a question about fort steele just ask away 1 
product was excellent and works better than the verizon one and boy was it cheaper 1 
its one of the movies i need to see whenever it comes on tvnever mind the fact that i already have it memorized 1 
very good food great atmosphere1 1 
the transfers are very good 1 
just really good so far probably the best bt headset i have ever had 1 
crostini that came with the salad was stale 0 
anne heche was utterly convincing 1 
very good quality though 1 
it felt too light and tinny 0 
see it with your kids if you have a chanceit will open up some amazing dialog about how far race relations have come in the last 50 years 1 
it was horrendous 0 
logitech bluetooth headset is a 10 1 
does not work 0 
waste of money 0 
this film has no redeeming features 0 
it is practically useless and did not add any kind of boost to my reception after i bought it 0 
i love my 350 headset my jabra350 bluetooth headset is great the reception is very good and the ear piece is a comfortable fit 1 
1010 1 
but in any case the best part is you can download these pictures to your laptop using ir or even send pictures from your laptop to the phone 1 
what should have been a hilarious yummy christmas eve dinner to remember was the biggest fail of the entire trip for us 0 
we got the food and apparently they have never heard of salt and the batter on the fish was chewy 0 
the movie has almost no action scenes in it and very little comedy 0 
i had about two bites and refused to eat anymore 0 
this was utterly confusing at first which caused me to lose a couple of very very important contacts 0 
unfortunately cover girl is an example of how hollywood used to exploit women for financial gain 0 
product was excellent and works better than the verizon one and boy was it cheaper 1 
they dropped more than the ball 0 
it is just the sort of pap that is screened in the afternoon to punish the unemployed for not having jobs 0 
great phone 1 
i ordered this for sony ericsson w810i but i think it only worked once thats when i first used it 0 
i rather enjoyed it 1 
the cashier had no care what so ever on what i had to say it still ended up being wayyy overpriced 0 
i would avoid this place if you are staying in the mirage 0 
i wish i could enter negative values admins 0 
we recently witnessed her poor quality of management towards other guests as well 0 
this frog phone charm is adorable and very eye catching 1 
host staff were for lack of a better word bitches 0 
the service was extremely slow 0 
buyerbe very careful 0 
emily watsons character is very strong and she has only to give a quick glance and you understand everything 1 
their frozen margaritas are way too sugary for my taste 0 
i love this cable it allows me to connect any miniusb device to my pc 1 
these are the nicest restaurant owners ive ever come across 1 
camera color balance is awful 0 
the cashew cream sauce was bland and the vegetables were undercooked 0 
these are the central themes of the film and they are handled ineptly stereotypically and with no depth of imagination 0 
oh and i forgot to also mention the weird color effect it has on your phone 0 
bad purchase 0 
went in for happy hour great list of wines 1 
the presentation of the food was awful 0 
i am sorry i made this purchase 0 
as i said abovepretty useless 0 
2 thumbs up 1 
very funny 1 
seller shipped quickly and much cheaper than the competitors 1 
perabo has a nice energy level and is obviously very comfortable in front of a camera 1 
the chicken i got was definitely reheated and was only ok the wedges were cold and soggy 0 
it works fine on my motorola 325 cellphone and a lot better than the wornout battery did 1 
we recently witnessed her poor quality of management towards other guests as well 0 
the phone gets extremely hot 0 
this movie does an excellent job of revealing the complexity of the task and the incredible challenges facing south africa 1 
of course the footage from the 70s was grainy but that only enhanced the film 1 
great for ipods too 1 
for that price i can think of a few place i would have much rather gone 0 
it kept getting worse and worse so now im officially done 0 
for sushi on the strip this is the place to go 1 
im using it with an iriver spinn with case and it fits fine 1 
you need two hands to operate the screenthis software interface is decade old and cannot compete with new software designs 0 
if that bug never showed up i would have given a 4 for sure but on the other side of the wall where this bug was climbing was the kitchen 0 
perfect for someone me who only likes beer ice cold or in this case even colder 1 
thanks good a movie like this was done and released 1 
needless to say i wont be going back anytime soon 0 
waited and waited and waited 0 
the food was excellent and service was very good 1 
we walked away stuffed and happy about our first vegas buffet experience 1 
and sometimes it was so embarrassing that i had to look away 0 
the story line is just awful 0 
i waited and waited 0 
the awful dialogue and hopeless overacting by everyone who gets shot top off a real waste of space and time 0 
it was too predictable even for a chick flick 0 
definitely not worth the 3 i paid 0 
is pretty funny 1 
i think the most wonderful parts literally full of wonder are the excerpts from his works 1 
pricing is a bit of a concern at mellow mushroom 0 
the food was delicious our bartender was attentive and personable and we got a great deal 1 
we are sending it back 0 
i especially love the long battery life 1 
punishment park is a brilliant piece of cinema 1 
i have to use the smallest earpieces provided but it stays on pretty well 1 
i will be back many times soon 1 
everything about it is just bad 0 
we had 7 at our table and the service was pretty fast 1 
cinematography the film was shot in an interesting way 1 
phone falls out easily 0 
all in all i think it was a good investment 1 
problem is that the ear loops are made of weak material and break easily 0 
painful on the ear 0 
this is a great product sure beats using your fingers 1 
good value works fine power via usb car or wall outlet 1 
once you get inside youll be impressed with the place 1 
lets start with all the problems¬óthe acting especially from the lead professor was very very bad 0 
however after seeing the short again after about 25 years i was amazed at how timeless the film actually is 1 
fantastic food 1 
the awful dialogue and hopeless overacting by everyone who gets shot top off a real waste of space and time 0 
however my girl was complain that some time the phone doesnt wake up like normal phone does 0 
still its quite interesting and entertaining to follow 1 
ill even say it again ¬ñ this is torture 0 
a good time 1 
their steaks are 100 recommended 1 
nevertheless yet another wonderful film from the great masters stable 1 
they made this case too small and is very difficult to install 0 
logitech bluetooth headset is a 10 1 
artless camerawork endlessly presents us with the ugliest setting imaginable ie 0 
i have had this phone for over a year now and i will tell you its not that great 0 
we have tried 2 units and they both failed within 2 months pros 0 
great headset very impressed h500 1 
i was able to do voice dialing in the car with no problem 1 
amazon sucks 0 
im so sorry but i really cant recommend it to anyone 0 
seafood was limited to boiled shrimp and crab legs but the crab legs definitely did not taste fresh 0 
so i am here to warn youdo not rent this movie it is the dumbest thing you have never seen 0 
i checked out this place a couple years ago and was not impressed 0 
also the fries are without a doubt the worst fries ive ever had 0 
ryans bar is definitely one edinburgh establishment i wont be revisiting 0 
i love that they put their food in nice plastic containers as opposed to cramming it in little paper takeout boxes 1 
the decor is nice and the piano music soundtrack is pleasant 1 
first of all there are enough racial stereotypes and racial jokes to offend everyone 0 
i cant believe theres even a sequel to this 0 
the loudspeaker option is great the bumpers with the lights is very appealing 0 
this movie is possibly one of the most creative works of horror ever 1 
i would recommend saving room for this 1 
i recommend igo to anyone with different brand cell phonesmp3 players in the family 1 
it was a huge awkward 15lb piece of cow that was 34ths gristle and fat 0 
i go to far too many places and ive never seen any restaurant that serves a 1 egg breakfast especially for 400 0 
defective crap 0 
the descriptions said yum yum sauce and another said eel sauce yet another said spicy mayowell none of the rolls had sauces on them 0 
the igo chargers and tips are really great 1 
i found the product to be easy to set up and use 1 
this little device has transformed my organizational capability and made my life a whole lot easier 1 
and his subtle connections between the three films are awesome 1 
the text messaging feature is really tricky to use 0 
then theres the plot holes 0 
works well 1 
steve martin delivers a really funny performance of a middleaged upper class uptight white guy 1 
perhaps my phone is defective but people cannot hear me when i use this 0 
the instructions didnt explain that a microphone jack could be used 0 
much less than the jawbone i was going to replace it with 1 
the acting is like watching wooden puppets moving around and reading from a book thats how bad it is 0 
service is perfect and the family atmosphere is nice to see 1 
i was amazed at the quick arrival of the two original lg cell phone batteries and and at a fraction of the price 1 
awesome selection of beer 1 
but i thought his acting was skilled 1 
its a case of so bad it is laughable 0 
this one wants to surf on the small wave of space movies in 1998 deep impact and armageddon and this one fails everywhere 0 
if that bug never showed up i would have given a 4 for sure but on the other side of the wall where this bug was climbing was the kitchen 0 
the flat reenactments dont hold your attention because they are emotionally adrift and stagy 0 
all in all id expected a better consumer experience from motorola 0 
works well 1 
looks great and is strong 1 
almost all of the songs in cover girl are oldfashioned and not very tuneful 0 
the nokia ca42 usb cable did not work with my phone 0 
totally different with loads of understatement and black comedy this is a film few get to see but those who do will remember it 1 
the story is beyond stupid 0 
the camera although rated at an impressive 13 megapixels renders images that fall well below expectations of such a relatively high resolution 0 
the lead man is charismafree 0 
weve have gotten a much better service from the pizza place next door than the services we received from this restaurant 0 
what a piece of junk i lose more calls on this phone 0 
all in all id expected a better consumer experience from motorola 0 
every time he opened his mouth you expect to hear you see kids pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show 0 
the grilled chicken was so tender and yellow from the saffron seasoning 1 
the phone gets extremely hot 0 
do not buy do not buyit sucks 0 
i understand that its supposed to be a cheap popcorn comedy but that doesnt mean that it has to completely insult our intelligence and have writing so incredibly hackneyed that it borders on offensive 0 
none of it works just dont buy it 0 
the only consistent thread holding the series together were the amazing performances of leni parker and anita laselva as the two taelons in quiet idealogical conflict 0 
secondly hitchcock pretty much perfected the thriller and chase movie 1 
just really good so far probably the best bt headset i have ever had 1 
i really recommend this faceplates since it looks very nice elegant and cool 1 
they were goldencrispy and delicious 1 
it is a joy to use 1 
i dressed up to be treated so rudely 0 
its still wild stuff though and is highly recommended to fans of giallo cinema 1 
i was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar not only because the quality is great but the service is fast and the food impeccable 1 
tom wilkinson broke my heart at the end and everyone elses judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike 1 
the portion was huge 1 
the plot doesnt hang together at all and the acting is absolutely appalling 0 
i even dropped this phone into a stream and it was submerged for 15 seconds and it still works great 1 
very bad performance plays angela bennett a computer expert who is at home all the time 0 
but the premise of the film was so ridiculous that the president of the us 0 
ive had better not only from dedicated boba tea spots but even from jenni pho 0 
on three different occasions i asked for well done or medium well and all three times i got the bloodiest piece of meat on my plate 0 
theres also enough hypocrisy in this film to make me vomit 0 
i wouldnt return 0 
my experience was terrible this was my fourth bluetooth headset and while it was much more comfortable than my last jabra which i hated 0 
the opening sequence of this gem is a classic and the cat n mouse games that follow are a delight to watch 1 
left very frustrated 0 
im surprised this is a good quality car charger and theres not much reviews about it 1 
bad characters bad story and bad acting 0 
there are massive levels massive unlockable characters its just a massive game 1 
in conclusion i will not bother with this movie because a volcano in los angeles is nothing but nonsense 0 
great food 1 
i know this is not like the other restaurants at all something is very off here 0 
this is probably one of the least effective and utterly unoriginal films i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
i am far from a sushi connoisseur but i can definitely tell the difference between good food and bad food and this was certainly bad food 0 
this case seems well made 1 
the staff is friendly and the joint is always clean 1 
i as well wouldve given godfathers zero stars if possible 0 
the color is even prettier than i thought it would be and the graphics are incredibly sharp 1 
i had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get some relief 0 
and the red curry had so much bamboo shoots and wasnt very tasty to me 0 
its aggravating 0 
magical help 1 
all the actors give a wonderful performance especially jennifer rubin as jamie harris who changes from the nervous starlet in the beginning through the strange events she is part of to the cool star 1 
very bad experience 0 
i got the car charger and not even after a week the charger was brokeni went to plug it in and it started smoking 0 
again no plot at all 0 
im in az all the time and now have my new spot 1 
the service was a little slow considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace 0 
which is precisely why i am giving it such a bad review 0 
as for the service i thought it was good 1 
excellent starter wireless headset 0 
does not work for listening to music with the cingular 8125 0 
it features an outlandish array of memorable psychotic but lovable nuts 1 
overall the film is interesting and thoughtprovoking 1 
ive had this bluetoooth headset for some time now and still not comfortable with the way it fits on the ear 0 
sweetest phone 1 
great for the jawbone 1 
they could be used as exemplars for any set designer 1 
this film and i use that word loosely is an insult to the moviegoing public 0 
it is easy to turn on and off when you are in the car and the volume controls are quite accessable 1 
one of the worst shows of all time 0 
how can anyone in their right mind ask for anything more from a movie than this 1 
very good lunch spot 1 
i probably wont be coming back here 0 
excellent 1 
the only thing i wasnt too crazy about was their guacamole as i dont like it pur√©ed 0 
tried to go here for lunch and it was a madhouse 0 
see both films if you can 1 
i tried the cape cod ravoli chickenwith cranberrymmmm 1 
we loved the place 1 
i cannot make calls at certain places 0 
my girlfriends veal was very bad 0 
thats how id describe this painfully dreary timewaster of a film 0 
this one works and was priced right 1 
they could be used as exemplars for any set designer 1 
there is no plot or storyline 0 
the food is good 1 
characters are onedimensional even the good guys and especially the bad guys 0 
the acting is terrible and the writing is worse 0 
well just if you keep thinking how bad it is 0 
this is a good joint 1 
an hour seriously 0 
lange had become a great actress 1 
excellent sound quality 1 
today was my first taste of a buldogis gourmet hot dog and i have to tell you it was more than i ever thought possible 1 
total brunch fail 0 
after charging overnight these batteries work great 1 
it is wonderful and inspiring to watch and i hope that it gets released again on to video or dvd 1 
the film is well paced understated and one of the best courtroom documentaries ive seen 1 
jamie foxx absolutely is ray charles 1 
this film and i use that word loosely is an insult to the moviegoing public 0 
if it was to turn my good day feeling into a night of disturbing memories than i guess he succeeded 0 
the movie seemed a little slow at first 0 
i could not understand what kind of idiot would produce this mess in the first place not to mention several season 0 
the scripting of the subtle comedy is unmatched by any movie in recent years 1 
once you get inside youll be impressed with the place 1 
this is a really fantastic thai restaurant which is definitely worth a visit 1 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
it just blew 0 
worthless product 0 
we watched our waiter pay a lot more attention to other tables and ignore us 0 
nonlinear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well 1 
i have been very happy with the 510 and have had no complaints from any one regarding my sound quality on their end 1 
we wont be going back anytime soon 0 
after the disappointing dinner we went elsewhere for dessert 0 
only had this a month but its worked flawlessly so far 1 
this is the place where i first had pho and it was amazing 1 
highly unrecommended 0 
what this film lacks is a convincing script 0 
it is perfect for a sitdown family meal or get together with a few friends 1 
i can say that the desserts were yummy 1 
they were excellent 1 
ive seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie 0 
their menu is diverse and reasonably priced 1 
phone falls out easily 0 
do not buy do not buyit sucks 0 
eclectic selection 1 
this was a poor remake of my best friends wedding 0 
ill give this film 10 out of 10 1 
i got this phone on reccomendation from a relative and im glad i did 1 
disappointing experience 0 
their steaks are 100 recommended 1 
oh this is such a thing of beauty this restaurant 1 
not what i wanted 0 
great headset very impressed h500 1 
i was left shattered from the experience of watching this film and i took a good two hours to fully recover 0 
someone shouldve invented this sooner 1 
you can watch them preparing the delicious food 1 
on the good side the staff was genuinely pleasant and enthusiastic a real treat 1 
the worst experience ever 0 
the reception is excellent 1 
there are massive levels massive unlockable characters its just a massive game 1 
i thoroughly enjoyed it when christopher eccleston took control of the tardis and the continuation of the series 1 
my order was not correct 0 
ray charles life provided excellent biographical material for the film which goes well beyond being just another movie about a musician 1 
things that went wrong they burned the saganaki 0 
its fits like a glove and is strong secure and durable 1 
i know that sounds funny but to me it seemed like sketchy technology that wouldnt work wellwell this one works great 1 
awful 0 
overall i was not impressed and would not go back 0 
there are the usual hitchcock logic flaws 0 
i advise you to look out for it 1 
steamboat willie is an amazingly important film to our cinema history 1 
i was very disappointed 0 
though the wind and the lion is told largely through the eyes of the son every member of the family can identify with one of the characters whether it be sean connerys noble brigand candace bergens feisty heroine john hustons wily john hay or steve kanalys spiffy radiant ruthless cando lieutenant roosevelts big stick 1 
internet is excrutiatingly slow 0 
nice case feels good in your hands 1 
overall i like there food and the service 1 
wont work right or atleast for me 0 
ive also had problems with the phone reading the memory card in which i always turn it on and then off again 0 
if good intentions made a film great then this film might be one of the greatest films ever made 1 
because both ears are occupied background is not distracting at all 1 
we are so glad we found this place 1 
i wear glasses and it fits fine with them 1 
the jalapeno bacon is soooo good 1 
however i recently watched the whole thing again on dvd and i was completely struck by how extremely stupid the storyline was how it contained holes inconsistencies and frankly a whole lot of crap and how horrid the dancing was 0 
hands down my favorite italian restaurant 1 
poor sound quality 0 
then theres the plot holes 0 
sounds good reasonably priced and effective its that simple 1 
worse theres an incredibly weak subplot thrown in that follows a little band of latterday mansonites as they go after a reporter whos working on a story on the anniversary of the killings 0 
it was packed 0 
the steaks are all well trimmed and also perfectly cooked 1 
dee snider just plain sucks 0 
i am also very happy with the price 1 
the inside is really quite nice and very clean 1 
the food is about on par with dennys which is to say not good at all 0 
doesnt last long 0 
you wont be disappointed 1 
will never ever go back and have told many people what had happened 0 
id like to return it 0 
he came running after us when he realized my husband had left his sunglasses on the table 1 
the ngage is still lacking in earbuds 0 
i can assure you that you wont be disappointed 1 
voice quality signal strength dropped calls 0 
this movie has a cutting edge to it 1 
nice quality build unlike some cheap s out there 1 
does not work 0 
disappointment i hate anything that goes in my ear 0 
horrible 0 
it was probably dirt 0 
cant upload ringtones from a third party 0 
hackneyed writing certainly but made even worse by the bad directing 0 
good audio quality 1 
some applause should be given to the prelude however 1

this is probably one of the least effective and utterly unoriginal films i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
we are sending it back 0

their rotating beers on tap is also a highlight of this place 1

at a time when it seems that film animation has been dominated by disneypixars cgi masterpieces it is both refreshing and comforting to know that miyazaki is still relying on traditional handdrawn animation to tell his charming and enchanting stories 1

there were too many close ups 0 
any ring toneoverall good phone to buy 1

lucy bell is so much higher than this crap and for her to sink this low is quite depressing 0 
its a sad movie but very good 1 
the 12 mega pixel camera being a part of a phone is reasonably good7 1 
avoid this film at all costs 0 
the films sole bright spot was jonah hill who will look almost unrecognizable to fans of the recent superbad due to the amount of weight he lost in the interim 1

but even the talented carrell cant save this 0

to be honest with you this is unbelievable nonsense and very foolish 0 
the only possible way this movie could be redeemed would be as mst3k fodder 0 
the cast of veteran actors are more than just a nostalgia trip 1 
the foreigner is not worth one second of your time 0 
the real killer is the volume and of course it breaking 0 
considering the relations off screen between taylor and stanwyck it was surprising how little chemistry there was on screen between the two of them 0 
after i pulled up my car i waited for another 15 minutes before being acknowledged 0 
meredith m was better than all right 1
