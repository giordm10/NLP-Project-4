thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
must have been an off night at this place 0 
item arrived quickly and works great with my metro pcs samsung schr450 slider phone and sony premium sound in ear plugs 1 
this may be the only bad film he ever made 0 
perhaps my phone is defective but people cannot hear me when i use this 0 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
this is a disgrace 0 
one character is totally annoying with a voice that gives me the feeling of fingernails on a chalkboard 0 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
and the sound quality is great 1 
this is cool because most cases are just open there allowing the screen to get all scratched up 1 
i received my headset in good time and was happy with it 1 
just really good so far probably the best bt headset i have ever had 1 
the color is even prettier than i thought it would be and the graphics are incredibly sharp 1 
enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film 1 
we also ordered the spinach and avocado salad the ingredients were sad and the dressing literally had zero taste 0 
my sister has one also and she loves it 1 
great food 1 
my first visit to hiro was a delight 1 
this place is awesome if you want something light and healthy during the summer 1 
their chow mein is so good 1 
it is very educational for children 1 to 8 years old 1 
someone shouldve invented this sooner 1 
the last 15 minutes of movie are also not bad as well 1 
i even fully charged it before i went to bed and turned off blue tooth and wifi and noticed that it only had 20 left in the morning 0 
he is an amazing film artist one of the most important whoever lived 1 
i love this device 1 
the only suspense i was feeling was the frustration at just how retarded the girls were 0 
works good 1 
go rent it 1 
mobile phone tools are a must have 1 
painful on the ear 0 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
the food is rich so order accordingly 1 
i love the camera its really pretty good quality 1 
the loudspeaker option is great the bumpers with the lights is very appealing 0 
you can watch them preparing the delicious food 1 
wed definitely go back here again 1 
this is the kind of money that is wasted properly 1 
horrible horrible protector 0 
i can take a little bad service but the food sucks 0 
his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic 1 
i have read others reviews here but i havent had any problem with it 1 
owners are really great people 1 
i like steiners because its dark and it feels like a bar 1 
it is light has plenty of battery capacity and is very confortable to wear for somewhat extended periods of time 1 
the only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port irda 0 
dont buy this product it fails 0 
service was good and the company was better 1 
i really wanted the plantronics 510 to be the right one but it has too many issues for methe good 0 
using all earpieces left or right this thing will not stay on my ear 0 
his costars dont fare much better with people like morgan freeman jonah hill and ed helms just wasted 0 
i believe that this place is a great stop for those with a huge belly and hankering for sushi 1 
the kids are very cool too 1 
the phone loads super 1 
i saw mirrormask last night and it was an unsatisfactory experience 0 
if there were zero stars i would give it zero stars 0 
they keep getting better and better this is my third one and ive had numerous palms too 1 
nothing at all to recommend 0 
in conclusion i will not bother with this movie because a volcano in los angeles is nothing but nonsense 0 
he surely doesnt know how to make a coherent action movie from the screenwriter of air force one who was only obliged to write the script just for a big sum of money 0 
i did not bother contacting the company for few dollar product but i learned the lesson that i should not have bought this form online anyway 0 
call me a nut but i think this is one of the best movies ever 1 
walked in and the place smelled like an old grease trap and only 2 others there eating 0 
all it took was one drop from about 6 inches above the kitchen counter and it was crackedi am not impressed and i am not laughing 0 
then our food came out disappointment ensued 0 
the movie showed a lot of florida at its best made it look very appealing 1 
we got sitting fairly fast but ended up waiting 40 minutes just to place our order another 30 minutes before the food arrived 0 
i love the look and feel of samsung flipphones 1 
how can anyone in their right mind ask for anything more from a movie than this 1 
the kids are very cool too 1 
battery has no life 0 
victor mclaglen was even bad and brian donlevy was almost unrecognizable 0 
its a long time since i was so entertained by a movie 1 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
the film gives meaning to the phrase never in the history of human conflict has so much been owed by so many to so few 1 
unfortunately any virtue in this films production work was lost on a regrettable script 0 
not recommended 0 
i like armand assante my cable companys summary sounded interesting so i watched it twice already and probably will again 1 
also difficult to put onid recommend avoiding this product 0 
i dont think ive ever gone to a movie and disliked it as much 0 
i ordered the lemon raspberry ice cocktail which was also incredible 1 
i am far from a sushi connoisseur but i can definitely tell the difference between good food and bad food and this was certainly bad food 0 
everything about this movie is stupid 0 
ill even say it again Â– this is torture 0 
this is a disgrace 0 
an extensive menu provides lots of options for breakfast 1 
horrible had to switch 3 times 0 
you have to hold the phone at a particular angle for the other party to hear you clearly 0 
poorly contstruct hinge 0 
highly recommended for all ages although the younger set will probably not appreciate some of the more subtle references they will certainly appreciate one galley scene in particular 1 
there is nothing authentic about this place 0 
the malta settings are as dry and as barren as the dialogue 0 
this place is horrible and way overpriced 0 
ive had this for nearly 2 years and it has worked great for me 1 
thus far have only visited twice and the food was absolutely delicious each time 1 
this particular model would not work with my motorola q smartphone 0 
special mention should be made of the superb music score and sound effects which are an integral element in helping to make this such a memorable and enjoyable cartoon 1 
the plot such as it is is so derivative and predictable that the ending is like a mercy killing 0 
today was my first taste of a buldogis gourmet hot dog and i have to tell you it was more than i ever thought possible 1 
the scenes are often funny and occasionally touching as the characters evaluate their lives and where they are going 1 
im using it with an iriver spinn with case and it fits fine 1 
when it opens the battery connection is broken and the device is turned off 0 
food was so gooodd 1 
easy to use 1 
i saw this movie and i thought this is a stupid movie 0 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
i wasnt expecting oscar material but this 0 
i advise everyone do not be fooled 0 
brilliance indeed 1 
whatever prompted such a documentary is beyond me 0 
their chow mein is so good 1 
if i take a picture the battery drops a bar and starts beeping letting me know its dieing 0 
this is one of peter watkins most accessible films 1 
pretty cool i would say 1 
point your finger at any item on the menu order it and you wont be disappointed 1 
my headset works just peachykeen 1 
the attempts at humor were pitiful and story is so awful it dosent bear thinking about which basically involves a vulcan stealing the enterprise to find god seriously i just didnt care about any of this film and oh not to mention uhura does a belly dance to distract male guards 0 
im still infatuated with this phone 1 
good item low price 1 
if there were zero stars i would give it zero stars 0 
this is a bad film with bad writing and good actorsan ugly cartoon crafted by paul haggis for people who cant handle anything but the bold strokes in storytellinga picture painted with crayons 0 
the only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive 1 
the noise shield is incrediable 1 
i bought this battery with a coupon from amazon and im very happy with my purchase 1 
i guess i should have known that this place would suck because it is inside of the excalibur but i didnt use my common sense 0 
they have a really nice atmosphere 1 
also great directing and photography 1 
the only possible way this movie could be redeemed would be as mst3k fodder 0 
dont waste your money 0 
the films sole bright spot was jonah hill who will look almost unrecognizable to fans of the recent superbad due to the amount of weight he lost in the interim 1 
fantastic food 1 
trumbull on i love lucy 1 
elias koteasjack palance play good roles angelina is hot and gets nakedbilly drago appears in this and is cool as usual a cameo by sven ole thorsen helps make this a very enjoyable movie with good acting and a decent budget 1 
this place receives stars for their appetizers 1 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
this is essentially a communications tool that does not communicate 0 
however the ear pads come off easily and after only one week i lost one 0 
the pancake was also really good and pretty large at that 1 
i highly recommend this movie for anyone interested in art poetry theater politics or japanese history 1 
it only recognizes the phone as its storage device 0 
comfortable fit you need your headset to be comfortable for at least an hour at a time if not for an entire day 1 
the delivery was on time 1 
the plastic breaks really easy on this clip 0 
now imagine that every single one of those decisions was made wrong 0 
when i opened the sandwich i was impressed but not in a good way 0 
i was hoping for more 0 
would not reccommend 0 
crash is a depressing little nothing that provokes emotion but teaches you nothing if you already know racism and prejudice are bad things 0 
having trouble with volume 0 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
items stated as included from the description are not included 0 
has been working great 1 
the roast beef sandwich tasted really good 1 
the acting from all involved and that includes those like shatner and nimoy is bad and washed out and making them seem as old as they look in real life the special effects are tacky like when spock has to rescue kirk on a jet pack when he falls down from a mountain 0 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
highly unrecommended 0 
after the first charge kept going dead after 12 minutes 0 
drinks took close to 30 minutes to come out at one point 0 
the attention given to every character and complex psychological portrayals detailing loyalty treachery love and hope are tremendous 1 
none of the new ones have ever quite worked properly 0 
overall i wasnt very impressed with noca 0 
nine out of ten for a truly lovely film 1 
the worst was the salmon sashimi 0 
this film highlights the fundamental flaws of the legal process that its not about discovering guilt or innocence but rather is about who presents better in court 1 
i really enjoyed crema cafÃ© before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
no one at the table thought the food was above average or worth the wait that we had for it 0 
great phone 1 
obviously they have a terrible customer service so you get what you pay for 0 
talk about great customer service of course we will be back 1 
i can take a little bad service but the food sucks 0 
greatno problems at all 1 
we recently witnessed her poor quality of management towards other guests as well 0 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
hayao miyazakis latest and eighth film for studio ghibili gake no ue no ponyo ponyo on the cliff by the sea is a wonderfully fun and imaginative look at childhood 1 
a good time 1 
the salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop which was perfectly cooked 1 
10 out of 10 for both the movie and trilogy 1 
unfortunately any virtue in this films production work was lost on a regrettable script 0 
not good by any stretch of the imagination 0 
product was excellent and works better than the verizon one and boy was it cheaper 1 
the jerky camera movements were also annoying 0 
lifetime does not air it enough so if anyone knows what store sells it let me know because this is a musthave 1 
there was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters 0 
the warmth it generates is in contrast to its austere backdrop 1 
excellent 1 
i particularly remember my senses being assaulted by strident cords of music that would blare out with very little warning and even less meaning 0 
ordered burger rare came in well done 0 
disappointed 0 
and considering the two of us left there very full and happy for about 20 you just cant go wrong 1 
the worst phone ive ever had only had it for a few months 0 
my husband said she was very rude did not even apologize for the bad food or anything 0 
wasted two hours 0 
i was disgusted because i was pretty sure that was human hair 0 
i purcashed this for the car charger and it does not work 0 
kind of hard to mess up a steak but they did 0 
i am going to have to be the first to negatively review this product 0 
back to good bbq lighter fare reasonable pricing and tell the public they are back to the old ways 1 
the budget was evidently very limited 0 
i received my headset in good time and was happy with it 1 
main thing i didnt enjoy is that the crowd is of older crowd around mid 30s and up 0 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
2 times very bad customer service 0 
the new characters werent all that memorable and i found myself forgetting who was who 0 
this is probably one of the least effective and utterly unoriginal films i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
being a 90s child i truly enjoyed this show and i can proudly say that i enjoyed it big time and even more than the classical wb cartoons 1 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
very tough and very short on flavor 0 
i had a pretty satifying experience 1 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
warning do not buy 0 
it has northern humour and positive about the community it represents 1 
i have yet to run this new battery below two bars and thats three days without charging 1 
all in all i can assure you ill be back 1 
the service was not up to par either 0 
i have had this phone for over a year now and i will tell you its not that great 0 
i believe the screenwriter did a good job of tying up the loose ends 1 
this place is awesome if you want something light and healthy during the summer 1 
the sets especially designed to work with the camera are amazingstylized beautiful and effective 1 
camera color balance is awful 0 
doesnt hold charge 0 
my boyfriend tried the mediterranean chicken salad and fell in love 1 
i think i was one of the people who found this another one of roths pearls 1 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
this film has no redeeming features 0 
ive had no trouble accessing the internet downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions 1 
there were too many close ups 0 
furthermore you cant even find hours of operation on the website 0 
come hungry leave happy and stuffed 1 
so good i am going to have to review this place twice once hereas a tribute to the place and once as a tribute to an event held here last night 1 
sam shepards portrayal of a gung ho marine was sobering 1 
those phones are working just fine now 1 
this place deserves no stars 0 
id like to return it 0 
love this headset 1 
it has all the features i want 1 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
i wasnt really impressed with strip steak 0 
the desserts were a bit strange 0 
i love the camera its really pretty good quality 1 
our server was super nice and checked on us many times 1 
it was not good 0 
first time there and might just be the last 0 
pricing is a bit of a concern at mellow mushroom 0 
food quality has been horrible 0 
restored my phone to like new performance 1 
thank you for such great service 1 
battery has no life 0 
im so sorry but i really cant recommend it to anyone 0 
i love this phone 1 
the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach 0 
the nokia ca42 usb cable did not work with my phone 0 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
wed definitely go back here again 1 
simply beautiful 1 
but storm trooper is not even bad enough to make it to the list of wonderfully terrible movies 0 
this is the place where i first had pho and it was amazing 1 
i give wirefly 1 stari will contact cingularatt and inform them of this practice 0 
all in all a great disappointment 0 
my wife had the lobster bisque soup which was lukewarm 0 
thus far have only visited twice and the food was absolutely delicious each time 1 
leopard print is wonderfully wild 1 
from what my dinner companions told meeverything was very fresh with nice texture and taste 1 
the seasonal fruit was fresh white peach puree 1 
i love this bluetooth 1 
definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly will return next time im in vegas 1 
the fries were great too 1 
my fiancÃ© and i came in the middle of the day and we were greeted and seated right away 1 
this is the phone to get for 2005 i just bought my s710a and all i can say is wow 1 
they have great dinners 1 
comfortable in my hand 1 
her lines seem to have been written by a fifteen year old though they are trying oh so so hard to sound like how a fifteen year old would really um you know well talk 0 
excellent cast story line performances 1 
also if your phone is dropped this case is not going to save it specially when dropped face down 0 
when a song could explain the emotions of the subjects better such as when jay adams unfortunate life was a subject of talk the song old man by neil young was played which evokes many emotions 1 
i have purchased these for both family and friends and all enjoy their clarity and ease of use 1 
keep up the good work amazon 1 
the budget was evidently very limited 0 
the cinematography is simply stunning to say the least and the fx are nothing if not stateoftheart 1 
however i recently watched the whole thing again on dvd and i was completely struck by how extremely stupid the storyline was how it contained holes inconsistencies and frankly a whole lot of crap and how horrid the dancing was 0 
it is a joy to use 1 
he also came back to check on us regularly excellent service 1 
lifetime does not air it enough so if anyone knows what store sells it let me know because this is a musthave 1 
i waited and waited 0 
in summary this was a largely disappointing dining experience 0 
he was very impressed when going from the original battery to the extended battery 1 
great place to eat reminds me of the little mom and pop shops in the san francisco bay area 1 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
absolutel junk 0 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
i had the mac salad and it was pretty bland so i will not be getting that again 0 
what a big waste of time 0 
honeslty it didnt taste that fresh 0 
stopped by during the late may bank holiday off rick steve recommendation and loved it 1 
sauce was tasteless 0 
those phones are working just fine now 1 
first of all it doesnt wear well 0 
i really dont see how anyone could enjoy this movie 0 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
the malta settings are as dry and as barren as the dialogue 0 
the food came out at a good pace 1 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
it was quite comfortable in the ear 1 
they have been around for years and carries the highest quality of antiglare screen protector that i have found to date 1 
save your money ive had this item for 11 months now 0 
thus far have only visited twice and the food was absolutely delicious each time 1 
its quite simply the highest most superlative form of cinema imaginable 1 
light weight i hardly notice it is there 1 
a cheap and cheerless heist movie with poor characterisation lots of underbite style stoic emoting think chow yun fat in a better tomorrow and some cheesy clichÃ©s thrown into an abandoned factory ready for a few poorly executed flying judo rolls a la john woo 0 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
i vomited in the bathroom mid lunch 0 
aside from its terrible lead this film has loads of other debits 0 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
i knew when i saw the film that more great things were to come from this gifted actor 1 
i give wirefly 1 stari will contact cingularatt and inform them of this practice 0 
magical help 1 
i found the product to be easy to set up and use 1 
ive seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie 0 
then i watched it again two sundays ago march 20th 2005 and i began to really enjoy it and this time i taped the entire thing 1 
just what i wanted 1 
they are so cool 1 
kind of hard to mess up a steak but they did 0 
this particular model would not work with my motorola q smartphone 0 
the puppets look really cheesy not in a good way like in the puppet master 80s flicks 0 
were jerks on the phone 0 
some may say this buffet is pricey but i think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot 1 
arrived quickly and much less expensive than others being sold 1 
it looses connection to the phone even when it is within a couple feet between the two 0 
and dont even get me started on the jerky camerawork 0 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
the first thing that happened was that the tracking was off 0 
i sat riveted to the tv screen 1 
highly recommended for all ages although the younger set will probably not appreciate some of the more subtle references they will certainly appreciate one galley scene in particular 1 
lets start with all the problemsÂ—the acting especially from the lead professor was very very bad 0 
it is practically useless and did not add any kind of boost to my reception after i bought it 0 
the warm beer didnt help 0 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
this place is horrible and way overpriced 0 
the shrimp tender and moist 1 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
ps the only scene in the movie that was cool is when the central character finds her room blown up 1 
today was my first taste of a buldogis gourmet hot dog and i have to tell you it was more than i ever thought possible 1 
it was a long time that i didnt see a so charismatic actor on screen 1 
it looked like a wonderful story 1 
food was great and so was the serivce 1 
for the price on amazon it is an excellent product which i would highly recommend 1 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
very good stuff for the price 1 
all things considered a job very well done 1 
there still are good actors around 1 
the visual effects were awful 0 
in the span of an hour i had two people exclaim whoa is that the new phone on tv 1 
comfortable fit you need your headset to be comfortable for at least an hour at a time if not for an entire day 1 
about ten minutes into this film i started having second thoughts 0 
you can watch them preparing the delicious food 1 
i ate there twice on my last visit and especially enjoyed the salmon salad 1 
ive owned this phone for 7 months now and can say that its the best mobile phone ive had 1 
20th century foxs road house 1948 is not only quite a silly noir but is an implausible unmitigated bore of a movie 0 
there is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again 0 
rip off over charge shipping 0 
battery is holding up well 1 
this is a chilly unremarkable movie about an author livingworking in a chilly abstruse culture 0 
i can assure you that you wont be disappointed 1 
the staff is friendly and the joint is always clean 1 
overall i was not impressed and would not go back 0 
the phone loads super 1 
jamie foxx absolutely is ray charles 1 
terrible my car will not accept this cassette 0 
disappointing 0 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
so just beware 0 
my brother in law who works at the mall ate here same day and guess what he was sick all night too 0 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
of course the acting is blah 0 
of course the acting is blah 0 
the shrimp tender and moist 1 
sending it back 0 
nicest chinese restaurant ive been in a while 1 
the service was a bit lacking 0 
this review is long overdue since i consider a tale of two sisters to be the single greatest film ever made 1 
painful on the ear 0 
this product had a strong rubberpetroleum smell that was unbearable after a while and caused me to return it 0 
love this phone 1 
this film offers many delights and surprises 1 
it was equally awful 0 
nice headset priced right 1 
go to place for gyros 1 
one of the worst shows of all time 0 
this film tries to be a serious and sophisticated thrillerhorror flick and it fails miserably 0 
extremely tasty 1 
its very attractive and appears to be of good quality 1 
the color is even prettier than i thought it would be and the graphics are incredibly sharp 1 
i ordered the voodoo pasta and it was the first time id had really excellent pasta since going gluten free several years ago 1 
the chicken dishes are ok the beef is like shoe leather 0 
pretty good beer selection too 1 
food was great and so was the serivce 1 
waaaaaayyyyyyyyyy over rated is all i am saying 0 
it came free with a dvd player i bought but i still turned the thing off halfway through because i was embarrassed for howell 0 
both the hot sour the egg flower soups were absolutely 5 stars 1 
i had the chicken pho and it tasted very bland 0 
we made the drive all the way from north scottsdale and i was not one bit disappointed 1 
before i go in to why i gave a 1 star rating please know that this was my third time eating at bachi burger before writing a review 0 
if good intentions made a film great then this film might be one of the greatest films ever made 1 
this movie is also revealing 1 
its reception is very very poor 0 
the cinematography is simply stunning to say the least and the fx are nothing if not stateoftheart 1 
go to place for gyros 1 
the first thing that happened was that the tracking was off 0 
definitely a bargain 1 
after a year the battery went completely dead on my headset 0 
not sure who was more lost the flat characters or the audience nearly half of whom walked out 0 
simple lightweight and great fit 1 
great brunch spot 1 
the kids are very cool too 1 
food was average at best 0 
their steaks are 100 recommended 1 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
the phone is sturdy and waterproof 1 
this is actually a very smart movie 1 
i was sitting in my vehicle with the cradle on my belt and the headset lost signal 0 
the only consistent thread holding the series together were the amazing performances of leni parker and anita laselva as the two taelons in quiet idealogical conflict 0 
dont buy this product 0 
tom wilkinson broke my heart at the end and everyone elses judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike 1 
the acting by the whole cast could be put on a scale and balanced perfectly between overacting and underacting 0 
nice headphones for the price and they work great 1 
headset works great was packaged nicely to avoid any damage 1 
the update procedure is difficult and cumbersome 0 
it has northern humour and positive about the community it represents 1 
worst phone ever 0 
its kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly its embarrassing how childlike the company is 0 
everything was good and tasty 1 
each track commands sentiment actually contributing to the scenes and characters 1 
the food was excellent and service was very good 1 
the building itself seems pretty neat the bathroom is pretty trippy but i wouldnt eat here again 0 
this movie is excellentangel is beautiful and scamp is adorablehis little yelps when hes scaredand the funniest parts are whenscamp is caught under the curtain and when angel and scamp are singing ive never had this feeling beforei totally recommend this movieits coming out on special edition on june 20the cover has scamp on a garbage can and angel underneath the lid 1 
the lead man is charismafree 0 
cheap but hey it works was pleasantly suprised given the low cost of this item 1 
i totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is 1 
you get extra minutes so that you can carry out the call and not get cut off 1 
left very frustrated 0 
cooked to perfection and the service was impeccable 1 
we wont be going back 0 
the only good thing was our waiter he was very helpful and kept the bloddy marys coming 1 
i have only had it for a few weeks but so far so good 1 
battery life is also great 1 
after a year the battery went completely dead on my headset 0 
john garfield ann revere lilli plmer william conrad canada leeand filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screenjames wong howe 1 
there is no plot or storyline 0 
i bought this to use with my kindle fire and absolutely loved it 1 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
the basic premise is wasted since it is sidelined by the inexplicable focus on the documentary crew 0 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0

i hate those things as much as cheap quality black olives 0 
10 out of 10 for both the movie and trilogy 1 
its practically perfect in all of them Â– a true masterpiece in a sea of faux masterpieces 1 
the opening sequence of this gem is a classic and the cat n mouse games that follow are a delight to watch 1 
performed awful muffled tinny incoming sound and severe echo for those on the other end of the call 0 
there arent death scenes like in previous movies and the fx are terrible 0 
the sweet potato tots were good but the onion rings were perfection or as close as i have had 1 
the camera on the phone may be used as a dustpan when indoors id rather be using a disposable then this 0 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
the only suspense i was feeling was the frustration at just how retarded the girls were 0 
i saw this short film on hbo the other day and absolutely loved it 1 
as an earlier review noted plug in this charger and nothing happens 0 
i immediately said i wanted to talk to the manager but i did not want to talk to the guy who was doing shots of fireball behind the bar 0 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
loved the casting of jimmy buffet as the science teacher 1 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
im glad the film didnt go for the most obvious choice as a lesser film certainly would have 1 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
perfect for the ps3 1

now the pizza itself was good the peanut sauce was very tasty 1 
this hole in the wall has great mexican street tacos and friendly staff 1 
great phone 1 
what a mistake 0 
five star plus plus 1 
camera color balance is awful 0 
i really wanted the plantronics 510 to be the right one but it has too many issues for methe good 0 
the jerky camera movements were also annoying 0 
it looks very nice 1 
this place is like chipotle but better 1 
highly recommend for any one who has a blue tooth phone 1 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
when i saw it in the theater i thought i was going to be sick 0 
tonight i had the elk filet specialand it sucked 0 
i left with a stomach ache and felt sick the rest of the day 0 
works as described 1 
i was disgusted because i was pretty sure that was human hair 0 
nonlinear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well 1 
they are so easy to love but even more easy to identify with 1 
worth every penny 1 
shes poised and amazing 1 
this is the first phone ive had that has been so cheaply made 0 
the lines the cuts the audio everything is wrong 0 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
the only good thing was our waiter he was very helpful and kept the bloddy marys coming 1 
i mean really how do you get so famous for your fish and chips when its so terrible 0 
it quit working after id used it for about 18 months so i just purchased another one because this is the best headset ive ever owned 1 
the movie in movie situations in the beginning and through the game that is played with her by the acting coach are fascinating 1 
we waited for forty five minutes in vain 0 
saw the movie today and thought it was a good effort good messages for kids 1 
waitress was sweet and funny 1 
buyer beware you could flush money right down the toilet 0 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
i received my headset in good time and was happy with it 1 
the spaghetti is nothing special whatsoever 0 
crostini that came with the salad was stale 0 
imdb ratings only go as low 1 for awful its time to get some negative numbers in there for cases such as these 0 
good food good service 1 
i was sitting in my vehicle with the cradle on my belt and the headset lost signal 0 
i was very excited to get this headset because i thought it was really cute 1 
by this time our side of the restaurant was almost empty so there was no excuse 0 
dont bother go to the store 0 
we had so much to say about the place before we walked in that he expected it to be amazing but was quickly disappointed 0 
10 out of 10 for both the movie and trilogy 1 
i dont think it would hold it too securly on your belt 0 
this phone might well be the worst ive ever had in any brand 0 
the food is not tasty at all not to say its real traditional hunan style 0 
their chow mein is so good 1 
new battery works great in phone 1 
it fits my ear well and is comfortable on 1 
yet i enjoy watching it 1 
it didnt charge for me 0 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
the worst phone ive ever had only had it for a few months 0 
great pocket pc phone combination 1 
excellent sound quality 1 
in an interesting part of town this place is amazing 1 
then our food came out disappointment ensued 0 
dont bother coming here 0 
reasonably priced also 1 
nice solid keyboard 1 
the owner used to work at nobu so this place is really similar for half the price 1 
other than that the leather is nice and soft the fit is very tight the cut out for the face is a good shape 1 
didnt laugh or even smile once 0 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
the movie lacks visual interest drama expression of feeling and celebration of the very patriotism that underlines the narrative 0 
nargile i think you are great 1 
items stated as included from the description are not included 0 
the sound quality is excellent as well 1 
avoid at all costs 0 
the warm beer didnt help 0 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
great place to eat reminds me of the little mom and pop shops in the san francisco bay area 1 
this is the place where i first had pho and it was amazing 1 
how stupid is that 0 
schrader has made a resume full of lousy amateurish films 0 
this place deserves no stars 0 
one character is totally annoying with a voice that gives me the feeling of fingernails on a chalkboard 0 
there is nothing privileged about workingeating there 0 
overall i wasnt very impressed with noca 0 
what happened next was prettyoff putting 0 
the first thing that happened was that the tracking was off 0 
even allowing for poor production values for the time 1971 and the format some kind of miniseries this is baaaaaad 0 
this phone tries very hard to do everything but fails at its very ability to be a phone 0 
unless youre just out to visually collect all extant films of austens work you can skip this one 0 
this second appearance of mickey mouse following the silent plane crazy earlier that year is probably his most famous filmmostly because it was so groundbreaking 1 
the casting is also horrible cause all you see is a really really bad actors period 0 
awesome service and food 1 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
point your finger at any item on the menu order it and you wont be disappointed 1 
the ear buds only play music in one ear 0 
i received my headset in good time and was happy with it 1 
of course the acting is blah 0 
there is simply no excuse for something this poorly done 0 
i did not bother contacting the company for few dollar product but i learned the lesson that i should not have bought this form online anyway 0 
your staff spends more time talking to themselves than me 0 
poor reliability 0 
by the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant i was bored and didnt care what happened next and so i switched off 0 
avoid at all costs 0 
really pleased with this product so far 1 
i think it was robert ryans best film because he portrayed someone like my father and he was a schizophrenic in real lifemy father although he never murdered anyone but was affected more so during the second world war which made him worse 1 
the restaurant atmosphere was exquisite 1 
the sets especially designed to work with the camera are amazingstylized beautiful and effective 1 
why was this film made 0 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
at first i thought i was grtting a good deal at 744 until i plugged it into my phone v3c razr 0 
the two main characters may be two of the most believable children i ever saw put on screen 1 
does not fit 0 
i was very pleased to see that i could replace my well travled swivel holster for my blackberry flip 1 
the mic is great 1 
trouble is the writing and directing make it impossible to establish those things that make a movie watchable like character story theme and so on 0 
director paul matthews who also wrotedirected the weak 1995 monster movie grim clearly doesnt know how to pace his films 0 
bought mainly for the charger which broke soon after purchasing 0 
not a good bargain 0 
we ordered the duck rare and it was pink and tender on the inside with a nice char on the outside 1 
i dont understand how this garbage got on the shelves of the movie store its not even a real movie 0 
the selection was probably the worst ive seen in vegasthere was none 0 
also the fries are without a doubt the worst fries ive ever had 0 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
he is almost unbearable to watch on screen he has little to no charisma and terrible comedic timing 0 
i just cant explain this movie more than romanticcharminghilariousand adorablethe junkyard scenes are funnyall the junkyard dogs have something specialtoo funny i laughedkids will love itbuy it when it comes outit has new features 1 
works for me 1 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
i did not bother contacting the company for few dollar product but i learned the lesson that i should not have bought this form online anyway 0 
the worst piece of crap ever along with the verizon customer service 0 
the burger i got the gold standard a 17 burger and was kind of disappointed 0 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
excellent short film 1 
the plot is nonsense that doesnt interest in the slightest way or have any uniqueness to it 0 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
this movie has a cutting edge to it 1 
the pancake was also really good and pretty large at that 1 
both films are terrible but to the credit of the 1986 version it was watchable 0 
my boyfriend and i sat at the bar and had a completely delightful experience 1 
useless phone simply deaf 0 
nice headphones for the price and they work great 1 
i dont think there are any redeeming qualities in this remake 0 
this is so embarassing and also my ears hurt if i try to push the ear plug into my ear 0 
the warm beer didnt help 0 
i was deeply impressed with the character he played 1 
ill even say it again Â– this is torture 0 
dont buy this product it fails 0 
this item worked great but it broke after 6 months of use 0 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
i cant use this case because the smell is disgusting 0 
all in all a great disappointment 0 
too politically correct 0 
i gave it a 10 1 
waste of money 0 
but now that it is out of warranty the same problems reoccurebottom line put your money somewhere else cingular will not support it 0 
i ordered the lemon raspberry ice cocktail which was also incredible 1 
i have bought this nokia cell phone a few weeks ago and it was a nightmare 0 
cinematography the film was shot in an interesting way 1 
steamboat willie is an amazingly important film to our cinema history 1 
helen baxendale is a very credible lady macbeth who can be very cheerfull at times and sometimes she just looks like a naughty girl but deadly in her taste for blood and evil 1 
not even good for camp value 0 
id love to go back 1 
first time there and might just be the last 0 
i liked this movie way too much 1 
but storm trooper is not even bad enough to make it to the list of wonderfully terrible movies 0 
putting the race card aside lets look at the major flaw in the film they destroy latifas character 0 
yes its that bad 0 
avoid at all cost 0 
i think this restaurant suffers from not trying hard enough 0 
i would highly recommend this product 1 
down the drain because of a weak snap 0 
will definitely be back 1 
great hands free device 1 
the company shipped my product very promptly and it works well 1 
you can find better movies at youtube 0
