i promise they wont disappoint 1 
we have gotten a lot of compliments on it 1 
the foreigner is not worth one second of your time 0 
it worked very well 1 
food quality has been horrible 0 
the greek dressing was very creamy and flavorful 1 
i got to enjoy the seafood salad with a fabulous vinegrette 1 
third the cheese on my friends burger was cold 0 
this is actually a very smart movie 1 
good item low price 1 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
it even has its sweet moments 1 
did not like at all 0 
the microphone also works well but according to people i have called it applifies everything 1 
worst hour and a half of my lifeoh my gosh 0 
anyway the plot flowed smoothly and the malebonding scenes were a hoot 1 
wow loved this place 1 
all in all id expected a better consumer experience from motorola 0 
sprint charges for this service 0 
the story itself is just predictable and lazy 0 
i dont think well be going back anytime soon 0 
to summarize the food was incredible nay transcendant but nothing brings me joy quite like the memory of the pneumatic condiment dispenser 1 
at any rate this film stinks its not funny and fulci should have stayed with giallo and supernatural zombie movies 0 
also if your phone is dropped this case is not going to save it specially when dropped face down 0 
then a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use 0 
dont waste your on this one 0 
i was very excited to get this headset because i thought it was really cute 1 
to call this movie a drama is ridiculous 0 
im still trying to get over how bad it was 0 
the noise shield is incrediable 1 
excellent product for the price 1 
does not work for listening to music with the cingular 8125 0 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
dont waste your money 0 
i know that sounds funny but to me it seemed like sketchy technology that wouldnt work wellwell this one works great 1 
the characters are interesting and you want to find out more about them the longer the movie goes on and i think people will be surprised by who does and doesnt make it 1 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
i went on motorolas website and followed all directions but could not get it to pair again 0 
dont waste your time 0 
good servicecheck 1 
poor voice clarity 0 
fantastic food 1 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
schrader has made a resume full of lousy amateurish films 0 
waiter was a jerk 0 
im so sorry but i really cant recommend it to anyone 0 
i know that sounds funny but to me it seemed like sketchy technology that wouldnt work wellwell this one works great 1 
tied to charger for conversations lasting more than 45 minutesmajor problems 0 
the writers were smack on and i think the best actors and actresses were a bonus to the showthese characters were so real 1 
considering the relations off screen between taylor and stanwyck it was surprising how little chemistry there was on screen between the two of them 0 
god and i can never get that 90 minutes back 0 
if it were possible to give them zero stars theyd have it 0 
love this phone 1 
ive missed numerous calls because of this reason 0 
very serious spoilers this movie was a huge disappointment 0 
the staff is great the food is delish and they have an incredible beer selection 1 
what happened next was prettyoff putting 0 
it was so cool 1 
i dont know exactly what it is about this movie but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our familys memories 1 
avoid this one if you can 0 
join the club and get awesome offers via email 1 
the headset fulfills my requirements so i am happy with my purchase 1 
what the hell kind of crap is that 0 
he deserves 5 stars 1 
cant store anything but phone numbers to sim 0 
raw and sublimely moving 1 
highquality chicken on the chicken caesar salad 1 
very friendly staff 1 
there were too many close ups 0 
the food wasnt good 0 
terrible service 0 
as a courtroom drama its compelling as an indictment on the american justice system its frightening 1 
maybe if they werent cold they would have been somewhat edible 0 
the budget was evidently very limited 0 
its so stupid to have to keep buying new chargers car chargers cradles headphones and car kits every time a new phone comes out 0 
i checked out this place a couple years ago and was not impressed 0 
not much dialogue not much music the whole film was shot as elaborately and aesthetically like a sculpture 1 
ps the only scene in the movie that was cool is when the central character finds her room blown up 1 
lovely little thriller from hitchcock with lots of nice shenanigans surrounding a murdered spy a kidnapped child a nasty church a foreign plot and some random taxidermists 1 
his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic 1 
there was a warm feeling with the service and i felt like their guest for a special treat 1 
filmiing was less expansive 0 
its a fresh subtle and rather sublime effect 1 
the cashier had no care what so ever on what i had to say it still ended up being wayyy overpriced 0 
still i do like this movie for its empowerment of women theres not enough movies out there like this one 1 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
the bt headset was such a disapoinment 0 
as a sushi lover avoid this place by all means 0 
its not hard to make a decent hamburger 0 
2 thumbs up 1 
i got it because it was so small and adorable 1 
then i had to continue pairing it periodically since it somehow kept dropping 0 
very much disappointed with this company 0 
the service was a little slow considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace 0 
the worst sappiest dialogue i could go on and on 0 
love this product 1 
it is an insane game 1 
also the fries are without a doubt the worst fries ive ever had 0 
i keep watching it over and over 1 
great product fast shipping 1 
bland and flavorless is a good way of describing the barely tepid meat 0 
its welldesigned and very sharp the blue is a very nice color 1 
its worth driving up from tucson 1 
best tater tots in the southwest 1 
on the up side their cafe serves really good food 1 
it quit working after id used it for about 18 months so i just purchased another one because this is the best headset ive ever owned 1 
its not what it says it is 0 
never going back 0 
a lot of websites have been rating this a very good phone and so do i 1 
worthless product 0 
lots of holes in the script 0 
will not be back 0 
its practically perfect in all of them  a true masterpiece in a sea of faux masterpieces 1 
there is really nothing for me at postinos hope your experience is better 0 
the croutons also taste homemade which is an extra plus 1 
you truly take this journey through the eyes and soul of a child 1 
actually the graphics were good at the time 1 
this is some seriously good pizza and im an expertconnisseur on the topic 1 
lately they have been extremely nice and helpful on the phone 1 
dont waste your money 0 
the cable looks so thin and flimsy it is scary 0 
i have had mine for about a year and this christmas i bought some for the rest of the family 1 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
better than youd expect 1 
this place is pretty good nice little vibe in the restaurant 1 
bad fit way too big 0 
bad choice 0 
very slow at seating even with reservation 0 
love the margaritas too 1 
you can even take self portraits with the outside exterior display very cool 1 
the kids are very cool too 1 
the pan cakes everyone are raving about taste like a sugary disaster tailored to the palate of a six year old 0 
and service was super friendly 1 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
yet i enjoy watching it 1 
at no point in the proceedings does it look remotely like america 0 
go to place for gyros 1 
great place to relax and have an awesome burger and beer 1 
dont waste your money 0 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
when im on this side of town this will definitely be a spot ill hit up again 1 
food was average at best 0 
bad purchase 0 
really ugly 0 
id rather eat airline food seriously 0 
the reception is excellent 1 
a very very very slowmoving aimless movie about a distressed drifting young man 0 
food was good service was good prices were good 1 
stay away from the q 0 
so just beware 0 
the phone loads super 1 
the holster that arrived did not match the photo in the ad 0 
the construction of the headsets is poor 0 
unfortunately cover girl is an example of how hollywood used to exploit women for financial gain 0 
the only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive 1 
the acting is terrible and the writing is worse 0 
unfortunately cover girl is an example of how hollywood used to exploit women for financial gain 0 
also notable is john baileys fine crisp beautifully colored cinematography and the great production design costumes by eiko ishioka who went on to do the memorable costumes for coppolas dracula for which she received a well deserved oscar 1 
go to place for gyros 1 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
youd have to have the iq of particularly stupid mollusk not to see that one coming 0 
i think it was robert ryans best film because he portrayed someone like my father and he was a schizophrenic in real lifemy father although he never murdered anyone but was affected more so during the second world war which made him worse 1 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
the bose noise cancelling is amazing which is very important for a nyc commuter 1 
rating 1 out of 10 0 
this is definitely one of the better documentaries i have seen looking at family relationships and marriage 1 
the performances are real and gripping the crocdodile is extremely well done indeed if the black water website is to be believed thats because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous 1 
just does not work 0 
bad fit way too big 0 
one of my favorite purchases ever 1 
i saw this film over christmas and what a great film it was 1 
you could drive a semi truck into these holes 0 
i dont think there are any redeeming qualities in this remake 0 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
i really wanted the plantronics 510 to be the right one but it has too many issues for methe good 0 
a piece of cinematic garbage captured on celluloid 0 
if you have several dozen or several hundred contacts then imagine the fun of sending each of them one by one 0 
special thanks to dylan t for the recommendation on what to order all yummy for my tummy 1 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
the dialogue sucked 0 
best of luck to the rude and noncustomer service focused new management 0 
i get absolutely horrible reception in my apartment where with other phones i have not had this problem 0 
not recommended 0 
all in all im quite satisfied with this purchase 1 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
i mean really how do you get so famous for your fish and chips when its so terrible 0 
i own a jabra earset and was very happy with it but the sound quality especially outgoing on this is better 1 
that said our mouths and bellies were still quite pleased 1 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
i do not know if this was emilio estevezs directorial debut but the pacing the interplay and development of the characters as well as some clever camera work surrounding the character estevez plays all suggest a natural eye 1 
it looked like a wonderful story 1 
not as good as i had hoped 0 
what did bother me was the slow service 0 
i love this phone 1 
personally i think it shows that people should learn to find a compromise them self without involving other people into issue 1 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
i found this place by accident and i could not be happier 1 
i would recommend it 1 
we are so glad we found this place 1 
worked perfectly 1 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
its not hard to make a decent hamburger 0 
you get extra minutes so that you can carry out the call and not get cut off 1 
his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic 1 
lot of holes in the plot theres nothing about how he became the emperor nothing about where he spend 20 years between his childhood and mature age 0 
great audio 1 
my boyfriend and i came here for the first time on a recent trip to vegas and could not have been more pleased with the quality of food and service 1 
this phone tries very hard to do everything but fails at its very ability to be a phone 0 
think of the film being like a dream 1 
i could not recommend these more 0 
would not reccommend 0 
i connected my wifes bluetoothmotorola hs850 to my phone and it worked like a charm whether the phone was in my pocket or the case 1 
delete this film from your mind 0 
i knew when i saw the film that more great things were to come from this gifted actor 1 
phenomenal food service and ambiance 1 
my sister has one also and she loves it 1 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
im still infatuated with this phone 1 
the movie lacks visual interest drama expression of feeling and celebration of the very patriotism that underlines the narrative 0 
ordered an appetizer and took 40 minutes and then the pizza another 10 minutes 0 
service is perfect and the family atmosphere is nice to see 1 
all of the tapas dishes were delicious 1 
motorola finally got the voice quality of a bluetooth headset right 1 
the pairing of the two devices was so easy it barely took a couple minutes before i started making calls with the voice dialing feature 1 
editing the editing of this film was phenomenal in my opinion 1 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
this is a chilly unremarkable movie about an author livingworking in a chilly abstruse culture 0 
you also cannot take pictures with it in the case because the lense is covered 0 
so badwellits just bad 0 
also its slim enough to fit into my alarm clock docking station without removing the case 1 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
trumbull on i love lucy 1 
not to mention the combination of pears almonds and bacon is a big winner 1 
if it was to turn my good day feeling into a night of disturbing memories than i guess he succeeded 0 
cooked to perfection and the service was impeccable 1 
the text messaging feature is really tricky to use 0 
cinematography the film was shot in an interesting way 1 
avoid avoid avoid 0 
comfort for our whole family 1 
design flaw 0 
i was sitting in my vehicle with the cradle on my belt and the headset lost signal 0 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
but storm trooper is not even bad enough to make it to the list of wonderfully terrible movies 0 
for readers who have already seen one of miyazakis films he is still in top form and made another worthwhile experience 1 
not loud enough and doesnt turn on like it should 0 
then i had to continue pairing it periodically since it somehow kept dropping 0 
the block was amazing 1 
nice ambiance 1 
i saw mirrormask last night and it was an unsatisfactory experience 0 
now this dish was quite flavourful 1 
however the keypads are so tinny that i sometimes reach the wrong buttons 0 
the presentation of the food was awful 0 
every time he opened his mouth you expect to hear you see kids pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show 0 
adapter does not provide enough charging current 0 
frankly after cotton club and unfaithful it was kind of embarrassing to watch lane and gere in this film because it is bad 0 
but in any case the best part is you can download these pictures to your laptop using ir or even send pictures from your laptop to the phone 1 
im glad the film didnt go for the most obvious choice as a lesser film certainly would have 1 
no im going to eat the potato that i found some strangers hair in it 0 
you get what you pay for i guess 0 
regrettably the film fails 0 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
all it took was one drop from about 6 inches above the kitchen counter and it was crackedi am not impressed and i am not laughing 0 
i only hear garbage for audio 0 
no complaints 1 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
doesnt hold charge 0 
this movie is also revealing 1 
but its just not funny 0 
very poor service 0 
seller shipped quickly and much cheaper than the competitors 1 
muddy low quality sound and the casing around the wires insert was poorly super glued and slid off 0 
special mention should be made of the superb music score and sound effects which are an integral element in helping to make this such a memorable and enjoyable cartoon 1 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
i dont have very many words to say about this place but it does everything pretty well 1 
i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
a standout scene 1 
we ordered some old classics and some new dishes after going there a few times and were sorely disappointed with everything 0 
personally i think it shows that people should learn to find a compromise them self without involving other people into issue 1 
this phone tries very hard to do everything but fails at its very ability to be a phone 0 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
poor construction 0 
in addition to having one of the most lovely songs ever written french cancan also boasts one of the cutest leading ladies ever to grace the screen 1 
about 30 minutes of footage is wasted to show mediocre elderly actors awkwardly babbling overwrought pseudosatanic gibberish corny enough to make a teen goth blush almost always in olde english and sometimes in latin that may or may not be made up words 0 
i did not bother contacting the company for few dollar product but i learned the lesson that i should not have bought this form online anyway 0 
fast service 1 
whatever prompted such a documentary is beyond me 0 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
the best phone in market 1 
very windresistant 1 
i recommend igo to anyone with different brand cell phonesmp3 players in the family 1 
soggy and not good 0 
all in all its an insult to ones intelligence and a huge waste of money 0 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
i swung in to give them a try but was deeply disappointed 0 
excellent hands free tool 1 
this is one of the best movies out there that shows such strong sibling bond for each other 1 
its quite simply the highest most superlative form of cinema imaginable 1 
it is very comfortable to wear as well which is probably the most important aspect about using a case 1 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
this place is pretty good nice little vibe in the restaurant 1 
director paul matthews who also wrotedirected the weak 1995 monster movie grim clearly doesnt know how to pace his films 0 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
waste your money on this game 1 
excellent phone 1 
and i just love the colors 1 
it is shameful 0 
verizons bills however are difficult to understand even though their pricing plans are simple 0 
perfect for someone me who only likes beer ice cold or in this case even colder 1 
it was a riot to see hugo weaving play a sexobsessed gay real estate salesman who uses his clients houses for his trysts with the flaming darren tom hollander 1 
speaking of the music it is unbearably predictably and kitchy 0 
the attractive set used throughout most of the film is an eyepleasing gem 1 
if you have several dozen or several hundred contacts then imagine the fun of sending each of them one by one 0 
this is a witty and delightful adaptation of the dr seuss book brilliantly animated by upas finest and thoroughly deserving of its academy award 1 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
this is an excellent film 1 
an hour seriously 0 
needless to say we will never be back here again 0 
but it picked up speed and got right to the point 1 
best headset ever 1 
my only complaint is the standard sound volume is a little low even when turned up to 5of 5 0 
what on earth is irons doing in this film 0 
gets the job done 1 
always a great time at dos gringos 1 
light weight i hardly notice it is there 1 
the cashew cream sauce was bland and the vegetables were undercooked 0 
although i very much liked the look and sound of this place the actual experience was a bit disappointing 0 
on a positive note our server was very attentive and provided great service 1 
lasted one day and then blew up 0 
it kept getting worse and worse so now im officially done 0 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
on the ground right next to our table was a large smeared beensteppedinandtrackedeverywhere pile of green bird poop 0 
i hope this place sticks around 1 
however the ear pads come off easily and after only one week i lost one 0 
the fries were great too 1 
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 
i recently had problems where i could not stay connected for more than 10 minutes before being disconnected 0 
definitely will come back here again 1 
great phone 1 
the best electronics of the available fm transmitters 1 
the charger worked for about a week and then completely stopped charging my phone 0 
i love my 350 headset my jabra350 bluetooth headset is great the reception is very good and the ear piece is a comfortable fit 1 
saggy floppy piece of junk 0 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
what happened next was prettyoff putting 0 
everything from acting to cinematography was solid 1 
it was awesome 1 
i probably would not go here again 0 
great food and great service in a clean and friendly setting 1 
top line dont waste your time and money on this one its as bad as it comes 0 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
the only consistent thread holding the series together were the amazing performances of leni parker and anita laselva as the two taelons in quiet idealogical conflict 0 
the salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop which was perfectly cooked 1 
also the fries are without a doubt the worst fries ive ever had 0 
our server was very nice and even though he looked a little overwhelmed with all of our needs he stayed professional and friendly until the end 1 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
voice quality signal strength dropped calls 0 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
it is super charged up for use as a small hybrid palmtopcameracellphone and excels in those roles 1 
the plug did not work very well 0 
nice ambiance 1 
a great way to finish a great 1 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
five star plus plus 1 
their research and development division obviously knows what theyre doing 1 
bad characters bad story and bad acting 0 
the cg opening sequence in space looked like it could have been created on microsoft slideshow for gods sake 0 
good value works fine power via usb car or wall outlet 1 
worst phone ever 0 
this is one of the worst sandra bullock movie since speed 2 but not quite that bad 0 
timely shipment and quality product 1 
battery is terrible 0 
piece of trash 0 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
the sweet potato tots were good but the onion rings were perfection or as close as i have had 1 
this is a great restaurant at the mandalay bay 1 
its very attractive and appears to be of good quality 1 
problem is that the ear loops are made of weak material and break easily 0 
everything about this film is simply incredible 1 
in the summer you can dine in a charming outdoor patio so very delightful 1 
thats how id describe this painfully dreary timewaster of a film 0 
never got it 0 
the soundtrack wasnt terrible either 1 
i did not expect this to be so good 1 
god and i can never get that 90 minutes back 0 
wont work right or atleast for me 0 
great phone 1 
it was attached to a gas station and that is rarely a good sign 0 
theres really nothing bad i can say about this headset 0 
my friend did not like his bloody mary 0 
delicious nyc bagels good selections of cream cheese real lox with capers even 1 
the script is horrendously stupid 0 
looks great and is strong 1 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
point your finger at any item on the menu order it and you wont be disappointed 1 
seafood was limited to boiled shrimp and crab legs but the crab legs definitely did not taste fresh 0 
thank you for such great service 1 
the pan cakes everyone are raving about taste like a sugary disaster tailored to the palate of a six year old 0 
i received my headset in good time and was happy with it 1 
aside from its terrible lead this film has loads of other debits 0 
never going back 0 
mishima is extremely uninteresting 0 
love it great armband 1 
i do think tom hanks is a good actor 1 
in fact this stinker smells like a directtovideo release 0 
then the film just dropped the ball 0 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
special mention should be made of the superb music score and sound effects which are an integral element in helping to make this such a memorable and enjoyable cartoon 1 
it was either too cold not enough flavor or just bad 0 
in the summer you can dine in a charming outdoor patio so very delightful 1 
the scenes with the ohsomature neighbourgirl are a misplace 0 
this movie is greatespecially if you enjoy visual arts 1 
a drive thru means you do not want to wait around for half an hour for your food but somehow when we end up going here they make us wait and wait 0 
the visual effects were awful 0 
never got it 0 
my fiancé and i came in the middle of the day and we were greeted and seated right away 1 
fantastic buy and will get again for whatever my next phone is 1 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
the chicken wings contained the driest chicken meat i have ever eaten 0 
helen baxendale is a very credible lady macbeth who can be very cheerfull at times and sometimes she just looks like a naughty girl but deadly in her taste for blood and evil 1 
how this piece of trash was ever released is beyond me the acting the story the characters the supposedly special effects etcits all wrong 0 
the veggitarian platter is out of this world 1 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
everything stinks 0 
however after seeing the short again after about 25 years i was amazed at how timeless the film actually is 1 
so far so good 1 
delicious 1 
sucked most of the stuff does not work with my phone 0 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
it was pretty gross 0 
cant get the software to work with my computer 0 
poor construction 0 
i left the theater with a lilt in my step joy in my heart and hope for the human race 1 
avoid at any and all costs 0 
if you are razr owneryou must have this 1 
great value 1 
after all the rave reviews i couldnt wait to eat herewhat a disappointment 0 
probably not in a hurry to go back 0 
this place is way too overpriced for mediocre food 0 
i took back my money and got outta there 0 
reaching for the bottom row is uncomfortable and the send and end keys are not where i expect them to be3 0 
i cannot make calls at certain places 0 
excellent service 1 
ill definitely be in soon again 1 
so for our enjoyment we get to see them run around play games and be dangerous 1 
his performance is simply genius 1 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
this one works and was priced right 1 
food arrived quickly 1 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
well packaged arrived on time and works as intended 1 
hes a national treasure 1 
the selection of food was not the best 0 
my sister has one also and she loves it 1 
and then tragedy struck 0 
service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is vegas and located inside the crystals shopping mall by aria 1 
i think the most wonderful parts literally full of wonder are the excerpts from his works 1 
emily watsons character is very strong and she has only to give a quick glance and you understand everything 1 
i contacted the company and they told me that although the unit was still under warranty if i couldnt produce my receipt i was out of luck 0 
overall a delight 1 
everything was fresh and delicious 1 
this is a simple little phone to use but the breakage is unacceptible 0 
the battery life is highly unacceptable 0 
this phone is slim and light and the display is beautiful 1 
it is an excellent drama an excellent thriller and an excellent film 1 
what a mistake that was 0 
the results well are a shame 0 
and the accents are absolutely abysmal 0 
but now i was completely grossed out 0 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
you could drive a semi truck into these holes 0 
the only consistent thread holding the series together were the amazing performances of leni parker and anita laselva as the two taelons in quiet idealogical conflict 0 
worst service to boot but that is the least of their worries 0 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
timely shipment and quality product 1 
the croutons also taste homemade which is an extra plus 1 
i never walked out of a movie faster 0 
worst customer service 0 
dont buy it 0 
what is even more stupid is that who had thought an idea that there should be a volcano in los angeles 0 
i started this review with two stars but im editing it to give it only one 0

i am pairing this with my iphone and i could not be happier with it so far 1 
the budget was evidently very limited 0 
i could not understand what kind of idiot would produce this mess in the first place not to mention several season 0 
my salad had a bland vinegrette on the baby greens and hearts of palm 0 
they were goldencrispy and delicious 1 
ive dropped my phone more times than i can say even on concrete and my phone is still great knock on wood 1 
overall i wasnt very impressed with noca 0 
i think this restaurant suffers from not trying hard enough 0 
the company shipped my product very promptly and it works well 1 
this is one of the best movies out there that shows such strong sibling bond for each other 1 
i love this phone 1 
all it took was one drop from about 6 inches above the kitchen counter and it was crackedi am not impressed and i am not laughing 0 
the acting by the whole cast could be put on a scale and balanced perfectly between overacting and underacting 0 
why was this film made 0 
then i watched it again two sundays ago march 20th 2005 and i began to really enjoy it and this time i taped the entire thing 1 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
from here on the widmark character turns unintentionally comical 0 
if good intentions made a film great then this film might be one of the greatest films ever made 1

the black eyed peas and sweet potatoes unreal 1 
my salad had a bland vinegrette on the baby greens and hearts of palm 0

the sound is clear and the people i talk to on it are amazed at the quality too 1 
the phone takes forever to charge like 2 to 5 hours literally 0 
at first glance it is a lovely bakery cafe nice ambiance clean friendly staff 1 
though the wind and the lion is told largely through the eyes of the son every member of the family can identify with one of the characters whether it be sean connerys noble brigand candace bergens feisty heroine john hustons wily john hay or steve kanalys spiffy radiant ruthless cando lieutenant roosevelts big stick 1 
comfortable nice range good battery life 1 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
the vanilla ice cream was creamy and smooth while the profiterole choux pastry was fresh enough 1 
great place to eat reminds me of the little mom and pop shops in the san francisco bay area 1 
it wasnt busy at all and now we know why 0 
this isnt a small family restaurant this is a fine dining establishment 1 
does everything it should and more 1

the fries were great too 1 
we have gotten a lot of compliments on it 1 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
every element of this story was so over the top excessively phony and contrived that it was painful to sit through 0 
would not reccommend 0 
and the red curry had so much bamboo shoots and wasnt very tasty to me 0 
this movie is also revealing 1 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
i was bored throughout the whole damn thing 0 
i love being able to use one headset for both by landline and cell 1 
the food was barely lukewarm so it must have been sitting waiting for the server to bring it out to us 0

waitress was a little slow in service 0 
i dont each much pasta but i love the homemade hand made pastas and thin pizzas here 1 
the restaurant is very clean and has a family restaurant feel to it 1 
this movie contained an allstar cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i havent seen before 1

each day of the week they have a different deal and its all so delicious 1 
i own 2 of these cases and would order another 1 
disappointing 0 
the plantains were the worst ive ever tasted 0 
the dining space is tiny but elegantly decorated and comfortable 1 
we sat another ten minutes and finally gave up and left 0

the file browser offers all the options that one needshandsfree is great 1 
the phone crashed completely and now i have to get it replaced 0 
what is even more stupid is that who had thought an idea that there should be a volcano in los angeles 0 
good value works fine power via usb car or wall outlet 1 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
but now i was completely grossed out 0

poor product 0 
i have to use the smallest earpieces provided but it stays on pretty well 1 
a disappointment 0 
to those who find this movie intelligent or even masterful i can only say its your intelligence and your imagination you obviously used to try and make some sense of this pitiful attempt its in our human nature to try and make sense of things 0 
everyone is treated equally special 1 
works great when my cat attacked the phone he scratched the protective strip instead of destroying the screen 1 
reasonably priced also 1 
this particular model would not work with my motorola q smartphone 0 
still its quite interesting and entertaining to follow 1 
we received a white colored battery that goes dead after a couple hoursthe original used to last a week but still lasts longer than thereplacement 0 
works great 1 
a good time 1 
i will never go back to this place and will never ever recommended this place to anyone 0 
if it were possible to give them zero stars theyd have it 0 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
it was a riot to see hugo weaving play a sexobsessed gay real estate salesman who uses his clients houses for his trysts with the flaming darren tom hollander 1 
any grandmother can make a roasted chicken better than this one 0 
i would not recommend this place 0 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
poor product 0
