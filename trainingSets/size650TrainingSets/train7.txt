there still are good actors around 1 
works like a charm it work the same as the one i got with the phone 1 
prosgood camera very nice pictures also has cool styles like black and white and more 1 
the bipolarity of the ruthless thug one minute a ruthless killer the next minute a luvs diaper commercial is completely unconvincing 0 
case was more or less an extra that i originally put on but later discarded because it scratched my ear 0 
food is way overpriced and portions are fucking small 0 
they keep getting better and better this is my third one and ive had numerous palms too 1 
often the dialogue doesnt really follow from one line to another or fit the surroundings 0 
it is very comfortable to wear as well which is probably the most important aspect about using a case 1 
similarly the delivery man did not say a word of apology when our food was 45 minutes late 0 
my husband and i ate lunch here and were very disappointed with the food and service 0 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
the casting is also horrible cause all you see is a really really bad actors period 0 
the movie showed a lot of florida at its best made it look very appealing 1 
worked great 1 
excellent product 1 
piece of junk 0 
avoid this one if you can 0 
not only did the software do a great job of this i could also make my own ringtones form my existing cds without an internet connection 1 
it is rare when a filmmaker takes the time to tell a worthy moral tale with care and love that doesnt fall into the trap of being overly syrupy or over indulgent 1 
its a sad movie but very good 1 
the ripped banana was not only ripped but petrified and tasteless 0 
the best place to go for a tasty bowl of pho 1 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
cant upload ringtones from a third party 0 
the volume for the ringer is real good you have choices how loud 1 
ill be looking for a new earpiece 0 
the shower area is outside so you can only rinse not take a full shower unless you dont mind being nude for everyone to see 0 
not to mention the combination of pears almonds and bacon is a big winner 1 
i also didnt like the on button it felt like it would crack with use 0 
i wasnt really impressed with strip steak 0 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
both rickman and stowe play their roles to the hilt in this tale of a childrens book writer who maybe has written a subversive tract 1 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
i think that it is a must see older john wayne film 1 
jamie foxx absolutely is ray charles 1 
their menu is diverse and reasonably priced 1 
i would advise to not purchase this item it never worked very well 0 
poor quality and service 0 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
the pan cakes everyone are raving about taste like a sugary disaster tailored to the palate of a six year old 0 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
mobile phone tools are a must have 1 
it fits so securely that the ear hook does not even need to be used and the sound is better directed through your ear canal 1 
the film gives meaning to the phrase never in the history of human conflict has so much been owed by so many to so few 1 
today the graphics are crap 0 
totally different with loads of understatement and black comedy this is a film few get to see but those who do will remember it 1 
those phones are working just fine now 1 
the food is good 1 
about half way through this film i started to dislike it 0 
i was very pleased to see that i could replace my well travled swivel holster for my blackberry flip 1 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
hell no will i go back 0 
my ribeye steak was cooked perfectly and had great mesquite flavor 1 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
this place is pretty good nice little vibe in the restaurant 1 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
worst service to boot but that is the least of their worries 0 
paolo sorrentino has written a wonderful story about loneliness and tony has built one of the most unforgettable characters seen in movies in recent years 1 
server did a great job handling our large rowdy table 1 
i really loved the story line and the poler bear was kinda cutebut if anyone has a question about fort steele just ask away 1 
i am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this 1 
every time he opened his mouth you expect to hear you see kids pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show 0 
everything about this movie is stupid 0 
i had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get some relief 0 
it was that loudglad to say that the plantronics 510 maintains a flawless connection to my cell and with no static during normal use 1 
verizon tech support walked my through a few procedures none of which worked and i ended up having to do a hard reset wiping out all my data 0 
doesnt last long 0 
i dont think ill be running back to carlys anytime soon for food 0 
this is was due to the fact that it took 20 minutes to be acknowledged then another 35 minutes to get our foodand they kept forgetting things 0 
the battery is completely useless to me 0 
we ordered the duck rare and it was pink and tender on the inside with a nice char on the outside 1 
everything is appalling 0 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
it is zillion times away from reality 0 
in my house i was getting dropped coverage upstairs and no coverage in my basement 0 
just what i wanted 1 
all in all im quite satisfied with this purchase 1 
i think the most wonderful parts literally full of wonder are the excerpts from his works 1 
i especially love the long battery life 1 
worthwhile 1 
long whiny and pointless 0 
im probably one of the few people to ever go to ians and not like it 0 
waaaaaayyyyyyyyyy over rated is all i am saying 0 
join the club and get awesome offers via email 1 
all in all a great disappointment 0 
the directing seems too pretentious 0 
and those baby owls were adorable 1 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
though the wind and the lion is told largely through the eyes of the son every member of the family can identify with one of the characters whether it be sean connerys noble brigand candace bergens feisty heroine john hustons wily john hay or steve kanalys spiffy radiant ruthless cando lieutenant roosevelts big stick 1 
they keep getting better and better this is my third one and ive had numerous palms too 1 
i had a pretty satifying experience 1 
great place to eat reminds me of the little mom and pop shops in the san francisco bay area 1 
once you get inside youll be impressed with the place 1 
service is perfect and the family atmosphere is nice to see 1 
my girlfriends veal was very bad 0 
frozen pucks of disgust with some of the worst people behind the register 0 
the jerky camera movements were also annoying 0 
the acting was bad 0 
items stated as included from the description are not included 0 
a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it 1 
an hour seriously 0 
hes a national treasure 1 
small sleek impressive looking practical setup with ample storage in place 1 
five star plus plus 1 
absolutel junk 0 
product is useless since it does not have enough charging current to charge the 2 cellphones i was planning to use it with 0 
the chicken dishes are ok the beef is like shoe leather 0 
logitech bluetooth headset is a 10 1 
the result is a powerhouse achievement made more timely now perhaps because of our cultures disturbing fascination with celebrity and its distorted interpretations of fame 1 
attempting artiness with black white and clever camera angles the movie disappointed became even more ridiculous as the acting was poor and the plot and lines almost nonexistent 0 
i went to bachi burger on a friends recommendation and was not disappointed 1 
the service was terrible food was mediocre 0 
the movie lacks visual interest drama expression of feeling and celebration of the very patriotism that underlines the narrative 0 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
even in my bmw 3 series which is fairly quiet i have trouble hearing what the other person is saying 0 
the buttons for on and off are bad 0 
yes this film does require a rather significant amount of puzzlesolving but the pieces fit together to create a beautiful picture 1 
just does not work 0 
we enjoy their pizza and brunch 1 
this movie is a good and humorous comment on life in 2006 1 
it was awesome 1 
very dissapointing performance 0 
i never come again 0 
it was that year however that reminded us that huston was still at the top of his game as evinced by his faithful adaptation of james joyces acclaimed novella the dead 1 
i guess i should have known that this place would suck because it is inside of the excalibur but i didnt use my common sense 0 
50 down the drain 0 
i have to use the smallest earpieces provided but it stays on pretty well 1 
awesome selection of beer 1 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
this movie has a cutting edge to it 1 
it even has its sweet moments 1 
this is a disgrace 0 
then as if i hadnt wasted enough of my life there they poured salt in the wound by drawing out the time it took to bring the check 0 
and the rest of it just sits there being awful with soldiers singing songs about the masculinity they pledge themselves to hairsplitting about purity the admiration of swords etc 0 
horrible dont waste your time and money 0 
poor voice clarity 0 
service was exceptional and food was a good as all the reviews 1 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
juano hernandez an exceptional actor who played supporting roles in many films of the era is a proud black man who is accused of murdering a white man in the south 1 
please dont waste your money 0 
i dont understand how this garbage got on the shelves of the movie store its not even a real movie 0 
the price is reasonable and the service is great 1 
worth every penny 1 
and i just love the colors 1 
cooked to perfection and the service was impeccable 1 
terrible management 0 
as for the mains also uninspired 0 
the best place in vegas for breakfast just check out a sat or sun 1 
bad purchase 0 
lewis blacks considerable talent is wasted here too as he is at his most incendiary when he is unrestrained which the pg13 rating certainly wont allow 0 
lets start with all the problemsthe acting especially from the lead professor was very very bad 0 
i highly recommend this case 1 
the phone was unusable and was not new 0 
this would not even be good as a made for tv flick 0 
in addition to having one of the most lovely songs ever written french cancan also boasts one of the cutest leading ladies ever to grace the screen 1 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
if you havent gone here go now 1 
your servers suck wait correction our server heimer sucked 0 
very much disappointed with this company 0 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
i must say i have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again 1 
they have been around for years and carries the highest quality of antiglare screen protector that i have found to date 1 
it features an outlandish array of memorable psychotic but lovable nuts 1 
it dit not work most of the time with my nokia 5320 0 
their menu is diverse and reasonably priced 1 
superb phone on a great network 1 
i dont have very many words to say about this place but it does everything pretty well 1 
the keyboard is a nice compromise between a full qwerty and the basic cell phone number keypad 1 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
it was that year however that reminded us that huston was still at the top of his game as evinced by his faithful adaptation of james joyces acclaimed novella the dead 1 
the only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port irda 0 
the problem was the script 0 
waitress was good though 1 
it defeats the purpose of a bluetooth headset 0 
seriously killer hot chai latte 1 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
i wish i could return the unit and get back my money 0 
the bathrooms are clean and the place itself is well decorated 1 
clever and a real crowdpleaserthis film still ranks among mickeys best films even after 80 wonderful years 1 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
mark my words this is one of those cult films like evil dead 2 or phantasm that people will still be discovering and falling in love with 20 30 40 years down the line 1 
its really easy 1 
not loud enough and doesnt turn on like it should 0 
the incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film 1 
its just adorable seeing mickey playing turkey in the straw in a highly imaginative if occasionally cruel way 1 
everything stinks 0 
i thought errol flynn was brilliant as custer and has since become my favourite actor 1 
after all the rave reviews i couldnt wait to eat herewhat a disappointment 0 
you truly take this journey through the eyes and soul of a child 1 
we ordered some old classics and some new dishes after going there a few times and were sorely disappointed with everything 0 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
poorly contstruct hinge 0 
very good food great atmosphere1 1 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
the price is reasonable and the service is great 1 
item arrived quickly and works great with my metro pcs samsung schr450 slider phone and sony premium sound in ear plugs 1 
if you look for authentic thai food go else where 0 
my gyro was basically lettuce only 0 
the best place in vegas for breakfast just check out a sat or sun 1 
highly recommended for all ages although the younger set will probably not appreciate some of the more subtle references they will certainly appreciate one galley scene in particular 1 
the service was outshining i definitely recommend the halibut 1 
bad reception 0 
i will not be eating there again 0 
about half way through this film i started to dislike it 0 
this is a beautiful phone 1 
star trek v the final frontier is the worst in the series 0 
good value great food great service 1 
this is an outstanding little restaurant with some of the best food i have ever tasted 1 
back to good bbq lighter fare reasonable pricing and tell the public they are back to the old ways 1 
they refuse to refund or replace 0 
the mic is great 1 
absolutely great 1 
highly entertaining at all angles 1 
i have 23 bars on my cell phone when i am home but you cant not hear anything 0 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it 1 
i probably wont be coming back here 0 
i mean this in a terrible way 0 
i would advise to not purchase this item it never worked very well 0 
there is a lot of beautiful places 1 
mishima is extremely uninteresting 0 
amazon sucks 0 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
good transmit audio 1 
the awful dialogue and hopeless overacting by everyone who gets shot top off a real waste of space and time 0 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
we had so much to say about the place before we walked in that he expected it to be amazing but was quickly disappointed 0 
great brunch spot 1 
heres where the movie really pied me off 0 
an awesome new look for fall 2000 1 
the characters are interesting and you really care for them 1 
hayao miyazakis latest and eighth film for studio ghibili gake no ue no ponyo ponyo on the cliff by the sea is a wonderfully fun and imaginative look at childhood 1 
give this one a look 1 
this place receives stars for their appetizers 1 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
this is a very average phone with bad battery life that operates on a weak network 0 
the story unfolds in 18th century jutland and the use of period music played on period instruments is just one more fine touch 1 
the fries were not hot and neither was my burger 0 
it presents a idyllic yet serious portrayal of the ups and downs of the characters lives 1 
the steaks are all well trimmed and also perfectly cooked 1 
the menu is always changing food quality is going down service is extremely slow 0 
though the wind and the lion is told largely through the eyes of the son every member of the family can identify with one of the characters whether it be sean connerys noble brigand candace bergens feisty heroine john hustons wily john hay or steve kanalys spiffy radiant ruthless cando lieutenant roosevelts big stick 1 
an italian reviewer called this a small great film and thats right 1 
def coming back to bowl next time 1 
it just blew 0 
could not get strong enough signal 0 
often the dialogue doesnt really follow from one line to another or fit the surroundings 0 
the keyboard is a nice compromise between a full qwerty and the basic cell phone number keypad 1 
the nano stated itmy son was dissapointed 0 
i keep watching it over and over 1 
also the fries are without a doubt the worst fries ive ever had 0 
great phone 1 
the first thing that happened was that the tracking was off 0 
rating 010 grade z note the show is so bad that even mother of the cast pull her daughter out of the show 0 
service was very prompt 1 
sprint charges for this service 0 
one of my favorite purchases ever 1 
i think it was robert ryans best film because he portrayed someone like my father and he was a schizophrenic in real lifemy father although he never murdered anyone but was affected more so during the second world war which made him worse 1 
all in all ha long bay was a bit of a flop 0 
is it possible for a movie to get any worse than this 0 
service sucks 0 
you share general loewenhielms exquisite joy in his partaking of the cailles en sarcophage even though you are just watching a movie but you do wish for just a small sample to savor 1 
generous portions and great taste 1 
the phone gets extremely hot 0 
its so stupid to have to keep buying new chargers car chargers cradles headphones and car kits every time a new phone comes out 0 
now the pizza itself was good the peanut sauce was very tasty 1 
anne heche was utterly convincing 1 
we watched our waiter pay a lot more attention to other tables and ignore us 0 
great phone 1 
the scripting of the subtle comedy is unmatched by any movie in recent years 1 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
for service i give them no stars 0 
but in any case the best part is you can download these pictures to your laptop using ir or even send pictures from your laptop to the phone 1 
i am a fan of his this movie sucked really bad 0 
those phones are working just fine now 1 
seller shipped quickly and much cheaper than the competitors 1 
o my gosh the best phone i have ever had 1 
nicest chinese restaurant ive been in a while 1 
this early film from future goremeister lucio fulci is a very good addition to the giallo subgenre 1 
im glad the film didnt go for the most obvious choice as a lesser film certainly would have 1 
ive dropped my phone more times than i can say even on concrete and my phone is still great knock on wood 1 
waiter was a jerk 0 
tried to go here for lunch and it was a madhouse 0 
in other words the content level of this film is enough to easily fill a dozen other films 1 
its a campy sort of film thats a joy to watch 1 
the headset fulfills my requirements so i am happy with my purchase 1 
of all the dishes the salmon was the best but all were great 1 
the atmosphere was great with a lovely duo of violinists playing songs we requested 1 
it is a joy to use 1 
i dont like this nokia either 0 
my rating just 3 out of 10 0 
i was particularly pleased with the acting ability of dwight schultz 1 
the plug did not work very well 0 
it never condescends all the characters have good genuine hearts and believable problems 1 
it ranks highly as a great noircrimedrama incredible performances by belmondo and lino ventura 1 
otherwise easy to install and use clear sound 1 
110 and only because there is no setting for 010 0 
a drive thru means you do not want to wait around for half an hour for your food but somehow when we end up going here they make us wait and wait 0 
how can that bethe audio quality is poor 0 
theres really nothing bad i can say about this headset 0 
does everything it should and more 1 
we loved the place 1 
waiter was a jerk 0 
headset works great was packaged nicely to avoid any damage 1 
leopard print is wonderfully wild 1 
predictable but not a bad watch 1 
the service was extremely slow 0 
it is not good 0 
if you want a sandwich just go to any firehouse 1 
this place is pretty good nice little vibe in the restaurant 1 
we got sitting fairly fast but ended up waiting 40 minutes just to place our order another 30 minutes before the food arrived 0 
i wont say any more i dont like spoilers so i dont want to be one but i believe this film is worth your time 1 
the bus boy on the other hand was so rude 0 
it has northern humour and positive about the community it represents 1 
im very disappointed with my decision 0 
comfortable nice range good battery life 1 
the only very disappointing thing was there was no speakerphone 0 
go to place for gyros 1 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
well just if you keep thinking how bad it is 0 
this is a bad film with bad writing and good actorsan ugly cartoon crafted by paul haggis for people who cant handle anything but the bold strokes in storytellinga picture painted with crayons 0 
also the fries are without a doubt the worst fries ive ever had 0 
it clicks into place in a way that makes you wonder how long that mechanism would last 0 
i have never had such bland food which surprised me considering the article we read focused so much on their spices and flavor 0 
dessert panna cotta was amazing 1 
my mother and brother had to do thiswhen i saw robert ryan portraying this type of man it was a very good imitation of this type of individual and i was impressed 1 
the voice recognition thru the handset is excellent 1 
works great 1 
i will come back here every time im in vegas 1 
utterly without merit on any level this is akin to torture 0 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
last night was my second time dining here and i was so happy i decided to go back 1 
so i am here to warn youdo not rent this movie it is the dumbest thing you have never seen 0 
the salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop which was perfectly cooked 1 
i also didnt like the on button it felt like it would crack with use 0 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
nice design and quality 1 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
a must study for anyone interested in the worst sins of industrial design 0 
but in any case the best part is you can download these pictures to your laptop using ir or even send pictures from your laptop to the phone 1 
sprint charges for this service 0 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
i love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it 1 
the sound is clear and the people i talk to on it are amazed at the quality too 1 
really pleased with this product so far 1 
great for the jawbone 1 
it really created a unique feeling though 1 
i work in the hospitality industry in paradise valley and have refrained from recommending cibo any longer 0 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
its reception is very very poor 0 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
absolutel junk 0 
a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it 1 
it was awesome 1 
excellent performance 1 
not as good as i had hoped 0 
warning stay away 0 
worthless product 0 
there are many continuity errors one other user commented on different cars in the garage joes glassesthe one that got to me the most was the fact joes facial hair configuration seemed to change from scene to scene 0 
the scenery that the two daughters paint and photograph are beautiful 1 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
i find this inexcusable and so will probably be returning this phone and perhaps changing carriers 0 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
rude inconsiderate management 0 
this place was such a nice surprise 1 
the pancake was also really good and pretty large at that 1 
beautiful styling though 1 
battery chargelife is quite long 1 
no plot whatsoever 0 
useless phone simply deaf 0 
there were several moments in the movie that just didnt need to be there and were excruciatingly slow moving 0 
just as good as when i had it more than a year ago 1 
the inside is really quite nice and very clean 1 
i cant wait to go back 1 
the only possible way this movie could be redeemed would be as mst3k fodder 0 
that being said for a phone the camera is very nice many cool effects to play with and video is decent as well 1 
the food was delicious our bartender was attentive and personable and we got a great deal 1 
im not impressed with the concept or the food 0 
the charger arrived within the promised timeframe but it did not work 0 
great audio 1 
very disappointing 0 
i love this device 1 
now we were chosen to be tortured with this disgusting piece of blatant american propaganda 0 
first time there and might just be the last 0 
it really is impressive that the place hasnt closed down 0 
one of the worst shows of all time 0 
so bad 0 
but the convoluted plot just didnt convince me and much of the film was watched with a weird questioning glance 0 
the owners really really need to quit being soooooo cheap let them wrap my freaking sandwich in two papers not one 0 
useless phone simply deaf 0 
voice recognition is tremendous 1 
its very attractive and appears to be of good quality 1 
any grandmother can make a roasted chicken better than this one 0 
it works fine on my motorola 325 cellphone and a lot better than the wornout battery did 1 
the things that the four kids get themselves into is absolutely hilarious to watch 1 
his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic 1 
gave up trying to eat any of the crust teeth still sore 0 
this is a great deal 1 
not good by any stretch of the imagination 0 
the file browser offers all the options that one needshandsfree is great 1 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
cooked to perfection and the service was impeccable 1 
not good by any stretch of the imagination 0 
this totally unfunny movie is so over the top and pathetic and unrealistic that throughout the whole 90 minutes of utter torture i probably looked at my watch about 70000 times 0 
one of the best mexican movies ever and one of the less understood even by mexican themselves no matter how identified the should have felt with it 1 
the food is good 1 
an hour and a half i wish i could bring back 0 
this movie is a good and humorous comment on life in 2006 1 
and generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode 0 
great time family dinner on a sunday night 1 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
because both ears are occupied background is not distracting at all 1 
this battery is an excellent bargain 1 
the awful dialogue and hopeless overacting by everyone who gets shot top off a real waste of space and time 0 
i give it 2 thumbs down 0 
the food came out at a good pace 1 
i especially love the long battery life 1 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
disappointed 0 
awesome service and food 1 
with the originality and freshness of the first movie now spent this remake had little else to offer 0 
nice docking station for home or work 1 
this is infuriating 0 
penne vodka excellent 1 
duris has a wholesome appearance and gives a fine performance 1 
now this is a movie i really dislike 0 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
definitely worth checking out 1 
the real killer is the volume and of course it breaking 0 
small sleek impressive looking practical setup with ample storage in place 1 
im trying to return it for a refund 0 
also its slim enough to fit into my alarm clock docking station without removing the case 1 
after the disappointing dinner we went elsewhere for dessert 0 
ive never been treated so bad 0 
so i am here to warn youdo not rent this movie it is the dumbest thing you have never seen 0 
the fish is badly made and some of its underwater shots are repeated a thousand times in the film 0 
you learn a lot about the real inside emotions of people in this movie and a lot about the movie business itself 1 
the budget was evidently very limited 0 
a great way to finish a great 1 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
i great reception all the time 1 
the plot has more holes than a pair of fishnet stockings and the direction and editing is astonishingly ham fisted 0 
very pleased with this headset 1 
the explosion of the gas tanks at the end was just as awful 0 
the range is very decent ive been able to roam around my house with the phone in the living room with no receptionsound quality issues 1 
this greedy corporation will never see another dime from me 0 
i am a fan of his this movie sucked really bad 0 
with the originality and freshness of the first movie now spent this remake had little else to offer 0 
so i basically threw my money out the window for nothing 0 
you cant go wrong with any of the food here 1 
battery has no life 0 
it looses connection to the phone even when it is within a couple feet between the two 0 
definitely worth checking out 1 
i had a salad with the wings and some ice cream for dessert and left feeling quite satisfied 1 
overall the film is interesting and thoughtprovoking 1 
i have recommended it to friends 1 
my brother in law who works at the mall ate here same day and guess what he was sick all night too 0 
its practically perfect in all of them  a true masterpiece in a sea of faux masterpieces 1 
the worst one of the series 0 
i wish i could return the unit and get back my money 0 
it looked like a wonderful story 1 
cooked to perfection and the service was impeccable 1 
the point is the journey a journey that touches every member of the family 1 
the folks at otto always make us feel so welcome and special 1 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
the incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film 1 
good servicecheck 1 
and those baby owls were adorable 1 
now imagine that every single one of those decisions was made wrong 0 
the keyboard is a nice compromise between a full qwerty and the basic cell phone number keypad 1 
but despite these few flaws this case is of exceptional quality and well worth the additional costs of owning an official oem product 1 
plantronics bluetooth excelent buy 1 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
leopard print is wonderfully wild 1 
the building itself seems pretty neat the bathroom is pretty trippy but i wouldnt eat here again 0 
due to this happening on every call i was forced to stop using this headset 0 
its this pandering to the audience that sabotages most of his films 0 
even the squibs look awful 0 
frozen pucks of disgust with some of the worst people behind the register 0 
talk about useless customer service 0 
useless phone simply deaf 0 
very disappointed in accessoryone 0 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
their daily specials are always a hit with my group 1 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
an extensive menu provides lots of options for breakfast 1 
if i take a picture the battery drops a bar and starts beeping letting me know its dieing 0 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
what this film lacks is a convincing script 0 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
a week later after i activated it it suddenly died 0 
the screen does get smudged easily because it touches your ear and face 0 
im super pissd 0 
the battery life is highly unacceptable 0 
the bus boy on the other hand was so rude 0 
the ending is so so perfect youll shed a tear 1 
lastly the mozzarella sticks they were the best thing we ordered 1 
i love this bluetooth 1 
here in the wind and the lion we see a wonderful rendering of americas own imperial age 1 
a very very very slowmoving aimless movie about a distressed drifting young man 0 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
never going back 0 
very well made and fits my surefire gx2 perfectly 1 
pricing is a bit of a concern at mellow mushroom 0 
10 out of 10 stars 1 
1 long lasting battery you dont have to recharge it as frequentyly as some of the flip phones2 0 
the story is beyond stupid 0 
setup couldnt have been simpler 1 
verizon tech support walked my through a few procedures none of which worked and i ended up having to do a hard reset wiping out all my data 0 
the movie seemed a little slow at first 0 
this is a great restaurant at the mandalay bay 1 
there is really nothing for me at postinos hope your experience is better 0 
i advise everyone do not be fooled 0 
an interesting premise and billy drago is always good as a dangerous nutbag side note id love to see drago stephen mchattie and lance hendrikson in a flick together talk about raging cheekbones 1 
i was not happy with this item 0 
if that bug never showed up i would have given a 4 for sure but on the other side of the wall where this bug was climbing was the kitchen 0 
ill put this gem up against any movie in terms of screenplay cinematography acting postproduction editing directing or any other aspect of filmmaking 1 
so i basically threw my money out the window for nothing 0 
it has northern humour and positive about the community it represents 1 
phone is sturdy as all nokia bar phones are 1 
then our food came out disappointment ensued 0 
a drive thru means you do not want to wait around for half an hour for your food but somehow when we end up going here they make us wait and wait 0 
it was forced like everything in this movie 0 
dont waste your on this one 0 
a world better than 95 of the garbage in the theatres today 1 
first of all it doesnt wear well 0 
my drink was never empty and he made some really great menu suggestions 1 
the roast beef sandwich tasted really good 1 
over rated 0 
i have 23 bars on my cell phone when i am home but you cant not hear anything 0 
too bad you have to pay up to a month for the service 0 
some may say this buffet is pricey but i think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot 1 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
i give it 2 thumbs down 0 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
first of all it doesnt wear well 0 
after 3 months screen just went black all of a sudden 0 
battery chargelife is quite long 1 
this place is good 1 
their menu is diverse and reasonably priced 1 
but the service was beyond bad 0 
i really like this product over the motorola because it is allot clearer on the ear piece and the mic 1 
disappointed with battery 0 
the script is bad very bad  it contains both cheesiness and unethical joke that you normally see in rated r or nc17 movie 0 
some great music and terrific scenery 1 
this is a great little item 1 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
they have a really nice atmosphere 1 
not a good item it worked for a while then started having problems in my auto reverse tape player 0 
the structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema 1 
it does everything the description said it would 1 
best ive found so far ive tried 2 other bluetooths and this one has the best quality for both me and the listener as well as ease of using 1 
just as good as when i had it more than a year ago 1 
i would have casted her in that role after ready the script 1 
host staff were for lack of a better word bitches 0 
mobile phone tools are a must have 1 
i hope this place sticks around 1 
better than expected 1 
very disappointed and wondered how it could be in the oscar shortlist 0 
very very disappointed ordered the 35 big bay plater 0 
great food 1 
worth every penny 1 
i found this place by accident and i could not be happier 1 
that just screams legit in my booksomethats also pretty rare here in vegas 1 
my breakfast was perpared great with a beautiful presentation of 3 giant slices of toast lightly dusted with powdered sugar 1 
however the ear pads come off easily and after only one week i lost one 0 
funny clever hip just like prays previous film hype 1 
i went to bachi burger on a friends recommendation and was not disappointed 1 
it didnt work people can not hear me when i talk 0 
w810i is just superb 1 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
is it possible for a movie to get any worse than this 0 
this is a good joint 1 
this place has it 1 
i work in the hospitality industry in paradise valley and have refrained from recommending cibo any longer 0 
director paul matthews who also wrotedirected the weak 1995 monster movie grim clearly doesnt know how to pace his films 0 
the volume for the ringer is real good you have choices how loud 1 
this is high adventure at its best 1 
motorola finally got the voice quality of a bluetooth headset right 1 
the cast of veteran actors are more than just a nostalgia trip 1 
but when i check voice mail at night the keypad backlight turns off a few seconds into the first message and then im lost 0 
painful on the ear 0 
my friend loved the salmon tartar 1 
we received a white colored battery that goes dead after a couple hoursthe original used to last a week but still lasts longer than thereplacement 0 
battery is holding up well 1 
it is a joy to use 1 
a great way to finish a great 1 
the majority of the logitech earbud headsets failed 0 
very good lunch spot 1 
the ripped banana was not only ripped but petrified and tasteless 0 
we literally sat there for 20 minutes with no one asking to take our order 0 
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
this is a great deal 1 
your servers suck wait correction our server heimer sucked 0 
as always the evening was wonderful and the food delicious 1 
i have yet to run this new battery below two bars and thats three days without charging 1 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
almost everyone involved must be return to school acting is utterly predictable and bad script is pile of garbage all round 0 
dont buy this product 0 
piece of junk 0 
i left with a stomach ache and felt sick the rest of the day 0 
rating 010 grade z note the show is so bad that even mother of the cast pull her daughter out of the show 0 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
this place is amazing 1 
that company is a joke 0 
it is very comfortable to wear as well which is probably the most important aspect about using a case 1 
i really loved the story line and the poler bear was kinda cutebut if anyone has a question about fort steele just ask away 1 
i had a salad with the wings and some ice cream for dessert and left feeling quite satisfied 1 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
i got home to see the driest damn wings ever 0 
nothing new there 0 
being a 90s child i truly enjoyed this show and i can proudly say that i enjoyed it big time and even more than the classical wb cartoons 1 
your servers suck wait correction our server heimer sucked 0 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
will never ever go back and have told many people what had happened 0 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
if you plan to use this in a car forget about it 0 
i have always used corded headsets and the freedom from the wireless is very helpful 1 
how can you call yourself a steakhouse if you cant properly cook a steak i dont understand 0 
great place to eat reminds me of the little mom and pop shops in the san francisco bay area 1 
the owner used to work at nobu so this place is really similar for half the price 1 
but storm trooper is not even bad enough to make it to the list of wonderfully terrible movies 0 
well im satisfied 1 
their chow mein is so good 1 
bluetooth range is good a few days ago i left my phone in the trunk got a call and carried the conversation without a hitch 1 
i am also very happy with the price 1 
total brunch fail 0 
works for me 1 
you share general loewenhielms exquisite joy in his partaking of the cailles en sarcophage even though you are just watching a movie but you do wish for just a small sample to savor 1 
the phone gets extremely hot 0 
they made this case too small and is very difficult to install 0 
youll love it 1 
main thing i didnt enjoy is that the crowd is of older crowd around mid 30s and up 0 
the flat reenactments dont hold your attention because they are emotionally adrift and stagy 0 
we recently witnessed her poor quality of management towards other guests as well 0 
you wont regret it 1 
the food is rich so order accordingly 1 
i will continue to come here on ladies night andddd date night highly recommend this place to anyone who is in the area 1 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
works like a charm it work the same as the one i got with the phone 1 
battery is holding up well 1 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
left very frustrated 0 
the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach 0
