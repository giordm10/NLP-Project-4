the chicken i got was definitely reheated and was only ok the wedges were cold and soggy 0 
i love the camera its really pretty good quality 1 
omg the food was delicioso 1 
but storm trooper is not even bad enough to make it to the list of wonderfully terrible movies 0 
they are so cool 1 
the kids are annoying 0 
regardless the film fails on most levels 0 
we literally sat there for 20 minutes with no one asking to take our order 0 
very good though 1 
i love the scream movies and all horror movies and this one ranks way up there 1 
very disappointing 0 
im big fan of rpg games too but this movie its a disgrace to any selfrespecting rpger there is 0 
maybe its just their vegetarian fare but ive been twice and i thought it was average at best 0 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
i guess it was supposed to be clever twist then shed some light on the situation but it was just stupid 0 
i know that sounds funny but to me it seemed like sketchy technology that wouldnt work wellwell this one works great 1 
very disappointed 0 
ill put this gem up against any movie in terms of screenplay cinematography acting postproduction editing directing or any other aspect of filmmaking 1 
gave up trying to eat any of the crust teeth still sore 0 
but it is great i would really recommend it 1 
their menu is diverse and reasonably priced 1 
i really dont see how anyone could enjoy this movie 0 
product is exactly as described 1 
if you want healthy authentic or ethic food try this place 1 
best tacos in town by far 1 
comfortable nice range good battery life 1 
everything about this movie is stupid 0 
so i am here to warn youdo not rent this movie it is the dumbest thing you have never seen 0 
the bathrooms are clean and the place itself is well decorated 1 
so good i am going to have to review this place twice once hereas a tribute to the place and once as a tribute to an event held here last night 1 
the headsets are easy to use and everyone loves them 1 
they are so cool 1 
however the keypads are so tinny that i sometimes reach the wrong buttons 0 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
but when i check voice mail at night the keypad backlight turns off a few seconds into the first message and then im lost 0 
the casting is also horrible cause all you see is a really really bad actors period 0 
there is no plot or storyline 0 
we started with the tuna sashimi which was brownish in color and obviously wasnt fresh 0 
good servicecheck 1 
i have never had such bland food which surprised me considering the article we read focused so much on their spices and flavor 0 
if you love death and decay and shakespears lyrics this is the one 1 
as for the mains also uninspired 0 
garbo who showed right off the bat that her talents could carry over from the silent era i wanted to see some of her silent work but netflix doesnt seem to be stocking them 1 
do not buy for d807wrongly advertised for d807 0 
this place is good 1 
they have horrible attitudes towards customers and talk down to each one when customers dont enjoy their food 0 
great price too 1 
the plot is nonsense that doesnt interest in the slightest way or have any uniqueness to it 0 
drinks took close to 30 minutes to come out at one point 0 
the script is a big flawed mess 0 
lange had become a great actress 1 
yeah the movie pretty much sucked 0 
o my gosh the best phone i have ever had 1 
it plays louder than any other speaker of this size the price is so low that most would think the quality is lacking however its not 1 
an hour and a half i wish i could bring back 0 
lastly the mozzarella sticks they were the best thing we ordered 1 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
also if your phone is dropped this case is not going to save it specially when dropped face down 0 
i really like this product over the motorola because it is allot clearer on the ear piece and the mic 1 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
returned 8 hours later 0 
adapter does not provide enough charging current 0 
the service was a little slow considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace 0 
def coming back to bowl next time 1 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
see it with your kids if you have a chanceit will open up some amazing dialog about how far race relations have come in the last 50 years 1 
the ambiance was incredible 1 
the plot simply rumbles on like a machine desperately depending on the addition of new scenes 0 
another thing i didnt really like is when a character got punched in the face a gallon of blood would spew forth soon after 0 
a standout scene 1 
crust is not good 0 
you wont regret it 1 
good servicecheck 1 
if you look for authentic thai food go else where 0 
as i said abovepretty useless 0 
both films are terrible but to the credit of the 1986 version it was watchable 0 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
im so sorry but i really cant recommend it to anyone 0 
i dont think ill be running back to carlys anytime soon for food 0 
worthless product 0 
service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is vegas and located inside the crystals shopping mall by aria 1 
kind of flops around 0 
bt50 battery junk 0 
the acting is fantastic the stories are seamlessly woven together and the dogs are splendid a must rent view or see 1 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
it was so boring 0 
at least think to refill my water before i struggle to wave you over for 10 minutes 0 
trumbull on i love lucy 1 
so flavorful and has just the perfect amount of heat 1 
all the characters in this film are tremendously well played 1 
just reading on the specs alone makes you say wow 1 
love this headset 1 
they could be used as exemplars for any set designer 1 
the ambiance isnt much better 0 
i would not recommend this place 0 
but other than that the movie seemed to drag and the heroes didnt really work for their freedom 0 
i would highly recommend this 1 
dont waste your time 0 
the voice recognition thru the handset is excellent 1 
for those that havent seen it dont waste your time 0 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
it features an outlandish array of memorable psychotic but lovable nuts 1 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
if you want a real scare rent this one 1 
you also cannot take pictures with it in the case because the lense is covered 0 
only like 3 or 4 buildings used a couple of locations maybe poor hummh 0 
this place is disgusting 0 
a drive thru means you do not want to wait around for half an hour for your food but somehow when we end up going here they make us wait and wait 0 
new battery works great in phone 1 
not tasty and the texture was just nasty 0 
you also cannot take pictures with it in the case because the lense is covered 0 
i have read others reviews here but i havent had any problem with it 1 
good show samsung 1 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
i bought this battery with a coupon from amazon and im very happy with my purchase 1 
if you see it you should probably just leave it on the shelf 0 
i really enjoyed eating here 1 
excellent short film 1 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
the roast beef sandwich tasted really good 1 
i knew when i saw the film that more great things were to come from this gifted actor 1 
one of the worst shows of all time 0 
doesnt do the job 0 
the film deserves strong kudos for taking this stand for having exceptional acting from its mostly lesserknown cast and for the superintelligent script that doesnt insult the audience or take the easy way out when it comes to white racism 1 
worst ever 0 
this is one of the worst sandra bullock movie since speed 2 but not quite that bad 0 
their research and development division obviously knows what theyre doing 1 
beware this is not a trashy cult movie this is trash period 0 
dee snider just plain sucks 0 
what a disappointment 0 
lastly the mozzarella sticks they were the best thing we ordered 1 
avoid this one if you can 0 
this movie creates its own universe and is fascinating in every way 1 
it deserves strong love 1 
im still trying to get over how bad it was 0 
the service was terrible food was mediocre 0 
but its just not funny 0 
this is one of the best italian thrillers of the early 70s 1 
awsome device works great 1 
the burger had absolutely no flavor the meat itself was totally bland the burger was overcooked and there was no charcoal flavor 0 
this scene is very strong and unpleasant 0 
does not fit 0 
it is shameful 0 
lot of holes in the plot theres nothing about how he became the emperor nothing about where he spend 20 years between his childhood and mature age 0 
i wasted my little money with this earpiece 0 
phone is sturdy as all nokia bar phones are 1 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
an absolute must visit 1 
comfortable nice range good battery life 1 
the characters are fleshed out surprisingly well particularly grimes and blake and all the actors deliver their sharply scripted lines with just the right amount of deadpan tongue in cheek to make the dialogue both hilarious and realistic 1 
this was utterly confusing at first which caused me to lose a couple of very very important contacts 0 
with the originality and freshness of the first movie now spent this remake had little else to offer 0 
all in all its an insult to ones intelligence and a huge waste of money 0 
also difficult to put onid recommend avoiding this product 0 
worst customer service 0 
after 20 minutes wait i got a table 0 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
improper description i had to return it 0 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
very pleased with this headset 1 
it wasnt busy either also the building was freezing cold 0 
disappointment i hate anything that goes in my ear 0 
the movie in movie situations in the beginning and through the game that is played with her by the acting coach are fascinating 1 
almost all of the songs in cover girl are oldfashioned and not very tuneful 0 
trying to make a call on these is an exercise in frustration 0 
when it opens the battery connection is broken and the device is turned off 0 
whatever prompted such a documentary is beyond me 0 
plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job 1 
unfortunately the ability to actually know you are receiving a call is a rather important feature and this phone is pitiful in that respect 0 
cant store anything but phone numbers to sim 0 
it quit working after id used it for about 18 months so i just purchased another one because this is the best headset ive ever owned 1 
it was either too cold not enough flavor or just bad 0 
it probably would have been better if the director hadnt spent most of the movie showcasing his own art work which really isnt that noteworthy 0 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
at first glance it is a lovely bakery cafe nice ambiance clean friendly staff 1 
this is such a fun and funny movie 1 
i highly recommend these and encourage people to give them a try 1 
his losing his marbles so early in the proceedings is totally implausible and unconvincing 0 
its too bad the food is so damn generic 0 
i would avoid this place if you are staying in the mirage 0 
the charger arrived within the promised timeframe but it did not work 0 
worse theres an incredibly weak subplot thrown in that follows a little band of latterday mansonites as they go after a reporter whos working on a story on the anniversary of the killings 0 
the ngage is still lacking in earbuds 0 
but the actingeven that of such professionals as drago and debbie rochonwas terrible the directing worse perhaps contributory to the former the dialog chimplike and the camera work barely tolerable 0 
very funny 1 
but the service was beyond bad 0 
it will drive you barking mad 0 
not nearly as good looking as the amazon picture makes it look 0 
their steaks are 100 recommended 1 
if there is a wind it is completely useless 0 
probably not in a hurry to go back 0 
i ate there twice on my last visit and especially enjoyed the salmon salad 1 
the service was a bit lacking 0 
what did bother me was the slow service 0 
crisp and clear 1 
she carries the movie well 1 
this hole in the wall has great mexican street tacos and friendly staff 1 
i was particularly pleased with the acting ability of dwight schultz 1 
much more interesting more action more suspense and less of the unneeded controversy 1 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
omit watching this 0 
very very fun chef 1 
awesome selection of beer 1 
the handsfree part works fine but then the car tries to download the address book and the treo rebootsoverall i still rate this device high 1 
perhaps i caught them on an off night judging by the other reviews but im not inspired to go back 0 
it looked like a wonderful story 1 
its hard not to fall headoverheels in love with that girl 1 
bad choice 0 
cute quaint simple honest 1 
not worth it 0 
filmiing was less expansive 0 
first time there and might just be the last 0 
i saw mirrormask last night and it was an unsatisfactory experience 0 
that said our mouths and bellies were still quite pleased 1 
only pros large seating area nice bar area great simple drink menu the best brick oven pizza with homemade dough 1 
as for the killer dont expect anything original or even remotely frightening 0 
highly unrecommended 0 
that one didnt work either 0 
this product is clearly not ready for prime time i dont care how cool it looks if you cant tell a call is coming in its worthless 0 
furthermore you cant even find hours of operation on the website 0 
the nokia ca42 usb cable did not work with my phone 0 
it has a very good plot it holds your complete attention the acting is superb tom wilkinson was fantastic and emily watson was also very good 1 
lucy bell is so much higher than this crap and for her to sink this low is quite depressing 0 
a good commentary of todays love and undoubtedly a film worth seeing 1 
gotta love those closeups of slimy drooling teeth 1 
then the film just dropped the ball 0 
it really is impressive that the place hasnt closed down 0 
jamie foxx absolutely is ray charles 1 
not much seafood and like 5 strings of pasta at the bottom 0 
crisp and clear 1 
now this dish was quite flavourful 1 
very good quality though 1 
it was forced like everything in this movie 0 
i had heard good things about this place but it exceeding every hope i could have dreamed of 1 
great brunch spot 1 
it is so small and you dont even realize that it is there after a while of getting used to it 1 
i really like this product over the motorola because it is allot clearer on the ear piece and the mic 1 
then a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use 0 
we had 7 at our table and the service was pretty fast 1 
what should have been a hilarious yummy christmas eve dinner to remember was the biggest fail of the entire trip for us 0 
if you plan to use this in a car forget about it 0 
speaking of the music it is unbearably predictably and kitchy 0 
bad purchase 0 
after trying many many handsfree gadgets this is the one that finally works well 1 
very friendly staff 1 
a bit predictable 0 
nice docking station for home or work 1 
by the time the film ended i not only disliked it i despised it 0 
loved the casting of jimmy buffet as the science teacher 1 
speaking of the music it is unbearably predictably and kitchy 0 
there was no chemistry between ben affleck and sandra bullock in this film and i couldnt understand why he would consider even leaving his wifetobe for this chick that he supposedly was knocked out by 0 
everything stinks 0 
poor quality 0 
garbo who showed right off the bat that her talents could carry over from the silent era i wanted to see some of her silent work but netflix doesnt seem to be stocking them 1 
not enough volume 0 
my 810 score is mostly for the plot 1 
you get extra minutes so that you can carry out the call and not get cut off 1 
i wont spoil it but the ending in pretty amazing 1 
the chefs were friendly and did a good job 1 
sweetest phone 1 
i consider this theft 0 
the handsfree part works fine but then the car tries to download the address book and the treo rebootsoverall i still rate this device high 1 
dessert panna cotta was amazing 1 
i was hoping for more 0 
but whatever it was that cost them so much it didnt translate to quality thats for sure 0 
im not eating here 0 
logitech bluetooth headset is a 10 1 
i dont think there are any redeeming qualities in this remake 0 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
the death row scenes were entirely unmoving 0 
the refried beans that came with my meal were dried out and crusty and the food was bland 0 
this place is amazing 1 
good quality 1 
greatno problems at all 1 
well packaged arrived on time and works as intended 1 
if this premise sound stupid thats because it is 0 
we waited for thirty minutes to be seated although there were 8 vacant tables and we were the only folks waiting 0 
i would definitely recommend the jabra bt250v for those who are looking for comfort clarity and a great price 1 
they do not care about the consumer one bit 0 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
the acting sucks the music sucks the script sucks the pacing sucks the special fx suck the directing sucks basically this movie sucks 0 
great atmosphere friendly and fast service 1 
all i can do is whine on the internet so here it goesthe more i use the thing the less i like it 0 
we had 7 at our table and the service was pretty fast 1 
the food amazing 1 
one nice thing was that they added gratuity on the bill since our party was larger than 6 or 8 and they didnt expect more tip than that 1 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
as an earlier review noted plug in this charger and nothing happens 0 
i was sitting in my vehicle with the cradle on my belt and the headset lost signal 0 
we ordered some old classics and some new dishes after going there a few times and were sorely disappointed with everything 0 
if you plan to use this in a car forget about it 0 
this movie was kind of long in length but i enjoyed every minute of it 1 
not a pleasant voyage of selfdiscovery 0 
voice quality signal strength dropped calls 0 
was not happy 0 
we wont be returning 0 
i wouldnt see this movie again for free 0 
i felt asleep the first time i watched it so i can recommend it for insomniacs 0 
customer service was terrible 0 
it probably would have been better if the director hadnt spent most of the movie showcasing his own art work which really isnt that noteworthy 0 
i own a jabra earset and was very happy with it but the sound quality especially outgoing on this is better 1 
incredible 1 
i probably wont be coming back here 0 
improper description i had to return it 0 
one of the best mexican movies ever and one of the less understood even by mexican themselves no matter how identified the should have felt with it 1 
not much dialogue not much music the whole film was shot as elaborately and aesthetically like a sculpture 1 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
the chicken wings contained the driest chicken meat i have ever eaten 0 
it is a true classic 1 
and then tragedy struck 0 
both great 1 
works great 1 
i would recommend saving room for this 1 
i really hope the team behind this movie makes more movies and that they will continue to do so in their own some kinda weird style 1 
they keep getting better and better this is my third one and ive had numerous palms too 1 
there is so much good food in vegas that i feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to rice and company 0 
we got sitting fairly fast but ended up waiting 40 minutes just to place our order another 30 minutes before the food arrived 0 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
there still are good actors around 1 
level 5 spicy was perfect where spice didnt overwhelm the soup 1 
the seasonal fruit was fresh white peach puree 1 
the camera really likes her in this movie 1 
this place is good 1 
now we were chosen to be tortured with this disgusting piece of blatant american propaganda 0 
just does not work 0 
i am far from a sushi connoisseur but i can definitely tell the difference between good food and bad food and this was certainly bad food 0 
i went to bachi burger on a friends recommendation and was not disappointed 1 
the problem i have is that they charge 1199 for a sandwich that is no bigger than a subway sub which offers better and more amount of vegetables 0 
service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is vegas and located inside the crystals shopping mall by aria 1 
the block was amazing 1 
overall i am psyched to have a phone which has all my appointments and contacts in and gets great reception 1 
i have two more years left in this contract and i hate this phone 0 
im very disappointed with my decision 0 
pretty awesome place 1 
a great film by a great director 1 
its pretty surprising that this wonderful film was made in 1949 as hollywood generally had its collective heads in the sand concerning black and white issues at that time 1 
great food and great service in a clean and friendly setting 1 
putting the race card aside lets look at the major flaw in the film they destroy latifas character 0 
avoid avoid avoid 0 
cant store anything but phone numbers to sim 0 
nice headset priced right 1 
the food is good 1 
the servers are not pleasant to deal with and they dont always honor pizza hut coupons 0 
rip off over charge shipping 0 
lewis blacks considerable talent is wasted here too as he is at his most incendiary when he is unrestrained which the pg13 rating certainly wont allow 0 
you will leave the theater wanting to go out and dance under the stars 1 
everything was good and tasty 1 
it just blew 0 
funny clever hip just like prays previous film hype 1 
the seasonal fruit was fresh white peach puree 1 
the songs were the best and the muppets were so hilarious 1 
this is infuriating 0 
this is just a great movie 1 
the selection of food was not the best 0 
it is a joy to use 1 
its a great item 1 
the jamaican mojitos are delicious 1 
if there was ever an indication of a writer and a directors ability to meld two highly volatile temperaments into a seamless union of creativity then this is it 1 
what is even more stupid is that who had thought an idea that there should be a volcano in los angeles 0 
though the wind and the lion is told largely through the eyes of the son every member of the family can identify with one of the characters whether it be sean connerys noble brigand candace bergens feisty heroine john hustons wily john hay or steve kanalys spiffy radiant ruthless cando lieutenant roosevelts big stick 1 
all in all im quite satisfied with this purchase 1 
be sure to order dessert even if you need to pack it togo the tiramisu and cannoli are both to die for 1 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
i recently tried caballeros and i have been back every week since 1 
overall i wasnt very impressed with noca 0 
i am far from a sushi connoisseur but i can definitely tell the difference between good food and bad food and this was certainly bad food 0 
unreliable im giving up 0 
the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach 0 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
this product had a strong rubberpetroleum smell that was unbearable after a while and caused me to return it 0 
again no plot at all 0 
it dit not work most of the time with my nokia 5320 0 
every time he opened his mouth you expect to hear you see kids pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show 0 
this is an excellent tool especially when paired with your phones autoanswer 1 
this film tries to be a serious and sophisticated thrillerhorror flick and it fails miserably 0 
so just beware 0 
w810i is just superb 1 
my order was not correct 0 
however the keypads are so tinny that i sometimes reach the wrong buttons 0 
im still trying to get over how bad it was 0 
their daily specials are always a hit with my group 1 
on the up side their cafe serves really good food 1 
great food and awesome service 1 
the warm beer didnt help 0 
initially the local sites in the film which was filmed here in buffalo intrigued me 1 
it is so small and you dont even realize that it is there after a while of getting used to it 1 
it was so funny 1 
this is a disgrace 0 
insults profound deuchebaggery and had to go outside for a smoke break while serving just to solidify it 0 
this is hands down the best phone ive ever had 1 
you need at least 3 mins to get to your phone book from the time you first turn on the phonebattery life is short 0 
the memories are murky but i can only say that i enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show 1 
kind of hard to mess up a steak but they did 0 
that company is a joke 0 
it was probably dirt 0 
the service here is fair at best 0 
i did not bother contacting the company for few dollar product but i learned the lesson that i should not have bought this form online anyway 0 
the mic there is a joke and the volume is quite low 0 
i was totally fascinated by the music the dancing everything 1 
the least said about the acting the better 0 
even if you love bad movies do not watch this movie 0 
the owners really really need to quit being soooooo cheap let them wrap my freaking sandwich in two papers not one 0 
plus it was wellpaced and suited its relatively short run time 1 
the shipping time was also very quick 1 
often the dialogue doesnt really follow from one line to another or fit the surroundings 0 
but its just not funny 0 
we enjoy their pizza and brunch 1 
i mean this in a terrible way 0 
what makes this story different are the terrific production values faultless photography composition and editing the terrific casting the underappreciated brian keith playing a bully teddy and vivid history 1 
10 out of 10 stars 1 
bad choice 0 
constantine gives everything the right intensity and seems to have a good understanding of the underlying psychological motivations 1 
and the beans and rice were mediocre at best 0 
frozen pucks of disgust with some of the worst people behind the register 0 
you cant beat the price on these 1 
oh and i forgot to also mention the weird color effect it has on your phone 0 
special mention should be made of the superb music score and sound effects which are an integral element in helping to make this such a memorable and enjoyable cartoon 1 
this place is good 1 
but the actingeven that of such professionals as drago and debbie rochonwas terrible the directing worse perhaps contributory to the former the dialog chimplike and the camera work barely tolerable 0 
i purcashed this for the car charger and it does not work 0 
it failed to convey the broad sweep of landscapes that were a great part of the original 0 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
this blueant supertooth handsfree phone speaker is awesome 1 
ps the only scene in the movie that was cool is when the central character finds her room blown up 1 
nice leather 1 
logitech bluetooth headset is a 10 1 
tonight i had the elk filet specialand it sucked 0 
exceptionally bad 0 
definitely worth checking out 1 
horrible had to switch 3 times 0 
they made this case too small and is very difficult to install 0 
but it is great i would really recommend it 1 
i did not bother contacting the company for few dollar product but i learned the lesson that i should not have bought this form online anyway 0 
the place was fairly clean but the food simply wasnt worth it 0 
in addition it feels amp looks as if the phone is all lightweight cheap plastic 0 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
the chicken i got was definitely reheated and was only ok the wedges were cold and soggy 0 
we have gotten a lot of compliments on it 1 
its reception is very very poor 0 
this is so embarassing and also my ears hurt if i try to push the ear plug into my ear 0 
i just wanted to leave 0 
the design is very odd as the ear clip is not very comfortable at all 0 
i gave it 5 stars because of the sound quality 1 
aailiyah was pretty good as akasha in places compelling her first entrance and mini dance scene 1 
food was really boring 0 
we had fantastic service and were pleased by the atmosphere 1 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
their menu is diverse and reasonably priced 1 
great character actors telly savalas and peter boyle 1 
the food is very good for your typical bar food 1 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
from here on the widmark character turns unintentionally comical 0 
the waitress was friendly and happy to accomodate for veganveggie options 1 
steer clear of this product and go with the genuine palm replacementr pens which come in a threepack 0 
no one at the table thought the food was above average or worth the wait that we had for it 0 
this totally unfunny movie is so over the top and pathetic and unrealistic that throughout the whole 90 minutes of utter torture i probably looked at my watch about 70000 times 0 
in a word it is embarrassing 0 
waited and waited and waited 0 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
used and dirty 0 
the ambiance isnt much better 0 
great price also 1 
the best phone in market 1 
in other words the content level of this film is enough to easily fill a dozen other films 1 
best tacos in town by far 1 
we will not be coming back 0 
tom wilkinson broke my heart at the end and everyone elses judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike 1 
ryans bar is definitely one edinburgh establishment i wont be revisiting 0 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
the servers went back and forth several times not even so much as an are you being helped 0 
the service here leaves a lot to be desired 0 
i dont know exactly what it is about this movie but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our familys memories 1 
they have great dinners 1 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0

this phone is slim and light and the display is beautiful 1 
poor sound quality 0 
i checked out this place a couple years ago and was not impressed 0 
the waiter wasnt helpful or friendly and rarely checked on us 0 
loved itfriendly servers great food wonderful and imaginative menu 1 
great it was new packaged nice works good no problems and it came in less time then i expected 1 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
of course the footage from the 70s was grainy but that only enhanced the film 1 
this film offers many delights and surprises 1 
from here on the widmark character turns unintentionally comical 0 
the cable looks so thin and flimsy it is scary 0 
lovely little thriller from hitchcock with lots of nice shenanigans surrounding a murdered spy a kidnapped child a nasty church a foreign plot and some random taxidermists 1 
avoid this film at all costs 0 
the best example of how dumb the writing is when its established that you can turn the zombiestudents back into humans by removing a necklace containing a piece of the meteorite 0 
the movie is full of wonderful dancing hence the title 1 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
the greek dressing was very creamy and flavorful 1 
all this movie does is make you sick watching all these slackers make excuses for their stupid actions for 90 minutes 0 
very displeased 0 
the cast is good 1 
now the pizza itself was good the peanut sauce was very tasty 1 
it was a drive to get there 0 
the instruction manual is lacking 0 
this film highlights the fundamental flaws of the legal process that its not about discovering guilt or innocence but rather is about who presents better in court 1 
this case has passed the one year mark and while it shows signs of wear it is 100 functional 1 
the place was fairly clean but the food simply wasnt worth it 0 
very happy with this product 1 
not my thing 0 
i will continue to come here on ladies night andddd date night highly recommend this place to anyone who is in the area 1 
the decor is nice and the piano music soundtrack is pleasant 1 
very disappointing 0 
go watch it 1 
this product is clearly not ready for prime time i dont care how cool it looks if you cant tell a call is coming in its worthless 0 
unreliable im giving up 0 
i love the ringtones because they are so upbeat 1 
this is the phone to get for 2005 i just bought my s710a and all i can say is wow 1 
im not impressed with the concept or the food 0 
blue ant is easy to use 1 
an absolute must visit 1 
on three different occasions i asked for well done or medium well and all three times i got the bloodiest piece of meat on my plate 0 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
wow loved this place 1 
the best place in vegas for breakfast just check out a sat or sun 1 
everything was fresh and delicious 1 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
i must say i have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again 1 
we have tried 2 units and they both failed within 2 months pros 0 
the concert sequences just sucked 0 
im probably one of the few people to ever go to ians and not like it 0 
im big fan of rpg games too but this movie its a disgrace to any selfrespecting rpger there is 0 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
now we were chosen to be tortured with this disgusting piece of blatant american propaganda 0 
steve martin delivers a really funny performance of a middleaged upper class uptight white guy 1 
however after finally watching this film i realized that not only had i had a closed mind to the brilliance it depicts i also found myself watching it over and over again 1 
best of all is the rotating feature very helpful 1 
as i said abovepretty useless 0 
if this premise sound stupid thats because it is 0 
i was sitting in my vehicle with the cradle on my belt and the headset lost signal 0 
if it were possible to give them zero stars theyd have it 0 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
also its slim enough to fit into my alarm clock docking station without removing the case 1 
iam very pleased with my purchase 1 
one of the best mexican movies ever and one of the less understood even by mexican themselves no matter how identified the should have felt with it 1 
bad script bad direction and horrible acting make this one plain bad 0 
i was not happy with this item 0 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
the sweet potato tots were good but the onion rings were perfection or as close as i have had 1 
the fries were great too 1 
feelings thoughtsgabriels discomfort during the danceall these intangibles leap to life and come within the viewers grasp in hustons portrayal 1 
waste your money on this game 1 
i really loved the story line and the poler bear was kinda cutebut if anyone has a question about fort steele just ask away 1 
its one of the movies i need to see whenever it comes on tvnever mind the fact that i already have it memorized 1 
initially the local sites in the film which was filmed here in buffalo intrigued me 1 
nobody identifies with these characters because theyre all cardboard cutouts and stereotypes or predictably reversestereotypes 0 
today the graphics are crap 0 
you will leave the theater wanting to go out and dance under the stars 1 
the scripting of the subtle comedy is unmatched by any movie in recent years 1 
no shifting no bubbling no peeling not even a scratch nothingi couldnt be more happier with my new one for the droid 1 
not tasty and the texture was just nasty 0 
maybe there would be a reasonable explanation for this atrocity 0 
if you simply want a small flip phone look elsewhere as the extra bells whistles are mediocre 0 
we had fantastic service and were pleased by the atmosphere 1 
oh the charger seems to work fine 1 
the worst phone from samsungcrap this crappy samsung e715 is the worst i have ever seeen 0 
the veggitarian platter is out of this world 1 
each day of the week they have a different deal and its all so delicious 1 
the phone was unusable and was not new 0 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
the script is a big flawed mess 0 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
an excellent new restaurant by an experienced frenchman 1 
waste of 13 bucks 0 
i was seated immediately 1 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
this place deserves no stars 0 
appears to actually outperform the original battery from china that came with my v325i 1 
my friend did not like his bloody mary 0 
this movie is terrible 0 
this is a beautiful phone 1 
her lines seem to have been written by a fifteen year old though they are trying oh so so hard to sound like how a fifteen year old would really um you know well talk 0 
i particularly remember my senses being assaulted by strident cords of music that would blare out with very little warning and even less meaning 0 
freezes frequently4 0 
very good stuff for the price 1 
i dont understand how this garbage got on the shelves of the movie store its not even a real movie 0 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
you also cannot take pictures with it in the case because the lense is covered 0 
the ending is so so perfect youll shed a tear 1 
this movie was kind of long in length but i enjoyed every minute of it 1 
if you see it you should probably just leave it on the shelf 0 
it is not good 0 
ive seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie 0 
if good intentions made a film great then this film might be one of the greatest films ever made 1 
all in all im quite satisfied with this purchase 1 
great brunch spot 1 
say bye bye to your tip lady 0 
this is probably the most irritating show i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
the movie was very interesting from beginning to the end 1 
you wont regret it 1 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
all i can do is whine on the internet so here it goesthe more i use the thing the less i like it 0 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
if you want a sandwich just go to any firehouse 1 
worst customer service ever 0 
a good film by a great director 1 
great it was new packaged nice works good no problems and it came in less time then i expected 1 
what i really like there is the crepe station 1 
oh and i forgot to also mention the weird color effect it has on your phone 0 
food was great and so was the serivce 1 
its been my choice headset for yearsgreat sound good volume good noise cancellation 1 
after the disappointing dinner we went elsewhere for dessert 0 
i can take a little bad service but the food sucks 0 
lange had become a great actress 1 
the story which was told so eloquently by francis ford coppola 25 years earlier really unfolds gradually and leaves room for the characters to develop 1 
i was hoping for more 0 
strike 2 who wants to be rushed 0 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
service is quick and even to go orders are just like we like it 1 
it works 1 
we wont be going back anytime soon 0 
nice sound 1 
sucked most of the stuff does not work with my phone 0 
the lines the cuts the audio everything is wrong 0 
star trek v the final frontier is the worst in the series 0

star trek v the final frontier is the worst in the series 0 
very disappointed 0 
fast service 1 
now we were chosen to be tortured with this disgusting piece of blatant american propaganda 0 
honeslty it didnt taste that fresh 0 
for service i give them no stars 0 
ive had this for nearly 2 years and it has worked great for me 1 
i went to bachi burger on a friends recommendation and was not disappointed 1 
the only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port irda 0 
it also had a new problem 0 
gotta love those closeups of slimy drooling teeth 1 
service was good and the company was better 1 
favorite place in town for shawarrrrrrma 1 
having trouble with volume 0 
omelets are to die for 1 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
graphics is far from the best part of the game 0 
the majority of the logitech earbud headsets failed 0 
very good quality though 1 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
the spaghetti is nothing special whatsoever 0 
its the best headset i have used 1 
its practically perfect in all of them  a true masterpiece in a sea of faux masterpieces 1 
stay away from this store be careful 0 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
very good lunch spot 1
