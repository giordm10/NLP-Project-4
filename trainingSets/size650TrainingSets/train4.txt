i wasted my little money with this earpiece 0 
this was such an awesome movie that i bought it off of ebay 1 
im still infatuated with this phone 1 
much better than the other ayce sushi place i went to in vegas 1 
you also cannot take pictures with it in the case because the lense is covered 0 
its one of the movies i need to see whenever it comes on tvnever mind the fact that i already have it memorized 1 
this film and i use that word loosely is an insult to the moviegoing public 0 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
schrader has made a resume full of lousy amateurish films 0 
alexander nevsky is a great film 1 
at first glance it is a lovely bakery cafe nice ambiance clean friendly staff 1 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
do not buy for d807wrongly advertised for d807 0 
that was funny 1 
the staff is great the food is delish and they have an incredible beer selection 1 
sorry i will not be getting food from here anytime soon 0 
i let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this bad idea we both hated it 0 
i highly recommend these and encourage people to give them a try 1 
my husband and i ate lunch here and were very disappointed with the food and service 0 
an interesting premise and billy drago is always good as a dangerous nutbag side note id love to see drago stephen mchattie and lance hendrikson in a flick together talk about raging cheekbones 1 
wonderful lil tapas and the ambience made me feel all warm and fuzzy inside 1 
the ambiance isnt much better 0 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
highly recommended a 1 
the stories were powerful explorations of the nature of man and of art 1 
i was very disappointed 0 
i think i was one of the people who found this another one of roths pearls 1 
saggy floppy piece of junk 0 
the movie seemed a little slow at first 0 
this was one of the worst films i have ever seen 0 
i dont each much pasta but i love the homemade hand made pastas and thin pizzas here 1 
seems like a good quick place to grab a bite of some familiar pub food but do yourself a favor and look elsewhere 0 
good prices 1 
i was so insulted 0 
but it wasnt until i watched this film that i realised how great he actually was 1 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
battery is holding up well 1 
i got to enjoy the seafood salad with a fabulous vinegrette 1 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
call me a nut but i think this is one of the best movies ever 1 
today the graphics are crap 0 
overall i like there food and the service 1 
essentially you can forget microsofts tech support 0 
the problem was the script 0 
i had high hopes for this place since the burgers are cooked over a charcoal grill but unfortunately the taste fell flat way flat 0 
this place deserves no stars 0 
i really recommend this faceplates since it looks very nice elegant and cool 1 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
the soundtrack wasnt terrible either 1 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
but i dont like it 0 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
the nokia ca42 usb cable did not work with my phone 0 
the staff is always super friendly and helpful which is especially cool when you bring two small boys and a baby 1 
unfortunately cover girl is an example of how hollywood used to exploit women for financial gain 0 
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
the food sucked which we expected but it sucked more than we could have imagined 0 
does everything it should and more 1 
this film offers many delights and surprises 1 
and service was super friendly 1 
these are the central themes of the film and they are handled ineptly stereotypically and with no depth of imagination 0 
star trek v the final frontier is the worst in the series 0 
the price is reasonable and the service is great 1 
the only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive 1 
and if that isnt enough of a mess of a movie for you the picture is also marred with a constant use of studio sets and indoor exteriors 0 
the visual effects were awful 0 
they dropped more than the ball 0 
great product for the price 1 
updatewent back for a second time and it was still just as amazing 1 
its like a really sexy party in your mouth where youre outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party 1 
cinematography noteworthy including fine views of barcelona and its famed gaudi towers 1 
well packaged arrived on time and works as intended 1 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
i never come again 0 
top line dont waste your time and money on this one its as bad as it comes 0 
the explosion of the gas tanks at the end was just as awful 0 
if that bug never showed up i would have given a 4 for sure but on the other side of the wall where this bug was climbing was the kitchen 0 
seriously flavorful delights folks 1 
the sweet potato tots were good but the onion rings were perfection or as close as i have had 1 
this is actually a very smart movie 1 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
the food is very good for your typical bar food 1 
if you havent gone here go now 1 
i have recommended it to friends 1 
the reception has been generally good 1 
the nokia ca42 usb cable did not work with my phone 0 
sam shepards portrayal of a gung ho marine was sobering 1 
started watching this but didnt believe in any of the characters 0 
i can barely ever hear on it and am constantly saying what 0 
it is practically useless and did not add any kind of boost to my reception after i bought it 0 
razr battery good buy 1 
the phone is sturdy and waterproof 1 
ps the only scene in the movie that was cool is when the central character finds her room blown up 1 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
much less than the jawbone i was going to replace it with 1 
he really didnt seem to want to be hosting his voiceovers were monotonous didnt get involved with the guests 0 
in other words the content level of this film is enough to easily fill a dozen other films 1 
utterly without merit on any level this is akin to torture 0 
star trek v the final frontier is the worst in the series 0 
i like steiners because its dark and it feels like a bar 1 
nothing at all to recommend 0 
i would highly recommend this product 1 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
food quality has been horrible 0 
i love this device 1 
the keyboard is a nice compromise between a full qwerty and the basic cell phone number keypad 1 
totally believable 1 
the cast was great 1 
those burgers were amazing 1 
the update procedure is difficult and cumbersome 0 
i was very excited to get this headset because i thought it was really cute 1 
so good i am going to have to review this place twice once hereas a tribute to the place and once as a tribute to an event held here last night 1 
clear skype calls long battery life long range 1 
the memories are murky but i can only say that i enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show 1 
attempting artiness with black white and clever camera angles the movie disappointed became even more ridiculous as the acting was poor and the plot and lines almost nonexistent 0 
who in their right mind is gonna buy this battery 0 
first the bathrooms at this location were dirty seat covers were not replenished just plain yucky 0 
i really hope the team behind this movie makes more movies and that they will continue to do so in their own some kinda weird style 1 
think it over when you plan to own this onethis sure is the last moto phone for me 0 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
all the bread is made inhouse 1 
also great directing and photography 1 
a piece of junk that broke after being on my phone for 2 days 0 
still i do like this movie for its empowerment of women theres not enough movies out there like this one 1 
excellent product for the price 1 
it was clear that she had the range and ability to pull off this part 1 
i thought it was bad 0 
soyo technology sucks 0 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
he was terrible 0 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
i had about two bites and refused to eat anymore 0 
once you get inside youll be impressed with the place 1 
id like to return it 0 
say bye bye to your tip lady 0 
personally i think it shows that people should learn to find a compromise them self without involving other people into issue 1 
i dont think well be going back anytime soon 0 
a world better than 95 of the garbage in the theatres today 1 
motorola finally got the voice quality of a bluetooth headset right 1 
its a little geeky but i think thats its sex on toast and it rocks and oozes sex right down to its battery embedded sleek stylish leather case 1 
a good time 1 
overall i was not impressed and would not go back 0 
does everything it should and more 1 
better than expected 1 
spend your money and time some place else 0 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
even when the women finally show up there is no sign of improvement the most expected things happen and by the time the film is over you might be far asleep 0 
i dont know what the big deal is about this place but i wont be back yaall 0 
this movie is excellentangel is beautiful and scamp is adorablehis little yelps when hes scaredand the funniest parts are whenscamp is caught under the curtain and when angel and scamp are singing ive never had this feeling beforei totally recommend this movieits coming out on special edition on june 20the cover has scamp on a garbage can and angel underneath the lid 1 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
i have 23 bars on my cell phone when i am home but you cant not hear anything 0 
excellent phone 1 
bad script bad direction and horrible acting make this one plain bad 0 
disappointed 0 
the jabra eargels fit my ears very well 1 
dont make the same mistake i did 0 
later i found myself lost in the power of the film 1 
horrible dont waste your time and money 0 
the art style has the appearance of crayonpencil drawings and is wonderfully colorful and fanciful 1 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
for the price on amazon it is an excellent product which i would highly recommend 1 
i have been very happy with the 510 and have had no complaints from any one regarding my sound quality on their end 1 
this is a very average phone with bad battery life that operates on a weak network 0 
ive tried several different earpieces for my cell phone and this jabra one is the first one ive found that fits my ear comfortably 1 
over rated 0 
this is so embarassing and also my ears hurt if i try to push the ear plug into my ear 0 
which are small and not worth the price 0 
avoid at all costs 0 
the worst was the salmon sashimi 0 
highly recommend for any one who has a blue tooth phone 1 
seafood was limited to boiled shrimp and crab legs but the crab legs definitely did not taste fresh 0 
unreliable im giving up 0 
chinese forgeries abound 0 
gets a signal when other verizon phones wont 1 
it was a riot to see hugo weaving play a sexobsessed gay real estate salesman who uses his clients houses for his trysts with the flaming darren tom hollander 1 
the characters are fleshed out surprisingly well particularly grimes and blake and all the actors deliver their sharply scripted lines with just the right amount of deadpan tongue in cheek to make the dialogue both hilarious and realistic 1 
a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it 1 
which has more depth and character than the man underneath it 0 
the chicken wings contained the driest chicken meat i have ever eaten 0 
camerawork again bad 0 
but then they came back cold 0 
john wayne did an incredible job for being so young in the movie industry 1 
absolutely great 1 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
the worst one of the series 0 
worst customer service ever 0 
we recently witnessed her poor quality of management towards other guests as well 0 
i loved it it was really scary 1 
for 40 bucks a head i really expect better food 0 
very windresistant 1 
bland not a liking this place for a number of reasons and i dont want to waste time on bad reviewing ill leave it at that 0 
barney is definitely super de duper 1 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
its a campy sort of film thats a joy to watch 1 
thank you for such great service 1 
kind of flops around 0 
love this product 1 
it also took her forever to bring us the check when we asked for it 0 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
this fixes all the problems 1 
this battery is an excellent bargain 1 
a week later after i activated it it suddenly died 0 
everyone is very attentive providing excellent customer service 1 
what happened next was prettyoff putting 0 
i dont think ive ever gone to a movie and disliked it as much 0 
im not really sure how joeys was voted best hot dog in the valley by readers of phoenix magazine 0 
it just blew 0 
definitely not worth the 3 i paid 0 
avoid at all costs 0 
before i go in to why i gave a 1 star rating please know that this was my third time eating at bachi burger before writing a review 0 
but i definitely would not eat here again 0 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
the menu is always changing food quality is going down service is extremely slow 0 
the only thing worse than taylors acting was stanwycks singing 0 
this place receives stars for their appetizers 1 
if the food isnt bad enough for you then enjoy dealing with the worlds worstannoying drunk people 0 
the cable looks so thin and flimsy it is scary 0 
after a year the battery went completely dead on my headset 0 
good product good seller 1 
all the pretty pictures in the world cannot make up for a piece of work that is flawed at the core 0 
the holster that arrived did not match the photo in the ad 0 
id say that would be the hardest decision honestly all of ms dishes taste how they are supposed to taste amazing 1 
the problem i have is that they charge 1199 for a sandwich that is no bigger than a subway sub which offers better and more amount of vegetables 0 
of all the dishes the salmon was the best but all were great 1 
i have bought this nokia cell phone a few weeks ago and it was a nightmare 0 
great pork sandwich 1 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
i have read others reviews here but i havent had any problem with it 1 
the phone loads super 1 
heres where the movie really pied me off 0 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
excellent bluetooth headset 1 
works great 1 
terrible my car will not accept this cassette 0 
needless to say i wont be going back anytime soon 0 
i have had problems wit hit dropping signal and more 0 
buttons are too small 0 
seems like a good quick place to grab a bite of some familiar pub food but do yourself a favor and look elsewhere 0 
there was no chemistry between ben affleck and sandra bullock in this film and i couldnt understand why he would consider even leaving his wifetobe for this chick that he supposedly was knocked out by 0 
the entire audience applauded at the conclusion of the film 1 
the real killer is the volume and of course it breaking 0 
overall a delight 1 
definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly will return next time im in vegas 1 
the directing and the cinematography arent quite as good 0 
the warmth it generates is in contrast to its austere backdrop 1 
then a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use 0 
bad fit way too big 0 
the service was extremely slow 0 
the film succeeds despite or perhaps because of an obviously meagre budget 1 
also the story and acting were weak 0 
tom wilkinson broke my heart at the end and everyone elses judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike 1 
not good when wearing a hat or sunglasses 0 
the warm beer didnt help 0 
the chicken i got was definitely reheated and was only ok the wedges were cold and soggy 0 
kind of hard to mess up a steak but they did 0 
uncomfortable in the ear dont use with lg vx9900 env 0 
excellent product 1 
his use of the colours of the french flag in the three films was nothing short of incredible every shot every scene was like a work of art 1 
the range is very decent ive been able to roam around my house with the phone in the living room with no receptionsound quality issues 1 
someone shouldve invented this sooner 1 
whatever prompted such a documentary is beyond me 0 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
dont make the same mistake that i did and please dont buy this phone 0 
awful service 0 
i think this restaurant suffers from not trying hard enough 0 
it isnt even an achievement as a sobaditsgood or sobaditsmemorable movie 0 
the chicken wings contained the driest chicken meat i have ever eaten 0 
unreliable im giving up 0 
my friend did not like his bloody mary 0 
phone falls out easily 0 
i used bitpim a free program you can find on the internetto transfer data to the phonethe price of the cable was excellent 1 
i ordered the lemon raspberry ice cocktail which was also incredible 1 
the cocktails are all handmade and delicious 1 
it features an outlandish array of memorable psychotic but lovable nuts 1 
the food was terrible 0 
then a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use 0 
saggy floppy piece of junk 0 
i have had mine for about a year and this christmas i bought some for the rest of the family 1 
this film offers many delights and surprises 1 
but it wasnt until i watched this film that i realised how great he actually was 1 
great product 1 
the phone crashed completely and now i have to get it replaced 0 
the fact is this film is a wonderful heartwarming tale about two people chasing their dreams 1 
this battery is an excellent bargain 1 
my friend did not like his bloody mary 0 
later i found myself lost in the power of the film 1 
i dont have very many words to say about this place but it does everything pretty well 1 
i understand that its supposed to be a cheap popcorn comedy but that doesnt mean that it has to completely insult our intelligence and have writing so incredibly hackneyed that it borders on offensive 0 
the bottowm lineanother worthless cheap gimmick from sprint 0 
this greedy corporation will never see another dime from me 0 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
if you see it you should probably just leave it on the shelf 0 
one of my favorite purchases ever 1 
if you havent choked in your own vomit by the end by all the cheap drama and worthless dialogue youve must have bored yourself to death with this waste of time 0 
the owner used to work at nobu so this place is really similar for half the price 1 
the biggest complaint i have is the battery drains superfast 0 
this was one of the worst films i have ever seen 0 
with the originality and freshness of the first movie now spent this remake had little else to offer 0 
it was so bad i had lost the heart to finish it 0 
very very sad 0 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
so there is no way for me to plug it in here in the us unless i go by a converter 0 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
hard to judge whether these sides were good because we were grossed out by the melted styrofoam and didnt want to eat it for fear of getting sick 0 
the things that the four kids get themselves into is absolutely hilarious to watch 1 
the only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port irda 0 
the awful dialogue and hopeless overacting by everyone who gets shot top off a real waste of space and time 0 
great product and price 1 
an awesome new look for fall 2000 1 
i have never had such bland food which surprised me considering the article we read focused so much on their spices and flavor 0 
the staff are also very friendly and efficient 1 
good transmit audio 1 
the food was terrible 0 
so for our enjoyment we get to see them run around play games and be dangerous 1 
item does not match picture 0 
best of luck to the rude and noncustomer service focused new management 0 
but its just not funny 0 
it didnt make me scared horrified or make me sympathetic towards the characters it was simply annoying 0 
the food is very good for your typical bar food 1 
great product 1 
if youre not familiar check it out 1 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
okay i like to consider myself a fair critic so ill give credit where credits duethe creature effects were actually pretty cool 1 
the only very disappointing thing was there was no speakerphone 0 
well im satisfied 1 
this place is overpriced not consistent with their boba and it really is overpriced 0 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
the buttons for on and off are bad 0 
nice design and quality 1 
wow loved this place 1 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
its a case of so bad it is laughable 0 
it has a very good plot it holds your complete attention the acting is superb tom wilkinson was fantastic and emily watson was also very good 1 
what a great double cheeseburger 1 
unfortunately any virtue in this films production work was lost on a regrettable script 0 
this case has passed the one year mark and while it shows signs of wear it is 100 functional 1 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
excellent bluetooth headset 1 
avoid at any and all costs 0 
dont buy this product 0 
the black eyed peas and sweet potatoes unreal 1 
does not work 0 
a great film by a great director 1 
a standout scene 1 
the fries were not hot and neither was my burger 0 
everything captain howdy says is either laughable or just plain stupid 0 
that was nice 1 
the manager was the worst 0 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
w810i is just superb 1 
service was very prompt 1 
the nokia ca42 usb cable did not work with my phone 0 
phone now holds charge like it did when it was new 1 
im not eating here 0 
battery lasts only a few hours 0 
this is a great product sure beats using your fingers 1 
great sound and service 1 
this is an excellent tool especially when paired with your phones autoanswer 1 
the transfers are very good 1 
the bathrooms are clean and the place itself is well decorated 1 
phone falls out easily 0 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
the sweet potato fries were very good and seasoned well 1 
hayao miyazakis latest and eighth film for studio ghibili gake no ue no ponyo ponyo on the cliff by the sea is a wonderfully fun and imaginative look at childhood 1 
my rating just 3 out of 10 0 
my brother in law who works at the mall ate here same day and guess what he was sick all night too 0 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
we waited for thirty minutes to be seated although there were 8 vacant tables and we were the only folks waiting 0 
the pan cakes everyone are raving about taste like a sugary disaster tailored to the palate of a six year old 0 
i felt insulted and disrespected how could you talk and judge another human being like that 0 
dont make the same mistake that i did and please dont buy this phone 0 
better than new 1 
spend your money and time some place else 0 
all in all i think it was a good investment 1 
avoid this one if you can 0 
i had the chicken pho and it tasted very bland 0 
for people who are first timers in film making i think they did an excellent job 1 
the live music on fridays totally blows 0 
best service and food ever maria our server was so good and friendly she made our day 1 
i like armand assante my cable companys summary sounded interesting so i watched it twice already and probably will again 1 
the staff is always super friendly and helpful which is especially cool when you bring two small boys and a baby 1 
this place was such a nice surprise 1 
i have seen many movies starring jaclyn smith but my god this was one of her best though it came out 12 years ago 1 
the design is very good4 1 
yes i am simplifying things here for the sake of brevity for this really is at the core of the problems with this film it has too much going on without any real fulfilling explanation 0 
the worst sappiest dialogue i could go on and on 0 
i guess i should have known that this place would suck because it is inside of the excalibur but i didnt use my common sense 0 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
product is useless since it does not have enough charging current to charge the 2 cellphones i was planning to use it with 0 
my 5year old nokia 2160 from tracfone holds the charge a lot better than this 0 
both rickman and stowe play their roles to the hilt in this tale of a childrens book writer who maybe has written a subversive tract 1 
the buttons for on and off are bad 0 
very disappointed and wondered how it could be in the oscar shortlist 0 
both of them were truly unbelievably good and i am so glad we went back 1 
will be back again 1 
you cant beat that 1 
no real improvement 0 
i dont understand how this garbage got on the shelves of the movie store its not even a real movie 0 
avoid this establishment 0 
i would have given no star if i was able 0 
this place deserves one star and 90 has to do with the food 0 
the phone crashed completely and now i have to get it replaced 0 
this movie is a good and humorous comment on life in 2006 1 
also great directing and photography 1 
i have seen many movies starring jaclyn smith but my god this was one of her best though it came out 12 years ago 1 
the film is well paced understated and one of the best courtroom documentaries ive seen 1 
plus it was wellpaced and suited its relatively short run time 1 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
i wont be back 0 
i never come again 0 
the chicken i got was definitely reheated and was only ok the wedges were cold and soggy 0 
jabra ear gels r the best 1 
your staff spends more time talking to themselves than me 0 
now you know why i gave it a 10 1 
then i exchanged for the same phone even that had the same problem 0 
the results well are a shame 0 
by the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant i was bored and didnt care what happened next and so i switched off 0 
for people who are first timers in film making i think they did an excellent job 1 
good item low price 1 
the cinematography is simply stunning to say the least and the fx are nothing if not stateoftheart 1 
i just cant explain this movie more than romanticcharminghilariousand adorablethe junkyard scenes are funnyall the junkyard dogs have something specialtoo funny i laughedkids will love itbuy it when it comes outit has new features 1 
this is simply the best bluetooth headset for sound quality 1 
ive had this for nearly 2 years and it has worked great for me 1 
as for the service im a fan because its quick and youre being served by some nice folks 1 
saggy floppy piece of junk 0 
definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly will return next time im in vegas 1 
excellent cast story line performances 1 
but it is great i would really recommend it 1 
the problem i have is that they charge 1199 for a sandwich that is no bigger than a subway sub which offers better and more amount of vegetables 0 
its not what it says it is 0 
does not fit 0 
i love this cable it allows me to connect any miniusb device to my pc 1 
this is a great little item 1 
but then they came back cold 0 
there is no real plot 0 
after 20 minutes wait i got a table 0 
after 20 minutes wait i got a table 0 
there were several moments in the movie that just didnt need to be there and were excruciatingly slow moving 0 
last night was my second time dining here and i was so happy i decided to go back 1 
mark my words this is one of those cult films like evil dead 2 or phantasm that people will still be discovering and falling in love with 20 30 40 years down the line 1 
uncomfortable in the ear dont use with lg vx9900 env 0 
its a little geeky but i think thats its sex on toast and it rocks and oozes sex right down to its battery embedded sleek stylish leather case 1 
phone is sturdy as all nokia bar phones are 1 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
this movie is greatespecially if you enjoy visual arts 1 
hard to judge whether these sides were good because we were grossed out by the melted styrofoam and didnt want to eat it for fear of getting sick 0 
i would recommend this 1 
im not eating here 0 
nothing special 0 
at any rate this film stinks its not funny and fulci should have stayed with giallo and supernatural zombie movies 0 
great food 1 
very clear quality sound and you dont have to mess with the sound on your ipod since you have the sound buttons on the headset 1 
tried to go here for lunch and it was a madhouse 0 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
they refuse to refund or replace 0 
the characters are interesting even if a bit predictable 1 
i gave it a 10 1 
the aerial scenes were welldone 1 
and the sound quality is great 1 
avoid at all cost 0 
go watch it 1 
perhaps my phone is defective but people cannot hear me when i use this 0 
not only did the software do a great job of this i could also make my own ringtones form my existing cds without an internet connection 1 
the cast was great 1 
this phone might well be the worst ive ever had in any brand 0 
in fact this stinker smells like a directtovideo release 0 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
no one at the table thought the food was above average or worth the wait that we had for it 0 
hackneyed writing certainly but made even worse by the bad directing 0 
it is simple to use and i like it 1 
my order was not correct 0 
the battery life is highly unacceptable 0 
we enjoy their pizza and brunch 1 
lange had become a great actress 1 
the ripped banana was not only ripped but petrified and tasteless 0 
the cinematography is simply stunning to say the least and the fx are nothing if not stateoftheart 1 
service was fantastic 1 
we ordered some old classics and some new dishes after going there a few times and were sorely disappointed with everything 0 
it is an excellent drama an excellent thriller and an excellent film 1 
finally after three or four times the spring of the latch broke and i could not use it any longer on the visor 0 
while you dont yet hear mickey speak there are tons of sound effects and music throughout the filmsomething we take for granted now but which was a huge crowd pleaser in 1928 1 
has been working great 1 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
as for the mains also uninspired 0 
it is super charged up for use as a small hybrid palmtopcameracellphone and excels in those roles 1 
i do love sushi but i found kabuki to be overpriced overhip and underservices 0 
worst martini ever 0 
it is an hour and half waste of time following a bunch of very pretty high schoolers whine and cry about life 0 
only had this a month but its worked flawlessly so far 1 
not loud enough and doesnt turn on like it should 0 
the manager was the worst 0 
i think that it is a must see older john wayne film 1 
one of the most disappointing aspects is the lack of notable gore 0 
i have seen many movies starring jaclyn smith but my god this was one of her best though it came out 12 years ago 1 
dont buy it 0 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
i wont spoil it but the ending in pretty amazing 1 
great product 1 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
doesnt work 0 
their onscreen chemistry critical to the entire film is genuine 1 
warning stay away 0 
food was below average 0 
summary the witticisms werent witty 0 
battery has no life 0 
the staff is great the food is delish and they have an incredible beer selection 1 
this may be the only bad film he ever made 0 
i left with a stomach ache and felt sick the rest of the day 0 
my brother in law who works at the mall ate here same day and guess what he was sick all night too 0 
this phone works great 1 
it has northern humour and positive about the community it represents 1 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
damian is so talented and versatile in so many ways of writing and portraying different characters on screen 1 
highly recommended a 1 
the use of slowmotion needlessly repeats itself throughout the movie but is well backed up by bad acting and bad is a kind word here no continuity scenes that are thrown in for no reason whatsoever vehicles that looked like they were made from a corn flakes box and a directorial style that bordered on stupidity 0 
my ribeye steak was cooked perfectly and had great mesquite flavor 1 
this is just a great movie 1 
the food came out at a good pace 1 
would come back again if i had a sushi craving while in vegas 1 
here in the wind and the lion we see a wonderful rendering of americas own imperial age 1 
it was probably dirt 0 
the company shipped my product very promptly and it works well 1 
total brunch fail 0 
not only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic but it also managed to give away the entire movie and im not exaggerating every moment every plot point every joke is told in the trailer 0 
very disappointing 0 
fits comfortably came with three sizes of earbud tips 1 
i just wanted to leave 0 
not much seafood and like 5 strings of pasta at the bottom 0 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
10 out of 10 stars 1 
would recommend this item 1 
the atmosphere is modern and hip while maintaining a touch of coziness 1 
the han nan chicken was also very tasty 1 
disappointing accessory from a good manufacturer 0 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
you wont regret it 1 
it is zillion times away from reality 0 
he was very impressed when going from the original battery to the extended battery 1 
i guess that nobody at the network that aired this dribble watched it before putting it on 0 
no real improvement 0 
i hate writing bad reviews about films especially those in which i really like the star but this film is so bad i dont believe for one second that anyone could have been proud of it 0 
john wayne did an incredible job for being so young in the movie industry 1 
i ate there twice on my last visit and especially enjoyed the salmon salad 1 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
customer service was terrible 0 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
no real improvement 0 
i gave it a 10 1 
the ripped banana was not only ripped but petrified and tasteless 0 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
the movie is terribly boring in places 0 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
the pairing of the two devices was so easy it barely took a couple minutes before i started making calls with the voice dialing feature 1 
also the phone doesnt seem to accept anything except cbr mp3s preferably ripped by windows media player 0 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
great pork sandwich 1 
but kevin spacey is an excellent verbal tsunami as buddy ackerman  and totally believable because he is a great actor 1 
to be honest with you this is unbelievable nonsense and very foolish 0 
the roast beef sandwich tasted really good 1 
i had a pretty satifying experience 1 
could not get strong enough signal 0 
the things that the four kids get themselves into is absolutely hilarious to watch 1 
i wish i could return the unit and get back my money 0 
its just painful 0 
i dont think well be going back anytime soon 0 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
another note about this phones appearance is that it really looks rather bland especially in the all black model 0 
cumbersome design 0 
pretty piece of junk 0 
it features an outlandish array of memorable psychotic but lovable nuts 1 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
now we were chosen to be tortured with this disgusting piece of blatant american propaganda 0 
also the phone doesnt seem to accept anything except cbr mp3s preferably ripped by windows media player 0 
highly recommend for any one who has a blue tooth phone 1 
what i really like there is the crepe station 1 
the waitresses are very friendly 1 
it was probably dirt 0 
it was delicious 1 
i wouldnt return 0 
not much flavor to them and very poorly constructed 0 
it is so small and you dont even realize that it is there after a while of getting used to it 1 
bought mainly for the charger which broke soon after purchasing 0 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
with the originality and freshness of the first movie now spent this remake had little else to offer 0 
it also had a new problem 0 
what a big waste of time 0 
the potatoes were like rubber and you could tell they had been made up ahead of time being kept under a warmer 0 
the only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive 1 
i wouldnt return 0 
the service was not up to par either 0 
i have had tmobile service for 2 or 3 years now and i am pretty happy with it 1 
i didnt want the clip going over the top of my ear causing discomfort 0 
it is so small and you dont even realize that it is there after a while of getting used to it 1 
this convention never worked well in the past and certainly doesnt work here 0 
both do good jobs and are quite amusing 1 
however i needed some better instructions 0 
his performance as awarded was stunning 1 
overall a great experience 1 
by far the best cheesecurds we have ever had 1 
the ri style calamari was a joke 0 
what on earth is irons doing in this film 0 
john garfield ann revere lilli plmer william conrad canada leeand filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screenjames wong howe 1 
it is an hour and half waste of time following a bunch of very pretty high schoolers whine and cry about life 0 
painful on the ear 0 
it makes very strange ticking noises before it ends the call 0 
the vegetables are so fresh and the sauce feels like authentic thai 1 
favorite place in town for shawarrrrrrma 1 
the most annoying thing about cover girl is the way in which rita hayworth is put up on a pedestal 0 
what a piece of junk i lose more calls on this phone 0 
i also decided not to send it back because our waitress looked like she was on the verge of having a heart attack 0 
dont waste your time watching this rubbish nonresearched film 0 
then as if i hadnt wasted enough of my life there they poured salt in the wound by drawing out the time it took to bring the check 0 
point your finger at any item on the menu order it and you wont be disappointed 1 
with great sound effects and impressive special effects i cant recommend this movie enough 1 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
both of them were truly unbelievably good and i am so glad we went back 1 
the service was a bit lacking 0 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
but despite these few flaws this case is of exceptional quality and well worth the additional costs of owning an official oem product 1 
highly unprofessional and rude to a loyal patron 0 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
but above all the exquisite visual composition of each moment with inventive and elegant use of closeup camera angle and lighting including pointillistic faux home movie footage is a wonder and joy to behold 1 
just dont know why they were so slow 0 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
despite the pans of reviewers i liked this movie 1 
this place is handsdown one of the best places to eat in the phoenix metro area 1 
the battery life is highly unacceptable 0 
worst customer service ever 0 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
the delivery was on time 1 
works good 1 
its very slow 0 
the ambience is wonderful and there is music playing 1 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
also notable is john baileys fine crisp beautifully colored cinematography and the great production design costumes by eiko ishioka who went on to do the memorable costumes for coppolas dracula for which she received a well deserved oscar 1 
god and i can never get that 90 minutes back 0 
after arguing with verizon regarding the dropped calls we returned the phones after two days 0 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
there is a lot of beautiful places 1 
generally it just lacked imagination 0 
essentially you can forget microsofts tech support 0 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
i could eat their bruschetta all day it is devine 1 
it looses connection to the phone even when it is within a couple feet between the two 0 
nothing short of magnificent photographycinematography in this film 1
