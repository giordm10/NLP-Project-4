strike 2 who wants to be rushed 0 
im not impressed with the concept or the food 0 
if you are razr owneryou must have this 1 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
excellent cast story line performances 1 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
con spotty service 0 
2 thumbs up to this seller 1 
i just saw this film and i recommend it 1 
i consider this theft 0 
the best example of how dumb the writing is when its established that you can turn the zombiestudents back into humans by removing a necklace containing a piece of the meteorite 0 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
so good i am going to have to review this place twice once hereas a tribute to the place and once as a tribute to an event held here last night 1 
this place is pretty good nice little vibe in the restaurant 1 
talk about useless customer service 0 
actually the graphics were good at the time 1 
lastly the mozzarella sticks they were the best thing we ordered 1 
the grilled chicken was so tender and yellow from the saffron seasoning 1 
im happy about this purchase good quality and low price 1 
as always the evening was wonderful and the food delicious 1 
it is perfect for a sitdown family meal or get together with a few friends 1 
still waiting im sure this item would work well if i ever recieve it 0 
it even has its sweet moments 1 
it is easy to turn on and off when you are in the car and the volume controls are quite accessable 1 
then the film just dropped the ball 0 
the foreigner is not worth one second of your time 0 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
i contacted the company and they told me that although the unit was still under warranty if i couldnt produce my receipt i was out of luck 0 
the only thing really worth watching was the scenery and the house because it is beautiful 1 
just does not work 0 
good case 1 
and generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode 0 
i was able to do voice dialing in the car with no problem 1 
much more interesting more action more suspense and less of the unneeded controversy 1 
i just cant explain this movie more than romanticcharminghilariousand adorablethe junkyard scenes are funnyall the junkyard dogs have something specialtoo funny i laughedkids will love itbuy it when it comes outit has new features 1 
i would recommend saving room for this 1 
everything stinks 0 
cool phone 1 
however i needed some better instructions 0 
absolutely great 1 
the casting is also horrible cause all you see is a really really bad actors period 0 
all the bread is made inhouse 1 
it is zillion times away from reality 0 
there is however some pretty good acting at least for this type of film 1 
it was a huge awkward 15lb piece of cow that was 34ths gristle and fat 0 
i saw this short film on hbo the other day and absolutely loved it 1 
it fits so securely that the ear hook does not even need to be used and the sound is better directed through your ear canal 1 
for those that havent seen it dont waste your time 0 
best headset ever 1 
considering the relations off screen between taylor and stanwyck it was surprising how little chemistry there was on screen between the two of them 0 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
our server was very nice and even though he looked a little overwhelmed with all of our needs he stayed professional and friendly until the end 1 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
well packaged arrived on time and works as intended 1 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
poor construction 0 
i checked out this place a couple years ago and was not impressed 0 
it has all the features i want 1 
what a mistake that was 0 
heres where the movie really pied me off 0 
the instructions didnt explain that a microphone jack could be used 0 
the bipolarity of the ruthless thug one minute a ruthless killer the next minute a luvs diaper commercial is completely unconvincing 0 
my side greek salad with the greek dressing was so tasty and the pita and hummus was very refreshing 1 
how awful she is 0 
this greedy corporation will never see another dime from me 0 
product is exactly as described 1 
the food was excellent and service was very good 1 
but kevin spacey is an excellent verbal tsunami as buddy ackerman  and totally believable because he is a great actor 1 
the guys all had steaks and our steak loving son who has had steak at the best and worst places said it was the best steak hes ever eaten 1 
food was great and so was the serivce 1 
excellent cast story line performances 1 
it has been a winner for us 1 
raw and sublimely moving 1 
very pleased with this headset 1 
i had a salad with the wings and some ice cream for dessert and left feeling quite satisfied 1 
i could not understand what kind of idiot would produce this mess in the first place not to mention several season 0 
i was totally fascinated by the music the dancing everything 1 
avoid at all costs 0 
love this product 1 
great movie 1 
too politically correct 0 
initially the local sites in the film which was filmed here in buffalo intrigued me 1 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
not a good item it worked for a while then started having problems in my auto reverse tape player 0 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
performed awful muffled tinny incoming sound and severe echo for those on the other end of the call 0 
it was a good thing that the tickets only cost five dollars because i would be mad if id have paid 750 to see this crap 0 
service was fantastic 1 
love the margaritas too 1 
the best scene in the movie was when gerardo is trying to find a song that keeps running through his head 1 
the performances are not improved by improvisation because the actors now have twice as much to worry about not only whether theyre delivering the line well but whether the line itself is any good 0 
i struggle to find anything bad to say about it 1 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
punishment park is a brilliant piece of cinema 1 
it sure does beat the nachos at the movies but i would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant 0 
this place should honestly be blown up 0 
you wont be disappointed 1 
it is very educational for children 1 to 8 years old 1 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
price is good too 1 
their research and development division obviously knows what theyre doing 1 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
the ending is so so perfect youll shed a tear 1 
the sergeant pepper beef sandwich with auju sauce is an excellent sandwich as well 1 
the cinematography is simply stunning to say the least and the fx are nothing if not stateoftheart 1 
i really like this product over the motorola because it is allot clearer on the ear piece and the mic 1 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach 0 
theres really nothing bad i can say about this headset 0 
things that went wrong they burned the saganaki 0 
the characters are interesting and you really care for them 1 
now i know that i made a wise decision 1 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
the acting helps the writing along very well maybe the idiotsavant sister could have been played better and it is a real joy to watch 1 
i get absolutely horrible reception in my apartment where with other phones i have not had this problem 0 
lightweight and works well 1 
the incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film 1 
i advise everyone do not be fooled 0 
the staff are great the ambiance is great 1 
sooooo good 1 
this scene is very strong and unpleasant 0 
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0 
i will never forget it now 1 
to call this movie a drama is ridiculous 0 
i love this phone 1 
soyo technology sucks 0 
the best phone in market 1 
the acting from all involved and that includes those like shatner and nimoy is bad and washed out and making them seem as old as they look in real life the special effects are tacky like when spock has to rescue kirk on a jet pack when he falls down from a mountain 0 
and the red curry had so much bamboo shoots and wasnt very tasty to me 0 
i also decided not to send it back because our waitress looked like she was on the verge of having a heart attack 0 
lifetime does not air it enough so if anyone knows what store sells it let me know because this is a musthave 1 
i live in the neighborhood so i am disappointed i wont be back here because it is a convenient location 0 
thanks good a movie like this was done and released 1 
host staff were for lack of a better word bitches 0 
ample portions and good prices 1 
the phone takes forever to charge like 2 to 5 hours literally 0 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
very happy with this product 1 
service is quick and friendly 1 
special thanks to dylan t for the recommendation on what to order all yummy for my tummy 1 
painful on the ear 0 
they never brought a salad we asked for 0 
judith light is one of my favorite actresses and i think she does a superb job in this film 1 
i cant see how this movie can be an inspiration to anyone to come out or overcome fear and rejection 0 
the story starts too fast with absolutely no suspense or buildup in the slightest 0 
it was clear that she had the range and ability to pull off this part 1 
id say that would be the hardest decision honestly all of ms dishes taste how they are supposed to taste amazing 1 
highly unprofessional and rude to a loyal patron 0 
the waiter wasnt helpful or friendly and rarely checked on us 0 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
i saw this film over christmas and what a great film it was 1 
the only good thing was our waiter he was very helpful and kept the bloddy marys coming 1 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic 1 
and finally after all that we get to an ending that wouldve been great had it been handled by competent people and not jerry falwell 0 
i left with a stomach ache and felt sick the rest of the day 0 
its still wild stuff though and is highly recommended to fans of giallo cinema 1 
definitely worth checking out 1 
we ordered the duck rare and it was pink and tender on the inside with a nice char on the outside 1 
bad day or not i have a very low tolerance for rude customer service people it is your job to be nice and polite wash dishes otherwise 0 
it plays louder than any other speaker of this size the price is so low that most would think the quality is lacking however its not 1 
whatever the producer was going for he missed entirely 0 
doesnt last long 0 
disappointing experience 0 
if you do go see this movie bring a pillow or a girlfriendboyfriend to keep you occupied through out 0 
the owner used to work at nobu so this place is really similar for half the price 1 
after one bite i was hooked 1 
if you check the directors filmography on this site you will see why this film didnt have a chance 0 
these products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet 0 
now imagine that every single one of those decisions was made wrong 0 
worst martini ever 0 
echo problemvery unsatisfactory 0 
secondly hitchcock pretty much perfected the thriller and chase movie 1 
the poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying 0 
someone shouldve invented this sooner 1 
im a big fan of this series mostly due to anne rices style sensitivities and treatments 1 
overall i am psyched to have a phone which has all my appointments and contacts in and gets great reception 1 
great hands free device 1 
the writers were smack on and i think the best actors and actresses were a bonus to the showthese characters were so real 1 
and there wasnt a single sour note struck actingwise either some surprisingly solid casting here 1 
lasted one day and then blew up 0 
i cant see how this movie can be an inspiration to anyone to come out or overcome fear and rejection 0 
one of the worst shows of all time 0 
i came over from verizon because cingulair has nicer cell phones the first thing i noticed was the really bad service 0 
the camera although rated at an impressive 13 megapixels renders images that fall well below expectations of such a relatively high resolution 0 
dont waste your time watching this rubbish nonresearched film 0 
the pairing of the two devices was so easy it barely took a couple minutes before i started making calls with the voice dialing feature 1 
still waiting im sure this item would work well if i ever recieve it 0 
if you hate earbugs avoid this phone by all means 0 
he was extremely rude and really there are so many other restaurants i would love to dine at during a weekend in vegas 0 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
dont waste your money 0 
i was able to do voice dialing in the car with no problem 1 
reaching for the bottom row is uncomfortable and the send and end keys are not where i expect them to be3 0 
works good 1 
i really hope the team behind this movie makes more movies and that they will continue to do so in their own some kinda weird style 1 
great food 1 
this does not fit the palm tungsten e2 and it broke the first time i tried to plug it in 0 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
the acting from all involved and that includes those like shatner and nimoy is bad and washed out and making them seem as old as they look in real life the special effects are tacky like when spock has to rescue kirk on a jet pack when he falls down from a mountain 0 
the characters are interesting and you really care for them 1 
ive missed numerous calls because of this reason 0 
do not waste your money here 0 
lifetime does not air it enough so if anyone knows what store sells it let me know because this is a musthave 1 
a film not easily forgotten 1 
poor quality 0 
i thought it was bad 0 
this place is handsdown one of the best places to eat in the phoenix metro area 1 
classywarm atmosphere fun and fresh appetizers succulent steaks baseball steak 1 
really ugly 0 
i was deeply impressed with the character he played 1 
bad reception 0 
avoid this one if you can 0 
i am a fan of his this movie sucked really bad 0 
it even has its sweet moments 1 
some may say this buffet is pricey but i think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot 1 
bt50 battery junk 0 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
helen baxendale is a very credible lady macbeth who can be very cheerfull at times and sometimes she just looks like a naughty girl but deadly in her taste for blood and evil 1 
the reception is excellent 1 
worked perfectly 1 
big disappointment with calendar sync 0 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
love this phone 1 
i cant wait to go back 1 
painful on the ear 0 
they have great dinners 1 
this film has no redeeming features 0 
beautiful styling though 1 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
generous portions and great taste 1 
i love the scream movies and all horror movies and this one ranks way up there 1 
and the sound quality is great 1 
the chefs were friendly and did a good job 1 
we received a white colored battery that goes dead after a couple hoursthe original used to last a week but still lasts longer than thereplacement 0 
their daily specials are always a hit with my group 1 
hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in 0 
this is a great product sure beats using your fingers 1 
jamie foxx absolutely is ray charles 1 
but storm trooper is not even bad enough to make it to the list of wonderfully terrible movies 0 
this movie now joins revenge of the boogeyman and zombiez as part of the hellish trinity of horror films 0 
lots of holes in the script 0 
i will come back here every time im in vegas 1 
portable and it works 1 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
we thought youd have to venture further away to get good sushi but this place really hit the spot that night 1 
bacon is hella salty 1 
service was very prompt 1 
service is quick and friendly 1 
i highly recommend these and encourage people to give them a try 1 
ill be looking for a new earpiece 0 
i agree with jessica this movie is pretty bad 0 
i find this inexcusable and so will probably be returning this phone and perhaps changing carriers 0 
very good lunch spot 1 
the scallop dish is quite appalling for value as well 0 
constantine gives everything the right intensity and seems to have a good understanding of the underlying psychological motivations 1 
well never go again 0 
this is a chilly unremarkable movie about an author livingworking in a chilly abstruse culture 0 
i am very happy 1 
great headset very impressed h500 1 
improper description i had to return it 0 
great for the jawbone 1 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
i was shocked because no signs indicate cash only 0 
service is quick and even to go orders are just like we like it 1 
does not fit 0 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
it was packed 0 
my order was not correct 0 
nice case feels good in your hands 1 
the plot doesnt hang together at all and the acting is absolutely appalling 0 
this particular model would not work with my motorola q smartphone 0 
the majority of the logitech earbud headsets failed 0 
this is a simple little phone to use but the breakage is unacceptible 0 
secondly hitchcock pretty much perfected the thriller and chase movie 1 
the dialogue sucked 0 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
after a year the battery went completely dead on my headset 0 
ill put this gem up against any movie in terms of screenplay cinematography acting postproduction editing directing or any other aspect of filmmaking 1 
it kept getting worse and worse so now im officially done 0 
these are the central themes of the film and they are handled ineptly stereotypically and with no depth of imagination 0 
the desserts were a bit strange 0 
items stated as included from the description are not included 0 
we had 7 at our table and the service was pretty fast 1 
this is cool because most cases are just open there allowing the screen to get all scratched up 1 
personally i think it shows that people should learn to find a compromise them self without involving other people into issue 1 
eew this location needs a complete overhaul 0 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
this item worked great but it broke after 6 months of use 0 
i have always used corded headsets and the freedom from the wireless is very helpful 1 
the movie lacks visual interest drama expression of feeling and celebration of the very patriotism that underlines the narrative 0 
i received my orders well within the shipping timeframe everything was in good working order and overall i am very excited to have this source 1 
pricing is a bit of a concern at mellow mushroom 0 
victor mclaglen was even bad and brian donlevy was almost unrecognizable 0 
the worst phone from samsungcrap this crappy samsung e715 is the worst i have ever seeen 0 
doesnt work at all i bougth it for my l7c and its not working 0 
dont make the same mistake that i did and please dont buy this phone 0 
its a campy sort of film thats a joy to watch 1 
1 long lasting battery you dont have to recharge it as frequentyly as some of the flip phones2 0 
we literally sat there for 20 minutes with no one asking to take our order 0 
i really enjoyed eating here 1 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
2 thumbs up 1 
nine out of ten for a truly lovely film 1 
i kept catching the cable on the seat and i had to pull the phone out to turn it on an off 0 
the service was terrible food was mediocre 0 
the cg opening sequence in space looked like it could have been created on microsoft slideshow for gods sake 0 
worthwhile 1 
he was very impressed when going from the original battery to the extended battery 1 
hes a national treasure 1 
filmiing was less expansive 0 
actually the graphics were good at the time 1 
the story starts too fast with absolutely no suspense or buildup in the slightest 0 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
ill give this film 10 out of 10 1 
i swung in to give them a try but was deeply disappointed 0 
in fact im going to round up to 4 stars just because she was so awesome 1 
i was left shattered from the experience of watching this film and i took a good two hours to fully recover 0 
you have to hold the phone at a particular angle for the other party to hear you clearly 0 
instead we got a bore fest about a whiny spoiled brat babysitting 0 
i exchanged the sony ericson z500a for this and im pretty happy with that decision 1 
save your money ive had this item for 11 months now 0 
sweetest phone 1 
if there were zero stars i would give it zero stars 0 
the tracfonewebsite is user friendly and makes it easy toactivate etc 1 
this product is clearly not ready for prime time i dont care how cool it looks if you cant tell a call is coming in its worthless 0 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
so good i am going to have to review this place twice once hereas a tribute to the place and once as a tribute to an event held here last night 1 
it kept getting worse and worse so now im officially done 0 
cant upload ringtones from a third party 0 
it has everything i need and i couldnt ask for more 1 
but kevin spacey is an excellent verbal tsunami as buddy ackerman  and totally believable because he is a great actor 1 
steamboat willie is an amazingly important film to our cinema history 1 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
a piece of cinematic garbage captured on celluloid 0 
definitely not worth the 3 i paid 0 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
phone now holds charge like it did when it was new 1 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
the film has great actors a master director a significant themeat least a wouldbe significant theme undertone of fifties existential worldweariness aerial scenes that ought to have thrilled both senses and imagination and characters about which one might deeply care 1 
i will not return 0 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
the biggest complaint i have is the battery drains superfast 0 
i loved it 1 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
the plot doesnt hang together at all and the acting is absolutely appalling 0 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
totally believable 1 
you never know if you pushed it hard enough or the right number of times for the function you want or not 0 
very friendly staff 1 
everything about this movie is stupid 0 
unless youre just out to visually collect all extant films of austens work you can skip this one 0 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
i cant use this case because the smell is disgusting 0 
favorite place in town for shawarrrrrrma 1 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
i have recommended it to friends 1 
i work in the hospitality industry in paradise valley and have refrained from recommending cibo any longer 0 
blue ant is easy to use 1 
duris has a wholesome appearance and gives a fine performance 1 
there are many continuity errors one other user commented on different cars in the garage joes glassesthe one that got to me the most was the fact joes facial hair configuration seemed to change from scene to scene 0 
the flair bartenders are absolutely amazing 1 
great place to eat reminds me of the little mom and pop shops in the san francisco bay area 1 
instead we got a bore fest about a whiny spoiled brat babysitting 0 
disappointing experience 0 
yes this film does require a rather significant amount of puzzlesolving but the pieces fit together to create a beautiful picture 1 
i dont have to be an accountant to know im getting screwed 0 
highly recommended for all ages although the younger set will probably not appreciate some of the more subtle references they will certainly appreciate one galley scene in particular 1 
save your money ive had this item for 11 months now 0 
the movie seemed a little slow at first 0 
the manager was the worst 0 
strike 2 who wants to be rushed 0 
i tried talking real loud but shouting on the telephone gets old and i was still told it wasnt great 0 
not good when wearing a hat or sunglasses 0 
too bad you have to pay up to a month for the service 0 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
to those who find this movie intelligent or even masterful i can only say its your intelligence and your imagination you obviously used to try and make some sense of this pitiful attempt its in our human nature to try and make sense of things 0 
what on earth is irons doing in this film 0 
restored my phone to like new performance 1 
verizon tech support walked my through a few procedures none of which worked and i ended up having to do a hard reset wiping out all my data 0 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
i love the scream movies and all horror movies and this one ranks way up there 1 
i guess maybe we went on an off night but it was disgraceful 0 
after one bite i was hooked 1 
phenomenal food service and ambiance 1 
excellent product for the price 1 
the bt headset was such a disapoinment 0 
at any rate this film stinks its not funny and fulci should have stayed with giallo and supernatural zombie movies 0 
it was packed 0 
otherwise dont even waste your time on this 0 
this is a bad film with bad writing and good actorsan ugly cartoon crafted by paul haggis for people who cant handle anything but the bold strokes in storytellinga picture painted with crayons 0 
we also ordered the spinach and avocado salad the ingredients were sad and the dressing literally had zero taste 0 
i love the pho and the spring rolls oh so yummy you have to try 1 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
i have two more years left in this contract and i hate this phone 0 
in other words the content level of this film is enough to easily fill a dozen other films 1 
the food was outstanding and the prices were very reasonable 1 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
the calls drop the phone comes on and off at will the screen goes black and the worst of all it stops ringing intermittently 0 
there are many continuity errors one other user commented on different cars in the garage joes glassesthe one that got to me the most was the fact joes facial hair configuration seemed to change from scene to scene 0 
the volume for the ringer is real good you have choices how loud 1 
avoid this one if you can 0 
excellent service 1 
there is nothing privileged about workingeating there 0 
four stars for the food the guy in the blue shirt for his great vibe still letting us in to eat 1 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
i have had problems wit hit dropping signal and more 0 
it was packed 0 
but the duet between the astronaut and his doctor at the beginning of the movie is a perfect exchange if one considers that this movie was made well into the cold war and the astronauts biggest fear is that he has crashed in the ussr 1 
the owner used to work at nobu so this place is really similar for half the price 1 
i have had problems wit hit dropping signal and more 0 
now the burgers arent as good the pizza which used to be amazing is doughy and flavorless 0 
regardless the film fails on most levels 0 
the sound is clear and the people i talk to on it are amazed at the quality too 1 
comes with a strong light that you can use to light up your camera shots and even flash sos signals seriously 1 
dont buy this product 0 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
ill give this film 10 out of 10 1 
made very sturdy 1 
food is way overpriced and portions are fucking small 0 
i had a seriously solid breakfast here 1 
then the film just dropped the ball 0 
all this movie does is make you sick watching all these slackers make excuses for their stupid actions for 90 minutes 0 
the owners are super friendly and the staff is courteous 1 
extremely tasty 1 
i cant wait to go back 1 
very easy to use 1 
it isnt even an achievement as a sobaditsgood or sobaditsmemorable movie 0 
we also ordered the spinach and avocado salad the ingredients were sad and the dressing literally had zero taste 0 
lately they have been extremely nice and helpful on the phone 1 
ive missed numerous calls because of this reason 0 
very easy to use 1 
w810i is just superb 1 
in the span of an hour i had two people exclaim whoa is that the new phone on tv 1 
alexander nevsky is a great film 1 
those phones are working just fine now 1 
kris kristoffersen is good in this movie and really makes a difference 1 
which has more depth and character than the man underneath it 0 
very convenient since we were staying at the mgm 1 
i have seen many movies starring jaclyn smith but my god this was one of her best though it came out 12 years ago 1 
be sure to order dessert even if you need to pack it togo the tiramisu and cannoli are both to die for 1 
this was one of the worst films i have ever seen 0 
the point is the journey a journey that touches every member of the family 1 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
a lot of websites have been rating this a very good phone and so do i 1 
omit watching this 0 
still waiting im sure this item would work well if i ever recieve it 0 
my sister has one also and she loves it 1 
i love this place 1 
i give wirefly 1 stari will contact cingularatt and inform them of this practice 0 
great phone 1 
very good food great atmosphere1 1 
but when i check voice mail at night the keypad backlight turns off a few seconds into the first message and then im lost 0 
not good for the money 0 
the chefs were friendly and did a good job 1 
it was equally awful 0 
however after seeing the short again after about 25 years i was amazed at how timeless the film actually is 1 
definitely will come back here again 1 
thanks good a movie like this was done and released 1 
i would recommend it 1 
the film has an ultracheap look to it 0 
punishment park is a brilliant piece of cinema 1 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
i really recommend this faceplates since it looks very nice elegant and cool 1 
spend your money and time some place else 0 
the entire audience applauded at the conclusion of the film 1 
seller shipped quickly and much cheaper than the competitors 1 
but other than that the movie seemed to drag and the heroes didnt really work for their freedom 0 
its welldesigned and very sharp the blue is a very nice color 1 
just reading on the specs alone makes you say wow 1 
i had the mac salad and it was pretty bland so i will not be getting that again 0 
tried to go here for lunch and it was a madhouse 0 
one nice thing was that they added gratuity on the bill since our party was larger than 6 or 8 and they didnt expect more tip than that 1 
sprint charges for this service 0 
do not make the same mistake as me 0 
the ear buds only play music in one ear 0 
its a sad movie but very good 1 
it holds a charge for a long time is reasonably comfortable under longwearing conditions and the quality of sound is tremendous 1 
delicious nyc bagels good selections of cream cheese real lox with capers even 1 
if you are looking for a good quality motorola headset keep looking this isnt it 0 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in 0 
but the duet between the astronaut and his doctor at the beginning of the movie is a perfect exchange if one considers that this movie was made well into the cold war and the astronauts biggest fear is that he has crashed in the ussr 1 
good case excellent value 1 
this greedy corporation will never see another dime from me 0 
i did not expect this to be so good 1 
macbeth jason connery moved me to tears with his final monolog out brief candle outhe gave the sphere of moral decay and dark forces a human face which makes it the more interesting 1 
the server was very negligent of our needs and made us feel very unwelcome i would not suggest this place 0 
the entire audience applauded at the conclusion of the film 1 
horrible horrible protector 0 
however after finally watching this film i realized that not only had i had a closed mind to the brilliance it depicts i also found myself watching it over and over again 1 
however this didnt make up for the fact that overall this was a tremendously boring movie 0 
i probably wont be coming back here 0 
i came back today since they relocated and still not impressed 0 
i also didnt like the on button it felt like it would crack with use 0 
nice design and quality 1 
i live in the neighborhood so i am disappointed i wont be back here because it is a convenient location 0 
so anyone near you will hear part of your conversation 0 
a very good film indeed about great and unconditional love 1 
i had verizon 2 years ago and really liked their service 1 
i have yet to run this new battery below two bars and thats three days without charging 1 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
damn good steak 1 
bt50 battery junk 0 
i have to use the smallest earpieces provided but it stays on pretty well 1 
and sometimes it was so embarrassing that i had to look away 0 
both of the egg rolls were fantastic 1 
i thought it was bad 0 
excellent sound battery life and inconspicuous to boot 1 
i have had tmobile service for 2 or 3 years now and i am pretty happy with it 1 
both films are terrible but to the credit of the 1986 version it was watchable 0 
by this time our side of the restaurant was almost empty so there was no excuse 0 
the phone was unusable and was not new 0 
i ordered this for sony ericsson w810i but i think it only worked once thats when i first used it 0 
this hole in the wall has great mexican street tacos and friendly staff 1 
of all the dishes the salmon was the best but all were great 1 
the acting by the whole cast could be put on a scale and balanced perfectly between overacting and underacting 0 
now the burgers arent as good the pizza which used to be amazing is doughy and flavorless 0 
i do think tom hanks is a good actor 1 
the volume for the ringer is real good you have choices how loud 1 
when it opens the battery connection is broken and the device is turned off 0 
extremely tasty 1 
the 12 mega pixel camera being a part of a phone is reasonably good7 1 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
the budget was evidently very limited 0 
this movie creates its own universe and is fascinating in every way 1 
it ranks highly as a great noircrimedrama incredible performances by belmondo and lino ventura 1 
poor quality 0 
bad fit way too big 0 
1 hour 54 minutes of sheer tedium melodrama and horrible acting a mess of a script and a sinking feeling of good lord what were they thinking 0 
the potatoes were like rubber and you could tell they had been made up ahead of time being kept under a warmer 0 
save your money ive had this item for 11 months now 0 
good price 1 
horrible phone 0 
the movie lacks visual interest drama expression of feeling and celebration of the very patriotism that underlines the narrative 0 
i guess maybe we went on an off night but it was disgraceful 0 
i know that sounds funny but to me it seemed like sketchy technology that wouldnt work wellwell this one works great 1 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
highquality chicken on the chicken caesar salad 1 
perfect for the ps3 1 
it was so cool 1 
i have had this phone for over a year now and i will tell you its not that great 0 
and the sound quality is great 1 
the ambiance isnt much better 0 
all the actors give a wonderful performance especially jennifer rubin as jamie harris who changes from the nervous starlet in the beginning through the strange events she is part of to the cool star 1 
the atmosphere is modern and hip while maintaining a touch of coziness 1 
the only thing really worth watching was the scenery and the house because it is beautiful 1 
and if that isnt enough of a mess of a movie for you the picture is also marred with a constant use of studio sets and indoor exteriors 0 
the cast of veteran actors are more than just a nostalgia trip 1 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
i would highly recommend this 1 
warning do not buy 0 
his use of the colours of the french flag in the three films was nothing short of incredible every shot every scene was like a work of art 1 
even if you love bad movies do not watch this movie 0 
a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it 1 
i can think of no other film where something vitally important occurs every other minute 1 
the burrittos blah 0 
give this one a look 1 
just dont know why they were so slow 0 
do not purchase this phone 0 
spend your money and time some place else 0 
how can you call yourself a steakhouse if you cant properly cook a steak i dont understand 0 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
about ten minutes into this film i started having second thoughts 0 
the characters are interesting and you really care for them 1 
the jamaican mojitos are delicious 1 
im pleased 1 
an instant classic with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits 1 
it deserves strong love 1 
this place is not worth your time let alone vegas 0 
the directing seems too pretentious 0 
i would not recommend this place 0 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
youd have to have the iq of particularly stupid mollusk not to see that one coming 0 
verizon tech support walked my through a few procedures none of which worked and i ended up having to do a hard reset wiping out all my data 0 
the result is a powerhouse achievement made more timely now perhaps because of our cultures disturbing fascination with celebrity and its distorted interpretations of fame 1 
the chicken wings contained the driest chicken meat i have ever eaten 0 
very good lunch spot 1 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
very disappointing 0 
ive only had my bluetooth for a few weeks but i really like it 1 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
works as described 1 
the show would begin with smart ass ed comments to each other that would be totally off the wall and uncalled for 0 
one of the worst shows of all time 0 
i dont recommend unless your car breaks down in front of it and you are starving 0 
bluetooth range is good a few days ago i left my phone in the trunk got a call and carried the conversation without a hitch 1 
integrated seamlessly with the motorola razr phone 1 
its a fresh subtle and rather sublime effect 1 
its been my choice headset for yearsgreat sound good volume good noise cancellation 1 
yet i enjoy watching it 1 
his performance is simply genius 1 
battery life is real good 1 
perabo has a nice energy level and is obviously very comfortable in front of a camera 1 
the waiter wasnt helpful or friendly and rarely checked on us 0 
it did not work in my cell phone plug i am very up set with the charger 0 
after a year the battery went completely dead on my headset 0 
this place is like chipotle but better 1 
the chicken wings contained the driest chicken meat i have ever eaten 0 
great choice 1 
i cannot make calls at certain places 0 
not recommended 0 
ill give this film 10 out of 10 1 
trumbull on i love lucy 1 
every time he opened his mouth you expect to hear you see kids pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show 0 
this is an extraordinary film 1 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
for the price this was a great deal 1 
the warm beer didnt help 0 
this is a great deal 1 
the chips that came out were dripping with grease and mostly not edible 0 
ill even say it again  this is torture 0 
good prices 1 
what a mistake that was 0 
the mic is great 1 
i had verizon 2 years ago and really liked their service 1 
both actors truly understand and become their particular character delivering a convincing sincere performance 1 
do not waste your money here 0 
we waited an hour for what was a breakfast i could have done 100 times better at home 0 
worthwhile 1 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
portable and it works 1 
ill definitely be in soon again 1 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
ray charles is legendary 1 
one of the worst shows of all time 0 
but it does get better reception and clarity than any phone ive had before 1 
the stories were as unbelievable as the actors 0 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
cant upload ringtones from a third party 0 
item does not match picture 0 
my sashimi was poor quality being soggy and tasteless 0 
the films dialogue is natural real to life 1 
my friend loved the salmon tartar 1 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
but the movie makes a lot of serious mistakes 0 
service is quick and friendly 1 
they have horrible attitudes towards customers and talk down to each one when customers dont enjoy their food 0 
the attractive set used throughout most of the film is an eyepleasing gem 1 
i have two more years left in this contract and i hate this phone 0 
everything stinks 0 
i bought two of them and neither will charge 0 
also its slim enough to fit into my alarm clock docking station without removing the case 1 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
just as good as when i had it more than a year ago 1 
i still maintain that monkeys shouldnt make headphones we just obviously dont share enough dna to copy the design over to humans 0 
iam very pleased with my purchase 1
