worse theres an incredibly weak subplot thrown in that follows a little band of latterday mansonites as they go after a reporter whos working on a story on the anniversary of the killings 0 
very disappointing 0 
the movie has almost no action scenes in it and very little comedy 0 
fantastic food 1 
i have been in more than a few bars in vegas and do not ever recall being charged for tap water 0 
its a total package 1 
product was excellent and works better than the verizon one and boy was it cheaper 1 
it was just not a fun experience 1 
my mother and brother had to do thiswhen i saw robert ryan portraying this type of man it was a very good imitation of this type of individual and i was impressed 1 
how can anyone in their right mind ask for anything more from a movie than this 1 
so absolutley fantastic 1 
seafood was limited to boiled shrimp and crab legs but the crab legs definitely did not taste fresh 0 
im really disappointed all i have now is a charger that doesnt work 0 
worst foodservice ive had in a while 0 
also the area where my unit broke im not too fond of the magnetic strap 0 
in the summer you can dine in a charming outdoor patio so very delightful 1 
it is very educational for children 1 to 8 years old 1 
i have been to very few places to eat that under no circumstances would i ever return to and this tops the list 0 
the phone was unusable and was not new 0 
this results in the phone being either stuck at max volume or mute 0 
i dont think well be going back anytime soon 0 
the problem was the script 0 
this is one of the worst sandra bullock movie since speed 2 but not quite that bad 0 
weve tried to like this place but after 10 times i think were done with them 0 
it was pretty gross 0 
its a fresh subtle and rather sublime effect 1 
the chips and salsa were really good the salsa was very fresh 1 
it is not good 0 
2 thumbs up to this seller 1 
it is perfect for a sitdown family meal or get together with a few friends 1 
i immediately said i wanted to talk to the manager but i did not want to talk to the guy who was doing shots of fireball behind the bar 0 
jabra ear gels r the best 1 
then i exchanged for the same phone even that had the same problem 0 
the phone gets extremely hot 0 
hell no will i go back 0 
insults profound deuchebaggery and had to go outside for a smoke break while serving just to solidify it 0 
at around 4 pm i bought it at around 8pm i started to watch at around 815pm i fast forwarded the remaining film to see if there was anything left watchable for a human being with a brain but there wasnt 0 
the cg opening sequence in space looked like it could have been created on microsoft slideshow for gods sake 0 
it isnt even an achievement as a sobaditsgood or sobaditsmemorable movie 0 
the film has an ultracheap look to it 0 
best headset ever 1 
otherwise dont even waste your time on this 0 
each day of the week they have a different deal and its all so delicious 1 
hot dishes are not hot cold dishes are close to room tempi watched staff prepare food with bare hands no gloveseverything is deep fried in oil 0 
we literally sat there for 20 minutes with no one asking to take our order 0 
this phone is slim and light and the display is beautiful 1 
after arguing with verizon regarding the dropped calls we returned the phones after two days 0 
it was a waste of my money 0 
i wouldnt return 0 
dont waste your time watching this rubbish nonresearched film 0 
great product for the price 1 
its pretty easy 1 
buyerbe very careful 0 
i dont think well be going back anytime soon 0 
it is so small and you dont even realize that it is there after a while of getting used to it 1 
the attention given to every character and complex psychological portrayals detailing loyalty treachery love and hope are tremendous 1 
i am very impressed with the job that motorola did on the sturdiness of this phone 1 
your brain will attempt to shutdown as part of a primal impulse of selfpreservation 0 
i felt as though her going to ireland did absolutely nothing whatsoever 0 
the shrimp tender and moist 1 
the best example of how dumb the writing is when its established that you can turn the zombiestudents back into humans by removing a necklace containing a piece of the meteorite 0 
it is the best charger i have seen on the market yet 1 
this product is clearly not ready for prime time i dont care how cool it looks if you cant tell a call is coming in its worthless 0 
the atmosphere was great with a lovely duo of violinists playing songs we requested 1 
avoid at all costs 0 
i love this thing 1 
i tried talking real loud but shouting on the telephone gets old and i was still told it wasnt great 0 
very unreliable service from tmobile 0 
this is a beautiful phone 1 
the plot well i said id let that one go 0 
the only place good for this film is in the garbage 0 
howeverthe riingtones are not the best and neither are the games 0 
it was equally awful 0 
i had high hopes for this place since the burgers are cooked over a charcoal grill but unfortunately the taste fell flat way flat 0 
best of luck to the rude and noncustomer service focused new management 0 
the sound is clear and the people i talk to on it are amazed at the quality too 1 
for readers who have already seen one of miyazakis films he is still in top form and made another worthwhile experience 1 
this is an excellent film 1 
they dropped more than the ball 0 
small sleek impressive looking practical setup with ample storage in place 1 
i would recommend it 1 
att is not clear sound is very distorted and you have to yell when you talk 0 
not impressed 0 
i give it 2 thumbs down 0 
verizon tech support walked my through a few procedures none of which worked and i ended up having to do a hard reset wiping out all my data 0 
hitchcock is a great director 1 
my friend did not like his bloody mary 0 
i go to far too many places and ive never seen any restaurant that serves a 1 egg breakfast especially for 400 0 
i believe the screenwriter did a good job of tying up the loose ends 1 
its a campy sort of film thats a joy to watch 1 
im surprised this is a good quality car charger and theres not much reviews about it 1 
that said our mouths and bellies were still quite pleased 1 
the phone gets extremely hot 0 
its also great to see that renowned silent screenwriter frances marion hasnt missed a step going from silent to sound 1 
an excellent new restaurant by an experienced frenchman 1 
i can take a little bad service but the food sucks 0 
i love this bluetooth 1 
this place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver 0 
putting the race card aside lets look at the major flaw in the film they destroy latifas character 0 
food was average at best 0 
none of them are engaging or exciting 0 
does not work 0 
if good intentions made a film great then this film might be one of the greatest films ever made 1 
my only problem is i thought the actor playing the villain was a low rent michael ironside 0 
the staff is friendly and the joint is always clean 1 
by the time the film ended i not only disliked it i despised it 0 
after watching this film i wanted to learn more about the works of this artist 1 
the service was terrible food was mediocre 0 
the camera although rated at an impressive 13 megapixels renders images that fall well below expectations of such a relatively high resolution 0 
it was absolutely amazing 1 
the design is very odd as the ear clip is not very comfortable at all 0 
the soundtrack wasnt terrible either 1 
i was very disappointed 0 
if you simply want a small flip phone look elsewhere as the extra bells whistles are mediocre 0 
perfect for the ps3 1 
doesnt hold charge 0 
this may be the only bad film he ever made 0 
i connected my wifes bluetoothmotorola hs850 to my phone and it worked like a charm whether the phone was in my pocket or the case 1 
poor talk time performance 0 
my sashimi was poor quality being soggy and tasteless 0 
worked perfectly 1 
i recommend this for everyone who loves film movies anythinga work of art 1 
it is zillion times away from reality 0 
this is was due to the fact that it took 20 minutes to be acknowledged then another 35 minutes to get our foodand they kept forgetting things 0 
the film is way too long 0 
there is nothing authentic about this place 0 
this case has passed the one year mark and while it shows signs of wear it is 100 functional 1 
the battery is unreliable as well as the service use antena 0 
anyways the food was definitely not filling at all and for the price you pay you should expect more 0 
it worked very well 1 
good protection and does not make phone too bulky 1 
strike 2 who wants to be rushed 0 
we made the drive all the way from north scottsdale and i was not one bit disappointed 1 
my fella got the huevos rancheros and they didnt look too appealing 0 
as i said abovepretty useless 0 
the buttons for on and off are bad 0 
the only suspense i was feeling was the frustration at just how retarded the girls were 0 
the story itself is just predictable and lazy 0 
good protection and does not make phone too bulky 1 
all in all i give this one a resounding 9 out of 10 1 
echo problemvery unsatisfactory 0 
it only recognizes the phone as its storage device 0 
unfortunately the ability to actually know you are receiving a call is a rather important feature and this phone is pitiful in that respect 0 
the scripting of the subtle comedy is unmatched by any movie in recent years 1 
i contacted the company and they told me that although the unit was still under warranty if i couldnt produce my receipt i was out of luck 0 
my husband said she was very rude did not even apologize for the bad food or anything 0 
there were several moments in the movie that just didnt need to be there and were excruciatingly slow moving 0 
they could serve it with just the vinaigrette and it may make for a better overall dish but it was still very good 1 
very cheap plastic creaks like an old wooden floor 0 
extremely tasty 1 
and his subtle connections between the three films are awesome 1 
its a case of so bad it is laughable 0 
the refried beans that came with my meal were dried out and crusty and the food was bland 0 
at first i thought i was grtting a good deal at 744 until i plugged it into my phone v3c razr 0 
the film succeeds despite or perhaps because of an obviously meagre budget 1 
i felt asleep the first time i watched it so i can recommend it for insomniacs 0 
i guess maybe we went on an off night but it was disgraceful 0 
food was below average 0 
this phone might well be the worst ive ever had in any brand 0 
i was very disappointed in the movie 0 
i dont think it would hold it too securly on your belt 0 
i know that sounds funny but to me it seemed like sketchy technology that wouldnt work wellwell this one works great 1 
the food is rich so order accordingly 1 
you cant beat that 1 
a very very very slowmoving aimless movie about a distressed drifting young man 0 
i advise you to look out for it 1 
wed definitely go back here again 1 
i contacted the company and they told me that although the unit was still under warranty if i couldnt produce my receipt i was out of luck 0 
terrible management 0 
adapter does not provide enough charging current 0 
to sum the film up breeders is a terrible cheaply made horror movie that should be avoided like the ebola virus 0 
the plot such as it is is so derivative and predictable that the ending is like a mercy killing 0 
the desserts were a bit strange 0 
its pretty surprising that this wonderful film was made in 1949 as hollywood generally had its collective heads in the sand concerning black and white issues at that time 1 
he came running after us when he realized my husband had left his sunglasses on the table 1 
however this didnt make up for the fact that overall this was a tremendously boring movie 0 
none of them are engaging or exciting 0 
the sangria was about half of a glass wine full and was 12 ridiculous 0 
would recommend this item 1 
alexander nevsky is a great film 1 
in fact this stinker smells like a directtovideo release 0 
i can barely ever hear on it and am constantly saying what 0 
this greedy corporation will never see another dime from me 0 
itll be a regular stop on my trips to phoenix 1 
it felt too light and tinny 0 
highly entertaining at all angles 1 
best ive found so far ive tried 2 other bluetooths and this one has the best quality for both me and the listener as well as ease of using 1 
i give it 2 thumbs down 0 
not sure who was more lost the flat characters or the audience nearly half of whom walked out 0 
this is a bad film with bad writing and good actorsan ugly cartoon crafted by paul haggis for people who cant handle anything but the bold strokes in storytellinga picture painted with crayons 0 
then i had to continue pairing it periodically since it somehow kept dropping 0 
we literally sat there for 20 minutes with no one asking to take our order 0 
do not waste your time 0 
i loved it it was really scary 1 
very dissapointing performance 0 
highquality chicken on the chicken caesar salad 1 
disappointed 0 
kids pizza is always a hit too with lots of great side dish options for the kiddos 1 
when im on this side of town this will definitely be a spot ill hit up again 1 
over rated 0 
this is a great place to eat 1 
other than that the leather is nice and soft the fit is very tight the cut out for the face is a good shape 1 
fantastic buy and will get again for whatever my next phone is 1 
this is a disgrace 0 
everything about it is fine and reasonable for the price ie 1 
seriously its not worth wasting your or your kids time on 0 
this really is how vegas fine dining used to be right down to the menus handed to the ladies that have no prices listed 1 
not as good as i had hoped 0 
special thanks to dylan t for the recommendation on what to order all yummy for my tummy 1 
the potato chip order was sad i could probably count how many chips were in that box and it was probably around 12 0 
i did not expect this to be so good 1 
the cinematography is simply stunning to say the least and the fx are nothing if not stateoftheart 1 
avoid avoid avoid 0 
by far the best cheesecurds we have ever had 1 
yeah the movie pretty much sucked 0 
the restaurant atmosphere was exquisite 1 
i am also very happy with the price 1 
the sound quality is excellent as well 1 
an instant classic with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits 1 
this one works and was priced right 1 
the only possible way this movie could be redeemed would be as mst3k fodder 0 
a good quality bargain i bought this after i bought a cheapy from big lots that sounded awful and people on the other end couldnt hear me 1 
well never go again 0 
the attention given to every character and complex psychological portrayals detailing loyalty treachery love and hope are tremendous 1 
its pure brilliance 1 
this is one of the best italian thrillers of the early 70s 1 
same problem as others have mentioned 0 
very tough and very short on flavor 0 
and the beans and rice were mediocre at best 0 
it will drive you barking mad 0 
no one at the table thought the food was above average or worth the wait that we had for it 0 
it is not good 0 
it was either too cold not enough flavor or just bad 0 
its welldesigned and very sharp the blue is a very nice color 1 
for a product that costs as much as this one does i expect it to work far better and with greater ease than this thing does 0 
i am glad i purchased it 1 
i bought this to use with my kindle fire and absolutely loved it 1 
very disappointing 0 
appetite instantly gone 0 
there is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again 0 
very very disappointed ordered the 35 big bay plater 0 
left very frustrated 0 
these are certainly very comfortable and functionality is decent 1 
definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly will return next time im in vegas 1 
nice headset priced right 1 
id say that would be the hardest decision honestly all of ms dishes taste how they are supposed to taste amazing 1 
i love the ownerchef his one authentic japanese cool dude 1 
it is an hour and half waste of time following a bunch of very pretty high schoolers whine and cry about life 0 
a film not easily forgotten 1 
made very sturdy 1 
warning stay away 0 
it was either too cold not enough flavor or just bad 0 
your brain will attempt to shutdown as part of a primal impulse of selfpreservation 0 
a week later after i activated it it suddenly died 0 
the service was a little slow considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace 0 
i dont each much pasta but i love the homemade hand made pastas and thin pizzas here 1 
tried to go here for lunch and it was a madhouse 0 
the veggitarian platter is out of this world 1 
it is very educational for children 1 to 8 years old 1 
great price also 1 
just whatever you do avoid groove as its the antithesis of all that is good about human traffic 0 
avoid at all costs 0 
no additional ear gels provided and no instructions whatsoever 0 
my friend loved the salmon tartar 1 
the camera on the phone may be used as a dustpan when indoors id rather be using a disposable then this 0 
and those baby owls were adorable 1 
hot dishes are not hot cold dishes are close to room tempi watched staff prepare food with bare hands no gloveseverything is deep fried in oil 0 
seems like a good quick place to grab a bite of some familiar pub food but do yourself a favor and look elsewhere 0 
its reception is very very poor 0 
top line dont waste your time and money on this one its as bad as it comes 0 
it has a great camera thats 2mp and the pics are nice and clear with great picture quality 1 
horrible dont waste your time and money 0 
this is definitely one of the better documentaries i have seen looking at family relationships and marriage 1 
the service was a little slow considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace 0 
would not recommend to others 0 
i guess it was supposed to be clever twist then shed some light on the situation but it was just stupid 0 
i recently had problems where i could not stay connected for more than 10 minutes before being disconnected 0 
returned 8 hours later 0 
this is a beautiful phone 1 
a great touch 1 
in conclusion i will not bother with this movie because a volcano in los angeles is nothing but nonsense 0 
the only consistent thread holding the series together were the amazing performances of leni parker and anita laselva as the two taelons in quiet idealogical conflict 0 
i think the most wonderful parts literally full of wonder are the excerpts from his works 1 
there were several moments in the movie that just didnt need to be there and were excruciatingly slow moving 0 
i ate there twice on my last visit and especially enjoyed the salmon salad 1 
the phone takes forever to charge like 2 to 5 hours literally 0 
service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is vegas and located inside the crystals shopping mall by aria 1 
dont waste your money 0 
their daily specials are always a hit with my group 1 
great earpiece 1 
this place should honestly be blown up 0 
the acting was bad 0 
the acting is terrible and the writing is worse 0 
it makes very strange ticking noises before it ends the call 0 
excellent performance 1 
the bose noise cancelling is amazing which is very important for a nyc commuter 1 
the burger i got the gold standard a 17 burger and was kind of disappointed 0 
this case seems well made 1 
imdb ratings only go as low 1 for awful its time to get some negative numbers in there for cases such as these 0 
i like steiners because its dark and it feels like a bar 1 
the potatoes were like rubber and you could tell they had been made up ahead of time being kept under a warmer 0 
if you want a sandwich just go to any firehouse 1 
just reading on the specs alone makes you say wow 1 
adapter does not provide enough charging current 0 
superb phone on a great network 1 
this particular model would not work with my motorola q smartphone 0 
overall i like this place a lot 1 
his performance as awarded was stunning 1 
my ribeye steak was cooked perfectly and had great mesquite flavor 1 
the good cinematography also makes her and monica bellucci look very beautiful 1 
there is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again 0 
he was very impressed when going from the original battery to the extended battery 1 
this little device has transformed my organizational capability and made my life a whole lot easier 1 
not sure who was more lost the flat characters or the audience nearly half of whom walked out 0 
i cant believe theres even a sequel to this 0 
as always the evening was wonderful and the food delicious 1 
good beer drink selection and good food selection 1 
it holds a charge for a long time is reasonably comfortable under longwearing conditions and the quality of sound is tremendous 1 
bt50 battery junk 0 
my experience was terrible this was my fourth bluetooth headset and while it was much more comfortable than my last jabra which i hated 0 
so they performed 1 
while you dont yet hear mickey speak there are tons of sound effects and music throughout the filmsomething we take for granted now but which was a huge crowd pleaser in 1928 1 
i have only had it for a few weeks but so far so good 1 
the most annoying thing about cover girl is the way in which rita hayworth is put up on a pedestal 0 
audio quality is poor very poor 0 
steamboat willie is an amazingly important film to our cinema history 1 
uncomfortable in the ear dont use with lg vx9900 env 0 
really good product 1 
horrible had to switch 3 times 0 
you get extra minutes so that you can carry out the call and not get cut off 1 
the instruction manual is lacking 0 
the owners really really need to quit being soooooo cheap let them wrap my freaking sandwich in two papers not one 0 
i dont know what kind it is but they have the best iced tea 1 
tonight i had the elk filet specialand it sucked 0 
awful service 0 
the design is very good4 1 
great hands free device 1 
very easy to use 1 
i had to go to a store and bought a new nokia phone which is working great 1 
i could not stand to even watch it for very long for fear of losing iq 0 
great product 1 
again lame 0 
i came over from verizon because cingulair has nicer cell phones the first thing i noticed was the really bad service 0 
this scene is very strong and unpleasant 0 
it defeats the purpose of a bluetooth headset 0 
i received it quickly and it works great 1 
excellent hands free tool 1 
the plot was the same as pretty much every other cheap horror 0 
battery lasts only a few hours 0 
this was one of the worst films i have ever seen 0 
great food and awesome service 1 
the ambiance was incredible 1 
this place is not quality sushi it is not a quality restaurant 0 
and the accents are absolutely abysmal 0 
i have had tmobile service for 2 or 3 years now and i am pretty happy with it 1 
spoilers whatever else can or cant be said about it surface is superbly crafted 1 
its very slow 0 
really good product 1 
the plantains were the worst ive ever tasted 0 
very unreliable service from tmobile 0 
dont buy this product 0 
there are many continuity errors one other user commented on different cars in the garage joes glassesthe one that got to me the most was the fact joes facial hair configuration seemed to change from scene to scene 0 
just reading on the specs alone makes you say wow 1 
your servers suck wait correction our server heimer sucked 0 
worst customer service ever 0 
just what i wanted 1 
well im satisfied 1 
very good quality though 1 
the waiter wasnt helpful or friendly and rarely checked on us 0 
design flaw 0 
then i exchanged for the same phone even that had the same problem 0 
nothing special 0 
i felt insulted and disrespected how could you talk and judge another human being like that 0 
i dont think ive ever gone to a movie and disliked it as much 0 
frozen pucks of disgust with some of the worst people behind the register 0 
i highly recommend this modest priced cellular phone 1 
this blueant supertooth handsfree phone speaker is awesome 1 
so good i am going to have to review this place twice once hereas a tribute to the place and once as a tribute to an event held here last night 1 
im still infatuated with this phone 1 
would not go back 0 
this item worked great but it broke after 6 months of use 0 
we have tried 2 units and they both failed within 2 months pros 0 
the only place good for this film is in the garbage 0 
the burger had absolutely no flavor the meat itself was totally bland the burger was overcooked and there was no charcoal flavor 0 
worst thai ever 0 
the films dialogue is natural real to life 1 
i find wasting food to be despicable but this just wasnt food 0 
what happened next was prettyoff putting 0 
the food was outstanding and the prices were very reasonable 1 
the acting as youd expect from this cast is top notch 1 
good item low price 1 
highly entertaining at all angles 1 
i think that it is a must see older john wayne film 1 
made very sturdy 1 
the malta settings are as dry and as barren as the dialogue 0 
the design is very odd as the ear clip is not very comfortable at all 0 
im not eating here 0 
the battery is unreliable as well as the service use antena 0 
the black eyed peas and sweet potatoes unreal 1 
the food was terrible 0 
a fly was in my apple juice a fly 0 
food quality has been horrible 0 
it really is impressive that the place hasnt closed down 0 
it deserves strong love 1 
food quality has been horrible 0 
good show samsung 1 
the only thing really worth watching was the scenery and the house because it is beautiful 1 
wasted two hours 0 
audio quality is poor very poor 0 
you wont forget this movie 1 
disappointed with battery 0 
the story is lame not interesting and never really explains the sinister origins of the puppets 0 
so in a nutshell 1 the restaraunt smells like a combination of a dirty fish market and a sewer 0 
now this is a movie i really dislike 0 
good product good seller 1 
an interesting premise and billy drago is always good as a dangerous nutbag side note id love to see drago stephen mchattie and lance hendrikson in a flick together talk about raging cheekbones 1 
and the chef was generous with his time even came around twice so we can take pictures with him 1 
yes this film does require a rather significant amount of puzzlesolving but the pieces fit together to create a beautiful picture 1 
good prices 1 
anyways the food was definitely not filling at all and for the price you pay you should expect more 0 
great product fast shipping 1 
the songs were the best and the muppets were so hilarious 1 
very pleased with this headset 1 
we waited an hour for what was a breakfast i could have done 100 times better at home 0 
very disappointed 0 
low quality 0 
about ten minutes into this film i started having second thoughts 0 
to be honest with you this is unbelievable nonsense and very foolish 0 
saw the movie today and thought it was a good effort good messages for kids 1 
in an interesting part of town this place is amazing 1 
it presents a idyllic yet serious portrayal of the ups and downs of the characters lives 1 
bland and flavorless is a good way of describing the barely tepid meat 0 
as a sushi lover avoid this place by all means 0 
aside from its terrible lead this film has loads of other debits 0 
the only thing i did like was the prime rib and dessert section 1 
its the best headset i have used 1 
i still maintain that monkeys shouldnt make headphones we just obviously dont share enough dna to copy the design over to humans 0 
the scenes with the ohsomature neighbourgirl are a misplace 0 
i want to first say our server was great and we had perfect service 1 
regardless the film fails on most levels 0 
however i recently watched the whole thing again on dvd and i was completely struck by how extremely stupid the storyline was how it contained holes inconsistencies and frankly a whole lot of crap and how horrid the dancing was 0 
he cant act one of the least scary villains i have ever seen he cant write did he write this damn movie in his sleep 0 
if there is a wind it is completely useless 0 
very friendly staff 1 
it was attached to a gas station and that is rarely a good sign 0 
this is the first phone ive had that has been so cheaply made 0 
so i am here to warn youdo not rent this movie it is the dumbest thing you have never seen 0 
it was either too cold not enough flavor or just bad 0 
i have to jiggle the plug to get it to line up right to get decent volume 0 
im really disappointed all i have now is a charger that doesnt work 0 
the chicken i got was definitely reheated and was only ok the wedges were cold and soggy 0 
before i go in to why i gave a 1 star rating please know that this was my third time eating at bachi burger before writing a review 0 
the scenes are often funny and occasionally touching as the characters evaluate their lives and where they are going 1 
worked very well paired with a treo 700w and as a skype headset on my pc using a usb bluetooth transceiver 1 
it is just the sort of pap that is screened in the afternoon to punish the unemployed for not having jobs 0 
dont buy it 0 
horrible had to switch 3 times 0 
adapter does not provide enough charging current 0 
see both films if you can 1 
they made this case too small and is very difficult to install 0 
i never come again 0 
its kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly its embarrassing how childlike the company is 0 
it is an hour and half waste of time following a bunch of very pretty high schoolers whine and cry about life 0 
the characters are interesting even if a bit predictable 1 
reversible plug works great 1 
dont waste your money 0 
its hard not to fall headoverheels in love with that girl 1 
when im on this side of town this will definitely be a spot ill hit up again 1 
arrived quickly and much less expensive than others being sold 1 
to sum the film up breeders is a terrible cheaply made horror movie that should be avoided like the ebola virus 0 
for those that havent seen it dont waste your time 0 
saggy floppy piece of junk 0 
this movie is also revealing 1 
none of the new ones have ever quite worked properly 0 
the pizza selections are good 1 
i ordered the lemon raspberry ice cocktail which was also incredible 1 
1 long lasting battery you dont have to recharge it as frequentyly as some of the flip phones2 0 
im not really sure how joeys was voted best hot dog in the valley by readers of phoenix magazine 0 
with great sound effects and impressive special effects i cant recommend this movie enough 1 
i love the pho and the spring rolls oh so yummy you have to try 1 
he cant act one of the least scary villains i have ever seen he cant write did he write this damn movie in his sleep 0 
a very charming film with wonderful sentiment and heart 1 
i cant see how this movie can be an inspiration to anyone to come out or overcome fear and rejection 0 
the chicken wings contained the driest chicken meat i have ever eaten 0 
its just lame 0 
the sound quality is excellent as well 1 
the sound is clear and the people i talk to on it are amazed at the quality too 1 
they will customize your order any way youd like my usual is eggplant with green bean stir fry love it 1 
low quality 0 
if you havent choked in your own vomit by the end by all the cheap drama and worthless dialogue youve must have bored yourself to death with this waste of time 0 
this is essentially a communications tool that does not communicate 0 
blue ant is easy to use 1 
its a gloriously fun fast paced and fairly accurate portrayal of the night of a raver 1 
lastly the mozzarella sticks they were the best thing we ordered 1 
schrader has made a resume full of lousy amateurish films 0 
the food amazing 1 
i own 2 of these cases and would order another 1 
the ambiance isnt much better 0 
i guess i should have known that this place would suck because it is inside of the excalibur but i didnt use my common sense 0 
they really want to make your experience a good one 1 
horrible phone 0 
as many people complained i found this headsets microphone was very weak 0 
brilliance indeed 1 
this is a great product sure beats using your fingers 1 
the films dialogue is natural real to life 1 
the worst experience ever 0 
performed awful muffled tinny incoming sound and severe echo for those on the other end of the call 0 
enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film 1 
excellent dualpurpose headset 1 
my sanyo has survived dozens of drops on blacktop without ill effect 1 
a fly was in my apple juice a fly 0 
no plot whatsoever 0 
and it was boring 0 
i ate there twice on my last visit and especially enjoyed the salmon salad 1 
this totally unfunny movie is so over the top and pathetic and unrealistic that throughout the whole 90 minutes of utter torture i probably looked at my watch about 70000 times 0 
if you have several dozen or several hundred contacts then imagine the fun of sending each of them one by one 0 
it has kept up very well 1 
not much flavor to them and very poorly constructed 0 
this would not even be good as a made for tv flick 0 
headset works great was packaged nicely to avoid any damage 1 
from here on the widmark character turns unintentionally comical 0 
my wife had the lobster bisque soup which was lukewarm 0 
gave up trying to eat any of the crust teeth still sore 0 
overall the film is interesting and thoughtprovoking 1 
what a waste 0 
i did not expect this to be so good 1 
overall i rate this movie a 10 out of a 110 scale 1 
the telephone repair man was really funny and his reactions to the nuts and bitchy boss were truly genuine 1 
not recommended 0 
i loved their mussels cooked in this wine reduction the duck was tender and their potato dishes were delicious 1 
thanks again to amazon for having the things i need for a good price 1 
ill give this film 10 out of 10 1 
this is a bad film with bad writing and good actorsan ugly cartoon crafted by paul haggis for people who cant handle anything but the bold strokes in storytellinga picture painted with crayons 0 
i like armand assante my cable companys summary sounded interesting so i watched it twice already and probably will again 1 
w810i is just superb 1 
do not buy do not buyit sucks 0 
i have been to very few places to eat that under no circumstances would i ever return to and this tops the list 0 
the puppets look really cheesy not in a good way like in the puppet master 80s flicks 0 
an extensive menu provides lots of options for breakfast 1 
it was a good thing that the tickets only cost five dollars because i would be mad if id have paid 750 to see this crap 0 
someone shouldve invented this sooner 1 
i was shocked because no signs indicate cash only 0 
the management is rude 0 
i bought two of them and neither will charge 0 
horrible had to switch 3 times 0 
and the chef was generous with his time even came around twice so we can take pictures with him 1 
my drink was never empty and he made some really great menu suggestions 1 
the charger arrived within the promised timeframe but it did not work 0 
but if you liked movies like the matrix and better yet their sequels i think youll appreciate the thought provoking mindblowing experience this film will give you 1 
the death row scenes were entirely unmoving 0 
gets the job done 1 
internet is excrutiatingly slow 0 
bluetooth range is good a few days ago i left my phone in the trunk got a call and carried the conversation without a hitch 1 
almost all of the songs in cover girl are oldfashioned and not very tuneful 0 
worst customer service 0 
i like steiners because its dark and it feels like a bar 1 
absolutely great 1 
people couldnt hear me talk and i had to pull out the earphone and talk on the phone 0 
my wife had the lobster bisque soup which was lukewarm 0 
the cast is good 1 
not too screamy not to masculine but just right 1 
i thought it was bad 0 
rude inconsiderate management 0 
it clicks into place in a way that makes you wonder how long that mechanism would last 0 
this is a chilly unremarkable movie about an author livingworking in a chilly abstruse culture 0 
its a campy sort of film thats a joy to watch 1 
weve have gotten a much better service from the pizza place next door than the services we received from this restaurant 0 
an hour seriously 0 
theres barely a boring moment in the film and there are plenty of humorous parts 1 
the food amazing 1 
do not make the same mistake as me 0 
would not recommend to others 0 
it was awesome 1 
i received my orders well within the shipping timeframe everything was in good working order and overall i am very excited to have this source 1 
it failed to convey the broad sweep of landscapes that were a great part of the original 0 
very cheap plastic creaks like an old wooden floor 0 
disappointed 0 
bought mainly for the charger which broke soon after purchasing 0 
we got sitting fairly fast but ended up waiting 40 minutes just to place our order another 30 minutes before the food arrived 0 
if it was to turn my good day feeling into a night of disturbing memories than i guess he succeeded 0 
we thought youd have to venture further away to get good sushi but this place really hit the spot that night 1 
he deserves 5 stars 1 
an excellent new restaurant by an experienced frenchman 1 
they were goldencrispy and delicious 1 
dont buy it 0 
crash is a depressing little nothing that provokes emotion but teaches you nothing if you already know racism and prejudice are bad things 0 
i do think tom hanks is a good actor 1 
the concert sequences just sucked 0 
i recently had problems where i could not stay connected for more than 10 minutes before being disconnected 0 
i am very impressed with the job that motorola did on the sturdiness of this phone 1 
updatewent back for a second time and it was still just as amazing 1 
better than youd expect 1 
trouble is the writing and directing make it impossible to establish those things that make a movie watchable like character story theme and so on 0 
highly recommend for any one who has a blue tooth phone 1 
i immediately said i wanted to talk to the manager but i did not want to talk to the guy who was doing shots of fireball behind the bar 0 
but i thought his acting was skilled 1 
but storm trooper is not even bad enough to make it to the list of wonderfully terrible movies 0 
this was reflected not only in the cast but also in the belowpar script which borrowed much from the earlier classic 0 
im so happy to be here 1 
the film has an ultracheap look to it 0 
i had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get some relief 0 
we were promptly greeted and seated 1 
a must study for anyone interested in the worst sins of industrial design 0 
this movie contained an allstar cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i havent seen before 1 
first off the reception sucks i have never had more than 2 bars ever 0 
its this pandering to the audience that sabotages most of his films 0 
the noise shield is incrediable 1 
i searched the internet and found this one to be the best value 1 
if you check the directors filmography on this site you will see why this film didnt have a chance 0 
this greedy corporation will never see another dime from me 0 
voice quality signal strength dropped calls 0 
items stated as included from the description are not included 0 
the attractive set used throughout most of the film is an eyepleasing gem 1 
the lighting is just dark enough to set the mood 1 
didnt laugh or even smile once 0 
this phone might well be the worst ive ever had in any brand 0 
otherwise easy to install and use clear sound 1 
i might have gotten a defect but i would not risk buying it again because of the built quality alone 0 
i am very impressed with the job that motorola did on the sturdiness of this phone 1 
what a disappointment 0 
this company charge me a restocking fee and still not given me my refund back 0 
works good 1 
i tried talking real loud but shouting on the telephone gets old and i was still told it wasnt great 0 
cumbersome design 0 
the plastic breaks really easy on this clip 0 
long whiny and pointless 0 
simple lightweight and great fit 1 
would not go back 0 
the charger arrived within the promised timeframe but it did not work 0 
w810i is just superb 1 
awesome selection of beer 1 
its quite simply the highest most superlative form of cinema imaginable 1 
im still trying to get over how bad it was 0 
its pure brilliance 1 
they work about 2 weeks then break 0 
helen baxendale is a very credible lady macbeth who can be very cheerfull at times and sometimes she just looks like a naughty girl but deadly in her taste for blood and evil 1 
i was shocked because no signs indicate cash only 0 
which are small and not worth the price 0 
spend your money and time some place else 0 
the film deserves strong kudos for taking this stand for having exceptional acting from its mostly lesserknown cast and for the superintelligent script that doesnt insult the audience or take the easy way out when it comes to white racism 1 
to those who find this movie intelligent or even masterful i can only say its your intelligence and your imagination you obviously used to try and make some sense of this pitiful attempt its in our human nature to try and make sense of things 0 
i found this place by accident and i could not be happier 1 
finally after three or four times the spring of the latch broke and i could not use it any longer on the visor 0 
krussel always good 1 
now this dish was quite flavourful 1 
my sashimi was poor quality being soggy and tasteless 0 
delicious nyc bagels good selections of cream cheese real lox with capers even 1 
the steaks are all well trimmed and also perfectly cooked 1 
this is a great deal 1 
but in any case the best part is you can download these pictures to your laptop using ir or even send pictures from your laptop to the phone 1
