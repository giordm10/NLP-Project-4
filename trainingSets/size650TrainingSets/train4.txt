i felt asleep the first time i watched it so i can recommend it for insomniacs 0 
very nice and relaxing late night viewing 1 
im not eating here 0 
highly recommend for any one who has a blue tooth phone 1 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
the pleather case doesnt fit 0 
disappointing 0 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
also difficult to put onid recommend avoiding this product 0 
this movie is greatespecially if you enjoy visual arts 1 
and the red curry had so much bamboo shoots and wasnt very tasty to me 0 
generally it just lacked imagination 0 
needless to say i wont be going back anytime soon 0 
blue ant is easy to use 1 
there is nothing authentic about this place 0 
simple lightweight and great fit 1 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
for a product that costs as much as this one does i expect it to work far better and with greater ease than this thing does 0 
this is a disgrace 0 
great it was new packaged nice works good no problems and it came in less time then i expected 1 
sam shepards portrayal of a gung ho marine was sobering 1 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
my salad had a bland vinegrette on the baby greens and hearts of palm 0 
the problem i have is that they charge 1199 for a sandwich that is no bigger than a subway sub which offers better and more amount of vegetables 0 
this is definitely one of the better documentaries i have seen looking at family relationships and marriage 1 
all in all ha long bay was a bit of a flop 0 
we loved the biscuits 1 
i am so tired of clich√©s that is just lazy writing and here they come in thick and fast 0 
after all the rave reviews i couldnt wait to eat herewhat a disappointment 0 
does everything it should and more 1 
good item low price 1 
all the bread is made inhouse 1 
okay i like to consider myself a fair critic so ill give credit where credits duethe creature effects were actually pretty cool 1 
battery is terrible 0 
love the margaritas too 1 
the igo chargers and tips are really great 1 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
damian is so talented and versatile in so many ways of writing and portraying different characters on screen 1 
horrible horrible protector 0 
the headsets are easy to use and everyone loves them 1 
the bartender was also nice 1 
i had heard good things about this place but it exceeding every hope i could have dreamed of 1 
i can think of no other film where something vitally important occurs every other minute 1 
i own 2 of these cases and would order another 1 
its just painful 0 
i only hear garbage for audio 0 
how can that bethe audio quality is poor 0 
worst service to boot but that is the least of their worries 0 
so they performed 1 
john garfield ann revere lilli plmer william conrad canada leeand filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screenjames wong howe 1 
the phone loads super 1 
it is just the sort of pap that is screened in the afternoon to punish the unemployed for not having jobs 0 
good item low price 1 
i did not expect this to be so good 1 
and it was way to expensive 0 
the dining space is tiny but elegantly decorated and comfortable 1 
at first i thought i was grtting a good deal at 744 until i plugged it into my phone v3c razr 0 
it has all the features i want 1 
i have to jiggle the plug to get it to line up right to get decent volume 0 
i wish i could enter negative values admins 0 
the puppets look really cheesy not in a good way like in the puppet master 80s flicks 0 
setup couldnt have been simpler 1 
if you plan to use this in a car forget about it 0 
car charger as well as ac charger are included to make sure you never run out of juicehighy recommended 1 
their monster chicken fried steak and eggs is my all time favorite 1 
it has all the features i want 1 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
camera color balance is awful 0 
do not buy do not buyit sucks 0 
thank you for such great service 1 
it is very comfortable to wear as well which is probably the most important aspect about using a case 1 
hence the whole story lacks a certain energy 0 
if you have several dozen or several hundred contacts then imagine the fun of sending each of them one by one 0 
if you want a real scare rent this one 1 
kind of flops around 0 
point your finger at any item on the menu order it and you wont be disappointed 1 
there are so many problems i dont know where to start 0 
ill give this film 10 out of 10 1 
i would advise to not purchase this item it never worked very well 0 
what a disappointment 0 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
this case has passed the one year mark and while it shows signs of wear it is 100 functional 1 
ive only had my bluetooth for a few weeks but i really like it 1 
disappointed 0 
bland and flavorless is a good way of describing the barely tepid meat 0 
it doesnt work in europe or asia 0 
this is definitely a cult classic well worth viewing and sharing with others 1 
ordered a double cheeseburger got a single patty that was falling apart picture uploaded yeah still sucks 0 
i keep watching it over and over 1 
hot dishes are not hot cold dishes are close to room tempi watched staff prepare food with bare hands no gloveseverything is deep fried in oil 0 
it was packed 0 
dont waste your time 0 
phone falls out easily 0 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
i saw this short film on hbo the other day and absolutely loved it 1 
comfortable in my hand 1 
restaurant is always full but never a wait 1 
this movie is a good and humorous comment on life in 2006 1 
really awful 0 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
classywarm atmosphere fun and fresh appetizers succulent steaks baseball steak 1 
horrible phone 0 
comfortable nice range good battery life 1 
he is almost unbearable to watch on screen he has little to no charisma and terrible comedic timing 0 
service is also cute 1 
you share general loewenhielms exquisite joy in his partaking of the cailles en sarcophage even though you are just watching a movie but you do wish for just a small sample to savor 1 
one character is totally annoying with a voice that gives me the feeling of fingernails on a chalkboard 0 
and his subtle connections between the three films are awesome 1 
and those baby owls were adorable 1 
very clear quality sound and you dont have to mess with the sound on your ipod since you have the sound buttons on the headset 1 
his costars dont fare much better with people like morgan freeman jonah hill and ed helms just wasted 0 
we arent ones to make a scene at restaurants but i just dont get itdefinitely lost the love after this one 0 
this is an outstanding little restaurant with some of the best food i have ever tasted 1 
i purcashed this for the car charger and it does not work 0 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
go and see it 1 
even in my bmw 3 series which is fairly quiet i have trouble hearing what the other person is saying 0 
the range is very decent ive been able to roam around my house with the phone in the living room with no receptionsound quality issues 1 
it looses connection to the phone even when it is within a couple feet between the two 0 
these headphones were a great find and i think they are perhaps the best purchase ive made in the last several years seriously 1 
i mean really how do you get so famous for your fish and chips when its so terrible 0 
if good intentions made a film great then this film might be one of the greatest films ever made 1 
the instruction manual is lacking 0 
im in az all the time and now have my new spot 1 
i knew when i saw the film that more great things were to come from this gifted actor 1 
i mean in a realistic world she would never have gotten into that ballet repertory the whole thing was quite pathetic 0 
just whatever you do avoid groove as its the antithesis of all that is good about human traffic 0 
cant get the software to work with my computer 0 
he was terrible 0 
this may be the only bad film he ever made 0 
she carries the movie well 1 
not enough volume 0 
thank you for such great service 1 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
insults profound deuchebaggery and had to go outside for a smoke break while serving just to solidify it 0 
it was a good thing that the tickets only cost five dollars because i would be mad if id have paid 750 to see this crap 0 
very disappointed and wondered how it could be in the oscar shortlist 0 
a world better than 95 of the garbage in the theatres today 1 
today the graphics are crap 0 
during several different 2 minute calls i experienced 5 drops and it was in an area that had 5 bars 0 
the best example of how dumb the writing is when its established that you can turn the zombiestudents back into humans by removing a necklace containing a piece of the meteorite 0 
awful service 0 
the staff is always super friendly and helpful which is especially cool when you bring two small boys and a baby 1 
the chefs were friendly and did a good job 1 
good item low price 1 
great phone 1 
i have purchased these for both family and friends and all enjoy their clarity and ease of use 1 
ive missed numerous calls because of this reason 0 
this movie creates its own universe and is fascinating in every way 1 
this place is great 1 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
the worst phone from samsungcrap this crappy samsung e715 is the worst i have ever seeen 0 
everything about this movie is stupid 0 
they refuse to refund or replace 0 
i dont like this nokia either 0 
pretty cool i would say 1 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
the volume switch rocketed out of the unit to a destination unknown 0 
if you look for authentic thai food go else where 0 
the delivery was on time 1 
yes i am simplifying things here for the sake of brevity for this really is at the core of the problems with this film it has too much going on without any real fulfilling explanation 0 
i would not recommend this place 0 
my friend loved the salmon tartar 1 
this review is long overdue since i consider a tale of two sisters to be the single greatest film ever made 1 
the desserts were a bit strange 0 
i work in the hospitality industry in paradise valley and have refrained from recommending cibo any longer 0 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
waste of money 0 
but it picked up speed and got right to the point 1 
excellent cast story line performances 1 
one character is totally annoying with a voice that gives me the feeling of fingernails on a chalkboard 0 
would not reccommend 0 
despite the pans of reviewers i liked this movie 1 
comfort for our whole family 1 
i did not bother contacting the company for few dollar product but i learned the lesson that i should not have bought this form online anyway 0 
i will not return 0 
itll be a regular stop on my trips to phoenix 1 
this game rocks 1 
the steaks are all well trimmed and also perfectly cooked 1 
the death row scenes were entirely unmoving 0 
you get what you pay for i guess 0 
he owns the film just as spacek owned coal miners daughter and quaid owned great balls of fire 1 
i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
great price too 1 
my experience was terrible this was my fourth bluetooth headset and while it was much more comfortable than my last jabra which i hated 0 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
this isnt a small family restaurant this is a fine dining establishment 1 
the plot has more holes than a pair of fishnet stockings and the direction and editing is astonishingly ham fisted 0 
there are so many problems i dont know where to start 0 
so they performed 1 
he was terrible 0 
nice leather 1 
freezes frequently4 0 
how this piece of trash was ever released is beyond me the acting the story the characters the supposedly special effects etcits all wrong 0 
worst ever 0 
a fly was in my apple juice a fly 0 
the bathrooms are clean and the place itself is well decorated 1 
i was not impressed by this product 0 
food was really good and i got full petty fast 1 
the movie is littered with overt racial slurs towards the black cast members and in return the whites are depicted as morons and boobs 0 
great pocket pc phone combination 1 
i tried the cape cod ravoli chickenwith cranberrymmmm 1 
they have great dinners 1 
she ordered a toasted english muffin that came out untoasted 0 
my only problem is i thought the actor playing the villain was a low rent michael ironside 0 
ive seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie 0 
and considering the two of us left there very full and happy for about 20 you just cant go wrong 1 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
and the beans and rice were mediocre at best 0 
linksys should have some way to exchange a bad phone for a refurb unit or something 0 
freezes frequently4 0 
it was a drive to get there 0 
the death row scenes were entirely unmoving 0 
this place is handsdown one of the best places to eat in the phoenix metro area 1 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
i wish i could return the unit and get back my money 0 
i connected my wifes bluetoothmotorola hs850 to my phone and it worked like a charm whether the phone was in my pocket or the case 1 
the calls drop the phone comes on and off at will the screen goes black and the worst of all it stops ringing intermittently 0 
very unreliable service from tmobile 0 
i agree with jessica this movie is pretty bad 0 
its very slow 0 
the staff are great the ambiance is great 1 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
i couldnt think of a better way to end the film but a smile on my face great way to wrap up an amazing film and trilogy 1 
warning stay away 0 
the service here is fair at best 0 
best service and food ever maria our server was so good and friendly she made our day 1 
i love lane but ive never seen her in a movie this lousy 0 
however the ear pads come off easily and after only one week i lost one 0 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
then theres the plot holes 0 
i highly recommend this movie for anyone interested in art poetry theater politics or japanese history 1 
battery lasts only a few hours 0 
i have two more years left in this contract and i hate this phone 0 
steer clear of this product and go with the genuine palm replacementr pens which come in a threepack 0 
the only possible way this movie could be redeemed would be as mst3k fodder 0 
i might have gotten a defect but i would not risk buying it again because of the built quality alone 0 
the film succeeds despite or perhaps because of an obviously meagre budget 1 
the explosion of the gas tanks at the end was just as awful 0 
works great 1 
due to this happening on every call i was forced to stop using this headset 0 
the script is horrendously stupid 0 
now the pizza itself was good the peanut sauce was very tasty 1 
i will come back here every time im in vegas 1 
what i really like there is the crepe station 1 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
total letdown i would much rather just go to the camelback flower shop and cartel coffee 0 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
this may be the only bad film he ever made 0 
lasted one day and then blew up 0 
my 5year old nokia 2160 from tracfone holds the charge a lot better than this 0 
the only thing i did like was the prime rib and dessert section 1 
went for lunch service was slow 0 
better than youd expect 1 
the real killer is the volume and of course it breaking 0 
the results well are a shame 0 
the turkey and roast beef were bland 0 
not a good item it worked for a while then started having problems in my auto reverse tape player 0 
overall i like this place a lot 1 
our server was very nice and even though he looked a little overwhelmed with all of our needs he stayed professional and friendly until the end 1 
i didnt know pulled pork could be soooo delicious 1 
the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach 0 
the volume for the ringer is real good you have choices how loud 1 
add betty white and jean smart and you have a great cast everyone played their parts really well 1 
it was pretty gross 0 
i know he was a contract player with little control over his scripts but the acting was as bad as the script 0 
the pancake was also really good and pretty large at that 1 
good item low price 1 
after 3 months screen just went black all of a sudden 0 
comfortable in my hand 1 
even allowing for poor production values for the time 1971 and the format some kind of miniseries this is baaaaaad 0 
nobody identifies with these characters because theyre all cardboard cutouts and stereotypes or predictably reversestereotypes 0 
cant store anything but phone numbers to sim 0 
yes this film does require a rather significant amount of puzzlesolving but the pieces fit together to create a beautiful picture 1 
this case seems well made 1 
i love it 1 
cant store anything but phone numbers to sim 0 
it kept getting worse and worse so now im officially done 0 
they really want to make your experience a good one 1 
not my thing 0 
however my girl was complain that some time the phone doesnt wake up like normal phone does 0 
the decor is nice and the piano music soundtrack is pleasant 1 
a great touch 1 
this place receives stars for their appetizers 1 
cute quaint simple honest 1 
excellent service 1 
my ribeye steak was cooked perfectly and had great mesquite flavor 1 
elias koteasjack palance play good roles angelina is hot and gets nakedbilly drago appears in this and is cool as usual a cameo by sven ole thorsen helps make this a very enjoyable movie with good acting and a decent budget 1 
this is probably one of the least effective and utterly unoriginal films i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
the biggest complaint i have is the battery drains superfast 0 
initially the local sites in the film which was filmed here in buffalo intrigued me 1 
the movie lacks visual interest drama expression of feeling and celebration of the very patriotism that underlines the narrative 0 
all i have to say is the food was amazing 1 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
i highly recommend this movie for anyone interested in art poetry theater politics or japanese history 1 
the service was terrible food was mediocre 0 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
very easy to use 1 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
all the pretty pictures in the world cannot make up for a piece of work that is flawed at the core 0 
first of all there are enough racial stereotypes and racial jokes to offend everyone 0 
we arent ones to make a scene at restaurants but i just dont get itdefinitely lost the love after this one 0 
i could not recommend these more 0 
there arent death scenes like in previous movies and the fx are terrible 0 
it makes very strange ticking noises before it ends the call 0 
excellent bluetooth headset 1 
sooooo good 1 
unfortunately the ability to actually know you are receiving a call is a rather important feature and this phone is pitiful in that respect 0 
their onscreen chemistry critical to the entire film is genuine 1 
so far so good 1 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
and the chef was generous with his time even came around twice so we can take pictures with him 1 
the dialogue is composed of things that make little sense 0 
the plot was the same as pretty much every other cheap horror 0 
the camera although rated at an impressive 13 megapixels renders images that fall well below expectations of such a relatively high resolution 0 
the results well are a shame 0 
problem is that the ear loops are made of weak material and break easily 0 
the story is also both funny and poignant at times 1 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
i love the scream movies and all horror movies and this one ranks way up there 1 
please dont waste your money 0 
buyer beware you could flush money right down the toilet 0 
if you do go see this movie bring a pillow or a girlfriendboyfriend to keep you occupied through out 0 
the acting sucks the music sucks the script sucks the pacing sucks the special fx suck the directing sucks basically this movie sucks 0 
one nice thing was that they added gratuity on the bill since our party was larger than 6 or 8 and they didnt expect more tip than that 1 
not a good item it worked for a while then started having problems in my auto reverse tape player 0 
comfort for our whole family 1 
i am pairing this with my iphone and i could not be happier with it so far 1 
in a word it is embarrassing 0 
the football scenes at the end were perplexing 0 
during several different 2 minute calls i experienced 5 drops and it was in an area that had 5 bars 0 
in the summer you can dine in a charming outdoor patio so very delightful 1 
service was fantastic 1 
big disappointment with calendar sync 0 
terrible phone holder 0 
dont buy it 0 
good product incredible value 1 
in other words the content level of this film is enough to easily fill a dozen other films 1 
this short film certainly pulls no punches 0 
you will leave the theater wanting to go out and dance under the stars 1 
what happened next was prettyoff putting 0 
i am very impressed with the job that motorola did on the sturdiness of this phone 1 
once your food arrives its meh 0 
lasted one day and then blew up 0 
waaaaaayyyyyyyyyy over rated is all i am saying 0 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
the directing and the cinematography arent quite as good 0 
first off the reception sucks i have never had more than 2 bars ever 0 
i highly recommend these and encourage people to give them a try 1 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
muddy low quality sound and the casing around the wires insert was poorly super glued and slid off 0 
ive missed numerous calls because of this reason 0 
if you check the directors filmography on this site you will see why this film didnt have a chance 0 
2 times very bad customer service 0 
this gets a 1 out of 10 simply because theres nothing lower 0 
i was bored throughout the whole damn thing 0 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
the foreigner is not worth one second of your time 0 
is pretty funny 1 
we watched our waiter pay a lot more attention to other tables and ignore us 0 
the fries were not hot and neither was my burger 0 
i love all the features and form factor 1 
a piece of junk that broke after being on my phone for 2 days 0 
its too bad that everyone else involved didnt share crowes level of dedication to quality for if they did wed have a far better film on our hands than this subpar mess 0 
the bartender was also nice 1 
this totally unfunny movie is so over the top and pathetic and unrealistic that throughout the whole 90 minutes of utter torture i probably looked at my watch about 70000 times 0 
great choice 1 
after i pulled up my car i waited for another 15 minutes before being acknowledged 0 
however my girl was complain that some time the phone doesnt wake up like normal phone does 0 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
it was attached to a gas station and that is rarely a good sign 0 
love the margaritas too 1 
you can even take self portraits with the outside exterior display very cool 1 
i do think tom hanks is a good actor 1 
sound quality on both end is excellent i use headset to call my wife and ask my wife to use headset to call me 2 1 
in conclusion i will not bother with this movie because a volcano in los angeles is nothing but nonsense 0 
you can even take self portraits with the outside exterior display very cool 1 
the cinematography is simply stunning to say the least and the fx are nothing if not stateoftheart 1 
my only problem is i thought the actor playing the villain was a low rent michael ironside 0 
they have a really nice atmosphere 1 
the interplay between martin and emilio contains the same wonderful chemistry we saw in wall street with martin and charlie 1 
this totally unfunny movie is so over the top and pathetic and unrealistic that throughout the whole 90 minutes of utter torture i probably looked at my watch about 70000 times 0 
funny clever hip just like prays previous film hype 1 
also the area where my unit broke im not too fond of the magnetic strap 0 
finally after three or four times the spring of the latch broke and i could not use it any longer on the visor 0 
and finally after all that we get to an ending that wouldve been great had it been handled by competent people and not jerry falwell 0 
do not waste your time 0 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
service stinks here 0 
the price was very good and with the free shipping and all it was a good purchase 1 
it really is impressive that the place hasnt closed down 0 
i believe that this place is a great stop for those with a huge belly and hankering for sushi 1 
best service and food ever maria our server was so good and friendly she made our day 1 
he is almost unbearable to watch on screen he has little to no charisma and terrible comedic timing 0 
if there is a wind it is completely useless 0 
bad fit way too big 0 
definitely worth checking out 1 
also if your phone is dropped this case is not going to save it specially when dropped face down 0 
her lines seem to have been written by a fifteen year old though they are trying oh so so hard to sound like how a fifteen year old would really um you know well talk 0 
good show samsung 1 
restored my phone to like new performance 1 
but if you liked movies like the matrix and better yet their sequels i think youll appreciate the thought provoking mindblowing experience this film will give you 1 
always a great time at dos gringos 1 
i have been in more than a few bars in vegas and do not ever recall being charged for tap water 0 
one nice thing was that they added gratuity on the bill since our party was larger than 6 or 8 and they didnt expect more tip than that 1 
horrible 0 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
we were promptly greeted and seated 1 
bad characters bad story and bad acting 0 
steve martin delivers a really funny performance of a middleaged upper class uptight white guy 1 
and the chef was generous with his time even came around twice so we can take pictures with him 1 
great food and great service in a clean and friendly setting 1 
the buffet at bellagio was far from what i anticipated 0 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
the chicken wings contained the driest chicken meat i have ever eaten 0 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
ive also had problems with the phone reading the memory card in which i always turn it on and then off again 0 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
you share general loewenhielms exquisite joy in his partaking of the cailles en sarcophage even though you are just watching a movie but you do wish for just a small sample to savor 1 
would not reccommend 0 
arrived quickly and much less expensive than others being sold 1 
the fact is this film is a wonderful heartwarming tale about two people chasing their dreams 1 
sorry i will not be getting food from here anytime soon 0 
i hate writing bad reviews about films especially those in which i really like the star but this film is so bad i dont believe for one second that anyone could have been proud of it 0 
i really like this product over the motorola because it is allot clearer on the ear piece and the mic 1 
if you havent gone here go now 1 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
the ambiance isnt much better 0 
when im on this side of town this will definitely be a spot ill hit up again 1 
this is so embarassing and also my ears hurt if i try to push the ear plug into my ear 0 
iam very pleased with my purchase 1 
he is one of my favourite directors and one of the most talented directors in the history of cinema 1 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
it showed exactly how the government and the scientist argued for humanity and the reasons of the gadget 1 
none of it works just dont buy it 0 
worthless product 0 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
we enjoy their pizza and brunch 1 
a very very very slowmoving aimless movie about a distressed drifting young man 0 
which is precisely why i am giving it such a bad review 0 
you truly take this journey through the eyes and soul of a child 1 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
which is precisely why i am giving it such a bad review 0 
the classic maine lobster roll was fantastic 1 
the food was terrible 0 
very good quality though 1 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
and finally after all that we get to an ending that wouldve been great had it been handled by competent people and not jerry falwell 0 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
blue ant is easy to use 1 
another thing i didnt really like is when a character got punched in the face a gallon of blood would spew forth soon after 0 
the seasonal fruit was fresh white peach puree 1 
very very fun chef 1 
his performance as awarded was stunning 1 
mobile phone tools are a must have 1 
today the graphics are crap 0 
the acting was decidely wooden though no worse than a period universal b movie 0 
the atmosphere was great with a lovely duo of violinists playing songs we requested 1 
the chicken i got was definitely reheated and was only ok the wedges were cold and soggy 0 
it clicks into place in a way that makes you wonder how long that mechanism would last 0 
which has more depth and character than the man underneath it 0 
you cant relate with them hell you barely can understand them 0 
great pizza and salads 1 
the good cinematography also makes her and monica bellucci look very beautiful 1 
their onscreen chemistry critical to the entire film is genuine 1 
soggy and not good 0 
it is light has plenty of battery capacity and is very confortable to wear for somewhat extended periods of time 1 
good value great food great service 1 
i would recommend saving room for this 1 
excellent service 1 
now you know why i gave it a 10 1 
from what my dinner companions told meeverything was very fresh with nice texture and taste 1 
from here on the widmark character turns unintentionally comical 0 
i had a seriously solid breakfast here 1 
sweetest phone 1 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
much more interesting more action more suspense and less of the unneeded controversy 1 
this place is disgusting 0 
this film highlights the fundamental flaws of the legal process that its not about discovering guilt or innocence but rather is about who presents better in court 1 
special thanks to dylan t for the recommendation on what to order all yummy for my tummy 1 
the handsfree part works fine but then the car tries to download the address book and the treo rebootsoverall i still rate this device high 1 
i wish i could return the unit and get back my money 0 
also the area where my unit broke im not too fond of the magnetic strap 0 
the nano stated itmy son was dissapointed 0 
there was hardly any meat 0 
service is friendly and inviting 1 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
great choice 1 
pretty piece of junk 0 
its the best headset i have used 1 
it has a very good plot it holds your complete attention the acting is superb tom wilkinson was fantastic and emily watson was also very good 1 
editing the editing of this film was phenomenal in my opinion 1 
how can that bethe audio quality is poor 0 
his performance as awarded was stunning 1 
none of them are engaging or exciting 0 
there arent death scenes like in previous movies and the fx are terrible 0 
not too screamy not to masculine but just right 1 
sorry i will not be getting food from here anytime soon 0 
so good i am going to have to review this place twice once hereas a tribute to the place and once as a tribute to an event held here last night 1 
very prompt service 1 
i used bitpim a free program you can find on the internetto transfer data to the phonethe price of the cable was excellent 1 
gets the job done 1 
we definately enjoyed ourselves 1 
very tough and very short on flavor 0 
that was done in the second movie 0 
thats how id describe this painfully dreary timewaster of a film 0 
the casting is also horrible cause all you see is a really really bad actors period 0 
id say that would be the hardest decision honestly all of ms dishes taste how they are supposed to taste amazing 1 
i just wanted to leave 0 
horrible dont waste your time and money 0 
my friend loved the salmon tartar 1 
worst service to boot but that is the least of their worries 0 
it was quite comfortable in the ear 1 
these are the central themes of the film and they are handled ineptly stereotypically and with no depth of imagination 0 
the acting is beyond abysmal 0 
dont waste your money 0 
food was so gooodd 1 
it looks very nice 1 
someone shouldve invented this sooner 1 
i have been to very few places to eat that under no circumstances would i ever return to and this tops the list 0 
we were promptly greeted and seated 1 
i am very impressed with this headset from plantronics 1 
it probably would have been better if the director hadnt spent most of the movie showcasing his own art work which really isnt that noteworthy 0 
highquality chicken on the chicken caesar salad 1 
works fine 1 
a week later after i activated it it suddenly died 0 
the restaurant atmosphere was exquisite 1 
simple lightweight and great fit 1 
great sound and service 1 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
price is good too 1 
however this didnt make up for the fact that overall this was a tremendously boring movie 0 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
first of all it doesnt wear well 0 
great pocket pc phone combination 1 
i give wirefly 1 stari will contact cingularatt and inform them of this practice 0 
after two i felt disgusting 0 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
i received my supposedly new motorola 375 and apparently there was not a match between the phone and the charger 0 
i know he was a contract player with little control over his scripts but the acting was as bad as the script 0 
after two i felt disgusting 0 
this film and i use that word loosely is an insult to the moviegoing public 0 
overall i rate this movie a 10 out of a 110 scale 1 
what a waste 0 
we arent ones to make a scene at restaurants but i just dont get itdefinitely lost the love after this one 0 
not recommended 0 
but this movie really got to me 1 
what a disappointment 0 
gotta love those closeups of slimy drooling teeth 1 
after all the rave reviews i couldnt wait to eat herewhat a disappointment 0 
the waiter wasnt helpful or friendly and rarely checked on us 0 
rude inconsiderate management 0 
the eargels channel the sound directly into your ear and seem to increase the sound volume and clarity 1 
if you love authentic mexican food and want a whole bunch of interesting yet delicious meats to choose from you need to try this place 1 
i will never go back to this place and will never ever recommended this place to anyone 0 
the food was outstanding and the prices were very reasonable 1 
there was hardly any meat 0 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clich√©s to be admitted elsewhere 0 
bland and flavorless is a good way of describing the barely tepid meat 0 
it feels poorly constructed the menus are difficult to navigate and the buttons are so recessed that it is difficult to push them 0 
good show samsung 1 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
last time buying from you 0 
loved itfriendly servers great food wonderful and imaginative menu 1 
after 3 months screen just went black all of a sudden 0 
the film has great actors a master director a significant themeat least a wouldbe significant theme undertone of fifties existential worldweariness aerial scenes that ought to have thrilled both senses and imagination and characters about which one might deeply care 1 
also notable is john baileys fine crisp beautifully colored cinematography and the great production design costumes by eiko ishioka who went on to do the memorable costumes for coppolas dracula for which she received a well deserved oscar 1 
after i pulled up my car i waited for another 15 minutes before being acknowledged 0 
pricing is a bit of a concern at mellow mushroom 0 
i could care less the interior is just beautiful 1 
this one is simply a disappointment 0 
the bathroom is just next door and very nice 1 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
overall i rate this movie a 10 out of a 110 scale 1 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
the fries were not hot and neither was my burger 0 
the turkey and roast beef were bland 0 
good audio quality 1 
waaaaaayyyyyyyyyy over rated is all i am saying 0 
wonderful lil tapas and the ambience made me feel all warm and fuzzy inside 1 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
very tough and very short on flavor 0 
it was absolutely amazing 1 
now you know why i gave it a 10 1 
waited and waited and waited 0 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
the writers were smack on and i think the best actors and actresses were a bonus to the showthese characters were so real 1 
the results well are a shame 0 
the acting was bad 0 
waste of 13 bucks 0 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
not good for the money 0 
this place is disgusting 0 
better than youd expect 1 
lousy product 0 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
it is cheap and it feel and look just as cheap 0 
on three different occasions i asked for well done or medium well and all three times i got the bloodiest piece of meat on my plate 0 
the script is a big flawed mess 0 
great brunch spot 1 
same problem as others have mentioned 0 
i seriously cannot believe that the owner has so many unexperienced employees that all are running around like chickens with their heads cut off 0 
very very fun chef 1 
the roast beef sandwich tasted really good 1 
no real improvement 0 
we had a group of 70 when we claimed we would only have 40 and they handled us beautifully 1 
went in for happy hour great list of wines 1 
but now that it is out of warranty the same problems reoccurebottom line put your money somewhere else cingular will not support it 0 
service was exceptional and food was a good as all the reviews 1 
dont waste your time 0 
their chow mein is so good 1 
i can think of no other film where something vitally important occurs every other minute 1 
i really like this product over the motorola because it is allot clearer on the ear piece and the mic 1 
the acting was decidely wooden though no worse than a period universal b movie 0 
i came over from verizon because cingulair has nicer cell phones the first thing i noticed was the really bad service 0 
not good by any stretch of the imagination 0 
i used bitpim a free program you can find on the internetto transfer data to the phonethe price of the cable was excellent 1 
i was so insulted 0 
this greedy corporation will never see another dime from me 0 
you get what you pay for i guess 0 
keep up the good work amazon 1 
what a big waste of time 0 
that company is a joke 0 
he cant act one of the least scary villains i have ever seen he cant write did he write this damn movie in his sleep 0 
i really recommend this faceplates since it looks very nice elegant and cool 1 
the bose noise cancelling is amazing which is very important for a nyc commuter 1 
no complaints 1 
this movie was kind of long in length but i enjoyed every minute of it 1 
either way it sucks 0 
it was way over fried 0 
dont buy this product 0 
back to good bbq lighter fare reasonable pricing and tell the public they are back to the old ways 1 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
very satisifed with that 1 
i use this product in a motor control center where there is a lot of high voltage humming from the equipment and it works great 1 
however the keypads are so tinny that i sometimes reach the wrong buttons 0 
the cast is good 1 
we were promptly greeted and seated 1 
great product 1 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
in my house i was getting dropped coverage upstairs and no coverage in my basement 0 
the new characters werent all that memorable and i found myself forgetting who was who 0 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
i thoroughly enjoyed it when christopher eccleston took control of the tardis and the continuation of the series 1
