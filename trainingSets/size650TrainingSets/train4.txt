i highly recommend these and encourage people to give them a try 1 
they are so cool 1 
for the price on amazon it is an excellent product which i would highly recommend 1 
del taco is pretty nasty and should be avoided if possible 0 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
the acting is like watching wooden puppets moving around and reading from a book thats how bad it is 0 
this is an extraordinary film 1 
hes a national treasure 1 
the owners are super friendly and the staff is courteous 1 
this is truly an art movieit actually has a lot of art in it 1 
terrible service 0 
the only thing that i think could improve is the sound leaks out from the headset 0 
which are small and not worth the price 0 
for a product that costs as much as this one does i expect it to work far better and with greater ease than this thing does 0 
its a gloriously fun fast paced and fairly accurate portrayal of the night of a raver 1 
terrible management 0 
now this is a movie i really dislike 0 
overall i like this place a lot 1 
worst service to boot but that is the least of their worries 0 
how awful she is 0 
just does not work 0 
awsome device works great 1 
someone shouldve invented this sooner 1 
the waiter wasnt helpful or friendly and rarely checked on us 0 
i kept looking at the time and it had soon become 35 minutes yet still no food 0 
the screen size is big key pad lit well enough and the camera quality is excellent for a camera phone 1 
this phone is pretty sturdy and ive never had any large problems with it 1 
its so bad its actually worth seeing just for that reason 0 
they refuse to refund or replace 0 
i have purchased these for both family and friends and all enjoy their clarity and ease of use 1 
an hour and a half i wish i could bring back 0 
great pocket pc phone combination 1 
the selection of food was not the best 0 
things happen characters personalities change plot twists occur for no real reason other than that script calls for it 0 
the only suspense i was feeling was the frustration at just how retarded the girls were 0 
the pizza tasted old super chewy in not a good way 0 
this case has passed the one year mark and while it shows signs of wear it is 100 functional 1 
in my house i was getting dropped coverage upstairs and no coverage in my basement 0 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
so badwellits just bad 0 
they are so easy to love but even more easy to identify with 1 
nothing short of magnificent photographycinematography in this film 1 
the cast is always entertaining as usual 1 
also the phone doesnt seem to accept anything except cbr mp3s preferably ripped by windows media player 0 
things happen characters personalities change plot twists occur for no real reason other than that script calls for it 0 
service was good and the company was better 1 
lovely little thriller from hitchcock with lots of nice shenanigans surrounding a murdered spy a kidnapped child a nasty church a foreign plot and some random taxidermists 1 
were jerks on the phone 0 
if you love death and decay and shakespears lyrics this is the one 1 
im surprised this is a good quality car charger and theres not much reviews about it 1 
easily none other cartoon made me laugh in a tender way before getting into dark sitcoms oriented for teenagers 1 
the service was outshining i definitely recommend the halibut 1 
i highly recommend these and encourage people to give them a try 1 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
trying to make a call on these is an exercise in frustration 0 
the waitress was friendly and happy to accomodate for veganveggie options 1 
one of the most disappointing aspects is the lack of notable gore 0 
server did a great job handling our large rowdy table 1 
the characters are interesting and you really care for them 1 
i liked this movie way too much 1 
it features an outlandish array of memorable psychotic but lovable nuts 1 
end of days is one of the worst bigbudget action movies ive ever seen 0 
highly recommended for all ages although the younger set will probably not appreciate some of the more subtle references they will certainly appreciate one galley scene in particular 1 
the nano stated itmy son was dissapointed 0 
finally after three or four times the spring of the latch broke and i could not use it any longer on the visor 0 
the attractive set used throughout most of the film is an eyepleasing gem 1 
delete this film from your mind 0 
voice quality signal strength dropped calls 0 
the menu is always changing food quality is going down service is extremely slow 0 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
gotta love those closeups of slimy drooling teeth 1 
it was probably dirt 0 
its pretty easy 1 
the staff is great the food is delish and they have an incredible beer selection 1 
give this one a look 1 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
bad fit way too big 0 
the sweet potato fries were very good and seasoned well 1 
the keyboard is a nice compromise between a full qwerty and the basic cell phone number keypad 1 
which is precisely why i am giving it such a bad review 0 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
it kept getting worse and worse so now im officially done 0 
the lighting is just dark enough to set the mood 1 
im really disappointed all i have now is a charger that doesnt work 0 
even in my bmw 3 series which is fairly quiet i have trouble hearing what the other person is saying 0 
very funny 1 
the steak and the shrimp are in my opinion the best entrees at gc 1 
hitchcock is a great director 1 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
their daily specials are always a hit with my group 1 
the voice recognition thru the handset is excellent 1 
this phone tries very hard to do everything but fails at its very ability to be a phone 0 
tasted like dirt 0 
we walked away stuffed and happy about our first vegas buffet experience 1 
dont waste your money 0 
it rocked my world and is certainly a must see for anyone with no social or physical outlets 1 
razr battery good buy 1 
if the food isnt bad enough for you then enjoy dealing with the worlds worstannoying drunk people 0 
i love the ringtones because they are so upbeat 1 
give this one a look 1 
its kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly its embarrassing how childlike the company is 0 
sound quality on both end is excellent i use headset to call my wife and ask my wife to use headset to call me 2 1 
i am glad i purchased it 1 
nothing short of magnificent photographycinematography in this film 1 
it was horrendous 0 
i wasted my little money with this earpiece 0 
the black eyed peas and sweet potatoes unreal 1 
i checked out this place a couple years ago and was not impressed 0 
simply beautiful 1 
it was a long time that i didnt see a so charismatic actor on screen 1 
my breakfast was perpared great with a beautiful presentation of 3 giant slices of toast lightly dusted with powdered sugar 1 
i was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar not only because the quality is great but the service is fast and the food impeccable 1 
love this product 1 
i would advise to not purchase this item it never worked very well 0 
the tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu 0 
a must study for anyone interested in the worst sins of industrial design 0 
brilliance indeed 1 
it is zillion times away from reality 0 
i advise you to look out for it 1 
im still infatuated with this phone 1 
great value 1 
what a waste of money and time 0 
i am going to have to be the first to negatively review this product 0 
reception is terrible and full of static 0 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
secondly hitchcock pretty much perfected the thriller and chase movie 1 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
an extensive menu provides lots of options for breakfast 1 
now the pizza itself was good the peanut sauce was very tasty 1 
setup couldnt have been simpler 1 
the real killer is the volume and of course it breaking 0 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
there is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again 0 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
if you are razr owneryou must have this 1 
my breakfast was perpared great with a beautiful presentation of 3 giant slices of toast lightly dusted with powdered sugar 1 
i am glad i purchased it 1 
the cast is good 1 
it was delicious 1 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
i was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar not only because the quality is great but the service is fast and the food impeccable 1 
we will not be coming back 0 
my sashimi was poor quality being soggy and tasteless 0 
essentially you can forget microsofts tech support 0 
dont miss it 1 
back to good bbq lighter fare reasonable pricing and tell the public they are back to the old ways 1 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
thanks good a movie like this was done and released 1 
i really do recommend this place you can go wrong with this donut place 1 
after 3 months screen just went black all of a sudden 0 
even allowing for poor production values for the time 1971 and the format some kind of miniseries this is baaaaaad 0 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
he is an amazing film artist one of the most important whoever lived 1 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
fans of the genre will be in heaven 1 
it was equally awful 0 
the kids are annoying 0 
the malta settings are as dry and as barren as the dialogue 0 
so far so good 1 
and the beans and rice were mediocre at best 0 
everything about it is fine and reasonable for the price ie 1 
terrible service 0 
the telephone repair man was really funny and his reactions to the nuts and bitchy boss were truly genuine 1 
the turkey and roast beef were bland 0 
really bad 0 
and those baby owls were adorable 1 
i dont understand how this garbage got on the shelves of the movie store its not even a real movie 0 
coming here is like experiencing an underwhelming relationship where both parties cant wait for the other person to ask to break up 0 
the film is way too long 0 
a week later after i activated it it suddenly died 0 
over rated 0 
poor construction 0 
there is simply no excuse for something this poorly done 0 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
great phone 1 
i had a seriously solid breakfast here 1 
a usable keyboard actually turns a pda into a realworld useful machine instead of just a neat gadget 1 
perfect for someone me who only likes beer ice cold or in this case even colder 1 
i would recommend this 1 
avoid this film at all costs 0 
this is infuriating 0 
it is practically useless and did not add any kind of boost to my reception after i bought it 0 
constantine gives everything the right intensity and seems to have a good understanding of the underlying psychological motivations 1 
the acting was bad the dialogs were extremely shallow and insincere 0 
the bt headset was such a disapoinment 0 
its not hard to make a decent hamburger 0 
very easy to use 1 
greatno problems at all 1 
its very slow 0 
i went to bachi burger on a friends recommendation and was not disappointed 1 
oh this is such a thing of beauty this restaurant 1 
this one works and was priced right 1 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
this movie is also revealing 1 
frankly after cotton club and unfaithful it was kind of embarrassing to watch lane and gere in this film because it is bad 0 
the cinematographyif it can be called thatsucked 0 
plantronics bluetooth excelent buy 1 
either way it sucks 0 
mobile phone tools are a must have 1 
but in terms of the writing its very fresh and bold 1 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
i paid the bill but did not tip because i felt the server did a terrible job 0 
despite the pans of reviewers i liked this movie 1 
food was average at best 0 
the movie in movie situations in the beginning and through the game that is played with her by the acting coach are fascinating 1 
the reception has been generally good 1 
and sometimes it was so embarrassing that i had to look away 0 
trying to make a call on these is an exercise in frustration 0 
what makes this story different are the terrific production values faultless photography composition and editing the terrific casting the underappreciated brian keith playing a bully teddy and vivid history 1 
i can take a little bad service but the food sucks 0 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
the incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film 1 
if she had not rolled the eyes we may have stayed not sure if we will go back and try it again 0 
dont buy this product it fails 0 
the worst phone from samsungcrap this crappy samsung e715 is the worst i have ever seeen 0 
dont go here 0 
the steaks are all well trimmed and also perfectly cooked 1 
the only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port irda 0 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
disappointing 0 
waitress was good though 1 
soggy and not good 0 
their monster chicken fried steak and eggs is my all time favorite 1 
when i opened the sandwich i was impressed but not in a good way 0 
the burger is good beef cooked just right 1 
the microphone also works well but according to people i have called it applifies everything 1 
none of the three sizes they sent with the headset would stay in my ears 0 
this is truly an art movieit actually has a lot of art in it 1 
just does not work 0 
great it was new packaged nice works good no problems and it came in less time then i expected 1 
im not eating here 0 
great pork sandwich 1 
the folks at otto always make us feel so welcome and special 1 
were jerks on the phone 0 
the basic premise is wasted since it is sidelined by the inexplicable focus on the documentary crew 0 
im still infatuated with this phone 1 
the lighting is awful 0 
the movie is full of wonderful dancing hence the title 1 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
the seller is very understanding and patient i would definitely buy from them again 1 
i found this place by accident and i could not be happier 1 
it was way over fried 0 
the service was extremely slow 0 
reception is terrible and full of static 0 
and sometimes it was so embarrassing that i had to look away 0 
if you stay in vegas you must get breakfast here at least once 1 
the only thing really worth watching was the scenery and the house because it is beautiful 1 
very slow at seating even with reservation 0 
the characters were all funny and had the peculiarity of not having a true lead character 1 
the acting was decidely wooden though no worse than a period universal b movie 0 
the wind and the lion is well written and superbly acted 1 
i enjoyed reading this book to my children when they were little 1 
i cant tell you how disappointed i was 0 
do not make the same mistake as me 0 
it is super charged up for use as a small hybrid palmtopcameracellphone and excels in those roles 1 
your staff spends more time talking to themselves than me 0 
muddy low quality sound and the casing around the wires insert was poorly super glued and slid off 0 
reaching for the bottom row is uncomfortable and the send and end keys are not where i expect them to be3 0 
works great 1 
otherwise easy to install and use clear sound 1 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
this product is clearly not ready for prime time i dont care how cool it looks if you cant tell a call is coming in its worthless 0 
overall a great experience 1 
crisp and clear 1 
today was my first taste of a buldogis gourmet hot dog and i have to tell you it was more than i ever thought possible 1 
the characters are interesting even if a bit predictable 1 
this movie has a cutting edge to it 1 
i could not recommend these more 0 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
the story itself is just predictable and lazy 0 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
all in all im quite satisfied with this purchase 1 
not worth it 0 
this place is horrible and way overpriced 0 
delicious and i will absolutely be back 1 
what a big waste of time 0 
if there was ever a movie that needed wordofmouth to promote this is it 1 
this is a witty and delightful adaptation of the dr seuss book brilliantly animated by upas finest and thoroughly deserving of its academy award 1 
be sure to order dessert even if you need to pack it togo the tiramisu and cannoli are both to die for 1 
kris kristoffersen is good in this movie and really makes a difference 1 
appears to actually outperform the original battery from china that came with my v325i 1 
five star plus plus 1 
reaching for the bottom row is uncomfortable and the send and end keys are not where i expect them to be3 0 
the worst was the salmon sashimi 0 
the inside is really quite nice and very clean 1 
very very disappointed ordered the 35 big bay plater 0 
he is almost unbearable to watch on screen he has little to no charisma and terrible comedic timing 0 
their steaks are 100 recommended 1 
nice solid keyboard 1 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
after a year the battery went completely dead on my headset 0 
utterly without merit on any level this is akin to torture 0 
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1 
seafood was limited to boiled shrimp and crab legs but the crab legs definitely did not taste fresh 0 
the macarons here are insanely good 1 
regrettably the film fails 0 
watching washing machine twirling around wouldnt hurt your eyes as much as this show 0 
i highly recommend this device to everyone 1 
gotta love those closeups of slimy drooling teeth 1 
perfect for someone me who only likes beer ice cold or in this case even colder 1 
worst phone ever 0 
phenomenal food service and ambiance 1 
the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach 0 
this one wants to surf on the small wave of space movies in 1998 deep impact and armageddon and this one fails everywhere 0 
im not sure what he was trying to do with this film 0 
1010 1 
terrible phone holder 0 
it is very comfortable to wear as well which is probably the most important aspect about using a case 1 
total brunch fail 0 
great steak great sides great wine amazing desserts 1 
there was hardly any meat 0 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
what a piece of junk i lose more calls on this phone 0 
the directing seems too pretentious 0 
one character is totally annoying with a voice that gives me the feeling of fingernails on a chalkboard 0 
there was no chemistry between ben affleck and sandra bullock in this film and i couldnt understand why he would consider even leaving his wifetobe for this chick that he supposedly was knocked out by 0 
on three different occasions i asked for well done or medium well and all three times i got the bloodiest piece of meat on my plate 0 
but she is still a bad actress repeating her robotic face moves in each of her pictures 0 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
i got this phone on reccomendation from a relative and im glad i did 1 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
its too bad the food is so damn generic 0 
the reception is excellent 1 
nothing at all to recommend 0 
this movie contained an allstar cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i havent seen before 1 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
good protection and does not make phone too bulky 1 
i was deeply impressed with the character he played 1 
very very sad 0 
i really recommend this faceplates since it looks very nice elegant and cool 1 
this is such a fun and funny movie 1 
i will never forget it now 1 
its a great item 1 
yes its shiny on front side and i love it 1 
god and i can never get that 90 minutes back 0 
the delivery was on time 1 
come hungry leave happy and stuffed 1 
nice spicy and tender 1 
the poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying 0 
absolutel junk 0 
they have great dinners 1 
thanks good a movie like this was done and released 1 
it plays louder than any other speaker of this size the price is so low that most would think the quality is lacking however its not 1 
i could not stand to even watch it for very long for fear of losing iq 0 
it really is impressive that the place hasnt closed down 0 
there was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters 0 
i came back today since they relocated and still not impressed 0 
end of days is one of the worst bigbudget action movies ive ever seen 0 
one character is totally annoying with a voice that gives me the feeling of fingernails on a chalkboard 0 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
this is infuriating 0 
our server was super nice and checked on us many times 1 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
horrible 0 
highly recommended a 1 
will order from them again 1 
i have had this phone for over a year now and i will tell you its not that great 0 
what a waste of time 0 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
great brunch spot 1 
nice headphones for the price and they work great 1 
god and i can never get that 90 minutes back 0 
meredith m was better than all right 1 
the reception is excellent 1 
it was so boring 0 
i believe that pitch black was done well 1 
food arrived quickly 1 
a good time 1 
the cast is always entertaining as usual 1 
the sweet potato tots were good but the onion rings were perfection or as close as i have had 1 
i love lane but ive never seen her in a movie this lousy 0 
good quality 1 
a great touch 1 
unfortunately we must have hit the bakery on leftover day because everything we ordered was stale 0 
terrible product and waste of money 0 
after 20 minutes wait i got a table 0 
the roast beef sandwich tasted really good 1 
the plot has more holes than a pair of fishnet stockings and the direction and editing is astonishingly ham fisted 0 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
it did not work in my cell phone plug i am very up set with the charger 0 
while i managed to bend the leaf spring back in place the metal now has enough stress that it will break on the next drop 0 
there is however some pretty good acting at least for this type of film 1 
it is rare when a filmmaker takes the time to tell a worthy moral tale with care and love that doesnt fall into the trap of being overly syrupy or over indulgent 1 
i think it was robert ryans best film because he portrayed someone like my father and he was a schizophrenic in real lifemy father although he never murdered anyone but was affected more so during the second world war which made him worse 1 
i had absolutely no problem with this headset linking to my 8530 blackberry curve 1 
i like the fact that it rests lightly against your ear rather than inside 1 
the ri style calamari was a joke 0 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
we had fantastic service and were pleased by the atmosphere 1 
the folks at otto always make us feel so welcome and special 1 
we have tried 2 units and they both failed within 2 months pros 0 
both actors truly understand and become their particular character delivering a convincing sincere performance 1 
mishima is extremely uninteresting 0 
waiter was a jerk 0 
sam shepards portrayal of a gung ho marine was sobering 1 
the only thing i wasnt too crazy about was their guacamole as i dont like it puréed 0 
really bad 0 
love it great armband 1 
the potato chip order was sad i could probably count how many chips were in that box and it was probably around 12 0 
i seriously cannot believe that the owner has so many unexperienced employees that all are running around like chickens with their heads cut off 0 
i am far from a sushi connoisseur but i can definitely tell the difference between good food and bad food and this was certainly bad food 0 
and i really did find them funny 1 
end of days is one of the worst bigbudget action movies ive ever seen 0 
items stated as included from the description are not included 0 
i love that they put their food in nice plastic containers as opposed to cramming it in little paper takeout boxes 1 
there is so much good food in vegas that i feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to rice and company 0 
ill even say it again  this is torture 0 
the staff is always super friendly and helpful which is especially cool when you bring two small boys and a baby 1 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
good price 1 
it looks very nice 1 
hated it 0 
but now i was completely grossed out 0 
classywarm atmosphere fun and fresh appetizers succulent steaks baseball steak 1 
again lame 0 
the telephone repair man was really funny and his reactions to the nuts and bitchy boss were truly genuine 1 
my friend did not like his bloody mary 0 
the nano stated itmy son was dissapointed 0 
this film highlights the fundamental flaws of the legal process that its not about discovering guilt or innocence but rather is about who presents better in court 1 
if you havent choked in your own vomit by the end by all the cheap drama and worthless dialogue youve must have bored yourself to death with this waste of time 0 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
the very idea of it was lame take a minor character from a mediocre pg13 film and make a complete nonsequel while changing its tone to a pgrated family movie 0 
the telephone repair man was really funny and his reactions to the nuts and bitchy boss were truly genuine 1 
the aerial scenes were welldone 1 
it was a huge awkward 15lb piece of cow that was 34ths gristle and fat 0 
helen baxendale is a very credible lady macbeth who can be very cheerfull at times and sometimes she just looks like a naughty girl but deadly in her taste for blood and evil 1 
because both ears are occupied background is not distracting at all 1 
while you dont yet hear mickey speak there are tons of sound effects and music throughout the filmsomething we take for granted now but which was a huge crowd pleaser in 1928 1 
i had the mac salad and it was pretty bland so i will not be getting that again 0 
sauce was tasteless 0 
i like steiners because its dark and it feels like a bar 1 
in the span of an hour i had two people exclaim whoa is that the new phone on tv 1 
third the cheese on my friends burger was cold 0 
i bought two of them and neither will charge 0 
avoid this one if you can 0 
would not recommend to others 0 
another thing i didnt really like is when a character got punched in the face a gallon of blood would spew forth soon after 0 
the headsets are easy to use and everyone loves them 1 
i have to jiggle the plug to get it to line up right to get decent volume 0 
buttons are too small 0 
unfortunately it will not recharge my iphone 4s despite connecting it from multiple power sources imac external battery wall outlet etc 0 
ill be looking for a new earpiece 0 
all i can do is whine on the internet so here it goesthe more i use the thing the less i like it 0 
it is so small and you dont even realize that it is there after a while of getting used to it 1 
join the club and get awesome offers via email 1 
very clear quality sound and you dont have to mess with the sound on your ipod since you have the sound buttons on the headset 1 
heres where the movie really pied me off 0 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
the food wasnt good 0 
if you look for authentic thai food go else where 0 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
i love that they put their food in nice plastic containers as opposed to cramming it in little paper takeout boxes 1 
not enough volume 0 
a very very very slowmoving aimless movie about a distressed drifting young man 0 
we were promptly greeted and seated 1 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
i tried the cape cod ravoli chickenwith cranberrymmmm 1 
great time family dinner on a sunday night 1 
we also ordered the spinach and avocado salad the ingredients were sad and the dressing literally had zero taste 0 
i advise everyone do not be fooled 0 
he is one of my favourite directors and one of the most talented directors in the history of cinema 1 
there was so much hype over this phone that i assumed it was the best my mistake 0 
great phone 1 
good audio quality 1 
seafood was limited to boiled shrimp and crab legs but the crab legs definitely did not taste fresh 0 
this is the phone to get for 2005 i just bought my s710a and all i can say is wow 1 
this movie is terrible 0 
just reading on the specs alone makes you say wow 1 
reaching for the bottom row is uncomfortable and the send and end keys are not where i expect them to be3 0 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
to my disbelief each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods i have ever tasted 0 
this was a poor remake of my best friends wedding 0 
all in all im quite satisfied with this purchase 1 
conclusion i loved it 1 
i have only had it for a few weeks but so far so good 1 
do not make the same mistake as me 0 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
come hungry leave happy and stuffed 1 
after two i felt disgusting 0 
great product fast shipping 1 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
this place is good 1 
i really wanted the plantronics 510 to be the right one but it has too many issues for methe good 0 
what on earth is irons doing in this film 0 
not tasty and the texture was just nasty 0 
every time he opened his mouth you expect to hear you see kids pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show 0 
best headset ever 1 
it is a joy to use 1 
so for our enjoyment we get to see them run around play games and be dangerous 1 
her lines seem to have been written by a fifteen year old though they are trying oh so so hard to sound like how a fifteen year old would really um you know well talk 0 
i know that sounds funny but to me it seemed like sketchy technology that wouldnt work wellwell this one works great 1 
almost all of the songs in cover girl are oldfashioned and not very tuneful 0 
i have always used corded headsets and the freedom from the wireless is very helpful 1 
lucy bell is so much higher than this crap and for her to sink this low is quite depressing 0 
i highly recommend this modest priced cellular phone 1 
to sum the film up breeders is a terrible cheaply made horror movie that should be avoided like the ebola virus 0 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
seafood was limited to boiled shrimp and crab legs but the crab legs definitely did not taste fresh 0 
if it were possible to give them zero stars theyd have it 0 
too politically correct 0 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
will be back again 1 
highly recommend for any one who has a blue tooth phone 1 
low quality 0 
i can assure you that you wont be disappointed 1 
the food was terrible 0 
we waited for forty five minutes in vain 0 
in other words the content level of this film is enough to easily fill a dozen other films 1 
the microphone also works well but according to people i have called it applifies everything 1 
it also had a new problem 0 
i went to bachi burger on a friends recommendation and was not disappointed 1 
which is precisely why i am giving it such a bad review 0 
personally i think it shows that people should learn to find a compromise them self without involving other people into issue 1 
so anyone near you will hear part of your conversation 0 
the casting is also horrible cause all you see is a really really bad actors period 0 
speaking of the music it is unbearably predictably and kitchy 0 
bluetooth does not work phone locks up screens just flash up and now it just makes calls randomly while in my pocket locked 0 
one character is totally annoying with a voice that gives me the feeling of fingernails on a chalkboard 0 
the food is about on par with dennys which is to say not good at all 0 
the characters were all funny and had the peculiarity of not having a true lead character 1 
im probably one of the few people to ever go to ians and not like it 0 
and the beans and rice were mediocre at best 0 
1010 1 
their monster chicken fried steak and eggs is my all time favorite 1 
damn good steak 1 
the interplay between martin and emilio contains the same wonderful chemistry we saw in wall street with martin and charlie 1 
exactly what i wanted 1 
the meat was pretty dry i had the sliced brisket and pulled pork 0 
terrible service 0 
the casting is also horrible cause all you see is a really really bad actors period 0 
the attempts at humor were pitiful and story is so awful it dosent bear thinking about which basically involves a vulcan stealing the enterprise to find god seriously i just didnt care about any of this film and oh not to mention uhura does a belly dance to distract male guards 0 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
i found this place by accident and i could not be happier 1 
it is well made easy to access the phone and has a handy detachable belt clip 1 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
this is simply the best bluetooth headset for sound quality 1 
they work about 2 weeks then break 0 
it is wonderful and inspiring to watch and i hope that it gets released again on to video or dvd 1 
updatewent back for a second time and it was still just as amazing 1 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
after 3 months screen just went black all of a sudden 0 
it has northern humour and positive about the community it represents 1 
the performances are not improved by improvisation because the actors now have twice as much to worry about not only whether theyre delivering the line well but whether the line itself is any good 0 
the classic maine lobster roll was fantastic 1 
very disappointed in accessoryone 0 
i probably would not go here again 0 
for a product that costs as much as this one does i expect it to work far better and with greater ease than this thing does 0 
this if the first movie ive given a 10 to in years 1 
then i exchanged for the same phone even that had the same problem 0 
this pair of headphones is the worst that i have ever had soundwise 0 
but it wasnt anything at all just one big yawn 0 
the plot simply rumbles on like a machine desperately depending on the addition of new scenes 0 
the directing seems too pretentious 0 
the voice recognition thru the handset is excellent 1 
the shipping time was also very quick 1 
the cast was great 1 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
this is hands down the best phone ive ever had 1 
i dont like this nokia either 0 
and the beans and rice were mediocre at best 0 
also its a real treat to see anthony quinn playing crazy horse 1 
worst foodservice ive had in a while 0 
if good intentions made a film great then this film might be one of the greatest films ever made 1 
the construction of the headsets is poor 0 
it is light has plenty of battery capacity and is very confortable to wear for somewhat extended periods of time 1 
i had strawberry tea which was good 1 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
2 thumbs up to this seller 1 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
defective crap 0 
we were promptly greeted and seated 1 
it was so bad i had lost the heart to finish it 0 
food was good service was good prices were good 1 
theres barely a boring moment in the film and there are plenty of humorous parts 1 
it was just not a fun experience 1 
it works 1 
this scene is very strong and unpleasant 0 
the battery life is highly unacceptable 0 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
ive never been treated so bad 0 
there are massive levels massive unlockable characters its just a massive game 1 
definitely will come back here again 1 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
it was a bit too sweet not really spicy enough and lacked flavor 0 
i must say i have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again 1 
unreliable im giving up 0 
i came back today since they relocated and still not impressed 0 
not enough volume 0 
the soundtrack wasnt terrible either 1 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
ordered an appetizer and took 40 minutes and then the pizza another 10 minutes 0 
generally it just lacked imagination 0 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
the only suspense i was feeling was the frustration at just how retarded the girls were 0 
john garfield ann revere lilli plmer william conrad canada leeand filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screenjames wong howe 1 
there is a brilliant twist ending 1 
it has everything i need and i couldnt ask for more 1 
voice recognition is tremendous 1 
its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
our server was super nice and checked on us many times 1 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
i have to jiggle the plug to get it to line up right to get decent volume 0 
sauce was tasteless 0 
im in az all the time and now have my new spot 1 
i bought this phone as a replacement for my startac and have regretted it since 0 
reaching for the bottom row is uncomfortable and the send and end keys are not where i expect them to be3 0 
i wasnt expecting oscar material but this 0 
the problem i have is that they charge 1199 for a sandwich that is no bigger than a subway sub which offers better and more amount of vegetables 0 
so far it has worked like a charm 1 
what happened next was prettyoff putting 0 
yes this film does require a rather significant amount of puzzlesolving but the pieces fit together to create a beautiful picture 1 
this item is great installed it let it charged up overnite and it has been working good every since with no problems 1 
conclusion very filling meals 1 
they have horrible attitudes towards customers and talk down to each one when customers dont enjoy their food 0 
i ate there twice on my last visit and especially enjoyed the salmon salad 1 
you also cannot take pictures with it in the case because the lense is covered 0 
food was delicious 1 
it was awesome 1 
makes it easier to keep up with my bluetooth when im not wearing it 0 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
the only thing i did like was the prime rib and dessert section 1 
id like to return it 0 
mark my words this is one of those cult films like evil dead 2 or phantasm that people will still be discovering and falling in love with 20 30 40 years down the line 1 
no plot whatsoever 0 
i tried the cape cod ravoli chickenwith cranberrymmmm 1 
we definately enjoyed ourselves 1 
i rate this movie 910 1 
it looks very nice 1 
i would highly recommend this 1 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
a very good film indeed about great and unconditional love 1 
it has a very good plot it holds your complete attention the acting is superb tom wilkinson was fantastic and emily watson was also very good 1 
plug was the wrong size 0 
youll love how thin it is 1 
i came back today since they relocated and still not impressed 0 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
tasted like dirt 0 
the telephone repair man was really funny and his reactions to the nuts and bitchy boss were truly genuine 1 
i saw it as a child on tv back in 1973 when it was the stranger and i loved it 1 
i received my orders well within the shipping timeframe everything was in good working order and overall i am very excited to have this source 1 
this place receives stars for their appetizers 1 
honeslty it didnt taste that fresh 0
