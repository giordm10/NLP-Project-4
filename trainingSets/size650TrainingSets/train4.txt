when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
the writers were smack on and i think the best actors and actresses were a bonus to the showthese characters were so real 1 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
pretty piece of junk 0 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
our server was very nice and even though he looked a little overwhelmed with all of our needs he stayed professional and friendly until the end 1 
returned 8 hours later 0 
i left the theater with a lilt in my step joy in my heart and hope for the human race 1 
good service very clean and inexpensive to boot 1 
its not what it says it is 0 
lovely little thriller from hitchcock with lots of nice shenanigans surrounding a murdered spy a kidnapped child a nasty church a foreign plot and some random taxidermists 1 
some highlights great quality nigiri here 1 
what a waste of money and time 0 
this phone might well be the worst ive ever had in any brand 0 
i am a fan of his this movie sucked really bad 0 
i can take a little bad service but the food sucks 0 
five star plus plus 1 
the manager was the worst 0 
im not sure what he was trying to do with this film 0 
it is perfect for a sitdown family meal or get together with a few friends 1 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
it works 1 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
the ri style calamari was a joke 0 
very disappointed 0 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
all of the tapas dishes were delicious 1 
lots of holes in the script 0 
dont make the same mistake i did 0 
audio quality is poor very poor 0 
cant upload ringtones from a third party 0 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
filmiing was less expansive 0 
the selection on the menu was great and so were the prices 1 
i immediately said i wanted to talk to the manager but i did not want to talk to the guy who was doing shots of fireball behind the bar 0 
i will be back many times soon 1 
the food sucked which we expected but it sucked more than we could have imagined 0 
dont miss it 1 
this was like the final blow 0 
sorry i will not be getting food from here anytime soon 0 
no complaints 1 
an instant classic with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits 1 
it was clear that she had the range and ability to pull off this part 1 
kris kristoffersen is good in this movie and really makes a difference 1 
i highly recommend this case 1 
the pleather case doesnt fit 0 
i highly recommend this device to everyone 1 
it plays louder than any other speaker of this size the price is so low that most would think the quality is lacking however its not 1 
our server was very nice and even though he looked a little overwhelmed with all of our needs he stayed professional and friendly until the end 1 
good value works fine power via usb car or wall outlet 1 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
the scenes are often funny and occasionally touching as the characters evaluate their lives and where they are going 1 
the seller is very understanding and patient i would definitely buy from them again 1 
great food and great service in a clean and friendly setting 1 
the tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu 0 
the chips and sals a here is amazing 1 
i used bitpim a free program you can find on the internetto transfer data to the phonethe price of the cable was excellent 1 
i like steiners because its dark and it feels like a bar 1 
i really like this product over the motorola because it is allot clearer on the ear piece and the mic 1 
its practically perfect in all of them  a true masterpiece in a sea of faux masterpieces 1 
omg i felt like i had never eaten thai food until this dish 1 
i have to use the smallest earpieces provided but it stays on pretty well 1 
i literally vomited while watching this film 0 
an hour and a half i wish i could bring back 0 
a piece of cinematic garbage captured on celluloid 0 
the waitress and manager are so friendly 1 
any grandmother can make a roasted chicken better than this one 0 
truly awful 0 
i recommend this for everyone who loves film movies anythinga work of art 1 
im terribly disappointed that this film would receive so many awards and accolades especially when there are far more deserving works of film out there 0 
but this movie is not funny considering the ridiculousness of it 0 
then theres the plot holes 0 
how can you call yourself a steakhouse if you cant properly cook a steak i dont understand 0 
for a product that costs as much as this one does i expect it to work far better and with greater ease than this thing does 0 
the plot is nonsense that doesnt interest in the slightest way or have any uniqueness to it 0 
clever and a real crowdpleaserthis film still ranks among mickeys best films even after 80 wonderful years 1 
i love the ownerchef his one authentic japanese cool dude 1 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
low quality 0 
worst customer service 0 
on a positive note our server was very attentive and provided great service 1 
you wont regret it 1 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
the charger worked for about a week and then completely stopped charging my phone 0 
the pizza tasted old super chewy in not a good way 0 
i believe that pitch black was done well 1 
aside from its terrible lead this film has loads of other debits 0 
an interesting premise and billy drago is always good as a dangerous nutbag side note id love to see drago stephen mchattie and lance hendrikson in a flick together talk about raging cheekbones 1 
i was mortified 0 
we walked away stuffed and happy about our first vegas buffet experience 1 
then i watched it again two sundays ago march 20th 2005 and i began to really enjoy it and this time i taped the entire thing 1 
very easy to use 1 
good case 1 
if you dont find it too bad as again the unit comes with one earpad onlyi would not recommend this to anyone 0 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
we made the drive all the way from north scottsdale and i was not one bit disappointed 1 
recommend with confidence 1 
what on earth is irons doing in this film 0 
lange had become a great actress 1 
after trying many many handsfree gadgets this is the one that finally works well 1 
i gave it 5 stars then and im giving it 5 stars now 1 
dont make the same mistake i did 0 
lovely little thriller from hitchcock with lots of nice shenanigans surrounding a murdered spy a kidnapped child a nasty church a foreign plot and some random taxidermists 1 
the music in the film is really nice too 1 
i got the car charger and not even after a week the charger was brokeni went to plug it in and it started smoking 0 
the story starts too fast with absolutely no suspense or buildup in the slightest 0 
i am not a filmmaker nor am i a director but i would hide my head in the sand if id spent whatever amount of money and time on this movie 0 
in short dont bother with this movie 0 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
what happened next was prettyoff putting 0 
i would highly recommend this 1 
worth every penny 1 
due to this happening on every call i was forced to stop using this headset 0 
it was a drive to get there 0 
stay away from this store be careful 0 
the food was terrible 0 
the cow tongue and cheek tacos are amazing 1 
it is very educational for children 1 to 8 years old 1 
i do not know if this was emilio estevezs directorial debut but the pacing the interplay and development of the characters as well as some clever camera work surrounding the character estevez plays all suggest a natural eye 1 
blue ant is easy to use 1 
third the cheese on my friends burger was cold 0 
steve martin delivers a really funny performance of a middleaged upper class uptight white guy 1 
the least said about the acting the better 0 
unfortunately it did not work 0 
avoid at any and all costs 0 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
the classic maine lobster roll was fantastic 1 
everyone is very attentive providing excellent customer service 1 
about ten minutes into this film i started having second thoughts 0 
its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
service is quick and even to go orders are just like we like it 1 
i love it 1 
hitchcock is a great director 1 
about half way through this film i started to dislike it 0 
i didnt know pulled pork could be soooo delicious 1 
i bought this battery with a coupon from amazon and im very happy with my purchase 1 
the waitresses are very friendly 1 
the black eyed peas and sweet potatoes unreal 1 
the ending is so so perfect youll shed a tear 1 
this is probably the most irritating show i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
razr battery good buy 1 
the worst piece of crap ever along with the verizon customer service 0 
i have to use the smallest earpieces provided but it stays on pretty well 1 
great place to relax and have an awesome burger and beer 1 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
their steaks are 100 recommended 1 
and the rest of it just sits there being awful with soldiers singing songs about the masculinity they pledge themselves to hairsplitting about purity the admiration of swords etc 0 
they really want to make your experience a good one 1 
but this movie is definitely a below average rent 0 
best tacos in town by far 1 
works great 1 
waste your money on this game 1 
appetite instantly gone 0 
it worked very well 1 
good transmit audio 1 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
dont buy it 0 
people who like european films and art movies will like this movie 1 
i wasnt really impressed with strip steak 0 
the visual effects were awful 0 
the film has an ultracheap look to it 0 
avoid at all cost 0 
i think that it is a must see older john wayne film 1 
i have always used corded headsets and the freedom from the wireless is very helpful 1 
i recently tried caballeros and i have been back every week since 1 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
bland not a liking this place for a number of reasons and i dont want to waste time on bad reviewing ill leave it at that 0 
this may be the only bad film he ever made 0 
but its just not funny 0 
youll love how thin it is 1 
there were too many close ups 0 
there were too many close ups 0 
there are so many problems i dont know where to start 0 
works great 1 
ive had this bluetoooth headset for some time now and still not comfortable with the way it fits on the ear 0 
elias koteasjack palance play good roles angelina is hot and gets nakedbilly drago appears in this and is cool as usual a cameo by sven ole thorsen helps make this a very enjoyable movie with good acting and a decent budget 1 
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 
car charger as well as ac charger are included to make sure you never run out of juicehighy recommended 1 
we will not be coming back 0 
wont go back 0 
as for the mains also uninspired 0 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
its a fresh subtle and rather sublime effect 1 
it doesnt work in europe or asia 0 
the speaker is of low quality so as making the ring tones sound very cheap 0 
it is an excellent drama an excellent thriller and an excellent film 1 
dont waste your money 0 
the burrittos blah 0 
its not user friendly 0 
the jalapeno bacon is soooo good 1 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
will not be back 0 
but in any case the best part is you can download these pictures to your laptop using ir or even send pictures from your laptop to the phone 1 
my sister has one also and she loves it 1 
service is friendly and inviting 1 
the movie showed a lot of florida at its best made it look very appealing 1 
perfect for the ps3 1 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
today the graphics are crap 0 
conclusion very filling meals 1 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
horrible dont waste your time and money 0 
happy so far 1 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
the structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema 1 
great product 1 
i think not again 0 
fantastic food 1 
2 thumbs up to this seller 1 
the potatoes were like rubber and you could tell they had been made up ahead of time being kept under a warmer 0 
worth every penny 1 
the design is very good4 1 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
cumbersome design 0 
have been going since 2007 and every meal has been awesome 1 
while you dont yet hear mickey speak there are tons of sound effects and music throughout the filmsomething we take for granted now but which was a huge crowd pleaser in 1928 1 
they will customize your order any way youd like my usual is eggplant with green bean stir fry love it 1 
not nearly as good looking as the amazon picture makes it look 0 
did not like at all 0 
the story line is totally predictable 0 
from what my dinner companions told meeverything was very fresh with nice texture and taste 1 
unreliable im giving up 0 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
the structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema 1 
to sum the film up breeders is a terrible cheaply made horror movie that should be avoided like the ebola virus 0 
i am far from a sushi connoisseur but i can definitely tell the difference between good food and bad food and this was certainly bad food 0 
a great way to finish a great 1 
ordered a double cheeseburger got a single patty that was falling apart picture uploaded yeah still sucks 0 
the plot was the same as pretty much every other cheap horror 0 
horrible horrible protector 0 
the directing seems too pretentious 0 
this film offers many delights and surprises 1 
the kids are very cool too 1 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
we wont be going back 0 
horrible had to switch 3 times 0 
give this one a look 1 
frankly after cotton club and unfaithful it was kind of embarrassing to watch lane and gere in this film because it is bad 0 
other than that the leather is nice and soft the fit is very tight the cut out for the face is a good shape 1 
how stupid is that 0 
waitress was good though 1 
i did not have any problem with this item and would order it again if needed 1 
the phone takes forever to charge like 2 to 5 hours literally 0 
you cant beat that 1 
conclusion i loved it 1 
the phone is sturdy and waterproof 1 
if you are looking for a good quality motorola headset keep looking this isnt it 0 
what a mistake 0 
i never walked out of a movie faster 0 
the soundtrack sucked 0 
yet i enjoy watching it 1 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
it is very comfortable to wear as well which is probably the most important aspect about using a case 1 
doesnt work 0 
we have gotten a lot of compliments on it 1 
item arrived quickly and works great with my metro pcs samsung schr450 slider phone and sony premium sound in ear plugs 1 
the cast was great 1 
the ambiance isnt much better 0 
i have had this phone for over a year now and i will tell you its not that great 0 
the greek dressing was very creamy and flavorful 1 
kind of hard to mess up a steak but they did 0 
light weight i hardly notice it is there 1 
couldnt use the unit with sunglasses not good in texas 0 
level 5 spicy was perfect where spice didnt overwhelm the soup 1 
the scenes are often funny and occasionally touching as the characters evaluate their lives and where they are going 1 
i had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get some relief 0 
highquality chicken on the chicken caesar salad 1 
sucked most of the stuff does not work with my phone 0 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
when my order arrived one of the gyros was missing 0 
all of the tapas dishes were delicious 1 
great product for the price 1 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
i left the theater with a lilt in my step joy in my heart and hope for the human race 1 
seems like a good quick place to grab a bite of some familiar pub food but do yourself a favor and look elsewhere 0 
i never come again 0 
the use of slowmotion needlessly repeats itself throughout the movie but is well backed up by bad acting and bad is a kind word here no continuity scenes that are thrown in for no reason whatsoever vehicles that looked like they were made from a corn flakes box and a directorial style that bordered on stupidity 0 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
this is probably one of the least effective and utterly unoriginal films i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
verizon tech support walked my through a few procedures none of which worked and i ended up having to do a hard reset wiping out all my data 0 
despite the pans of reviewers i liked this movie 1 
the keyboard is a nice compromise between a full qwerty and the basic cell phone number keypad 1 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
i received it quickly and it works great 1 
i get absolutely horrible reception in my apartment where with other phones i have not had this problem 0 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
bluetooth range is good a few days ago i left my phone in the trunk got a call and carried the conversation without a hitch 1 
the cinematography is simply stunning to say the least and the fx are nothing if not stateoftheart 1 
think of the film being like a dream 1 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
went in for happy hour great list of wines 1 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
we are sending it back 0 
if you stay in vegas you must get breakfast here at least once 1 
spend your money and time some place else 0 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
it fits so securely that the ear hook does not even need to be used and the sound is better directed through your ear canal 1 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
the plastic breaks really easy on this clip 0 
would not reccommend 0 
these are the central themes of the film and they are handled ineptly stereotypically and with no depth of imagination 0 
avoid this film at all costs 0 
each day of the week they have a different deal and its all so delicious 1 
i was totally fascinated by the music the dancing everything 1 
the reception is excellent 1 
this greedy corporation will never see another dime from me 0 
the camera really likes her in this movie 1 
the flair bartenders are absolutely amazing 1 
this film tries to be a serious and sophisticated thrillerhorror flick and it fails miserably 0 
the sets especially designed to work with the camera are amazingstylized beautiful and effective 1 
one of my favorite purchases ever 1 
even if you love bad movies do not watch this movie 0 
perhaps i caught them on an off night judging by the other reviews but im not inspired to go back 0 
bland and flavorless is a good way of describing the barely tepid meat 0 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
about ten minutes into this film i started having second thoughts 0 
the cg opening sequence in space looked like it could have been created on microsoft slideshow for gods sake 0 
easy to pair with my samsung cell 1 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
nice ambiance 1 
unfortunately the ability to actually know you are receiving a call is a rather important feature and this phone is pitiful in that respect 0 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
this is truly an art movieit actually has a lot of art in it 1 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
i love the scream movies and all horror movies and this one ranks way up there 1 
this little device has transformed my organizational capability and made my life a whole lot easier 1 
works great 1 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
i think i was one of the people who found this another one of roths pearls 1 
this allows the possibility of double booking for the same date and time after the first 0 
so i had to take the battery out of the phone put it all back together and then restart it 0 
a week later after i activated it it suddenly died 0 
saw the movie today and thought it was a good effort good messages for kids 1 
its the best headset i have used 1 
it kept getting worse and worse so now im officially done 0 
dont buy this product it fails 0 
for a self proclaimed coffee cafe i was wildly disappointed 0 
nargile i think you are great 1 
nice headset priced right 1 
there is no real plot 0 
couldnt figure it out 0 
you wont be disappointed 1 
it worked very well 1 
very disappointed 0 
i struggle to find anything bad to say about it 1 
the worst phone ive ever had only had it for a few months 0 
they really want to make your experience a good one 1 
it is a really good show to watch 1 
stay away from this store be careful 0 
regrettably the film fails 0 
the han nan chicken was also very tasty 1 
nevertheless yet another wonderful film from the great masters stable 1 
its kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly its embarrassing how childlike the company is 0 
i will never forget it now 1 
like the other reviewer said you couldnt pay me to eat at this place again 0 
this place should honestly be blown up 0 
it really is impressive that the place hasnt closed down 0 
prosgood camera very nice pictures also has cool styles like black and white and more 1 
the plot such as it is is so derivative and predictable that the ending is like a mercy killing 0 
i am so tired of clichés that is just lazy writing and here they come in thick and fast 0 
i wasnt expecting oscar material but this 0 
at no point in the proceedings does it look remotely like america 0 
what makes this story different are the terrific production values faultless photography composition and editing the terrific casting the underappreciated brian keith playing a bully teddy and vivid history 1 
its like a bad two hour tv movie 0 
this is not moviemaking 0 
the sound is clear and the people i talk to on it are amazed at the quality too 1 
definitely a turn off for me i doubt ill be back unless someone else is buying 0 
meredith m was better than all right 1 
its this pandering to the audience that sabotages most of his films 0 
lewis blacks considerable talent is wasted here too as he is at his most incendiary when he is unrestrained which the pg13 rating certainly wont allow 0 
even allowing for poor production values for the time 1971 and the format some kind of miniseries this is baaaaaad 0 
the phone crashed completely and now i have to get it replaced 0 
and dont even get me started on the jerky camerawork 0 
then the film just dropped the ball 0 
very very fun chef 1 
definitely worth seeing its the sort of thought provoking film that forces you to question your own threshold of loneliness 1 
the acting by the whole cast could be put on a scale and balanced perfectly between overacting and underacting 0 
so absolutley fantastic 1 
it clicks into place in a way that makes you wonder how long that mechanism would last 0 
also the story and acting were weak 0 
you also cannot take pictures with it in the case because the lense is covered 0 
the food is rich so order accordingly 1 
id rather eat airline food seriously 0 
good value works fine power via usb car or wall outlet 1 
conclusion very filling meals 1 
bad script bad direction and horrible acting make this one plain bad 0 
it is light easy to use and has very clear reception and transmission 1 
service sucks 0 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
each day of the week they have a different deal and its all so delicious 1 
small sleek impressive looking practical setup with ample storage in place 1 
the decor is nice and the piano music soundtrack is pleasant 1 
simple lightweight and great fit 1 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
its pretty easy 1 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
it is an excellent drama an excellent thriller and an excellent film 1 
they made this case too small and is very difficult to install 0 
dont miss it 1 
its kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly its embarrassing how childlike the company is 0 
the food was delicious our bartender was attentive and personable and we got a great deal 1 
never again will i be dining at this place 0 
the budget was evidently very limited 0 
i gave it 5 stars because of the sound quality 1 
the warm beer didnt help 0 
its really easy 1 
the worst piece of crap ever along with the verizon customer service 0 
i had heard good things about this place but it exceeding every hope i could have dreamed of 1 
but now that it is out of warranty the same problems reoccurebottom line put your money somewhere else cingular will not support it 0 
i have to jiggle the plug to get it to line up right to get decent volume 0 
there was a warm feeling with the service and i felt like their guest for a special treat 1 
the pan cakes everyone are raving about taste like a sugary disaster tailored to the palate of a six year old 0 
everything about it is just bad 0 
it was a long time that i didnt see a so charismatic actor on screen 1 
gave up trying to eat any of the crust teeth still sore 0 
it was just too horrible 0 
i will come back here every time im in vegas 1 
a happy wonderful feel good ending 1 
the seller is very understanding and patient i would definitely buy from them again 1 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
dont buy this product it fails 0 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
howeverthe riingtones are not the best and neither are the games 0 
regrettably the film fails 0 
the acting by the whole cast could be put on a scale and balanced perfectly between overacting and underacting 0 
nice spicy and tender 1 
i dont think well be going back anytime soon 0 
speaking of the music it is unbearably predictably and kitchy 0 
i consider this theft 0 
they really want to make your experience a good one 1 
very good though 1 
this place is not quality sushi it is not a quality restaurant 0 
editing the editing of this film was phenomenal in my opinion 1 
i immediately said i wanted to talk to the manager but i did not want to talk to the guy who was doing shots of fireball behind the bar 0 
kind of hard to mess up a steak but they did 0 
the battery works great 1 
ordered a double cheeseburger got a single patty that was falling apart picture uploaded yeah still sucks 0 
after watching this film i wanted to learn more about the works of this artist 1 
the design might be ergonomic in theory but i could not stand having these in my ear 0 
setup went very smoothly 1 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
either way it sucks 0 
im still trying to get over how bad it was 0 
graphics is far from the best part of the game 0 
they work about 2 weeks then break 0 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
the foreigner is not worth one second of your time 0 
very good phone 1 
the acting helps the writing along very well maybe the idiotsavant sister could have been played better and it is a real joy to watch 1 
much more interesting more action more suspense and less of the unneeded controversy 1 
really awful 0 
absolutely great 1 
i recently tried caballeros and i have been back every week since 1 
another note about this phones appearance is that it really looks rather bland especially in the all black model 0 
the headset fulfills my requirements so i am happy with my purchase 1 
seller shipped quickly and much cheaper than the competitors 1 
used and dirty 0 
the cast is good 1 
pricing is a bit of a concern at mellow mushroom 0 
call me a nut but i think this is one of the best movies ever 1 
a pretty good product 1 
the service was terrible though 0 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
waited 2 hours never got either of our pizzas as many other around us who came in later did 0 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
i highly recommend this modest priced cellular phone 1 
i am very impressed with this headset from plantronics 1 
cant upload ringtones from a third party 0 
these are fabulous 1 
the tracfonewebsite is user friendly and makes it easy toactivate etc 1 
recommend with confidence 1 
it also had a new problem 0 
good show samsung 1 
the plot simply rumbles on like a machine desperately depending on the addition of new scenes 0 
the film is way too long 0 
if you are razr owneryou must have this 1 
if you see it you should probably just leave it on the shelf 0 
everything about this film is simply incredible 1 
item does not match picture 0 
total brunch fail 0 
not a good item it worked for a while then started having problems in my auto reverse tape player 0 
overall i would recommend this phone over the new walkman 1 
weird vibe from owners 0 
this is the kind of money that is wasted properly 1 
this place is way too overpriced for mediocre food 0 
awesome device 1 
it is light easy to use and has very clear reception and transmission 1 
i immediately said i wanted to talk to the manager but i did not want to talk to the guy who was doing shots of fireball behind the bar 0 
service sucks 0 
meredith m was better than all right 1 
the worst phone from samsungcrap this crappy samsung e715 is the worst i have ever seeen 0 
i was totally fascinated by the music the dancing everything 1 
avoid this establishment 0 
its very slow 0 
the instructions didnt explain that a microphone jack could be used 0 
the best example of how dumb the writing is when its established that you can turn the zombiestudents back into humans by removing a necklace containing a piece of the meteorite 0 
however the ear pads come off easily and after only one week i lost one 0 
then scene where they debated whether or not to sack the trumpeter who falsely was accused for the murder is pure horror really stupid 0 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
i consider this theft 0 
conclusion very filling meals 1

i was left shattered from the experience of watching this film and i took a good two hours to fully recover 0 
disappointed 0 
there are so many problems i dont know where to start 0 
the only suspense i was feeling was the frustration at just how retarded the girls were 0 
sooooo good 1 
our server was super nice and checked on us many times 1 
i must say i have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again 1 
a good film by a great director 1 
for that its worth checking out 1 
they have a really nice atmosphere 1 
a must study for anyone interested in the worst sins of industrial design 0 
this is was due to the fact that it took 20 minutes to be acknowledged then another 35 minutes to get our foodand they kept forgetting things 0 
we wont be returning 0 
level 5 spicy was perfect where spice didnt overwhelm the soup 1 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
the story unfolds in 18th century jutland and the use of period music played on period instruments is just one more fine touch 1 
avoid at all cost 0 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
great phone 1 
alexander nevsky is a great film 1 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
i can say that the desserts were yummy 1 
anne heche was utterly convincing 1 
the story line is totally predictable 0 
recommend with confidence 1 
the entire audience applauded at the conclusion of the film 1 
i recommend igo to anyone with different brand cell phonesmp3 players in the family 1 
the characters are interesting and you really care for them 1 
i immediately said i wanted to talk to the manager but i did not want to talk to the guy who was doing shots of fireball behind the bar 0 
the cast was great 1 
these are fabulous 1 
its fits like a glove and is strong secure and durable 1 
10 out of 10 for both the movie and trilogy 1 
a usable keyboard actually turns a pda into a realworld useful machine instead of just a neat gadget 1 
i recently tried caballeros and i have been back every week since 1 
product is exactly as described 1 
so for our enjoyment we get to see them run around play games and be dangerous 1 
the burger i got the gold standard a 17 burger and was kind of disappointed 0 
the chips and sals a here is amazing 1 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
the death row scenes were entirely unmoving 0 
these headphones were a great find and i think they are perhaps the best purchase ive made in the last several years seriously 1 
integrated seamlessly with the motorola razr phone 1 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
do not buy for d807wrongly advertised for d807 0 
for a self proclaimed coffee cafe i was wildly disappointed 0 
started watching this but didnt believe in any of the characters 0 
i can say that the desserts were yummy 1 
but its just not funny 0 
however paul schrader has indeed made a film about mishima that is both superb complex 1 
however paul schrader has indeed made a film about mishima that is both superb complex 1 
this is one of the best movies out there that shows such strong sibling bond for each other 1 
buttons are too small 0 
attempting artiness with black white and clever camera angles the movie disappointed became even more ridiculous as the acting was poor and the plot and lines almost nonexistent 0 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
a fantastic neighborhood gem 1 
i just saw this film and i recommend it 1 
unfortunately this is a bad movie that is just plain bad 0 
the basic premise is wasted since it is sidelined by the inexplicable focus on the documentary crew 0 
just whatever you do avoid groove as its the antithesis of all that is good about human traffic 0 
if she had not rolled the eyes we may have stayed not sure if we will go back and try it again 0 
it crackles with an unpredictable youthful energy but honestly i found it hard to follow and concentrate on it meanders so badly 0 
the portion was huge 1 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
verizon tech support walked my through a few procedures none of which worked and i ended up having to do a hard reset wiping out all my data 0 
i love the ringtones because they are so upbeat 1 
there are the usual hitchcock logic flaws 0 
before i go in to why i gave a 1 star rating please know that this was my third time eating at bachi burger before writing a review 0 
integrated seamlessly with the motorola razr phone 1 
this movie is terrible 0 
good servicecheck 1 
what a piece of junk i lose more calls on this phone 0 
the selection was probably the worst ive seen in vegasthere was none 0 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
the servers are not pleasant to deal with and they dont always honor pizza hut coupons 0 
phone falls out easily 0 
the sergeant pepper beef sandwich with auju sauce is an excellent sandwich as well 1 
this phone is pretty sturdy and ive never had any large problems with it 1 
lange had become a great actress 1 
i think not again 0 
he also came back to check on us regularly excellent service 1 
no ear loop needed its tiny and the sound is great 1 
never again will i be dining at this place 0 
emily watsons character is very strong and she has only to give a quick glance and you understand everything 1 
nothing short of magnificent photographycinematography in this film 1 
the writer gorman bechard undoubtedly did his homework because all references are industry and characterage appropriate 1 
i had a salad with the wings and some ice cream for dessert and left feeling quite satisfied 1 
this device is great in several situations1 1 
needless to say i wont be going back anytime soon 0 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
an interesting premise and billy drago is always good as a dangerous nutbag side note id love to see drago stephen mchattie and lance hendrikson in a flick together talk about raging cheekbones 1 
the attempts at humor were pitiful and story is so awful it dosent bear thinking about which basically involves a vulcan stealing the enterprise to find god seriously i just didnt care about any of this film and oh not to mention uhura does a belly dance to distract male guards 0

at a time when it seems that film animation has been dominated by disneypixars cgi masterpieces it is both refreshing and comforting to know that miyazaki is still relying on traditional handdrawn animation to tell his charming and enchanting stories 1 
what a piece of junk i lose more calls on this phone 0 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
im a bit disappointed 0 
my wife had the lobster bisque soup which was lukewarm 0 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
perhaps i caught them on an off night judging by the other reviews but im not inspired to go back 0 
basically the service was very bad 0 
i was not impressed by this product 0 
the story is also both funny and poignant at times 1 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
full of unconvincing cardboard characters it is blandly written by edward chodorov who also produced and is surprisingly directed by jean negulesco from whom one would expect a great deal more 0 
excellent dualpurpose headset 1 
their menu is diverse and reasonably priced 1 
service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is vegas and located inside the crystals shopping mall by aria 1 
i will come back here every time im in vegas 1 
i got the aluminum case for my new palm vx and it worked really wellit has protected my handheld perfectly so far 1 
im still trying to get over how bad it was 0 
sam shepards portrayal of a gung ho marine was sobering 1 
we recently witnessed her poor quality of management towards other guests as well 0 
tom wilkinson broke my heart at the end and everyone elses judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike 1 
the building itself seems pretty neat the bathroom is pretty trippy but i wouldnt eat here again 0 
the scenery that the two daughters paint and photograph are beautiful 1 
i cant see how this movie can be an inspiration to anyone to come out or overcome fear and rejection 0 
restaurant is always full but never a wait 1 
very tough and very short on flavor 0 
the delivery was on time 1 
thus far have only visited twice and the food was absolutely delicious each time 1 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it 1 
now this is a movie i really dislike 0 
it is an excellent drama an excellent thriller and an excellent film 1 
the folks at otto always make us feel so welcome and special 1 
they made this case too small and is very difficult to install 0 
this is an excellent film 1 
im terribly disappointed that this film would receive so many awards and accolades especially when there are far more deserving works of film out there 0 
it was that year however that reminded us that huston was still at the top of his game as evinced by his faithful adaptation of james joyces acclaimed novella the dead 1 
the film has an ultracheap look to it 0 
they will customize your order any way youd like my usual is eggplant with green bean stir fry love it 1 
the chefs were friendly and did a good job 1 
the story which was told so eloquently by francis ford coppola 25 years earlier really unfolds gradually and leaves room for the characters to develop 1 
cinematography the film was shot in an interesting way 1 
i work in the hospitality industry in paradise valley and have refrained from recommending cibo any longer 0 
also great directing and photography 1 
point your finger at any item on the menu order it and you wont be disappointed 1 
i got the car charger and not even after a week the charger was brokeni went to plug it in and it started smoking 0 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1
