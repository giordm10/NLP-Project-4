both films are terrible but to the credit of the 1986 version it was watchable 0 
the shower area is outside so you can only rinse not take a full shower unless you dont mind being nude for everyone to see 0 
yeah the movie pretty much sucked 0 
the range is very decent ive been able to roam around my house with the phone in the living room with no receptionsound quality issues 1 
the plot such as it is is so derivative and predictable that the ending is like a mercy killing 0 
the seasonal fruit was fresh white peach puree 1 
the attempts at humor were pitiful and story is so awful it dosent bear thinking about which basically involves a vulcan stealing the enterprise to find god seriously i just didnt care about any of this film and oh not to mention uhura does a belly dance to distract male guards 0 
it was a pale color instead of nice and char and has no flavor 0 
we ordered the duck rare and it was pink and tender on the inside with a nice char on the outside 1 
the atmosphere was great with a lovely duo of violinists playing songs we requested 1 
there is so much good food in vegas that i feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to rice and company 0 
you need at least 3 mins to get to your phone book from the time you first turn on the phonebattery life is short 0 
those burgers were amazing 1 
but despite these few flaws this case is of exceptional quality and well worth the additional costs of owning an official oem product 1 
this would not even be good as a made for tv flick 0 
i definitly recommend 1 
there is no plot or storyline 0 
we literally sat there for 20 minutes with no one asking to take our order 0 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
i wish i could enter negative values admins 0 
i hope this place sticks around 1 
an extensive menu provides lots of options for breakfast 1 
the cast was great 1 
a truly truly bad film 0 
we loved the place 1 
its just lame 0 
food was great and so was the serivce 1 
the story starts too fast with absolutely no suspense or buildup in the slightest 0 
dont waste your money 0 
good item low price 1 
the owners are super friendly and the staff is courteous 1 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
the management is rude 0 
if you simply want a small flip phone look elsewhere as the extra bells whistles are mediocre 0 
host staff were for lack of a better word bitches 0 
how can that bethe audio quality is poor 0 
jabra ear gels r the best 1 
so far it has worked like a charm 1 
not to mention the combination of pears almonds and bacon is a big winner 1 
the owners are super friendly and the staff is courteous 1 
it has everything i need and i couldnt ask for more 1 
went for lunch service was slow 0 
this place is disgusting 0 
their daily specials are always a hit with my group 1 
good value works fine power via usb car or wall outlet 1 
disappointed 0 
these are certainly very comfortable and functionality is decent 1 
the camera on the phone may be used as a dustpan when indoors id rather be using a disposable then this 0 
there is a lot of beautiful places 1 
talk about great customer service of course we will be back 1 
the design is very good4 1 
stay away from the q 0 
the selection on the menu was great and so were the prices 1 
if there was ever a movie that needed wordofmouth to promote this is it 1 
the budget was evidently very limited 0 
add betty white and jean smart and you have a great cast everyone played their parts really well 1 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
totally believable 1 
also its a real treat to see anthony quinn playing crazy horse 1 
meredith m was better than all right 1 
very good though 1 
the battery life is highly unacceptable 0 
theres really nothing bad i can say about this headset 0 
at around 4 pm i bought it at around 8pm i started to watch at around 815pm i fast forwarded the remaining film to see if there was anything left watchable for a human being with a brain but there wasnt 0 
an instant classic with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits 1 
their onscreen chemistry critical to the entire film is genuine 1 
she carries the movie well 1 
it works 1 
customer service was terrible 0 
comfortable nice range good battery life 1 
beware this is not a trashy cult movie this is trash period 0 
youll love it 1 
clear crisp sound 1 
now you know why i gave it a 10 1 
this phone might well be the worst ive ever had in any brand 0 
better than expected 1 
i love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it 1 
item does not match picture 0 
i know that sounds funny but to me it seemed like sketchy technology that wouldnt work wellwell this one works great 1 
i have purchased these for both family and friends and all enjoy their clarity and ease of use 1 
the live music on fridays totally blows 0 
i am very impressed with this headset from plantronics 1 
i wish i could return the unit and get back my money 0 
still waiting im sure this item would work well if i ever recieve it 0 
the cast of veteran actors are more than just a nostalgia trip 1 
as many people complained i found this headsets microphone was very weak 0 
gave up trying to eat any of the crust teeth still sore 0 
the most annoying thing about cover girl is the way in which rita hayworth is put up on a pedestal 0 
awful service 0 
i got to enjoy the seafood salad with a fabulous vinegrette 1 
i have purchased these for both family and friends and all enjoy their clarity and ease of use 1 
they work about 2 weeks then break 0 
however i needed some better instructions 0 
personally i think it shows that people should learn to find a compromise them self without involving other people into issue 1 
as for the service i thought it was good 1 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
its a great item 1 
what the hell kind of crap is that 0 
for people who are first timers in film making i think they did an excellent job 1 
all in all id expected a better consumer experience from motorola 0 
and if that isnt enough of a mess of a movie for you the picture is also marred with a constant use of studio sets and indoor exteriors 0 
very windresistant 1 
everything on the menu is terrific and we were also thrilled that they made amazing accommodations for our vegetarian daughter 1 
i also didnt like the on button it felt like it would crack with use 0 
best service and food ever maria our server was so good and friendly she made our day 1 
i received it quickly and it works great 1 
very windresistant 1 
also the story and acting were weak 0 
dont waste your on this one 0 
the films sole bright spot was jonah hill who will look almost unrecognizable to fans of the recent superbad due to the amount of weight he lost in the interim 1 
1010 1 
the only place good for this film is in the garbage 0 
food was great and so was the serivce 1 
makes it easier to keep up with my bluetooth when im not wearing it 0 
i highly recommend this case 1 
bacon is hella salty 1 
the entire audience applauded at the conclusion of the film 1 
gets the job done 1 
problem is that the ear loops are made of weak material and break easily 0 
never again will i be dining at this place 0 
its been my choice headset for yearsgreat sound good volume good noise cancellation 1 
overall i was not impressed and would not go back 0 
the phone takes forever to charge like 2 to 5 hours literally 0 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
i was mortified 0 
i wont spoil it but the ending in pretty amazing 1 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
the meat was pretty dry i had the sliced brisket and pulled pork 0 
once your food arrives its meh 0 
i was so insulted 0 
not a good item it worked for a while then started having problems in my auto reverse tape player 0 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
jabra ear gels r the best 1 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
im using it with an iriver spinn with case and it fits fine 1 
a very very very slowmoving aimless movie about a distressed drifting young man 0 
i have purchased these for both family and friends and all enjoy their clarity and ease of use 1 
on the negative its insipid enough to cause regret for another 2 hours of life wasted in front of the screen 0 
this blueant supertooth handsfree phone speaker is awesome 1 
this film tries to be a serious and sophisticated thrillerhorror flick and it fails miserably 0 
highly entertaining at all angles 1 
left very frustrated 0 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
what a mistake 0 
a good commentary of todays love and undoubtedly a film worth seeing 1 
just does not work 0 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
everyone is very attentive providing excellent customer service 1 
great pocket pc phone combination 1 
i as well wouldve given godfathers zero stars if possible 0 
very bad experience 0 
it is shameful 0 
we were promptly greeted and seated 1 
the roast beef sandwich tasted really good 1 
this was a poor remake of my best friends wedding 0 
the scenes with the ohsomature neighbourgirl are a misplace 0 
but despite these few flaws this case is of exceptional quality and well worth the additional costs of owning an official oem product 1 
there is nothing privileged about workingeating there 0 
prosgood camera very nice pictures also has cool styles like black and white and more 1 
the service was terrible though 0 
the problem i have is that they charge 1199 for a sandwich that is no bigger than a subway sub which offers better and more amount of vegetables 0 
not enough volume 0 
att is not clear sound is very distorted and you have to yell when you talk 0 
unreliable im giving up 0 
i knew when i saw the film that more great things were to come from this gifted actor 1 
none of the three sizes they sent with the headset would stay in my ears 0 
the 12 mega pixel camera being a part of a phone is reasonably good7 1 
full of unconvincing cardboard characters it is blandly written by edward chodorov who also produced and is surprisingly directed by jean negulesco from whom one would expect a great deal more 0 
what a waste 0 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
i really enjoyed eating here 1 
the only thing i wasnt too crazy about was their guacamole as i dont like it puréed 0 
never heard of any of them except cole who was totally unbelievable in the part 0 
also its slim enough to fit into my alarm clock docking station without removing the case 1 
blue ant is easy to use 1 
dont buy it 0 
they were goldencrispy and delicious 1 
helen baxendale is a very credible lady macbeth who can be very cheerfull at times and sometimes she just looks like a naughty girl but deadly in her taste for blood and evil 1 
dont waste your time here 0 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
the service was terrible though 0 
everything captain howdy says is either laughable or just plain stupid 0 
though the wind and the lion is told largely through the eyes of the son every member of the family can identify with one of the characters whether it be sean connerys noble brigand candace bergens feisty heroine john hustons wily john hay or steve kanalys spiffy radiant ruthless cando lieutenant roosevelts big stick 1 
its very attractive and appears to be of good quality 1 
great brunch spot 1 
i even dropped this phone into a stream and it was submerged for 15 seconds and it still works great 1 
and the rest of it just sits there being awful with soldiers singing songs about the masculinity they pledge themselves to hairsplitting about purity the admiration of swords etc 0 
however i needed some better instructions 0 
i think that it is a must see older john wayne film 1 
poor sound quality 0 
crisp and clear 1 
i felt as though her going to ireland did absolutely nothing whatsoever 0 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
overall i am psyched to have a phone which has all my appointments and contacts in and gets great reception 1 
the acting was bad 0 
it was probably dirt 0 
worst thai ever 0 
nice headset priced right 1 
garbo who showed right off the bat that her talents could carry over from the silent era i wanted to see some of her silent work but netflix doesnt seem to be stocking them 1 
their regular toasted bread was equally satisfying with the occasional pats of butter mmmm 1 
i would highly recommend this product 1 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
this place was such a nice surprise 1 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
unfortunately it was not good 0 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
theres also enough hypocrisy in this film to make me vomit 0 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
this was a different cut than the piece the other day but still wonderful and tender s well as well flavored 1 
i purchased this and within 2 days it was no longer working 0 
after the first charge kept going dead after 12 minutes 0 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
its a piece of crap 0 
how can anyone in their right mind ask for anything more from a movie than this 1 
i had strawberry tea which was good 1 
great food and awesome service 1 
i paid the bill but did not tip because i felt the server did a terrible job 0 
its been my choice headset for yearsgreat sound good volume good noise cancellation 1 
this movie is greatespecially if you enjoy visual arts 1 
excellent performance 1 
it was just not a fun experience 1 
the bathrooms are clean and the place itself is well decorated 1 
i used bitpim a free program you can find on the internetto transfer data to the phonethe price of the cable was excellent 1 
this wonderful experience made this place a muststop whenever we are in town again 1 
the staff are also very friendly and efficient 1 
all of the main players are mesmerising 1 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
maybe if they werent cold they would have been somewhat edible 0 
these are the nicest restaurant owners ive ever come across 1 
they will customize your order any way youd like my usual is eggplant with green bean stir fry love it 1 
better than youd expect 1 
i am so tired of clichés that is just lazy writing and here they come in thick and fast 0 
the film deserves strong kudos for taking this stand for having exceptional acting from its mostly lesserknown cast and for the superintelligent script that doesnt insult the audience or take the easy way out when it comes to white racism 1 
but kevin spacey is an excellent verbal tsunami as buddy ackerman  and totally believable because he is a great actor 1 
just dont know why they were so slow 0 
i was left shattered from the experience of watching this film and i took a good two hours to fully recover 0 
i can take a little bad service but the food sucks 0 
phenomenal food service and ambiance 1 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
saw the movie today and thought it was a good effort good messages for kids 1 
it plays louder than any other speaker of this size the price is so low that most would think the quality is lacking however its not 1 
i dont recommend unless your car breaks down in front of it and you are starving 0 
any ring toneoverall good phone to buy 1 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
im super pissd 0 
i got home to see the driest damn wings ever 0 
then i had to continue pairing it periodically since it somehow kept dropping 0 
we definately enjoyed ourselves 1 
the memories are murky but i can only say that i enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show 1 
once you get inside youll be impressed with the place 1 
the interplay between martin and emilio contains the same wonderful chemistry we saw in wall street with martin and charlie 1 
again lame 0 
the phone crashed completely and now i have to get it replaced 0 
light weight i hardly notice it is there 1 
this item worked great but it broke after 6 months of use 0 
doesnt last long 0 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
worth every penny 1 
doesnt work at all i bougth it for my l7c and its not working 0 
the selection of food was not the best 0 
this movie is greatespecially if you enjoy visual arts 1 
omg the food was delicioso 1 
one more thing i can tolerate political incorrectness very well im all for artistic freedom and suspension of disbelief but the slavic female character was just too much 0 
the only place good for this film is in the garbage 0 
yeah the movie pretty much sucked 0 
hence the whole story lacks a certain energy 0 
setup couldnt have been simpler 1 
it was so bad i had lost the heart to finish it 0 
linksys should have some way to exchange a bad phone for a refurb unit or something 0 
i love this phone 1 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
i dont think i will be back for a very long time 0 
you have to hold the phone at a particular angle for the other party to hear you clearly 0 
be sure to order dessert even if you need to pack it togo the tiramisu and cannoli are both to die for 1 
awsome device works great 1 
this is such a fun and funny movie 1 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
also were served hot bread and butter and home made potato chips with bacon bits on topvery original and very good 1 
to sum the film up breeders is a terrible cheaply made horror movie that should be avoided like the ebola virus 0 
how awesome is that 1 
and the beans and rice were mediocre at best 0 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
it failed to convey the broad sweep of landscapes that were a great part of the original 0 
the film deserves strong kudos for taking this stand for having exceptional acting from its mostly lesserknown cast and for the superintelligent script that doesnt insult the audience or take the easy way out when it comes to white racism 1 
the seasonal fruit was fresh white peach puree 1 
i particularly remember my senses being assaulted by strident cords of music that would blare out with very little warning and even less meaning 0 
best headset ever 1 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
it is just the sort of pap that is screened in the afternoon to punish the unemployed for not having jobs 0 
due to this happening on every call i was forced to stop using this headset 0 
in other words the content level of this film is enough to easily fill a dozen other films 1 
anyway the plot flowed smoothly and the malebonding scenes were a hoot 1 
avoid avoid avoid 0 
its fits like a glove and is strong secure and durable 1 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
the characters were all funny and had the peculiarity of not having a true lead character 1 
so i basically threw my money out the window for nothing 0 
design flaw 0 
cute quaint simple honest 1 
i had a seriously solid breakfast here 1 
the ambiance was incredible 1 
what should have been a hilarious yummy christmas eve dinner to remember was the biggest fail of the entire trip for us 0 
it is a really good show to watch 1 
if you want healthy authentic or ethic food try this place 1 
bacon is hella salty 1 
obviously they have a terrible customer service so you get what you pay for 0 
this greedy corporation will never see another dime from me 0 
this movie suffered because of the writing it needed more suspense 0 
the burger had absolutely no flavor the meat itself was totally bland the burger was overcooked and there was no charcoal flavor 0 
much less than the jawbone i was going to replace it with 1 
special thanks to dylan t for the recommendation on what to order all yummy for my tummy 1 
good service very clean and inexpensive to boot 1 
the entire audience applauded at the conclusion of the film 1 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
it looses connection to the phone even when it is within a couple feet between the two 0 
it has everything i need and i couldnt ask for more 1 
the acting from all involved and that includes those like shatner and nimoy is bad and washed out and making them seem as old as they look in real life the special effects are tacky like when spock has to rescue kirk on a jet pack when he falls down from a mountain 0 
fast service 1 
regrettably the film fails 0 
case was more or less an extra that i originally put on but later discarded because it scratched my ear 0 
how can anyone in their right mind ask for anything more from a movie than this 1 
just whatever you do avoid groove as its the antithesis of all that is good about human traffic 0 
my sashimi was poor quality being soggy and tasteless 0 
performed awful muffled tinny incoming sound and severe echo for those on the other end of the call 0 
in conclusion i will not bother with this movie because a volcano in los angeles is nothing but nonsense 0 
things that went wrong they burned the saganaki 0 
maybe its just their vegetarian fare but ive been twice and i thought it was average at best 0 
good audio quality 1 
ive had this bluetoooth headset for some time now and still not comfortable with the way it fits on the ear 0 
their rotating beers on tap is also a highlight of this place 1 
so good i am going to have to review this place twice once hereas a tribute to the place and once as a tribute to an event held here last night 1 
i immediately said i wanted to talk to the manager but i did not want to talk to the guy who was doing shots of fireball behind the bar 0 
everything is appalling 0 
in my house i was getting dropped coverage upstairs and no coverage in my basement 0 
highly recommended a 1 
youll love it 1 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
not much seafood and like 5 strings of pasta at the bottom 0 
the bose noise cancelling is amazing which is very important for a nyc commuter 1 
the only thing really worth watching was the scenery and the house because it is beautiful 1 
also the phone doesnt seem to accept anything except cbr mp3s preferably ripped by windows media player 0 
hated it 0 
a greasy unhealthy meal 0 
star trek v the final frontier is the worst in the series 0 
this was like the final blow 0 
at least think to refill my water before i struggle to wave you over for 10 minutes 0 
the basic premise is wasted since it is sidelined by the inexplicable focus on the documentary crew 0 
kieslowski never ceases to amaze me 1 
we recently witnessed her poor quality of management towards other guests as well 0 
however the ear pads come off easily and after only one week i lost one 0 
the script is a big flawed mess 0 
the servers went back and forth several times not even so much as an are you being helped 0 
the descriptions said yum yum sauce and another said eel sauce yet another said spicy mayowell none of the rolls had sauces on them 0 
either way it sucks 0 
dont make the same mistake i did 0 
beautiful styling though 1 
an excellent new restaurant by an experienced frenchman 1 
unfortunately it did not work 0 
an hour and a half i wish i could bring back 0 
so in a nutshell 1 the restaraunt smells like a combination of a dirty fish market and a sewer 0 
the design is very odd as the ear clip is not very comfortable at all 0 
the speaker is of low quality so as making the ring tones sound very cheap 0 
i had the chicken pho and it tasted very bland 0 
the shipping time was also very quick 1 
the presentation of the food was awful 0 
we will not be coming back 0 
i really enjoyed eating here 1 
walked in and the place smelled like an old grease trap and only 2 others there eating 0 
food was great and so was the serivce 1 
we had a group of 70 when we claimed we would only have 40 and they handled us beautifully 1 
i wasted my little money with this earpiece 0 
his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic 1 
but the service was beyond bad 0 
the incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film 1 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
ps the only scene in the movie that was cool is when the central character finds her room blown up 1 
if that bug never showed up i would have given a 4 for sure but on the other side of the wall where this bug was climbing was the kitchen 0 
if it were possible to give them zero stars theyd have it 0 
it works 1 
a usable keyboard actually turns a pda into a realworld useful machine instead of just a neat gadget 1 
i wasted my little money with this earpiece 0 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
i think the most wonderful parts literally full of wonder are the excerpts from his works 1 
item does not match picture 0 
there is no real plot 0 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
avoid avoid avoid 0 
the management is rude 0 
after 3 months screen just went black all of a sudden 0 
love this product 1 
an interesting premise and billy drago is always good as a dangerous nutbag side note id love to see drago stephen mchattie and lance hendrikson in a flick together talk about raging cheekbones 1 
never heard of any of them except cole who was totally unbelievable in the part 0 
good servicecheck 1 
the whole experience was underwhelming and i think well just go to ninja sushi next time 0 
easily none other cartoon made me laugh in a tender way before getting into dark sitcoms oriented for teenagers 1 
when it opens the battery connection is broken and the device is turned off 0 
ryans bar is definitely one edinburgh establishment i wont be revisiting 0 
it shouldnt take 30 min for pancakes and eggs 0 
generally it just lacked imagination 0 
very disappointed 0 
sorry i will not be getting food from here anytime soon 0 
one of my favorite purchases ever 1 
it quit working after id used it for about 18 months so i just purchased another one because this is the best headset ive ever owned 1 
not much flavor to them and very poorly constructed 0 
this one is simply a disappointment 0 
overall i wasnt very impressed with noca 0 
this phone works great 1 
but storm trooper is not even bad enough to make it to the list of wonderfully terrible movies 0 
a good quality bargain i bought this after i bought a cheapy from big lots that sounded awful and people on the other end couldnt hear me 1 
the restaurant atmosphere was exquisite 1 
i have been to very few places to eat that under no circumstances would i ever return to and this tops the list 0 
crostini that came with the salad was stale 0 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
the food is not tasty at all not to say its real traditional hunan style 0 
i will come back here every time im in vegas 1 
but storm trooper is not even bad enough to make it to the list of wonderfully terrible movies 0 
im a big fan of this series mostly due to anne rices style sensitivities and treatments 1 
also if your phone is dropped this case is not going to save it specially when dropped face down 0 
the live music on fridays totally blows 0 
it was a waste of my money 0 
from here on the widmark character turns unintentionally comical 0 
needless to say i wont be going back anytime soon 0 
excellent product for the price 1 
very bad experience 0 
that was funny 1 
everything on the menu is terrific and we were also thrilled that they made amazing accommodations for our vegetarian daughter 1 
great food and service huge portions and they give a military discount 1 
very disappointed 0 
too bad cause i know its family owned i really wanted to like this place 0 
we watched our waiter pay a lot more attention to other tables and ignore us 0 
only pros large seating area nice bar area great simple drink menu the best brick oven pizza with homemade dough 1 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
the chains which im no fan of beat this place easily 0 
call me a nut but i think this is one of the best movies ever 1 
i have always used corded headsets and the freedom from the wireless is very helpful 1 
id love to go back 1 
appears to actually outperform the original battery from china that came with my v325i 1 
this place is horrible and way overpriced 0 
i wouldnt see this movie again for free 0 
drinks took close to 30 minutes to come out at one point 0 
waitress was a little slow in service 0 
delicious nyc bagels good selections of cream cheese real lox with capers even 1 
lordy the khao soi is a dish that is not to be missed for curry lovers 1 
very funny 1 
utterly without merit on any level this is akin to torture 0 
your brain will attempt to shutdown as part of a primal impulse of selfpreservation 0 
i vomited in the bathroom mid lunch 0 
i have to use the smallest earpieces provided but it stays on pretty well 1 
delicious nyc bagels good selections of cream cheese real lox with capers even 1 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
it has northern humour and positive about the community it represents 1 
total letdown i would much rather just go to the camelback flower shop and cartel coffee 0 
one of my favorite purchases ever 1 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
my experience was terrible this was my fourth bluetooth headset and while it was much more comfortable than my last jabra which i hated 0 
the pan cakes everyone are raving about taste like a sugary disaster tailored to the palate of a six year old 0 
i love this cable it allows me to connect any miniusb device to my pc 1 
no actress has been worse used that june allison in this movie 0 
it was so boring 0 
i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
they were goldencrispy and delicious 1 
low quality 0 
the design is very good4 1 
this game rocks 1 
we will not be coming back 0 
though the wind and the lion is told largely through the eyes of the son every member of the family can identify with one of the characters whether it be sean connerys noble brigand candace bergens feisty heroine john hustons wily john hay or steve kanalys spiffy radiant ruthless cando lieutenant roosevelts big stick 1 
i wish i could return the unit and get back my money 0 
the owners really really need to quit being soooooo cheap let them wrap my freaking sandwich in two papers not one 0 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0

the scripting of the subtle comedy is unmatched by any movie in recent years 1 
what the hell kind of crap is that 0 
worst customer service ever 0 
an italian reviewer called this a small great film and thats right 1 
oh this is such a thing of beauty this restaurant 1 
i am so tired of clichés that is just lazy writing and here they come in thick and fast 0 
i love the ownerchef his one authentic japanese cool dude 1 
still its quite interesting and entertaining to follow 1 
the best example of how dumb the writing is when its established that you can turn the zombiestudents back into humans by removing a necklace containing a piece of the meteorite 0 
i really enjoyed eating here 1 
both do good jobs and are quite amusing 1 
now this is a movie i really dislike 0

the han nan chicken was also very tasty 1 
this is some seriously good pizza and im an expertconnisseur on the topic 1 
waste of money 0 
this movie is bad 0 
those burgers were amazing 1 
bad reception 0 
cant upload ringtones from a third party 0 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
treo and tmobile refused to replace it again and forced me to buy another phone without any kind of upgrade discount 0 
highly recommended a 1 
my boyfriend tried the mediterranean chicken salad and fell in love 1 
i could barely stomach the meal but didnt complain because it was a business lunch 0 
this is infuriating 0 
item arrived quickly and works great with my metro pcs samsung schr450 slider phone and sony premium sound in ear plugs 1 
in summary this was a largely disappointing dining experience 0 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
really awful 0 
it kept getting worse and worse so now im officially done 0 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
i own 2 of these cases and would order another 1 
krussel always good 1 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
all in all im quite satisfied with this purchase 1 
glad i didnt pay to see it 0 
the potatoes were like rubber and you could tell they had been made up ahead of time being kept under a warmer 0 
i have had this phone for over a year now and i will tell you its not that great 0 
echo problemvery unsatisfactory 0 
we watched our waiter pay a lot more attention to other tables and ignore us 0 
i gave it 5 stars then and im giving it 5 stars now 1 
very disappointed 0 
the noise shield is incrediable 1 
it lasts less than 3o minutes if i actually try to use the phonemy wife has the same phone with the same problem 0 
i loved it it was really scary 1 
this short film certainly pulls no punches 0 
there is simply no excuse for something this poorly done 0 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
there are the usual hitchcock logic flaws 0 
i found this move beautiful enjoyable and uplifting 1 
i had high hopes for this place since the burgers are cooked over a charcoal grill but unfortunately the taste fell flat way flat 0 
crisp and clear 1 
excellent phone 1 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
you truly take this journey through the eyes and soul of a child 1 
also its a real treat to see anthony quinn playing crazy horse 1 
i would have casted her in that role after ready the script 1 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
needless to say i wont be going back anytime soon 0 
i would highly recommend this product 1 
we would recommend these to others 1 
rip off over charge shipping 0 
really awful 0 
cooked to perfection and the service was impeccable 1 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
there are so many problems i dont know where to start 0 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
useless phone simply deaf 0 
we made the drive all the way from north scottsdale and i was not one bit disappointed 1 
they really want to make your experience a good one 1 
keep up the good work amazon 1 
the story unfolds in 18th century jutland and the use of period music played on period instruments is just one more fine touch 1 
and generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode 0 
the telephone repair man was really funny and his reactions to the nuts and bitchy boss were truly genuine 1 
not too screamy not to masculine but just right 1 
but kevin spacey is an excellent verbal tsunami as buddy ackerman  and totally believable because he is a great actor 1 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
i had a seriously solid breakfast here 1 
i will not return 0 
i was sitting in my vehicle with the cradle on my belt and the headset lost signal 0 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
no ear loop needed its tiny and the sound is great 1 
not good by any stretch of the imagination 0 
that was done in the second movie 0 
try them in the airport to experience some tasty food and speedy friendly service 1 
the phone was unusable and was not new 0 
this is a great little item 1 
this is a great product sure beats using your fingers 1 
my boyfriend and i came here for the first time on a recent trip to vegas and could not have been more pleased with the quality of food and service 1 
the story starts too fast with absolutely no suspense or buildup in the slightest 0 
service was exceptional and food was a good as all the reviews 1 
doesnt work 0 
the food was great as always compliments to the chef 1 
this hole in the wall has great mexican street tacos and friendly staff 1 
unless youre just out to visually collect all extant films of austens work you can skip this one 0 
your staff spends more time talking to themselves than me 0 
on the up side their cafe serves really good food 1 
to be honest with you this is unbelievable nonsense and very foolish 0 
nothing short of magnificent photographycinematography in this film 1 
phenomenal food service and ambiance 1 
i dont have very many words to say about this place but it does everything pretty well 1 
today the graphics are crap 0 
sound quality on both end is excellent i use headset to call my wife and ask my wife to use headset to call me 2 1 
if you do go see this movie bring a pillow or a girlfriendboyfriend to keep you occupied through out 0 
not even a hello we will be right with you 0 
it just blew 0 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
an interesting premise and billy drago is always good as a dangerous nutbag side note id love to see drago stephen mchattie and lance hendrikson in a flick together talk about raging cheekbones 1 
lot of holes in the plot theres nothing about how he became the emperor nothing about where he spend 20 years between his childhood and mature age 0 
i can assure you that you wont be disappointed 1 
i bought this phone as a replacement for my startac and have regretted it since 0 
very satisifed with that 1 
i could not stand to even watch it for very long for fear of losing iq 0 
in summary this was a largely disappointing dining experience 0 
i had heard good things about this place but it exceeding every hope i could have dreamed of 1 
either way it sucks 0 
the worst one of the series 0 
constantine gives everything the right intensity and seems to have a good understanding of the underlying psychological motivations 1 
i have eaten here multiple times and each time the food was delicious 1 
i have to use the smallest earpieces provided but it stays on pretty well 1 
soggy and not good 0 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
this is hands down the best phone ive ever had 1 
im pleased 1 
oh the charger seems to work fine 1 
he really didnt seem to want to be hosting his voiceovers were monotonous didnt get involved with the guests 0 
strike 2 who wants to be rushed 0 
i liked the patio and the service was outstanding 1 
the camera although rated at an impressive 13 megapixels renders images that fall well below expectations of such a relatively high resolution 0 
however the keypads are so tinny that i sometimes reach the wrong buttons 0 
motorola finally got the voice quality of a bluetooth headset right 1 
its quite simply the highest most superlative form of cinema imaginable 1 
design flaw 0 
the management is rude 0 
very windresistant 1 
i like the fact that it rests lightly against your ear rather than inside 1 
my only problem is i thought the actor playing the villain was a low rent michael ironside 0 
hands down my favorite italian restaurant 1 
the goat taco didnt skimp on the meat and wow what flavor 1 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
i can assure you that you wont be disappointed 1 
nice spicy and tender 1 
secondly hitchcock pretty much perfected the thriller and chase movie 1 
the movie is not completely perfect but titta di girolamo will stay with you for a long time after the vision of the movie 1 
everything from acting to cinematography was solid 1 
the fact is this film is a wonderful heartwarming tale about two people chasing their dreams 1 
i never walked out of a movie faster 0 
hated it 0 
i hate writing bad reviews about films especially those in which i really like the star but this film is so bad i dont believe for one second that anyone could have been proud of it 0 
saggy floppy piece of junk 0 
i cant use this case because the smell is disgusting 0 
i would definitely recommend the jabra bt250v for those who are looking for comfort clarity and a great price 1 
not as good as i had hoped 0 
as always the evening was wonderful and the food delicious 1 
con spotty service 0 
you need two hands to operate the screenthis software interface is decade old and cannot compete with new software designs 0 
whatever prompted such a documentary is beyond me 0 
everything from acting to cinematography was solid 1 
the acting was bad 0 
a greasy unhealthy meal 0 
you cant beat the price on these 1 
the cg opening sequence in space looked like it could have been created on microsoft slideshow for gods sake 0 
the cow tongue and cheek tacos are amazing 1 
its worth driving up from tucson 1 
my friend loved the salmon tartar 1 
best headset ever 1 
light weight i hardly notice it is there 1 
i got the aluminum case for my new palm vx and it worked really wellit has protected my handheld perfectly so far 1 
i had the mac salad and it was pretty bland so i will not be getting that again 0
