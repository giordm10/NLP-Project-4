lucy bell is so much higher than this crap and for her to sink this low is quite depressing 0 
four stars for the food the guy in the blue shirt for his great vibe still letting us in to eat 1 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
works great 1 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
woa talk about awful 0 
wont ever go here again 0 
unfortunately it did not work 0 
problem is that the ear loops are made of weak material and break easily 0 
treo and tmobile refused to replace it again and forced me to buy another phone without any kind of upgrade discount 0 
of course the footage from the 70s was grainy but that only enhanced the film 1 
the mic is great 1 
then theres the plot holes 0 
doesnt work at all i bougth it for my l7c and its not working 0 
the attempts at humor were pitiful and story is so awful it dosent bear thinking about which basically involves a vulcan stealing the enterprise to find god seriously i just didnt care about any of this film and oh not to mention uhura does a belly dance to distract male guards 0 
this second appearance of mickey mouse following the silent plane crazy earlier that year is probably his most famous filmmostly because it was so groundbreaking 1 
very good food great atmosphere1 1 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
any grandmother can make a roasted chicken better than this one 0 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
gotta love those closeups of slimy drooling teeth 1 
but it is great i would really recommend it 1 
i had high hopes for this place since the burgers are cooked over a charcoal grill but unfortunately the taste fell flat way flat 0 
they will customize your order any way youd like my usual is eggplant with green bean stir fry love it 1 
overall i rate this movie a 10 out of a 110 scale 1 
people couldnt hear me talk and i had to pull out the earphone and talk on the phone 0 
i would advise to not purchase this item it never worked very well 0 
i recommend this for everyone who loves film movies anythinga work of art 1 
im big fan of rpg games too but this movie its a disgrace to any selfrespecting rpger there is 0 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
i liked it 1 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
the lines the cuts the audio everything is wrong 0 
a film not easily forgotten 1 
what a waste of money and time 0 
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 
any grandmother can make a roasted chicken better than this one 0 
not a good bargain 0 
food was really boring 0 
it showed exactly how the government and the scientist argued for humanity and the reasons of the gadget 1 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
truly awful 0 
exceptionally bad 0 
the hockey scenes are terrible defensemen playing like theyre 5 years old goalies diving at shots that are 10 feet wide of the net etc 0 
also makes it easier to hold on to 1 
its a shame to see good actors like thomerson and james make a living in a mess like this 0 
the incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film 1 
the music in the film is really nice too 1 
it sure does beat the nachos at the movies but i would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant 0 
waste of 13 bucks 0 
im trying to return it for a refund 0 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
bad reception 0 
poor sound quality 0 
i liked it 1 
it is super charged up for use as a small hybrid palmtopcameracellphone and excels in those roles 1 
the results well are a shame 0 
i wasnt really impressed with strip steak 0 
this film offers many delights and surprises 1 
it clicks into place in a way that makes you wonder how long that mechanism would last 0 
i would have casted her in that role after ready the script 1 
artless camerawork endlessly presents us with the ugliest setting imaginable ie 0 
nothing at all to recommend 0 
the food was barely lukewarm so it must have been sitting waiting for the server to bring it out to us 0 
this phone might well be the worst ive ever had in any brand 0 
i wasnt expecting oscar material but this 0 
the secondary plot line is incomprehensible and its relation to the primary plot line is mystifying 0 
iam very pleased with my purchase 1 
if you simply want a small flip phone look elsewhere as the extra bells whistles are mediocre 0 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
ive missed numerous calls because of this reason 0 
i would recommend purchasing the jabra jx10 series 2 which works flawlessly with my moto q go figure 1 
sooooo good 1 
once your food arrives its meh 0 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
but storm trooper is not even bad enough to make it to the list of wonderfully terrible movies 0 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
you cant beat that 1 
piece of trash 0 
everything was good and tasty 1 
the handsfree part works fine but then the car tries to download the address book and the treo rebootsoverall i still rate this device high 1 
but i definitely would not eat here again 0 
it was clear that she had the range and ability to pull off this part 1 
dont buy this product it fails 0 
i didnt want the clip going over the top of my ear causing discomfort 0 
all the bread is made inhouse 1 
the fact is this film is a wonderful heartwarming tale about two people chasing their dreams 1 
worst customer service ever 0 
almost everyone involved must be return to school acting is utterly predictable and bad script is pile of garbage all round 0 
to sum the film up breeders is a terrible cheaply made horror movie that should be avoided like the ebola virus 0 
good audio quality 1 
was not happy 0 
the acting is like watching wooden puppets moving around and reading from a book thats how bad it is 0 
its very slow 0 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
the food was barely lukewarm so it must have been sitting waiting for the server to bring it out to us 0 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
this is a great place to eat 1 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
everything was good and tasty 1 
it showed exactly how the government and the scientist argued for humanity and the reasons of the gadget 1 
hitchcock is a great director 1 
the dialogue sucked 0 
the chips and salsa were really good the salsa was very fresh 1 
as i said abovepretty useless 0 
good case 1 
very disappointed in accessoryone 0 
good value works fine power via usb car or wall outlet 1 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
i was so insulted 0 
as for the service im a fan because its quick and youre being served by some nice folks 1 
im so happy to be here 1 
the live music on fridays totally blows 0 
a standout scene 1 
jamie foxx absolutely is ray charles 1 
but i definitely would not eat here again 0 
still waiting im sure this item would work well if i ever recieve it 0 
krussel always good 1 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
initially the local sites in the film which was filmed here in buffalo intrigued me 1 
kind of flops around 0 
if you stay in vegas you must get breakfast here at least once 1 
i liked it 1 
the bose noise cancelling is amazing which is very important for a nyc commuter 1 
every thing on phone work perfectly she like it 1 
still waiting im sure this item would work well if i ever recieve it 0 
it works fine on my motorola 325 cellphone and a lot better than the wornout battery did 1 
it was clear that she had the range and ability to pull off this part 1 
these are certainly very comfortable and functionality is decent 1 
it worked very well 1 
arrived quickly and much less expensive than others being sold 1 
very unreliable service from tmobile 0 
this film and i use that word loosely is an insult to the moviegoing public 0 
this one is simply a disappointment 0 
lifetime does not air it enough so if anyone knows what store sells it let me know because this is a musthave 1 
bad characters bad story and bad acting 0 
aside from its terrible lead this film has loads of other debits 0 
easily none other cartoon made me laugh in a tender way before getting into dark sitcoms oriented for teenagers 1 
i found this place by accident and i could not be happier 1 
the live music on fridays totally blows 0 
gets a signal when other verizon phones wont 1 
if you love death and decay and shakespears lyrics this is the one 1 
the phone gets extremely hot 0 
i would recommend saving room for this 1 
it has been a winner for us 1 
almost everyone involved must be return to school acting is utterly predictable and bad script is pile of garbage all round 0 
my rating just 3 out of 10 0 
never again will i be dining at this place 0 
great audio 1 
putting the race card aside lets look at the major flaw in the film they destroy latifas character 0 
then as if i hadnt wasted enough of my life there they poured salt in the wound by drawing out the time it took to bring the check 0 
this blueant supertooth handsfree phone speaker is awesome 1 
avoid this one if you can 0 
i believe that pitch black was done well 1 
steve martin delivers a really funny performance of a middleaged upper class uptight white guy 1 
after one bite i was hooked 1 
disappointing accessory from a good manufacturer 0 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
excellent dualpurpose headset 1 
1010 1 
this film and i use that word loosely is an insult to the moviegoing public 0 
the volume switch rocketed out of the unit to a destination unknown 0 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
dont waste your time 0 
i hate to disagree with my fellow yelpers but my husband and i were so disappointed with this place 0 
good servicecheck 1 
service was very prompt 1 
i connected my wifes bluetoothmotorola hs850 to my phone and it worked like a charm whether the phone was in my pocket or the case 1 
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 
love the margaritas too 1 
meredith m was better than all right 1 
then our food came out disappointment ensued 0 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
its also great to see that renowned silent screenwriter frances marion hasnt missed a step going from silent to sound 1 
this particular model would not work with my motorola q smartphone 0 
i thought errol flynn was brilliant as custer and has since become my favourite actor 1 
think it over when you plan to own this onethis sure is the last moto phone for me 0 
nice case feels good in your hands 1 
i dont have to be an accountant to know im getting screwed 0 
im using it with an iriver spinn with case and it fits fine 1 
the selection was probably the worst ive seen in vegasthere was none 0 
case was more or less an extra that i originally put on but later discarded because it scratched my ear 0 
definitely worth seeing its the sort of thought provoking film that forces you to question your own threshold of loneliness 1 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
as many people complained i found this headsets microphone was very weak 0 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
everything about this film is simply incredible 1 
but now that it is out of warranty the same problems reoccurebottom line put your money somewhere else cingular will not support it 0 
buyerbe very careful 0 
utter crap sound quality is terrible 0 
utter crap sound quality is terrible 0 
this is so embarassing and also my ears hurt if i try to push the ear plug into my ear 0 
wow very spicy but delicious 1 
i felt as though her going to ireland did absolutely nothing whatsoever 0 
drinks took close to 30 minutes to come out at one point 0 
i am very happy 1 
this is truly an art movieit actually has a lot of art in it 1 
poor sound quality 0 
you cant relate with them hell you barely can understand them 0 
the story line is totally predictable 0 
both of the egg rolls were fantastic 1 
it is a true classic 1 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
works great when my cat attacked the phone he scratched the protective strip instead of destroying the screen 1 
item does not match picture 0 
everything about it is just bad 0 
back to good bbq lighter fare reasonable pricing and tell the public they are back to the old ways 1 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
overall i wasnt very impressed with noca 0 
then our food came out disappointment ensued 0 
you cant beat that 1 
this hole in the wall has great mexican street tacos and friendly staff 1 
i would recommend saving room for this 1 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
the menu had so much good stuff on it i could not decide 1 
food was really boring 0 
you cant relate with them hell you barely can understand them 0 
this place is handsdown one of the best places to eat in the phoenix metro area 1 
we recently witnessed her poor quality of management towards other guests as well 0 
dont buy it 0 
the film deserves strong kudos for taking this stand for having exceptional acting from its mostly lesserknown cast and for the superintelligent script that doesnt insult the audience or take the easy way out when it comes to white racism 1 
from what my dinner companions told meeverything was very fresh with nice texture and taste 1 
i found a six inch long piece of wire in my salsa 0 
i contacted the company and they told me that although the unit was still under warranty if i couldnt produce my receipt i was out of luck 0 
the mic there is a joke and the volume is quite low 0 
i think i was one of the people who found this another one of roths pearls 1 
only had this a month but its worked flawlessly so far 1 
instead we got a bore fest about a whiny spoiled brat babysitting 0 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
i have to use the smallest earpieces provided but it stays on pretty well 1 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
to sum the film up breeders is a terrible cheaply made horror movie that should be avoided like the ebola virus 0 
my phone doesnt slide around my car now and the grip prevents my phone from slipping out of my hand 1 
i wouldnt return 0 
my boyfriend tried the mediterranean chicken salad and fell in love 1 
as a sushi lover avoid this place by all means 0 
the success of the film depends on the casting of sydney greenstreet as the alexander yardley character 1 
and finally after all that we get to an ending that wouldve been great had it been handled by competent people and not jerry falwell 0 
this is a great deal 1 
it works fine on my motorola 325 cellphone and a lot better than the wornout battery did 1 
it wasnt busy at all and now we know why 0 
im in az all the time and now have my new spot 1 
highly recommended for all ages although the younger set will probably not appreciate some of the more subtle references they will certainly appreciate one galley scene in particular 1 
i enjoyed reading this book to my children when they were little 1 
we had so much to say about the place before we walked in that he expected it to be amazing but was quickly disappointed 0 
oh this is such a thing of beauty this restaurant 1 
unfortunately cover girl is an example of how hollywood used to exploit women for financial gain 0 
my husband said she was very rude did not even apologize for the bad food or anything 0 
i have tried these cables with my computer and my ipod and it works just fine 1 
i am very impressed with this headset from plantronics 1 
ive only had my bluetooth for a few weeks but i really like it 1 
awesome service and food 1 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
but this movie is not funny considering the ridiculousness of it 0 
as a sushi lover avoid this place by all means 0 
the voice recognition thru the handset is excellent 1 
its just adorable seeing mickey playing turkey in the straw in a highly imaginative if occasionally cruel way 1 
both the hot sour the egg flower soups were absolutely 5 stars 1 
but kevin spacey is an excellent verbal tsunami as buddy ackerman  and totally believable because he is a great actor 1 
regardless the film fails on most levels 0 
sucked most of the stuff does not work with my phone 0 
ample portions and good prices 1 
very disappointing 0 
to call this movie a drama is ridiculous 0 
it will drive you barking mad 0 
as for the killer dont expect anything original or even remotely frightening 0 
all the bread is made inhouse 1 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
stopped by during the late may bank holiday off rick steve recommendation and loved it 1 
poor voice clarity 0 
the poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying 0 
the staff is great the food is delish and they have an incredible beer selection 1 
wow very spicy but delicious 1 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
the soundtrack wasnt terrible either 1 
the price is reasonable and the service is great 1 
this place has it 1 
started watching this but didnt believe in any of the characters 0 
best tacos in town by far 1 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
seems like a good quick place to grab a bite of some familiar pub food but do yourself a favor and look elsewhere 0 
the steak and the shrimp are in my opinion the best entrees at gc 1 
i dont like this nokia either 0 
a piece of cinematic garbage captured on celluloid 0 
stay away from this store be careful 0 
not a good item it worked for a while then started having problems in my auto reverse tape player 0 
you also cannot take pictures with it in the case because the lense is covered 0 
the movie in movie situations in the beginning and through the game that is played with her by the acting coach are fascinating 1 
everything was gross 0 
definitely will come back here again 1 
not much dialogue not much music the whole film was shot as elaborately and aesthetically like a sculpture 1 
garbo who showed right off the bat that her talents could carry over from the silent era i wanted to see some of her silent work but netflix doesnt seem to be stocking them 1 
the food is rich so order accordingly 1 
that was funny 1 
worthwhile 1 
dont make the same mistake i did 0 
dont buy this product 0 
great phone 1 
after arguing with verizon regarding the dropped calls we returned the phones after two days 0 
stopped by during the late may bank holiday off rick steve recommendation and loved it 1 
everything was gross 0 
go and see it 1 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
the plot such as it is is so derivative and predictable that the ending is like a mercy killing 0 
i saw this movie and i thought this is a stupid movie 0 
fantastic service here 1 
service is quick and friendly 1 
the cocktails are all handmade and delicious 1 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
so good i am going to have to review this place twice once hereas a tribute to the place and once as a tribute to an event held here last night 1 
emily watsons character is very strong and she has only to give a quick glance and you understand everything 1 
it was a long time that i didnt see a so charismatic actor on screen 1 
the charger arrived within the promised timeframe but it did not work 0 
the volume for the ringer is real good you have choices how loud 1 
the han nan chicken was also very tasty 1 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
sooooo good 1 
nothing at all to recommend 0 
it worked very well 1 
ordered a double cheeseburger got a single patty that was falling apart picture uploaded yeah still sucks 0 
oh this is such a thing of beauty this restaurant 1 
ive had no trouble accessing the internet downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions 1 
im not eating here 0 
used and dirty 0 
brilliant 1 
ive missed numerous calls because of this reason 0 
and if that isnt enough of a mess of a movie for you the picture is also marred with a constant use of studio sets and indoor exteriors 0 
this is some seriously good pizza and im an expertconnisseur on the topic 1 
sprint charges for this service 0 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
of course the acting is blah 0 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
its like a bad two hour tv movie 0 
very prompt service 1 
but it is great i would really recommend it 1 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
dont waste your time watching this rubbish nonresearched film 0 
avoid at all cost 0 
which is precisely why i am giving it such a bad review 0 
useless phone simply deaf 0 
everything was perfect the night we were in 1 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
i wouldnt return 0 
the lead man is charismafree 0 
there is nothing privileged about workingeating there 0 
wont work right or atleast for me 0 
i have two more years left in this contract and i hate this phone 0 
down the drain because of a weak snap 0 
the restaurant atmosphere was exquisite 1 
hated it 0 
comfortable fit you need your headset to be comfortable for at least an hour at a time if not for an entire day 1 
beware this is not a trashy cult movie this is trash period 0 
great for ipods too 1 
defective crap 0 
excellent starter wireless headset 0 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
the problem i have is that they charge 1199 for a sandwich that is no bigger than a subway sub which offers better and more amount of vegetables 0 
this product had a strong rubberpetroleum smell that was unbearable after a while and caused me to return it 0 
the seller is very understanding and patient i would definitely buy from them again 1 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
i am a fan of his this movie sucked really bad 0 
painful on the ear 0 
if you have several dozen or several hundred contacts then imagine the fun of sending each of them one by one 0 
to those who find this movie intelligent or even masterful i can only say its your intelligence and your imagination you obviously used to try and make some sense of this pitiful attempt its in our human nature to try and make sense of things 0 
as many people complained i found this headsets microphone was very weak 0 
everything from acting to cinematography was solid 1 
the first thing that happened was that the tracking was off 0 
i think not again 0 
then i had to continue pairing it periodically since it somehow kept dropping 0 
i give it 2 thumbs down 0 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
i highly recommend this device to everyone 1 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
its just painful 0 
but i dont like it 0 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
this is the place where i first had pho and it was amazing 1 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
i think the most wonderful parts literally full of wonder are the excerpts from his works 1 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
i will never forget it now 1 
does not work 0 
this product had a strong rubberpetroleum smell that was unbearable after a while and caused me to return it 0 
all of the tapas dishes were delicious 1 
to my disbelief each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods i have ever tasted 0 
the only thing really worth watching was the scenery and the house because it is beautiful 1 
no actress has been worse used that june allison in this movie 0 
as many people complained i found this headsets microphone was very weak 0 
you need at least 3 mins to get to your phone book from the time you first turn on the phonebattery life is short 0 
seafood was limited to boiled shrimp and crab legs but the crab legs definitely did not taste fresh 0 
predictable but not a bad watch 1 
great steak great sides great wine amazing desserts 1 
ill put this gem up against any movie in terms of screenplay cinematography acting postproduction editing directing or any other aspect of filmmaking 1 
i will never forget it now 1 
this movie contained an allstar cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i havent seen before 1 
very disappointing 0 
i got it because it was so small and adorable 1 
there is simply no excuse for something this poorly done 0 
i get absolutely horrible reception in my apartment where with other phones i have not had this problem 0 
it works 1 
linked to my phone without effort 1 
all in all i give this one a resounding 9 out of 10 1 
not good for the money 0 
i put the latest os on it v115g and it now likes to slow to a crawl and lock up every once in a while 0 
this is one of the best movies out there that shows such strong sibling bond for each other 1 
the food is about on par with dennys which is to say not good at all 0 
freezes frequently4 0 
putting the race card aside lets look at the major flaw in the film they destroy latifas character 0 
eew this location needs a complete overhaul 0 
once you get inside youll be impressed with the place 1 
but the actingeven that of such professionals as drago and debbie rochonwas terrible the directing worse perhaps contributory to the former the dialog chimplike and the camera work barely tolerable 0 
service is perfect and the family atmosphere is nice to see 1 
the nano stated itmy son was dissapointed 0 
up there with the best of melville 1 
im surprised this is a good quality car charger and theres not much reviews about it 1 
good protection and does not make phone too bulky 1 
there is really nothing for me at postinos hope your experience is better 0 
elias koteasjack palance play good roles angelina is hot and gets nakedbilly drago appears in this and is cool as usual a cameo by sven ole thorsen helps make this a very enjoyable movie with good acting and a decent budget 1 
the death row scenes were entirely unmoving 0 
easy to pair with my samsung cell 1 
there is nothing privileged about workingeating there 0 
it has all the features i want 1 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
very very fun chef 1 
brilliance indeed 1 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
there is no real plot 0 
as a courtroom drama its compelling as an indictment on the american justice system its frightening 1 
great choice 1 
a disappointment 0 
the pizza selections are good 1 
the writers were smack on and i think the best actors and actresses were a bonus to the showthese characters were so real 1 
best tacos in town by far 1 
however my girl was complain that some time the phone doesnt wake up like normal phone does 0 
a must study for anyone interested in the worst sins of industrial design 0 
i love the ringtones because they are so upbeat 1 
sauce was tasteless 0 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
i couldnt think of a better way to end the film but a smile on my face great way to wrap up an amazing film and trilogy 1 
just does not work 0 
it has a very good plot it holds your complete attention the acting is superb tom wilkinson was fantastic and emily watson was also very good 1 
crisp and clear 1 
total waste of time 0 
it wasnt busy at all and now we know why 0 
the cashier was friendly and even brought the food out to me 1 
setup couldnt have been simpler 1 
mediocre food 0 
they have horrible attitudes towards customers and talk down to each one when customers dont enjoy their food 0 
it is the best charger i have seen on the market yet 1 
both of them were truly unbelievably good and i am so glad we went back 1 
really pleased with this product so far 1 
dont waste your money 0 
i saw this movie and i thought this is a stupid movie 0 
they have a really nice atmosphere 1 
i paid the bill but did not tip because i felt the server did a terrible job 0 
lightweight and works well 1 
if you do watch it however there are small consolations the actresses playing annes sisters each do a wonderful job with their roles 1 
the block was amazing 1 
this really is how vegas fine dining used to be right down to the menus handed to the ladies that have no prices listed 1 
this is one of the best movies out there that shows such strong sibling bond for each other 1 
but above all the exquisite visual composition of each moment with inventive and elegant use of closeup camera angle and lighting including pointillistic faux home movie footage is a wonder and joy to behold 1 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
ordered an appetizer and took 40 minutes and then the pizza another 10 minutes 0 
secondly hitchcock pretty much perfected the thriller and chase movie 1 
go watch it 1 
lasted one day and then blew up 0 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
this does not fit the palm tungsten e2 and it broke the first time i tried to plug it in 0 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
for that price i can think of a few place i would have much rather gone 0 
its like a really sexy party in your mouth where youre outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party 1 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
i had ordered a motorola data cable got a very well finished and working product 1 
the script is a big flawed mess 0 
big disappointment with calendar sync 0 
it was a very superficial movie and it gave me the feeling that i was watching play rather than a film 0 
they could be used as exemplars for any set designer 1 
disappointing experience 0 
bad script bad direction and horrible acting make this one plain bad 0 
i cannot believe that the actors agreed to do this film 0 
this pair of headphones is the worst that i have ever had soundwise 0 
worked perfectly 1 
worst martini ever 0 
we had so much to say about the place before we walked in that he expected it to be amazing but was quickly disappointed 0 
after a year the battery went completely dead on my headset 0 
it crackles with an unpredictable youthful energy but honestly i found it hard to follow and concentrate on it meanders so badly 0 
i never come again 0 
a piece of cinematic garbage captured on celluloid 0 
we loved the biscuits 1 
the acting sucks the music sucks the script sucks the pacing sucks the special fx suck the directing sucks basically this movie sucks 0 
that said our mouths and bellies were still quite pleased 1 
it is indescribably the most annoying and idiotic show i have ever seen 0 
blue ant is easy to use 1 
this is truly an art movieit actually has a lot of art in it 1 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
car charger as well as ac charger are included to make sure you never run out of juicehighy recommended 1 
i bought two of them and neither will charge 0 
the story line is just awful 0 
i had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get some relief 0 
i literally vomited while watching this film 0 
i purcashed this for the car charger and it does not work 0 
10 out of 10 stars 1 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
they do not last forever but is not overly expensive to replaceeasy to operate and the sound is much better than others i have tried 1 
a happy wonderful feel good ending 1 
the hockey scenes are terrible defensemen playing like theyre 5 years old goalies diving at shots that are 10 feet wide of the net etc 0 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
by the time the film ended i not only disliked it i despised it 0 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
the structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema 1 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
the camera although rated at an impressive 13 megapixels renders images that fall well below expectations of such a relatively high resolution 0 
if you have not seen this movie i definitely recommend it 1 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
the chicken dishes are ok the beef is like shoe leather 0 
battery chargelife is quite long 1 
although i very much liked the look and sound of this place the actual experience was a bit disappointing 0 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
crash is a depressing little nothing that provokes emotion but teaches you nothing if you already know racism and prejudice are bad things 0 
but other than that the movie seemed to drag and the heroes didnt really work for their freedom 0 
the battery runs down quickly 0 
food was great and so was the serivce 1 
tonight i had the elk filet specialand it sucked 0 
nice case feels good in your hands 1 
cooked to perfection and the service was impeccable 1 
the secondary plot line is incomprehensible and its relation to the primary plot line is mystifying 0 
thanks again to amazon for having the things i need for a good price 1 
def coming back to bowl next time 1 
after all the rave reviews i couldnt wait to eat herewhat a disappointment 0 
conclusion i loved it 1 
i love lane but ive never seen her in a movie this lousy 0 
i dont know exactly what it is about this movie but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our familys memories 1 
not only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic but it also managed to give away the entire movie and im not exaggerating every moment every plot point every joke is told in the trailer 0 
also the phone doesnt seem to accept anything except cbr mp3s preferably ripped by windows media player 0 
babie bop is very cute 1 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
now the pizza itself was good the peanut sauce was very tasty 1 
now i know that i made a wise decision 1 
wow very spicy but delicious 1 
for a product that costs as much as this one does i expect it to work far better and with greater ease than this thing does 0 
the tracfonewebsite is user friendly and makes it easy toactivate etc 1 
nice leather 1 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
fans of the genre will be in heaven 1 
it defeats the purpose of a bluetooth headset 0 
almost all of the songs in cover girl are oldfashioned and not very tuneful 0 
the owner used to work at nobu so this place is really similar for half the price 1 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
its a fresh subtle and rather sublime effect 1 
in addition it feels amp looks as if the phone is all lightweight cheap plastic 0 
the songs were the best and the muppets were so hilarious 1 
i would recommend this 1 
every element of this story was so over the top excessively phony and contrived that it was painful to sit through 0 
the nachos are a must have 1 
there is a brilliant twist ending 1 
its just lame 0 
this movie was kind of long in length but i enjoyed every minute of it 1 
it really is impressive that the place hasnt closed down 0 
i as well wouldve given godfathers zero stars if possible 0 
this item worked great but it broke after 6 months of use 0 
yes its shiny on front side and i love it 1 
sam shepards portrayal of a gung ho marine was sobering 1 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
the staff is always super friendly and helpful which is especially cool when you bring two small boys and a baby 1 
works as described 1 
but in terms of the writing its very fresh and bold 1 
excellent product for the price 1 
the phone takes forever to charge like 2 to 5 hours literally 0 
i bought this to use with my kindle fire and absolutely loved it 1 
it is super charged up for use as a small hybrid palmtopcameracellphone and excels in those roles 1 
great software for motorolas 1 
i dont think ill be running back to carlys anytime soon for food 0 
i will not be eating there again 0 
spend your money and time some place else 0 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
it doesnt make you look cool 0 
lucy bell is so much higher than this crap and for her to sink this low is quite depressing 0 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
my husband said she was very rude did not even apologize for the bad food or anything 0 
also great directing and photography 1 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
a world better than 95 of the garbage in the theatres today 1 
the food was delicious our bartender was attentive and personable and we got a great deal 1 
it is light has plenty of battery capacity and is very confortable to wear for somewhat extended periods of time 1 
disappointment i hate anything that goes in my ear 0 
in an interesting part of town this place is amazing 1 
we loved the place 1 
it was awesome 1 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
the phone crashed completely and now i have to get it replaced 0 
best headset ever 1 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
the server was very negligent of our needs and made us feel very unwelcome i would not suggest this place 0 
as a sushi lover avoid this place by all means 0 
best service and food ever maria our server was so good and friendly she made our day 1 
my mother and brother had to do thiswhen i saw robert ryan portraying this type of man it was a very good imitation of this type of individual and i was impressed 1 
as a sushi lover avoid this place by all means 0 
im terribly disappointed that this film would receive so many awards and accolades especially when there are far more deserving works of film out there 0 
first the bathrooms at this location were dirty seat covers were not replenished just plain yucky 0 
no additional ear gels provided and no instructions whatsoever 0 
i highly recommend these and encourage people to give them a try 1 
you wont regret it 1 
its a feelgood film and thats how i felt when i came out of the cinema 1 
the building itself seems pretty neat the bathroom is pretty trippy but i wouldnt eat here again 0 
both of them were truly unbelievably good and i am so glad we went back 1 
overall i like there food and the service 1 
black water is a thriller that manages to completely transcend its limitations its an indie flick by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience 1 
as many people complained i found this headsets microphone was very weak 0 
the ambiance isnt much better 0 
the price is reasonable and the service is great 1 
this is such a fun and funny movie 1 
a piece of junk that broke after being on my phone for 2 days 0 
product is useless since it does not have enough charging current to charge the 2 cellphones i was planning to use it with 0 
they will customize your order any way youd like my usual is eggplant with green bean stir fry love it 1 
this was my first and only vegas buffet and it did not disappoint 1 
if you want healthy authentic or ethic food try this place 1 
its worth driving up from tucson 1 
constantine gives everything the right intensity and seems to have a good understanding of the underlying psychological motivations 1 
very true to shakespear and a must for all shakespear fans 1 
the speaker is of low quality so as making the ring tones sound very cheap 0 
cinematography noteworthy including fine views of barcelona and its famed gaudi towers 1 
i will continue to come here on ladies night andddd date night highly recommend this place to anyone who is in the area 1 
the acting was decidely wooden though no worse than a period universal b movie 0 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
very friendly staff 1 
with great sound effects and impressive special effects i cant recommend this movie enough 1 
brilliant 1 
battery is terrible 0 
very disappointed in accessoryone 0 
comfort for our whole family 1 
im really disappointed all i have now is a charger that doesnt work 0 
im so sorry but i really cant recommend it to anyone 0 
it fits my ear well and is comfortable on 1 
the cast of veteran actors are more than just a nostalgia trip 1 
no additional ear gels provided and no instructions whatsoever 0 
the manager was the worst 0 
product is exactly as described 1 
this is simply the best bluetooth headset for sound quality 1 
the servers are not pleasant to deal with and they dont always honor pizza hut coupons 0
