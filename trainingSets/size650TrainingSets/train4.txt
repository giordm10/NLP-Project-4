warning do not buy 0 
loved the casting of jimmy buffet as the science teacher 1 
he also came back to check on us regularly excellent service 1 
absolutely great 1 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
item arrived quickly and works great with my metro pcs samsung schr450 slider phone and sony premium sound in ear plugs 1 
everything stinks 0 
which are small and not worth the price 0 
works great when my cat attacked the phone he scratched the protective strip instead of destroying the screen 1 
the camera really likes her in this movie 1 
the croutons also taste homemade which is an extra plus 1 
food was really boring 0 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
my phone doesnt slide around my car now and the grip prevents my phone from slipping out of my hand 1 
the fish is badly made and some of its underwater shots are repeated a thousand times in the film 0 
it has been a winner for us 1 
we definately enjoyed ourselves 1 
wont ever go here again 0 
now i know that i made a wise decision 1 
everything stinks 0 
the worst sappiest dialogue i could go on and on 0 
the food was delicious our bartender was attentive and personable and we got a great deal 1 
it didnt work people can not hear me when i talk 0 
trouble is the writing and directing make it impossible to establish those things that make a movie watchable like character story theme and so on 0 
i cannot make calls at certain places 0 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
they do not care about the consumer one bit 0 
avoid avoid avoid 0 
any ring toneoverall good phone to buy 1 
the plastic breaks really easy on this clip 0 
all this movie does is make you sick watching all these slackers make excuses for their stupid actions for 90 minutes 0 
also the phone doesnt seem to accept anything except cbr mp3s preferably ripped by windows media player 0 
we loved the biscuits 1 
freezes frequently4 0 
excellent hands free tool 1 
everything about this product is wrongfirst 0 
the new characters werent all that memorable and i found myself forgetting who was who 0 
i guess i liked the details of his dysfunctionhe was believable 1 
fantastic buy and will get again for whatever my next phone is 1 
the food sucked which we expected but it sucked more than we could have imagined 0 
ill be looking for a new earpiece 0 
its the best headset i have used 1 
a standout scene 1 
i exchanged the sony ericson z500a for this and im pretty happy with that decision 1 
the plot has more holes than a pair of fishnet stockings and the direction and editing is astonishingly ham fisted 0 
this is cool because most cases are just open there allowing the screen to get all scratched up 1 
the battery is working well as a replacement for the original that came with the phone over 2 years ago 1 
its like a really sexy party in your mouth where youre outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party 1 
then as if i hadnt wasted enough of my life there they poured salt in the wound by drawing out the time it took to bring the check 0 
unfortunately inexperience of direction meant that scene after scene passed with little in the way of dramatic tension or conflict 0 
maybe its just their vegetarian fare but ive been twice and i thought it was average at best 0 
it was a pale color instead of nice and char and has no flavor 0 
camerawork again bad 0 
the real disappointment was our waiter 0 
this convention never worked well in the past and certainly doesnt work here 0 
absolutel junk 0 
i paid the bill but did not tip because i felt the server did a terrible job 0 
either way it sucks 0 
great service and food 1 
bluetooth range is good a few days ago i left my phone in the trunk got a call and carried the conversation without a hitch 1 
its so stupid to have to keep buying new chargers car chargers cradles headphones and car kits every time a new phone comes out 0 
in fact its hard to remember that the part of ray charles is being acted and not played by the man himself 1 
everything from acting to cinematography was solid 1 
i do think tom hanks is a good actor 1 
poor product 0 
the incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film 1 
soyo technology sucks 0 
steer clear of this product and go with the genuine palm replacementr pens which come in a threepack 0 
the management is rude 0 
very disappointed and wondered how it could be in the oscar shortlist 0 
both rickman and stowe play their roles to the hilt in this tale of a childrens book writer who maybe has written a subversive tract 1 
last night was my second time dining here and i was so happy i decided to go back 1 
so i am here to warn youdo not rent this movie it is the dumbest thing you have never seen 0 
now this dish was quite flavourful 1 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
i had to go to a store and bought a new nokia phone which is working great 1 
this totally unfunny movie is so over the top and pathetic and unrealistic that throughout the whole 90 minutes of utter torture i probably looked at my watch about 70000 times 0 
well just if you keep thinking how bad it is 0 
for that price i can think of a few place i would have much rather gone 0 
i give it 2 thumbs down 0 
its reception is very very poor 0 
dont make the same mistake that i did and please dont buy this phone 0 
this phone works great 1 
the chips that came out were dripping with grease and mostly not edible 0 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
this is an unbelievable bargain 1 
the worst was the salmon sashimi 0 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in 0 
there was hardly any meat 0 
the visual effects were awful 0 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
the staff is friendly and the joint is always clean 1 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
the plot is nonsense that doesnt interest in the slightest way or have any uniqueness to it 0 
it was so bad i had lost the heart to finish it 0 
im a bit disappointed 0 
none of them are engaging or exciting 0 
the roast beef sandwich tasted really good 1 
a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it 1 
there was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth but it didnt really work into the rest of the plot 0 
im happy about this purchase good quality and low price 1 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
how can anyone in their right mind ask for anything more from a movie than this 1 
no ear loop needed its tiny and the sound is great 1 
i like design and look of jabra behing the ear headsets and 5020 is pretty comfortible to wear 24 hours a day without pain in the ear 1 
the concert sequences just sucked 0 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
so there is no way for me to plug it in here in the us unless i go by a converter 0 
yet plantronincs continues to use the same flawed charger design 0 
the lighting is awful 0 
it was so bad i had lost the heart to finish it 0 
i find this inexcusable and so will probably be returning this phone and perhaps changing carriers 0 
phone now holds charge like it did when it was new 1 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
it was pretty gross 0 
the wind and the lion is well written and superbly acted 1 
thank you for such great service 1 
the bartender was also nice 1 
gets the job done 1 
the movie has almost no action scenes in it and very little comedy 0 
i would have casted her in that role after ready the script 1 
the acting was decidely wooden though no worse than a period universal b movie 0 
my friend did not like his bloody mary 0 
the story starts too fast with absolutely no suspense or buildup in the slightest 0 
i found this move beautiful enjoyable and uplifting 1 
the charger arrived within the promised timeframe but it did not work 0 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
judith light is one of my favorite actresses and i think she does a superb job in this film 1 
there is a totally unnecessary trainroller coaster scene 0 
we were promptly greeted and seated 1 
best headset ever 1 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
putting the race card aside lets look at the major flaw in the film they destroy latifas character 0 
first off the reception sucks i have never had more than 2 bars ever 0 
what a great double cheeseburger 1 
like the other reviewer said you couldnt pay me to eat at this place again 0 
highquality chicken on the chicken caesar salad 1 
if you are looking for a good quality motorola headset keep looking this isnt it 0 
everything on the menu is terrific and we were also thrilled that they made amazing accommodations for our vegetarian daughter 1 
avoid this one if you can 0 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
ive seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie 0 
highly recommended for all ages although the younger set will probably not appreciate some of the more subtle references they will certainly appreciate one galley scene in particular 1 
i could not recommend these more 0 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
terrible service 0 
yes i am simplifying things here for the sake of brevity for this really is at the core of the problems with this film it has too much going on without any real fulfilling explanation 0 
the things that the four kids get themselves into is absolutely hilarious to watch 1 
the lines the cuts the audio everything is wrong 0 
my breakfast was perpared great with a beautiful presentation of 3 giant slices of toast lightly dusted with powdered sugar 1 
it was a bit too sweet not really spicy enough and lacked flavor 0 
im not eating here 0 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
they have horrible attitudes towards customers and talk down to each one when customers dont enjoy their food 0 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
i have bought this nokia cell phone a few weeks ago and it was a nightmare 0 
yet plantronincs continues to use the same flawed charger design 0 
point your finger at any item on the menu order it and you wont be disappointed 1 
i can think of no other film where something vitally important occurs every other minute 1 
food was great and so was the serivce 1 
i used bitpim a free program you can find on the internetto transfer data to the phonethe price of the cable was excellent 1 
a fantastic neighborhood gem 1 
the only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port irda 0 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
oh the charger seems to work fine 1 
good protection and does not make phone too bulky 1 
go watch it 1 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
every element of this story was so over the top excessively phony and contrived that it was painful to sit through 0 
he is an amazing film artist one of the most important whoever lived 1 
think it over when you plan to own this onethis sure is the last moto phone for me 0 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
personally i think it shows that people should learn to find a compromise them self without involving other people into issue 1 
both of the egg rolls were fantastic 1 
the pizza selections are good 1 
will never ever go back 0 
you cant relate with them hell you barely can understand them 0 
special thanks to dylan t for the recommendation on what to order all yummy for my tummy 1 
this movie has a cutting edge to it 1 
adapter does not provide enough charging current 0 
it even has its sweet moments 1 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
i left with a stomach ache and felt sick the rest of the day 0 
this movie is bad 0 
the speaker is of low quality so as making the ring tones sound very cheap 0 
wont go back 0 
very disappointing 0 
overall i like this place a lot 1 
not a good item it worked for a while then started having problems in my auto reverse tape player 0 
how stupid is that 0 
the kids are very cool too 1 
i didnt realize how wonderful the short really is until the last two scenes 1 
this is a good battery and it got here really fast 1 
this place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver 0 
i found this place by accident and i could not be happier 1 
the seasonal fruit was fresh white peach puree 1 
i hope this place sticks around 1 
macbeth jason connery moved me to tears with his final monolog out brief candle outhe gave the sphere of moral decay and dark forces a human face which makes it the more interesting 1 
when im on this side of town this will definitely be a spot ill hit up again 1 
not good for the money 0 
10 out of 10 stars 1 
we are so glad we found this place 1 
i ordered albondigas soup which was just warm and tasted like tomato soup with frozen meatballs 0 
great place to relax and have an awesome burger and beer 1 
his performance as awarded was stunning 1 
a must study for anyone interested in the worst sins of industrial design 0 
camera color balance is awful 0 
the worst one of the series 0 
its not user friendly 0 
unfortunately inexperience of direction meant that scene after scene passed with little in the way of dramatic tension or conflict 0 
were jerks on the phone 0 
the jalapeno bacon is soooo good 1 
they keep getting better and better this is my third one and ive had numerous palms too 1 
their chow mein is so good 1 
rating 010 grade z note the show is so bad that even mother of the cast pull her daughter out of the show 0 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
dont waste your time 0 
this would not even be good as a made for tv flick 0 
the plug did not work very well 0 
i really do recommend this place you can go wrong with this donut place 1 
cant upload ringtones from a third party 0 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
the phone crashed completely and now i have to get it replaced 0 
i recently had problems where i could not stay connected for more than 10 minutes before being disconnected 0 
i as well wouldve given godfathers zero stars if possible 0 
talk about useless customer service 0 
not easy to watch 0 
i would highly recommend this product 1 
the film has an ultracheap look to it 0 
it never condescends all the characters have good genuine hearts and believable problems 1 
im terribly disappointed that this film would receive so many awards and accolades especially when there are far more deserving works of film out there 0 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
we were promptly greeted and seated 1 
then the film just dropped the ball 0 
i knew when i saw the film that more great things were to come from this gifted actor 1 
in other words the content level of this film is enough to easily fill a dozen other films 1 
the service was outshining i definitely recommend the halibut 1 
its very slow 0 
the pairing of the two devices was so easy it barely took a couple minutes before i started making calls with the voice dialing feature 1 
i have to use the smallest earpieces provided but it stays on pretty well 1 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
it crackles with an unpredictable youthful energy but honestly i found it hard to follow and concentrate on it meanders so badly 0 
i love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it 1 
the greek dressing was very creamy and flavorful 1 
will be back again 1 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
waaaaaayyyyyyyyyy over rated is all i am saying 0 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
i am far from a sushi connoisseur but i can definitely tell the difference between good food and bad food and this was certainly bad food 0 
the turkey and roast beef were bland 0 
worked very well paired with a treo 700w and as a skype headset on my pc using a usb bluetooth transceiver 1 
food was delicious 1 
i am going to have to be the first to negatively review this product 0 
sending it back 0 
this company charge me a restocking fee and still not given me my refund back 0 
we also ordered the spinach and avocado salad the ingredients were sad and the dressing literally had zero taste 0 
is pretty funny 1 
very slow at seating even with reservation 0 
rating 010 grade z note the show is so bad that even mother of the cast pull her daughter out of the show 0 
down the drain because of a weak snap 0 
the ngage is still lacking in earbuds 0 
the screen size is big key pad lit well enough and the camera quality is excellent for a camera phone 1 
i didnt know pulled pork could be soooo delicious 1 
to my disbelief each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods i have ever tasted 0 
the warmth it generates is in contrast to its austere backdrop 1 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
there was hardly any meat 0 
ambience is perfect 1 
the cashew cream sauce was bland and the vegetables were undercooked 0 
i own a jabra earset and was very happy with it but the sound quality especially outgoing on this is better 1 
the cast was great 1 
not as good as i had hoped 0 
what is even more stupid is that who had thought an idea that there should be a volcano in los angeles 0 
cant upload ringtones from a third party 0 
this is a great deal 1 
the story unfolds in 18th century jutland and the use of period music played on period instruments is just one more fine touch 1 
i guess i should have known that this place would suck because it is inside of the excalibur but i didnt use my common sense 0 
its very attractive and appears to be of good quality 1 
fans of the genre will be in heaven 1 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
again no plot at all 0 
i am very happy 1 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
but i thought his acting was skilled 1 
while i managed to bend the leaf spring back in place the metal now has enough stress that it will break on the next drop 0 
10 out of 10 for both the movie and trilogy 1 
the spaghetti is nothing special whatsoever 0 
just dont know why they were so slow 0 
great pocket pc phone combination 1 
to those who find this movie intelligent or even masterful i can only say its your intelligence and your imagination you obviously used to try and make some sense of this pitiful attempt its in our human nature to try and make sense of things 0 
does not work for listening to music with the cingular 8125 0 
it will drive you barking mad 0 
and the chef was generous with his time even came around twice so we can take pictures with him 1 
excellent product 1 
the headset fulfills my requirements so i am happy with my purchase 1 
my headset works just peachykeen 1 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
im a big fan of this series mostly due to anne rices style sensitivities and treatments 1 
at first i thought i was grtting a good deal at 744 until i plugged it into my phone v3c razr 0 
this place receives stars for their appetizers 1 
there is simply no excuse for something this poorly done 0 
i totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is 1 
im not impressed with the concept or the food 0 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
an excellent new restaurant by an experienced frenchman 1 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
this phone tries very hard to do everything but fails at its very ability to be a phone 0 
cumbersome design 0 
after 3 months screen just went black all of a sudden 0 
i received it quickly and it works great 1 
still its quite interesting and entertaining to follow 1 
he is an amazing film artist one of the most important whoever lived 1 
sound quality on both end is excellent i use headset to call my wife and ask my wife to use headset to call me 2 1 
if she had not rolled the eyes we may have stayed not sure if we will go back and try it again 0 
the story starts too fast with absolutely no suspense or buildup in the slightest 0 
its not hard to make a decent hamburger 0 
i dont know what the big deal is about this place but i wont be back yaall 0 
it is practically useless and did not add any kind of boost to my reception after i bought it 0 
i know this is not like the other restaurants at all something is very off here 0 
on three different occasions i asked for well done or medium well and all three times i got the bloodiest piece of meat on my plate 0 
logitech bluetooth headset is a 10 1 
on the ground right next to our table was a large smeared beensteppedinandtrackedeverywhere pile of green bird poop 0 
this blueant supertooth handsfree phone speaker is awesome 1 
the stories were powerful explorations of the nature of man and of art 1 
not easy to watch 0 
will be back again 1 
its the best headset i have used 1 
i was disgusted because i was pretty sure that was human hair 0 
hell no will i go back 0 
the food wasnt good 0 
it is an insane game 1 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
ive had this bluetoooth headset for some time now and still not comfortable with the way it fits on the ear 0 
i have to jiggle the plug to get it to line up right to get decent volume 0 
the battery runs down quickly 0 
there is no real plot 0 
this is by far the worst purchase ive made on amazon 0 
unless youre just out to visually collect all extant films of austens work you can skip this one 0 
the point is the journey a journey that touches every member of the family 1 
bad characters bad story and bad acting 0 
the acting sucked 0 
basically the service was very bad 0 
that company is a joke 0 
horrible dont waste your time and money 0 
i will come back here every time im in vegas 1 
yes i am simplifying things here for the sake of brevity for this really is at the core of the problems with this film it has too much going on without any real fulfilling explanation 0 
ive tried several different earpieces for my cell phone and this jabra one is the first one ive found that fits my ear comfortably 1 
this totally unfunny movie is so over the top and pathetic and unrealistic that throughout the whole 90 minutes of utter torture i probably looked at my watch about 70000 times 0 
terrible my car will not accept this cassette 0 
it works fine on my motorola 325 cellphone and a lot better than the wornout battery did 1 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
i hate those things as much as cheap quality black olives 0 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
the only thing that i think could improve is the sound leaks out from the headset 0 
do not purchase this phone 0 
as for the service im a fan because its quick and youre being served by some nice folks 1 
we ordered some old classics and some new dishes after going there a few times and were sorely disappointed with everything 0 
no actress has been worse used that june allison in this movie 0 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
just as good as when i had it more than a year ago 1 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
but in terms of the writing its very fresh and bold 1 
after one bite i was hooked 1 
i ate there twice on my last visit and especially enjoyed the salmon salad 1 
insults profound deuchebaggery and had to go outside for a smoke break while serving just to solidify it 0 
her role was played well 1 
the staff are also very friendly and efficient 1 
it shouldnt take 30 min for pancakes and eggs 0 
by far the best cheesecurds we have ever had 1 
the lead man is charismafree 0 
i wont spoil it but the ending in pretty amazing 1 
i would highly recommend this product 1 
i love the ringtones because they are so upbeat 1 
if you havent choked in your own vomit by the end by all the cheap drama and worthless dialogue youve must have bored yourself to death with this waste of time 0 
we asked for the bill to leave without eating and they didnt bring that either 0 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
reception is terrible and full of static 0 
its pure brilliance 1 
i dont each much pasta but i love the homemade hand made pastas and thin pizzas here 1 
the transfers are very good 1 
very clear quality sound and you dont have to mess with the sound on your ipod since you have the sound buttons on the headset 1 
better than expected 1 
this is a good battery and it got here really fast 1 
this short film certainly pulls no punches 0 
its like a really sexy party in your mouth where youre outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party 1 
honeslty it didnt taste that fresh 0 
i think the most wonderful parts literally full of wonder are the excerpts from his works 1 
if there were zero stars i would give it zero stars 0 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
the only thing i did like was the prime rib and dessert section 1 
cant get the software to work with my computer 0 
it was packed 0 
also makes it easier to hold on to 1 
this is a beautiful phone 1 
its a shame to see good actors like thomerson and james make a living in a mess like this 0 
i had a seriously solid breakfast here 1 
for that its worth checking out 1 
probably not in a hurry to go back 0 
worst customer service 0 
to call this movie a drama is ridiculous 0 
i highly recommend this case 1 
his use of the colours of the french flag in the three films was nothing short of incredible every shot every scene was like a work of art 1 
in short dont bother with this movie 0 
ill put this gem up against any movie in terms of screenplay cinematography acting postproduction editing directing or any other aspect of filmmaking 1 
the vegetables are so fresh and the sauce feels like authentic thai 1 
bland and flavorless is a good way of describing the barely tepid meat 0 
worst customer service 0 
i especially liked the noncliche choices with the parents in other movies i could predict the dialog verbatim but the writing in this movie made better selections 1 
cool phone 1 
utter crap sound quality is terrible 0 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
also difficult to put onid recommend avoiding this product 0 
i came back today since they relocated and still not impressed 0 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
you can even take self portraits with the outside exterior display very cool 1 
great case and price 1 
lastly the mozzarella sticks they were the best thing we ordered 1 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
clear skype calls long battery life long range 1 
woa talk about awful 0 
but when i check voice mail at night the keypad backlight turns off a few seconds into the first message and then im lost 0 
what a big waste of time 0 
nonlinear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well 1 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
disappointing 0 
that was nice 1 
and finally after all that we get to an ending that wouldve been great had it been handled by competent people and not jerry falwell 0 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
excellent short film 1 
we have tried 2 units and they both failed within 2 months pros 0 
nice design and quality 1 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
great pizza and salads 1 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
unfortunately cover girl is an example of how hollywood used to exploit women for financial gain 0 
very disappointed and wondered how it could be in the oscar shortlist 0 
everyone is very attentive providing excellent customer service 1 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
the restaurant atmosphere was exquisite 1 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
raw and sublimely moving 1 
a piece of cinematic garbage captured on celluloid 0 
really pleased with this product so far 1 
all in all i can assure you ill be back 1 
very prompt service 1 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
aside from its terrible lead this film has loads of other debits 0 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
if you hate earbugs avoid this phone by all means 0 
you cant beat the price on these 1 
the grilled chicken was so tender and yellow from the saffron seasoning 1 
the best scene in the movie was when gerardo is trying to find a song that keeps running through his head 1 
but whatever it was that cost them so much it didnt translate to quality thats for sure 0 
god and i can never get that 90 minutes back 0 
the incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film 1 
i felt asleep the first time i watched it so i can recommend it for insomniacs 0 
great place to relax and have an awesome burger and beer 1 
otherwise easy to install and use clear sound 1 
there was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth but it didnt really work into the rest of the plot 0 
this movie is bad 0 
waste of money 0 
on a positive note our server was very attentive and provided great service 1 
good transmit audio 1 
his use of the colours of the french flag in the three films was nothing short of incredible every shot every scene was like a work of art 1 
the characters are interesting and you want to find out more about them the longer the movie goes on and i think people will be surprised by who does and doesnt make it 1 
the characters were all funny and had the peculiarity of not having a true lead character 1 
wed definitely go back here again 1 
just reading on the specs alone makes you say wow 1 
great phone 1 
the only place good for this film is in the garbage 0 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
even if you love bad movies do not watch this movie 0 
this phone is very fast with sending any kind of messages and web browsing is significantly faster than previous phones i have used 1 
i would have given no star if i was able 0 
there is a lot of beautiful places 1 
i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
a truly truly bad film 0 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
very cheap plastic creaks like an old wooden floor 0 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
wont go back 0 
this movie creates its own universe and is fascinating in every way 1 
reception is terrible and full of static 0 
worst service to boot but that is the least of their worries 0 
really bad 0 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
will not be back 0 
the food is good 1 
and the chef was generous with his time even came around twice so we can take pictures with him 1 
the basic premise is wasted since it is sidelined by the inexplicable focus on the documentary crew 0 
my first visit to hiro was a delight 1 
i have had tmobile service for 2 or 3 years now and i am pretty happy with it 1 
i dont each much pasta but i love the homemade hand made pastas and thin pizzas here 1 
service was exceptional and food was a good as all the reviews 1 
it was pretty gross 0 
the movie in movie situations in the beginning and through the game that is played with her by the acting coach are fascinating 1 
i am sorry i made this purchase 0 
at any rate this film stinks its not funny and fulci should have stayed with giallo and supernatural zombie movies 0 
its too bad the food is so damn generic 0 
the fish is badly made and some of its underwater shots are repeated a thousand times in the film 0 
and finally after all that we get to an ending that wouldve been great had it been handled by competent people and not jerry falwell 0 
i kept looking at the time and it had soon become 35 minutes yet still no food 0 
this was reflected not only in the cast but also in the belowpar script which borrowed much from the earlier classic 0 
yet plantronincs continues to use the same flawed charger design 0 
but it wasnt anything at all just one big yawn 0 
spend your money and time some place else 0 
but the duet between the astronaut and his doctor at the beginning of the movie is a perfect exchange if one considers that this movie was made well into the cold war and the astronauts biggest fear is that he has crashed in the ussr 1 
the sound quality is excellent as well 1 
everything was good and tasty 1 
the story starts too fast with absolutely no suspense or buildup in the slightest 0 
headset works great was packaged nicely to avoid any damage 1 
poor product 0 
the music in the film is really nice too 1 
at around 4 pm i bought it at around 8pm i started to watch at around 815pm i fast forwarded the remaining film to see if there was anything left watchable for a human being with a brain but there wasnt 0 
lately they have been extremely nice and helpful on the phone 1 
often the dialogue doesnt really follow from one line to another or fit the surroundings 0 
i advise you to look out for it 1 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
sucked most of the stuff does not work with my phone 0 
not much dialogue not much music the whole film was shot as elaborately and aesthetically like a sculpture 1 
i love my 350 headset my jabra350 bluetooth headset is great the reception is very good and the ear piece is a comfortable fit 1 
basically the service was very bad 0 
the entire audience applauded at the conclusion of the film 1 
nice quality build unlike some cheap s out there 1 
yes its shiny on front side and i love it 1 
the charger arrived within the promised timeframe but it did not work 0 
this one works and was priced right 1 
but what really made it unwatchable was the direction 0 
all the bread is made inhouse 1 
drinks took close to 30 minutes to come out at one point 0 
you wont regret it 1 
i came over from verizon because cingulair has nicer cell phones the first thing i noticed was the really bad service 0 
customer service was terrible 0 
it was so bad i had lost the heart to finish it 0 
in addition it feels amp looks as if the phone is all lightweight cheap plastic 0 
the food was terrible 0 
on the good side the staff was genuinely pleasant and enthusiastic a real treat 1 
the burger is good beef cooked just right 1 
everyone is treated equally special 1 
highquality chicken on the chicken caesar salad 1 
how stupid is that 0 
i got to enjoy the seafood salad with a fabulous vinegrette 1 
the best electronics of the available fm transmitters 1 
its a gloriously fun fast paced and fairly accurate portrayal of the night of a raver 1 
would recommend this item 1 
avoid avoid avoid 0 
at first i thought i was grtting a good deal at 744 until i plugged it into my phone v3c razr 0 
this case has passed the one year mark and while it shows signs of wear it is 100 functional 1 
its quite simply the highest most superlative form of cinema imaginable 1 
this is high adventure at its best 1 
horrible dont waste your time and money 0 
im not sure how long we stood there but it was long enough for me to begin to feel awkwardly out of place 0 
the attractive set used throughout most of the film is an eyepleasing gem 1 
it was a waste of my money 0 
the writers were smack on and i think the best actors and actresses were a bonus to the showthese characters were so real 1 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
it is an hour and half waste of time following a bunch of very pretty high schoolers whine and cry about life 0 
he was terrible 0 
very happy with this product 1 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
with great sound effects and impressive special effects i cant recommend this movie enough 1 
my first visit to hiro was a delight 1 
the flair bartenders are absolutely amazing 1 
food was delicious 1 
the phone loads super 1 
there is no plot here to keep you going in the first place 0 
garbo who showed right off the bat that her talents could carry over from the silent era i wanted to see some of her silent work but netflix doesnt seem to be stocking them 1 
lately they have been extremely nice and helpful on the phone 1 
i could care less the interior is just beautiful 1 
this place is not quality sushi it is not a quality restaurant 0 
disappointing 0 
our server was very nice and even though he looked a little overwhelmed with all of our needs he stayed professional and friendly until the end 1 
absolutel junk 0 
the burger is good beef cooked just right 1 
the wind and the lion is well written and superbly acted 1 
nice docking station for home or work 1 
this is infuriating 0 
avoid this film at all costs 0 
about 30 minutes of footage is wasted to show mediocre elderly actors awkwardly babbling overwrought pseudosatanic gibberish corny enough to make a teen goth blush almost always in olde english and sometimes in latin that may or may not be made up words 0 
waitress was good though 1 
small sleek impressive looking practical setup with ample storage in place 1 
the film gives meaning to the phrase never in the history of human conflict has so much been owed by so many to so few 1 
otherwise easy to install and use clear sound 1 
the scripting of the subtle comedy is unmatched by any movie in recent years 1 
im so happy to be here 1 
it was absolutely amazing 1 
this phone is pretty sturdy and ive never had any large problems with it 1 
the aerial scenes were welldone 1 
this blueant supertooth handsfree phone speaker is awesome 1 
great bluetooth 1 
also notable is john baileys fine crisp beautifully colored cinematography and the great production design costumes by eiko ishioka who went on to do the memorable costumes for coppolas dracula for which she received a well deserved oscar 1 
i am pairing this with my iphone and i could not be happier with it so far 1 
echo problemvery unsatisfactory 0 
nice headphones for the price and they work great 1 
the script is bad very bad  it contains both cheesiness and unethical joke that you normally see in rated r or nc17 movie 0 
i have always used corded headsets and the freedom from the wireless is very helpful 1 
artless camerawork endlessly presents us with the ugliest setting imaginable ie 0 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
in an interesting part of town this place is amazing 1 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
i recently had problems where i could not stay connected for more than 10 minutes before being disconnected 0 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
it is indescribably the most annoying and idiotic show i have ever seen 0 
so good i am going to have to review this place twice once hereas a tribute to the place and once as a tribute to an event held here last night 1 
works great 1 
this is one of peter watkins most accessible films 1 
in fact i liked it better than interview with a vampire and i liked this lestat stuart townsend better than cruises attempt 1 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
at around 4 pm i bought it at around 8pm i started to watch at around 815pm i fast forwarded the remaining film to see if there was anything left watchable for a human being with a brain but there wasnt 0 
plus its only 8 bucks 1 
up there with the best of melville 1 
the film succeeds despite or perhaps because of an obviously meagre budget 1 
comfortable fit you need your headset to be comfortable for at least an hour at a time if not for an entire day 1 
the pan cakes everyone are raving about taste like a sugary disaster tailored to the palate of a six year old 0 
wonderful lil tapas and the ambience made me feel all warm and fuzzy inside 1 
they dropped more than the ball 0 
the plot was the same as pretty much every other cheap horror 0 
this movie is terrible 0 
that just screams legit in my booksomethats also pretty rare here in vegas 1 
gets the job done 1 
wasted two hours 0 
talk about useless customer service 0 
definitely worth checking out 1 
it was packed 0 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
i purchased this and within 2 days it was no longer working 0 
jamie foxx absolutely is ray charles 1 
ambience is perfect 1 
thus far have only visited twice and the food was absolutely delicious each time 1 
each track commands sentiment actually contributing to the scenes and characters 1 
this film tries to be a serious and sophisticated thrillerhorror flick and it fails miserably 0 
she ordered a toasted english muffin that came out untoasted 0 
awful service 0 
this is a great little item 1 
there were several moments in the movie that just didnt need to be there and were excruciatingly slow moving 0 
i was so insulted 0 
great food and service huge portions and they give a military discount 1 
i have eaten here multiple times and each time the food was delicious 1 
waaaaaayyyyyyyyyy over rated is all i am saying 0 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
first the bathrooms at this location were dirty seat covers were not replenished just plain yucky 0 
the sets especially designed to work with the camera are amazingstylized beautiful and effective 1 
dee snider just plain sucks 0
