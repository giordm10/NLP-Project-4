the pan cakes everyone are raving about taste like a sugary disaster tailored to the palate of a six year old 0 
the film is well paced understated and one of the best courtroom documentaries ive seen 1 
a must study for anyone interested in the worst sins of industrial design 0 
the restaurant is very clean and has a family restaurant feel to it 1 
at a time when it seems that film animation has been dominated by disneypixars cgi masterpieces it is both refreshing and comforting to know that miyazaki is still relying on traditional handdrawn animation to tell his charming and enchanting stories 1 
who in their right mind is gonna buy this battery 0 
i received it quickly and it works great 1 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
very very disappointed ordered the 35 big bay plater 0 
this film highlights the fundamental flaws of the legal process that its not about discovering guilt or innocence but rather is about who presents better in court 1 
she ordered a toasted english muffin that came out untoasted 0 
excellent hands free tool 1 
i would recommend saving room for this 1 
all things considered a job very well done 1 
unfortunately this is a bad movie that is just plain bad 0 
disappointed 0 
im not really sure how joeys was voted best hot dog in the valley by readers of phoenix magazine 0 
the sweet potato tots were good but the onion rings were perfection or as close as i have had 1 
i guess that nobody at the network that aired this dribble watched it before putting it on 0 
that one didnt work either 0 
battery lasts only a few hours 0 
everything stinks 0 
soggy and not good 0 
so for our enjoyment we get to see them run around play games and be dangerous 1 
food was below average 0 
bland and flavorless is a good way of describing the barely tepid meat 0 
big disappointment with calendar sync 0 
i love the look and feel of samsung flipphones 1 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
saggy floppy piece of junk 0 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
nicest chinese restaurant ive been in a while 1 
even allowing for poor production values for the time 1971 and the format some kind of miniseries this is baaaaaad 0 
brilliance indeed 1 
overpriced for what you are getting 0 
the nano stated itmy son was dissapointed 0 
the price is reasonable and the service is great 1 
2 thumbs up 1 
love it great armband 1 
this is my new fav vegas buffet spot 1 
awful service 0 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
the directing seems too pretentious 0 
victor mclaglen was even bad and brian donlevy was almost unrecognizable 0 
definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly will return next time im in vegas 1 
that movie was bad 0 
appears to actually outperform the original battery from china that came with my v325i 1 
in other words the content level of this film is enough to easily fill a dozen other films 1 
great hands free device 1 
raw and sublimely moving 1 
honeslty it didnt taste that fresh 0 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
great character actors telly savalas and peter boyle 1 
bacon is hella salty 1 
bought mainly for the charger which broke soon after purchasing 0 
waiter was a jerk 0 
this movie is excellentangel is beautiful and scamp is adorablehis little yelps when hes scaredand the funniest parts are whenscamp is caught under the curtain and when angel and scamp are singing ive never had this feeling beforei totally recommend this movieits coming out on special edition on june 20the cover has scamp on a garbage can and angel underneath the lid 1 
on the up side their cafe serves really good food 1 
dont make the same mistake that i did and please dont buy this phone 0 
we got sitting fairly fast but ended up waiting 40 minutes just to place our order another 30 minutes before the food arrived 0 
i wont be back 0 
the art style has the appearance of crayonpencil drawings and is wonderfully colorful and fanciful 1 
it also took her forever to bring us the check when we asked for it 0 
fantastic buy and will get again for whatever my next phone is 1 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
excellent sound battery life and inconspicuous to boot 1 
stopped by during the late may bank holiday off rick steve recommendation and loved it 1 
not recommended 0 
you have to hold the phone at a particular angle for the other party to hear you clearly 0 
go rent it 1 
what a big waste of time 0 
seafood was limited to boiled shrimp and crab legs but the crab legs definitely did not taste fresh 0 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
the mic is great 1 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
their onscreen chemistry critical to the entire film is genuine 1 
its a great item 1 
the real disappointment was our waiter 0 
it didnt make me scared horrified or make me sympathetic towards the characters it was simply annoying 0 
i must say i have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again 1 
im pleased 1 
i highly recommend this device to everyone 1 
you get incredibly fresh fish prepared with care 1 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
well just if you keep thinking how bad it is 0 
the charger arrived within the promised timeframe but it did not work 0 
i even dropped this phone into a stream and it was submerged for 15 seconds and it still works great 1 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
we asked for the bill to leave without eating and they didnt bring that either 0 
tried to go here for lunch and it was a madhouse 0 
my only complaint is the standard sound volume is a little low even when turned up to 5of 5 0 
the hockey scenes are terrible defensemen playing like theyre 5 years old goalies diving at shots that are 10 feet wide of the net etc 0 
i asked multiple times for the wine list and after some time of being ignored i went to the hostess and got one myself 0 
the worst one of the series 0 
i saw this short film on hbo the other day and absolutely loved it 1 
bad characters bad story and bad acting 0 
what on earth is irons doing in this film 0 
great phone 1 
a good film by a great director 1 
come hungry leave happy and stuffed 1 
due to this happening on every call i was forced to stop using this headset 0 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
the movie had you on the edge of your seat and made you somewhat afraid to go to your car at the end of the night 1 
her lines seem to have been written by a fifteen year old though they are trying oh so so hard to sound like how a fifteen year old would really um you know well talk 0 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
what a waste of money and time 0 
i particularly remember my senses being assaulted by strident cords of music that would blare out with very little warning and even less meaning 0 
steamboat willie is an amazingly important film to our cinema history 1 
there is no real plot 0 
it was a riot to see hugo weaving play a sexobsessed gay real estate salesman who uses his clients houses for his trysts with the flaming darren tom hollander 1 
it was not good 0 
i was very excited to get this headset because i thought it was really cute 1 
not even good for camp value 0 
basically the service was very bad 0 
not impressed 0 
incredible 1 
i only hear garbage for audio 0 
its uncomfortable and the sound quality is quite poor compared with the phone razr or with my previous wired headset that plugged into an lg 0 
but i thought his acting was skilled 1 
the color is even prettier than i thought it would be and the graphics are incredibly sharp 1 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
this little device has transformed my organizational capability and made my life a whole lot easier 1 
there are so many problems i dont know where to start 0 
when i saw it in the theater i thought i was going to be sick 0 
cant store anything but phone numbers to sim 0 
just really good so far probably the best bt headset i have ever had 1 
the characters are interesting even if a bit predictable 1 
i recommend this for everyone who loves film movies anythinga work of art 1 
its not user friendly 0 
i really wanted the plantronics 510 to be the right one but it has too many issues for methe good 0 
the use of slowmotion needlessly repeats itself throughout the movie but is well backed up by bad acting and bad is a kind word here no continuity scenes that are thrown in for no reason whatsoever vehicles that looked like they were made from a corn flakes box and a directorial style that bordered on stupidity 0 
the burger had absolutely no flavor the meat itself was totally bland the burger was overcooked and there was no charcoal flavor 0 
great sound and service 1 
the ngage is still lacking in earbuds 0 
ive only had my bluetooth for a few weeks but i really like it 1 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
we are sending it back 0 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
very easy to use 1 
the ripped banana was not only ripped but petrified and tasteless 0 
all in all its an insult to ones intelligence and a huge waste of money 0 
good item low price 1 
the jabra eargels fit my ears very well 1 
the inside is really quite nice and very clean 1 
plug was the wrong size 0 
jawbone era is awesome too 1 
no plot whatsoever 0 
i highly recommend this modest priced cellular phone 1 
their menu is diverse and reasonably priced 1 
ps the only scene in the movie that was cool is when the central character finds her room blown up 1 
overall a delight 1 
this movie now joins revenge of the boogeyman and zombiez as part of the hellish trinity of horror films 0 
if this premise sound stupid thats because it is 0 
i love all the features and form factor 1 
this place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver 0 
i took back my money and got outta there 0 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
if you do watch it however there are small consolations the actresses playing annes sisters each do a wonderful job with their roles 1 
i have bought this nokia cell phone a few weeks ago and it was a nightmare 0 
it was packed 0 
but above all the exquisite visual composition of each moment with inventive and elegant use of closeup camera angle and lighting including pointillistic faux home movie footage is a wonder and joy to behold 1 
will never ever go back and have told many people what had happened 0 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
dont buy it 0 
the staff is great the food is delish and they have an incredible beer selection 1 
the desserts were a bit strange 0 
works for me 1 
if you look for authentic thai food go else where 0 
truly awful 0 
but storm trooper is not even bad enough to make it to the list of wonderfully terrible movies 0 
i would not recommend this place 0 
the writer gorman bechard undoubtedly did his homework because all references are industry and characterage appropriate 1 
the death row scenes were entirely unmoving 0 
it was either too cold not enough flavor or just bad 0 
it is very educational for children 1 to 8 years old 1 
brilliance indeed 1 
the instructions didnt explain that a microphone jack could be used 0 
it clicks into place in a way that makes you wonder how long that mechanism would last 0 
we ordered some old classics and some new dishes after going there a few times and were sorely disappointed with everything 0 
we sat another ten minutes and finally gave up and left 0 
this product is great it makes working a lot easier i can go to the copier while waiting on hold for something 1 
the potato chip order was sad i could probably count how many chips were in that box and it was probably around 12 0 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
do not make the same mistake as me 0 
i have been very happy with the 510 and have had no complaints from any one regarding my sound quality on their end 1 
delicious and i will absolutely be back 1 
it did not work in my cell phone plug i am very up set with the charger 0 
a piece of junk that broke after being on my phone for 2 days 0 
i wish i could enter negative values admins 0 
the problem i have is that they charge 1199 for a sandwich that is no bigger than a subway sub which offers better and more amount of vegetables 0 
speaking of the music it is unbearably predictably and kitchy 0 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
ryans bar is definitely one edinburgh establishment i wont be revisiting 0 
not nearly as good looking as the amazon picture makes it look 0 
the food came out at a good pace 1 
the service was extremely slow 0 
spend your money and time some place else 0 
this film offers many delights and surprises 1 
they were goldencrispy and delicious 1 
i want to first say our server was great and we had perfect service 1 
item arrived quickly and works great with my metro pcs samsung schr450 slider phone and sony premium sound in ear plugs 1 
this is infuriating 0 
linksys should have some way to exchange a bad phone for a refurb unit or something 0 
i have been very happy with the 510 and have had no complaints from any one regarding my sound quality on their end 1 
service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is vegas and located inside the crystals shopping mall by aria 1 
but now i was completely grossed out 0 
this was a different cut than the piece the other day but still wonderful and tender s well as well flavored 1 
comfortable nice range good battery life 1 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
when my mom and i got home she immediately got sick and she only had a few bites of salad 0 
it was that year however that reminded us that huston was still at the top of his game as evinced by his faithful adaptation of james joyces acclaimed novella the dead 1 
good case 1 
the update procedure is difficult and cumbersome 0 
kris kristoffersen is good in this movie and really makes a difference 1 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
it was an inexpensive piece but i would still have expected better quality 0 
ambience is perfect 1 
what is even more stupid is that who had thought an idea that there should be a volcano in los angeles 0 
it doesnt make you look cool 0 
we have tried 2 units and they both failed within 2 months pros 0 
great price also 1 
this is a good battery and it got here really fast 1 
after 20 minutes wait i got a table 0 
perfect for the ps3 1 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
the awful dialogue and hopeless overacting by everyone who gets shot top off a real waste of space and time 0 
a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it 1 
battery life is also great 1 
chinese forgeries abound 0 
in fact i liked it better than interview with a vampire and i liked this lestat stuart townsend better than cruises attempt 1 
works fine 1 
needless to say i wont be going back anytime soon 0 
brilliance indeed 1 
so far so good 1 
it feels poorly constructed the menus are difficult to navigate and the buttons are so recessed that it is difficult to push them 0 
point your finger at any item on the menu order it and you wont be disappointed 1 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
im really disappointed all i have now is a charger that doesnt work 0 
love it great armband 1 
no actress has been worse used that june allison in this movie 0 
a very good film indeed about great and unconditional love 1 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
it was so funny 1 
the least said about the acting the better 0 
my girlfriends veal was very bad 0 
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0 
what a waste of time 0 
i didnt realize how wonderful the short really is until the last two scenes 1 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
nice sound 1 
i wont say any more i dont like spoilers so i dont want to be one but i believe this film is worth your time 1 
barney is definitely super de duper 1 
the staff are great the ambiance is great 1 
this allows the possibility of double booking for the same date and time after the first 0 
this is one of the better buffets that i have been to 1 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
battery chargelife is quite long 1 
i have had problems wit hit dropping signal and more 0 
the foreigner is not worth one second of your time 0 
total waste of time 0 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
motorola finally got the voice quality of a bluetooth headset right 1 
the only thing i did like was the prime rib and dessert section 1 
the first time i ever came here i had an amazing experience i still tell people how awesome the duck was 1 
these are fabulous 1 
if you look for authentic thai food go else where 0 
i advise everyone do not be fooled 0 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
black water is a thriller that manages to completely transcend its limitations its an indie flick by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience 1 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
i really hope the team behind this movie makes more movies and that they will continue to do so in their own some kinda weird style 1 
i found this move beautiful enjoyable and uplifting 1 
the meat was pretty dry i had the sliced brisket and pulled pork 0 
if you want healthy authentic or ethic food try this place 1 
great food and service huge portions and they give a military discount 1 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
utter crap sound quality is terrible 0 
i own a jabra earset and was very happy with it but the sound quality especially outgoing on this is better 1 
works well 1 
hands down my favorite italian restaurant 1 
a great touch 1 
krussel always good 1 
first off the reception sucks i have never had more than 2 bars ever 0 
awesome service and food 1 
a film not easily forgotten 1 
macbeth jason connery moved me to tears with his final monolog out brief candle outhe gave the sphere of moral decay and dark forces a human face which makes it the more interesting 1 
you cant beat the price on these 1 
join the club and get awesome offers via email 1 
the sweet potato tots were good but the onion rings were perfection or as close as i have had 1 
the very idea of it was lame take a minor character from a mediocre pg13 film and make a complete nonsequel while changing its tone to a pgrated family movie 0 
also the fries are without a doubt the worst fries ive ever had 0 
this place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver 0 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
great product 1 
considering the relations off screen between taylor and stanwyck it was surprising how little chemistry there was on screen between the two of them 0 
the waitresses are very friendly 1 
i loved it 1 
i hope this place sticks around 1 
i found the product to be easy to set up and use 1 
then i exchanged for the same phone even that had the same problem 0 
the sangria was about half of a glass wine full and was 12 ridiculous 0 
the bus boy on the other hand was so rude 0 
first of all there are enough racial stereotypes and racial jokes to offend everyone 0 
customer service was terrible 0 
dont bother go to the store 0 
brilliance indeed 1 
these were so good we ordered them twice 1 
after 20 minutes wait i got a table 0 
this was my first time and i cant wait until the next 1 
what a big waste of time 0 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
point your finger at any item on the menu order it and you wont be disappointed 1 
this movie suffered because of the writing it needed more suspense 0 
this is a great restaurant at the mandalay bay 1 
the owners really really need to quit being soooooo cheap let them wrap my freaking sandwich in two papers not one 0 
it seems completely secure both holding on to my belt and keeping the iphone inside 1 
this allows the possibility of double booking for the same date and time after the first 0 
no shifting no bubbling no peeling not even a scratch nothingi couldnt be more happier with my new one for the droid 1 
went in for happy hour great list of wines 1 
cant get the software to work with my computer 0 
prosgood camera very nice pictures also has cool styles like black and white and more 1 
i love the ownerchef his one authentic japanese cool dude 1 
but then they came back cold 0 
if you are razr owneryou must have this 1 
if you are razr owneryou must have this 1 
generally it just lacked imagination 0 
it looks very nice 1 
using all earpieces left or right this thing will not stay on my ear 0 
i probably would not go here again 0 
do not waste your time 0 
the camera on the phone may be used as a dustpan when indoors id rather be using a disposable then this 0 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
coming here is like experiencing an underwhelming relationship where both parties cant wait for the other person to ask to break up 0 
well im satisfied 1 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
its a mediocre miserable hollow laughable and predictable piece of garbage 0 
i had the mac salad and it was pretty bland so i will not be getting that again 0 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
im very disappointed with my decision 0 
i am not a filmmaker nor am i a director but i would hide my head in the sand if id spent whatever amount of money and time on this movie 0 
i love this thing 1 
ill put this gem up against any movie in terms of screenplay cinematography acting postproduction editing directing or any other aspect of filmmaking 1 
service was good and the company was better 1 
obviously they have a terrible customer service so you get what you pay for 0 
this movie is possibly one of the most creative works of horror ever 1 
best service and food ever maria our server was so good and friendly she made our day 1 
the things that the four kids get themselves into is absolutely hilarious to watch 1 
however i recently watched the whole thing again on dvd and i was completely struck by how extremely stupid the storyline was how it contained holes inconsistencies and frankly a whole lot of crap and how horrid the dancing was 0 
i wear it everyday and it holds up very well 1 
i love my 350 headset my jabra350 bluetooth headset is great the reception is very good and the ear piece is a comfortable fit 1 
this is by far the worst purchase ive made on amazon 0 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
when i placed my treo into the case not only was it not snug but there was a lot of extra room on the sides 0 
exceptionally bad 0 
im trying to return it for a refund 0 
it was so boring 0 
it was not good 0 
i was hoping for more 0 
crash is a depressing little nothing that provokes emotion but teaches you nothing if you already know racism and prejudice are bad things 0 
youd have to have the iq of particularly stupid mollusk not to see that one coming 0 
but it is great i would really recommend it 1 
it isnt even an achievement as a sobaditsgood or sobaditsmemorable movie 0 
not tasty and the texture was just nasty 0 
the plug did not work very well 0 
otherwise easy to install and use clear sound 1 
the worst one of the series 0 
the warm beer didnt help 0 
because both ears are occupied background is not distracting at all 1 
this hole in the wall has great mexican street tacos and friendly staff 1 
i own a jabra earset and was very happy with it but the sound quality especially outgoing on this is better 1 
i totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is 1 
i have had problems wit hit dropping signal and more 0 
however bt headsets are currently not good for real time games like firstperson shooters since the audio delay messes me up 0 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
i highly recommend this case 1 
if you see it you should probably just leave it on the shelf 0 
they brought a fresh batch of fries and i was thinking yay something warm but no 0 
so i basically threw my money out the window for nothing 0 
treo and tmobile refused to replace it again and forced me to buy another phone without any kind of upgrade discount 0 
regrettably the film fails 0 
the sets especially designed to work with the camera are amazingstylized beautiful and effective 1 
the service was poor and thats being nice 0 
on three different occasions i asked for well done or medium well and all three times i got the bloodiest piece of meat on my plate 0 
the chips that came out were dripping with grease and mostly not edible 0 
if you want a sandwich just go to any firehouse 1 
an interesting premise and billy drago is always good as a dangerous nutbag side note id love to see drago stephen mchattie and lance hendrikson in a flick together talk about raging cheekbones 1 
much better than the other ayce sushi place i went to in vegas 1 
imdb ratings only go as low 1 for awful its time to get some negative numbers in there for cases such as these 0 
i dont think ive ever gone to a movie and disliked it as much 0 
pretty awesome place 1 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
that movie was bad 0 
its like a really sexy party in your mouth where youre outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party 1 
the lighting is awful 0 
it has a very good plot it holds your complete attention the acting is superb tom wilkinson was fantastic and emily watson was also very good 1 
it feels poorly constructed the menus are difficult to navigate and the buttons are so recessed that it is difficult to push them 0 
the budget was evidently very limited 0 
this one wants to surf on the small wave of space movies in 1998 deep impact and armageddon and this one fails everywhere 0 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
this place is handsdown one of the best places to eat in the phoenix metro area 1 
we wont be going back 0 
however i recently watched the whole thing again on dvd and i was completely struck by how extremely stupid the storyline was how it contained holes inconsistencies and frankly a whole lot of crap and how horrid the dancing was 0 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
updatewent back for a second time and it was still just as amazing 1 
a pretty good product 1 
ive only had my bluetooth for a few weeks but i really like it 1 
very satisifed with that 1 
the steak and the shrimp are in my opinion the best entrees at gc 1 
the food was very good 1 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
mobile phone tools are a must have 1 
the plot simply rumbles on like a machine desperately depending on the addition of new scenes 0 
this movie has a cutting edge to it 1 
i was sitting in my vehicle with the cradle on my belt and the headset lost signal 0 
dont buy this product 0 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
but if you liked movies like the matrix and better yet their sequels i think youll appreciate the thought provoking mindblowing experience this film will give you 1 
the camera on the phone may be used as a dustpan when indoors id rather be using a disposable then this 0 
the stories were as unbelievable as the actors 0 
i checked out this place a couple years ago and was not impressed 0 
feelings thoughtsgabriels discomfort during the danceall these intangibles leap to life and come within the viewers grasp in hustons portrayal 1 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
the crêpe was delicate and thin and moist 1 
the sangria was about half of a glass wine full and was 12 ridiculous 0 
great service and food 1 
someone shouldve invented this sooner 1 
i found this place by accident and i could not be happier 1 
it works 1 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
hated it 0 
kind of hard to mess up a steak but they did 0 
well just if you keep thinking how bad it is 0 
the only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port irda 0 
great for ipods too 1 
bad purchase 0 
still waiting im sure this item would work well if i ever recieve it 0 
she carries the movie well 1 
we walked away stuffed and happy about our first vegas buffet experience 1 
if you are reading this please dont go there 0 
returned 8 hours later 0 
it feels poorly constructed the menus are difficult to navigate and the buttons are so recessed that it is difficult to push them 0 
in conclusion i will not bother with this movie because a volcano in los angeles is nothing but nonsense 0 
i saw mirrormask last night and it was an unsatisfactory experience 0 
sweetest phone 1 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
this was reflected not only in the cast but also in the belowpar script which borrowed much from the earlier classic 0 
woa talk about awful 0 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
overall the film is interesting and thoughtprovoking 1 
cumbersome design 0 
waitress was sweet and funny 1 
i wasnt really impressed with strip steak 0 
first off the reception sucks i have never had more than 2 bars ever 0 
yet i enjoy watching it 1 
i go to far too many places and ive never seen any restaurant that serves a 1 egg breakfast especially for 400 0 
the only good thing was that it fits comfortably on small ears 1 
how awesome is that 1 
unreliable im giving up 0 
i would not recommend this place 0 
gotta love those closeups of slimy drooling teeth 1 
i had ordered a motorola data cable got a very well finished and working product 1 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
exactly what i wanted 1 
good transmit audio 1 
in addition it feels amp looks as if the phone is all lightweight cheap plastic 0 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
overpriced for what you are getting 0 
this is hands down the best phone ive ever had 1 
i wish i could enter negative values admins 0 
hard to judge whether these sides were good because we were grossed out by the melted styrofoam and didnt want to eat it for fear of getting sick 0 
when i saw it in the theater i thought i was going to be sick 0 
this is probably one of the least effective and utterly unoriginal films i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
in my house i was getting dropped coverage upstairs and no coverage in my basement 0 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
excellent sound battery life and inconspicuous to boot 1 
works great 1 
an awesome new look for fall 2000 1 
simply beautiful 1 
i dont have to be an accountant to know im getting screwed 0 
there are massive levels massive unlockable characters its just a massive game 1 
food quality has been horrible 0 
it has a very good plot it holds your complete attention the acting is superb tom wilkinson was fantastic and emily watson was also very good 1 
reasonably priced also 1 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
very good food great atmosphere1 1 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
i can think of no other film where something vitally important occurs every other minute 1 
we started with the tuna sashimi which was brownish in color and obviously wasnt fresh 0 
bad day or not i have a very low tolerance for rude customer service people it is your job to be nice and polite wash dishes otherwise 0 
very disappointed and wondered how it could be in the oscar shortlist 0 
this is an extraordinary film 1 
in addition it feels amp looks as if the phone is all lightweight cheap plastic 0 
poor sound quality 0 
this was such an awesome movie that i bought it off of ebay 1 
fantastic earphones 1 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
we also ordered the spinach and avocado salad the ingredients were sad and the dressing literally had zero taste 0 
the scripting of the subtle comedy is unmatched by any movie in recent years 1 
great phone 1 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
i had to go to a store and bought a new nokia phone which is working great 1 
this is the phone to get for 2005 i just bought my s710a and all i can say is wow 1 
echo problemvery unsatisfactory 0 
no ear loop needed its tiny and the sound is great 1 
on three different occasions i asked for well done or medium well and all three times i got the bloodiest piece of meat on my plate 0 
it didnt make me scared horrified or make me sympathetic towards the characters it was simply annoying 0 
again no plot at all 0 
stay away from this store be careful 0 
problem is that the ear loops are made of weak material and break easily 0 
dont waste your money 0 
i am very happy 1 
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
food quality has been horrible 0 
emily watsons character is very strong and she has only to give a quick glance and you understand everything 1 
anyways the food was definitely not filling at all and for the price you pay you should expect more 0 
it was a great phone 1 
the movie in movie situations in the beginning and through the game that is played with her by the acting coach are fascinating 1 
i will be back many times soon 1 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
almost all of the songs in cover girl are oldfashioned and not very tuneful 0 
in other words the content level of this film is enough to easily fill a dozen other films 1 
like the other reviewer said you couldnt pay me to eat at this place again 0 
all in all im quite satisfied with this purchase 1 
nice solid keyboard 1 
i will not return 0 
battery has no life 0 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
excellent 1 
both actors truly understand and become their particular character delivering a convincing sincere performance 1 
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0 
plus it was wellpaced and suited its relatively short run time 1 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
it deserves strong love 1 
i always order from the vegetarian menu during dinner which has a wide array of options to choose from 1 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
updatewent back for a second time and it was still just as amazing 1 
and if that isnt enough of a mess of a movie for you the picture is also marred with a constant use of studio sets and indoor exteriors 0 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
on the good side the staff was genuinely pleasant and enthusiastic a real treat 1 
it was a bit too sweet not really spicy enough and lacked flavor 0 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
w810i is just superb 1 
bad quality 0 
the block was amazing 1 
i hate movies like that 0 
i have to use the smallest earpieces provided but it stays on pretty well 1 
i got the car charger and not even after a week the charger was brokeni went to plug it in and it started smoking 0 
nice docking station for home or work 1 
it is not good 0 
what this film lacks is a convincing script 0 
a very good film indeed about great and unconditional love 1 
this is was due to the fact that it took 20 minutes to be acknowledged then another 35 minutes to get our foodand they kept forgetting things 0 
then the film just dropped the ball 0 
battery chargelife is quite long 1 
very very sad 0 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
a week later after i activated it it suddenly died 0 
the noise shield is incrediable 1 
i had verizon 2 years ago and really liked their service 1 
i dont know what kind it is but they have the best iced tea 1 
i did not expect this to be so good 1 
nothing new there 0 
problem is that the ear loops are made of weak material and break easily 0 
so i bought about 10 of these and saved alot of money 1 
you could only take 2 videos at a time and the quality was very poor 0 
do not make the same mistake as me 0 
it felt too light and tinny 0 
the movie is terribly boring in places 0 
however after finally watching this film i realized that not only had i had a closed mind to the brilliance it depicts i also found myself watching it over and over again 1 
not to mention the combination of pears almonds and bacon is a big winner 1 
the pleather case doesnt fit 0 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
disappointing experience 0 
if you love authentic mexican food and want a whole bunch of interesting yet delicious meats to choose from you need to try this place 1 
the films sole bright spot was jonah hill who will look almost unrecognizable to fans of the recent superbad due to the amount of weight he lost in the interim 1 
disappointing 0 
my only complaint is the standard sound volume is a little low even when turned up to 5of 5 0 
he was terrible 0 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
the movie seemed a little slow at first 0 
they know how to make them here 1 
steer clear of this product and go with the genuine palm replacementr pens which come in a threepack 0 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
great pizza and salads 1 
very disappointed in accessoryone 0 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
i got it because it was so small and adorable 1 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
if you see it you should probably just leave it on the shelf 0 
also the phone doesnt seem to accept anything except cbr mp3s preferably ripped by windows media player 0 
i have had this phone for over a year now and i will tell you its not that great 0 
just spicy enough perfect actually 1 
this movie does an excellent job of revealing the complexity of the task and the incredible challenges facing south africa 1 
i know that sounds funny but to me it seemed like sketchy technology that wouldnt work wellwell this one works great 1 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0 
as for the service i thought it was good 1 
it is unusable in a moving car at freeway speed 0 
gotta love those closeups of slimy drooling teeth 1 
tonight i had the elk filet specialand it sucked 0 
there was so much hype over this phone that i assumed it was the best my mistake 0 
the attractive set used throughout most of the film is an eyepleasing gem 1 
i checked out this place a couple years ago and was not impressed 0 
beware this is not a trashy cult movie this is trash period 0 
the spaghetti is nothing special whatsoever 0 
but i thought his acting was skilled 1 
comfortable fit you need your headset to be comfortable for at least an hour at a time if not for an entire day 1 
even worse than ticker 0 
the staff is friendly and the joint is always clean 1 
the chicken dishes are ok the beef is like shoe leather 0 
it crackles with an unpredictable youthful energy but honestly i found it hard to follow and concentrate on it meanders so badly 0 
the phone is sturdy and waterproof 1 
the attention given to every character and complex psychological portrayals detailing loyalty treachery love and hope are tremendous 1 
im so sorry but i really cant recommend it to anyone 0 
ill be looking for a new earpiece 0 
the 12 mega pixel camera being a part of a phone is reasonably good7 1 
i have been in more than a few bars in vegas and do not ever recall being charged for tap water 0 
after watching this film i wanted to learn more about the works of this artist 1 
for that price i can think of a few place i would have much rather gone 0 
that company is a joke 0 
product was excellent and works better than the verizon one and boy was it cheaper 1 
good audio quality 1 
jabra ear gels r the best 1 
lange had become a great actress 1 
i really loved the story line and the poler bear was kinda cutebut if anyone has a question about fort steele just ask away 1 
we watched our waiter pay a lot more attention to other tables and ignore us 0 
worst thai ever 0 
tasted like dirt 0 
after the disappointing dinner we went elsewhere for dessert 0 
i couldnt think of a better way to end the film but a smile on my face great way to wrap up an amazing film and trilogy 1 
it was forced like everything in this movie 0 
im so sorry but i really cant recommend it to anyone 0 
gets the job done 1 
i really liked that 1 
also its slim enough to fit into my alarm clock docking station without removing the case 1 
new battery works great in phone 1 
the owner used to work at nobu so this place is really similar for half the price 1 
works great when my cat attacked the phone he scratched the protective strip instead of destroying the screen 1 
both of them were truly unbelievably good and i am so glad we went back 1 
check it out 1 
i will continue to come here on ladies night andddd date night highly recommend this place to anyone who is in the area 1 
works well 1
