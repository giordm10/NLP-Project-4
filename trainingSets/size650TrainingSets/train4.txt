maybe there would be a reasonable explanation for this atrocity 0 
i probably wont be coming back here 0 
there still are good actors around 1 
never got it 0 
omg the food was delicioso 1 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
this is probably one of the least effective and utterly unoriginal films i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
the flair bartenders are absolutely amazing 1 
the telephone repair man was really funny and his reactions to the nuts and bitchy boss were truly genuine 1 
service is quick and friendly 1 
the sound quality is good and functionality is awesome 1 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
there is a totally unnecessary trainroller coaster scene 0 
the service was terrible though 0 
poor reliability 0 
really good product 1 
battery chargelife is quite long 1 
bacon is hella salty 1 
strike 2 who wants to be rushed 0 
excellent bluetooth headset 1 
aside from its terrible lead this film has loads of other debits 0 
great case and price 1 
its one of the movies i need to see whenever it comes on tvnever mind the fact that i already have it memorized 1 
end of days is one of the worst bigbudget action movies ive ever seen 0 
at first glance it is a lovely bakery cafe nice ambiance clean friendly staff 1 
the food was very good 1 
the waitress was friendly and happy to accomodate for veganveggie options 1 
there was no chemistry between ben affleck and sandra bullock in this film and i couldnt understand why he would consider even leaving his wifetobe for this chick that he supposedly was knocked out by 0 
horrible phone 0 
i like steiners because its dark and it feels like a bar 1 
i kept catching the cable on the seat and i had to pull the phone out to turn it on an off 0 
all the other cases ive tried normally fall apart after a few months but this one seems to be in for the long haul 1 
this is one of peter watkins most accessible films 1 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
also were served hot bread and butter and home made potato chips with bacon bits on topvery original and very good 1 
no ear loop needed its tiny and the sound is great 1 
same evening him and i are both drastically sick 0 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
the phone is sturdy and waterproof 1 
it even has its sweet moments 1 
what happened next was prettyoff putting 0 
very friendly staff 1 
internet is excrutiatingly slow 0 
item arrived quickly and works great with my metro pcs samsung schr450 slider phone and sony premium sound in ear plugs 1 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
this phone is pretty sturdy and ive never had any large problems with it 1 
the decor is nice and the piano music soundtrack is pleasant 1 
they were excellent 1 
it didnt work people can not hear me when i talk 0 
a film not easily forgotten 1 
the battery is completely useless to me 0 
w810i is just superb 1 
nevertheless yet another wonderful film from the great masters stable 1 
the feel of the dining room was more college cooking course than high class dining and the service was slow at best 0 
we made the drive all the way from north scottsdale and i was not one bit disappointed 1 
the whole experience was underwhelming and i think well just go to ninja sushi next time 0 
krussel always good 1 
very tough and very short on flavor 0 
the sweet potato fries were very good and seasoned well 1 
the chains which im no fan of beat this place easily 0 
they really want to make your experience a good one 1 
in fact i liked it better than interview with a vampire and i liked this lestat stuart townsend better than cruises attempt 1 
this allows the possibility of double booking for the same date and time after the first 0 
the soundtrack sucked 0 
i wish i could enter negative values admins 0 
the potatoes were like rubber and you could tell they had been made up ahead of time being kept under a warmer 0 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
but this movie is definitely a below average rent 0 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
the telephone repair man was really funny and his reactions to the nuts and bitchy boss were truly genuine 1 
i enjoyed it 1 
this movie now joins revenge of the boogeyman and zombiez as part of the hellish trinity of horror films 0 
my gyro was basically lettuce only 0 
i had about two bites and refused to eat anymore 0 
i was able to do voice dialing in the car with no problem 1 
we definately enjoyed ourselves 1 
as for the mains also uninspired 0 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
great brunch spot 1 
good show samsung 1 
im glad i found this product on amazon it is hard to find it wasnt high priced 1 
i found the product to be easy to set up and use 1 
i was very excited to get this headset because i thought it was really cute 1 
sucked most of the stuff does not work with my phone 0 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
punishment park is a brilliant piece of cinema 1 
excellent bluetooth headset 1 
very dissapointing performance 0 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
the scripting of the subtle comedy is unmatched by any movie in recent years 1 
the problem was the script 0 
the selection of food was not the best 0 
great for the jawbone 1 
an instant classic with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits 1 
it is an hour and half waste of time following a bunch of very pretty high schoolers whine and cry about life 0 
i love my 350 headset my jabra350 bluetooth headset is great the reception is very good and the ear piece is a comfortable fit 1 
only pros large seating area nice bar area great simple drink menu the best brick oven pizza with homemade dough 1 
i also decided not to send it back because our waitress looked like she was on the verge of having a heart attack 0 
the film is well paced understated and one of the best courtroom documentaries ive seen 1 
good audio quality 1 
it is an excellent drama an excellent thriller and an excellent film 1 
even allowing for poor production values for the time 1971 and the format some kind of miniseries this is baaaaaad 0 
this is a witty and delightful adaptation of the dr seuss book brilliantly animated by upas finest and thoroughly deserving of its academy award 1 
weve tried to like this place but after 10 times i think were done with them 0 
perabo has a nice energy level and is obviously very comfortable in front of a camera 1 
not enough volume 0 
fans of the genre will be in heaven 1 
everything from acting to cinematography was solid 1 
the design is very odd as the ear clip is not very comfortable at all 0 
this battery is an excellent bargain 1 
if she had not rolled the eyes we may have stayed not sure if we will go back and try it again 0 
the casting is also horrible cause all you see is a really really bad actors period 0 
using all earpieces left or right this thing will not stay on my ear 0 
i just cant explain this movie more than romanticcharminghilariousand adorablethe junkyard scenes are funnyall the junkyard dogs have something specialtoo funny i laughedkids will love itbuy it when it comes outit has new features 1 
jamie foxx absolutely is ray charles 1 
but the duet between the astronaut and his doctor at the beginning of the movie is a perfect exchange if one considers that this movie was made well into the cold war and the astronauts biggest fear is that he has crashed in the ussr 1 
w810i is just superb 1 
what a disappointment 0 
also its slim enough to fit into my alarm clock docking station without removing the case 1 
it was attached to a gas station and that is rarely a good sign 0 
last night was my second time dining here and i was so happy i decided to go back 1 
weve have gotten a much better service from the pizza place next door than the services we received from this restaurant 0 
the reception has been generally good 1 
definitely worth checking out 1 
ill put this gem up against any movie in terms of screenplay cinematography acting postproduction editing directing or any other aspect of filmmaking 1 
it shouldnt take 30 min for pancakes and eggs 0 
good quality 1 
its a case of so bad it is laughable 0 
and i really did find them funny 1 
worst service to boot but that is the least of their worries 0 
the chips and salsa were really good the salsa was very fresh 1 
this short film certainly pulls no punches 0 
my rating just 3 out of 10 0 
i gave it a 10 1 
ambience is perfect 1 
another thing i didnt really like is when a character got punched in the face a gallon of blood would spew forth soon after 0 
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0 
but kevin spacey is an excellent verbal tsunami as buddy ackerman  and totally believable because he is a great actor 1 
i mean really how do you get so famous for your fish and chips when its so terrible 0 
to my disbelief each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods i have ever tasted 0 
omelets are to die for 1 
the story starts too fast with absolutely no suspense or buildup in the slightest 0 
each day of the week they have a different deal and its all so delicious 1 
highly recommended a 1 
what a big waste of time 0 
it was not good 0 
i recently tried caballeros and i have been back every week since 1 
frozen pucks of disgust with some of the worst people behind the register 0 
enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film 1 
its this pandering to the audience that sabotages most of his films 0 
cinematography the film was shot in an interesting way 1 
the meat was pretty dry i had the sliced brisket and pulled pork 0 
this place is disgusting 0 
one of the most disappointing aspects is the lack of notable gore 0 
all the characters in this film are tremendously well played 1 
has been working great 1 
this is some seriously good pizza and im an expertconnisseur on the topic 1 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
left very frustrated 0 
everything about this product is wrongfirst 0 
overall i was not impressed and would not go back 0 
everything on the menu is terrific and we were also thrilled that they made amazing accommodations for our vegetarian daughter 1 
verizon tech support walked my through a few procedures none of which worked and i ended up having to do a hard reset wiping out all my data 0 
this place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver 0 
theres really nothing bad i can say about this headset 0 
i was so insulted 0 
this is simply the best bluetooth headset for sound quality 1 
because both ears are occupied background is not distracting at all 1 
i have 23 bars on my cell phone when i am home but you cant not hear anything 0 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
in fact this stinker smells like a directtovideo release 0 
unfortunately any virtue in this films production work was lost on a regrettable script 0 
very prompt service 1 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
thus far have only visited twice and the food was absolutely delicious each time 1 
the tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu 0 
the manager was the worst 0 
his performance is simply genius 1 
i dont think you will be disappointed 1 
this was reflected not only in the cast but also in the belowpar script which borrowed much from the earlier classic 0 
the film is way too long 0 
while you dont yet hear mickey speak there are tons of sound effects and music throughout the filmsomething we take for granted now but which was a huge crowd pleaser in 1928 1 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
the waitress and manager are so friendly 1 
there were several moments in the movie that just didnt need to be there and were excruciatingly slow moving 0 
host staff were for lack of a better word bitches 0 
a happy wonderful feel good ending 1 
a fly was in my apple juice a fly 0 
but it wasnt anything at all just one big yawn 0 
wont ever go here again 0 
i loved their mussels cooked in this wine reduction the duck was tender and their potato dishes were delicious 1 
great product for the price 1 
however my girl was complain that some time the phone doesnt wake up like normal phone does 0 
very very disappointed ordered the 35 big bay plater 0 
the phone was unusable and was not new 0 
i was mortified 0 
what a waste of time 0 
disapointing results 0 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
worst customer service ever 0 
i could eat their bruschetta all day it is devine 1 
this movie creates its own universe and is fascinating in every way 1 
the flair bartenders are absolutely amazing 1 
i love the ringtones because they are so upbeat 1 
this game rocks 1 
the seller is very understanding and patient i would definitely buy from them again 1 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
could not get strong enough signal 0 
service is perfect and the family atmosphere is nice to see 1 
the cable looks so thin and flimsy it is scary 0 
the nokia ca42 usb cable did not work with my phone 0 
this item is fantastic and works perfectly 1 
trumbull on i love lucy 1 
its kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly its embarrassing how childlike the company is 0 
the loudspeaker option is great the bumpers with the lights is very appealing 0 
also difficult to put onid recommend avoiding this product 0 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
i checked out this place a couple years ago and was not impressed 0 
i left with a stomach ache and felt sick the rest of the day 0 
i really do recommend this place you can go wrong with this donut place 1 
as i said abovepretty useless 0 
maybe its just their vegetarian fare but ive been twice and i thought it was average at best 0 
first off the reception sucks i have never had more than 2 bars ever 0 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
i will continue to come here on ladies night andddd date night highly recommend this place to anyone who is in the area 1 
the food was outstanding and the prices were very reasonable 1 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
the text messaging feature is really tricky to use 0 
then scene where they debated whether or not to sack the trumpeter who falsely was accused for the murder is pure horror really stupid 0 
superb phone on a great network 1 
utterly without merit on any level this is akin to torture 0 
all the characters in this film are tremendously well played 1 
to those who find this movie intelligent or even masterful i can only say its your intelligence and your imagination you obviously used to try and make some sense of this pitiful attempt its in our human nature to try and make sense of things 0 
it was horrendous 0 
the story line is totally predictable 0 
if you simply want a small flip phone look elsewhere as the extra bells whistles are mediocre 0 
verizons bills however are difficult to understand even though their pricing plans are simple 0 
nice quality build unlike some cheap s out there 1 
the nachos are a must have 1 
this wonderful experience made this place a muststop whenever we are in town again 1 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
spoilers whatever else can or cant be said about it surface is superbly crafted 1 
she ordered a toasted english muffin that came out untoasted 0 
lousy product 0 
nice ambiance 1 
very prompt service 1 
i can take a little bad service but the food sucks 0 
i didnt realize how wonderful the short really is until the last two scenes 1 
im very disappointed with my decision 0 
i think not again 0 
my gyro was basically lettuce only 0 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
oh yeah and the storyline was pathetic too 0 
the sides are delish mixed mushrooms yukon gold puree white corn beateous 1 
what a waste 0 
logitech bluetooth headset is a 10 1 
the pancake was also really good and pretty large at that 1 
none of the three sizes they sent with the headset would stay in my ears 0 
after two i felt disgusting 0 
i asked multiple times for the wine list and after some time of being ignored i went to the hostess and got one myself 0 
great phone 1 
wed definitely go back here again 1 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
sauce was tasteless 0 
this phone is slim and light and the display is beautiful 1 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
def coming back to bowl next time 1 
i recommend this for everyone who loves film movies anythinga work of art 1 
speaking of the music it is unbearably predictably and kitchy 0 
it is shameful 0 
do not buy if you want to use the holster 0 
this pda rocks 1 
rating 1 out of 10 0 
disappointed 0 
cant say enough good things about this place 1 
i like design and look of jabra behing the ear headsets and 5020 is pretty comfortible to wear 24 hours a day without pain in the ear 1 
worst customer service ever 0 
it doesnt work in europe or asia 0 
50 down the drain 0 
obviously they have a terrible customer service so you get what you pay for 0 
jamie foxx absolutely is ray charles 1 
it came free with a dvd player i bought but i still turned the thing off halfway through because i was embarrassed for howell 0 
who in their right mind is gonna buy this battery 0 
but storm trooper is not even bad enough to make it to the list of wonderfully terrible movies 0 
i found this move beautiful enjoyable and uplifting 1 
be sure to order dessert even if you need to pack it togo the tiramisu and cannoli are both to die for 1 
each day of the week they have a different deal and its all so delicious 1 
good servicecheck 1 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
good audio quality 1 
food arrived quickly 1 
they work about 2 weeks then break 0 
would recommend this item 1 
their monster chicken fried steak and eggs is my all time favorite 1 
but in any case the best part is you can download these pictures to your laptop using ir or even send pictures from your laptop to the phone 1 
i will be back many times soon 1 
after the first charge kept going dead after 12 minutes 0 
went for lunch service was slow 0 
makes it easier to keep up with my bluetooth when im not wearing it 0 
mic doesnt work 0 
this hole in the wall has great mexican street tacos and friendly staff 1 
im using it with an iriver spinn with case and it fits fine 1 
as many people complained i found this headsets microphone was very weak 0 
what happened next was prettyoff putting 0 
we had a group of 70 when we claimed we would only have 40 and they handled us beautifully 1 
dont do it 0 
this place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver 0 
i had strawberry tea which was good 1 
muddy low quality sound and the casing around the wires insert was poorly super glued and slid off 0 
not my thing 0 
do not make the same mistake as me 0 
waitress was sweet and funny 1 
youll love how thin it is 1 
if there were zero stars i would give it zero stars 0 
the bathrooms are clean and the place itself is well decorated 1 
wont work right or atleast for me 0 
i waited and waited 0 
lots of holes in the script 0 
i was very disappointed 0 
itll be a regular stop on my trips to phoenix 1 
i received my headset in good time and was happy with it 1 
an awesome new look for fall 2000 1 
the success of the film depends on the casting of sydney greenstreet as the alexander yardley character 1 
the sergeant pepper beef sandwich with auju sauce is an excellent sandwich as well 1 
their onscreen chemistry critical to the entire film is genuine 1 
disappointed 0 
there are massive levels massive unlockable characters its just a massive game 1 
the phone is sturdy and waterproof 1 
i dont know what kind it is but they have the best iced tea 1 
sound quality on both end is excellent i use headset to call my wife and ask my wife to use headset to call me 2 1 
but this movie is not funny considering the ridiculousness of it 0 
very disappointing 0 
basically the service was very bad 0 
i cant use this case because the smell is disgusting 0 
no ear loop needed its tiny and the sound is great 1 
the last 15 minutes of movie are also not bad as well 1 
i would give this television series a 10 plus if i could 1 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
i dont each much pasta but i love the homemade hand made pastas and thin pizzas here 1 
they were goldencrispy and delicious 1 
you can find better movies at youtube 0 
in a word it is embarrassing 0 
say bye bye to your tip lady 0 
20th century foxs road house 1948 is not only quite a silly noir but is an implausible unmitigated bore of a movie 0 
lousy product 0 
i have had tmobile service for 2 or 3 years now and i am pretty happy with it 1 
please dont waste your money 0 
there is nothing authentic about this place 0 
the bipolarity of the ruthless thug one minute a ruthless killer the next minute a luvs diaper commercial is completely unconvincing 0 
i could care less the interior is just beautiful 1 
pretty cool i would say 1 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
the staff was very attentive 1 
it was equally awful 0 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
too bad you have to pay up to a month for the service 0 
great food and great service in a clean and friendly setting 1 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
have been going since 2007 and every meal has been awesome 1 
highly unprofessional and rude to a loyal patron 0 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
it is very comfortable to wear as well which is probably the most important aspect about using a case 1 
they do not care about the consumer one bit 0 
also the phone doesnt seem to accept anything except cbr mp3s preferably ripped by windows media player 0 
youd have to have the iq of particularly stupid mollusk not to see that one coming 0 
nice case feels good in your hands 1 
phone is sturdy as all nokia bar phones are 1 
i am very impressed with the job that motorola did on the sturdiness of this phone 1 
its too bad the food is so damn generic 0 
i love this cable it allows me to connect any miniusb device to my pc 1 
great software for motorolas 1 
this movie does an excellent job of revealing the complexity of the task and the incredible challenges facing south africa 1 
although i very much liked the look and sound of this place the actual experience was a bit disappointing 0 
battery is terrible 0 
i found the product to be easy to set up and use 1 
this product is great it makes working a lot easier i can go to the copier while waiting on hold for something 1 
great phone 1 
if you havent gone here go now 1 
the lead man is charismafree 0 
their menu is diverse and reasonably priced 1 
magical help 1 
what did bother me was the slow service 0 
the tracfonewebsite is user friendly and makes it easy toactivate etc 1 
yes its shiny on front side and i love it 1 
meredith m was better than all right 1 
this is a great phone 1 
unfortunately cover girl is an example of how hollywood used to exploit women for financial gain 0 
maybe its just their vegetarian fare but ive been twice and i thought it was average at best 0 
this place is overpriced not consistent with their boba and it really is overpriced 0 
worked great 1 
it is simple to use and i like it 1 
not good for the money 0 
great value 1 
the script is bad very bad  it contains both cheesiness and unethical joke that you normally see in rated r or nc17 movie 0 
it will drive you barking mad 0 
heres where the movie really pied me off 0 
reversible plug works great 1 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
i have been very happy with the 510 and have had no complaints from any one regarding my sound quality on their end 1 
however my girl was complain that some time the phone doesnt wake up like normal phone does 0 
this one works and was priced right 1 
this was such an awesome movie that i bought it off of ebay 1 
an awesome new look for fall 2000 1 
ps the only scene in the movie that was cool is when the central character finds her room blown up 1 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
the meat was pretty dry i had the sliced brisket and pulled pork 0 
bad characters bad story and bad acting 0 
here in the wind and the lion we see a wonderful rendering of americas own imperial age 1 
how can anyone in their right mind ask for anything more from a movie than this 1 
the memories are murky but i can only say that i enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show 1 
not to mention the combination of pears almonds and bacon is a big winner 1 
i was not impressed by this product 0 
i liked this movie way too much 1 
i received my supposedly new motorola 375 and apparently there was not a match between the phone and the charger 0 
i ordered the lemon raspberry ice cocktail which was also incredible 1 
blue ant is easy to use 1 
the charger worked for about a week and then completely stopped charging my phone 0 
first off the reception sucks i have never had more than 2 bars ever 0 
works like a charm it work the same as the one i got with the phone 1 
the acting sucked 0 
seriously flavorful delights folks 1 
i have two more years left in this contract and i hate this phone 0 
we sat another ten minutes and finally gave up and left 0 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
not a weekly haunt but definitely a place to come back to every once in a while 1 
the film gives meaning to the phrase never in the history of human conflict has so much been owed by so many to so few 1 
so badwellits just bad 0 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
after my phone got to be about a year old its been slowly breaking despite much care on my part 0 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
not to mention the combination of pears almonds and bacon is a big winner 1 
works well 1 
the very idea of it was lame take a minor character from a mediocre pg13 film and make a complete nonsequel while changing its tone to a pgrated family movie 0 
as for the service im a fan because its quick and youre being served by some nice folks 1 
left very frustrated 0 
poor reliability 0 
painful on the ear 0 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
the hockey scenes are terrible defensemen playing like theyre 5 years old goalies diving at shots that are 10 feet wide of the net etc 0 
not sure who was more lost the flat characters or the audience nearly half of whom walked out 0 
couldnt use the unit with sunglasses not good in texas 0 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
the results well are a shame 0 
everything stinks 0 
the refried beans that came with my meal were dried out and crusty and the food was bland 0 
lucy bell is so much higher than this crap and for her to sink this low is quite depressing 0 
the fries were great too 1 
its a great item 1 
the food amazing 1 
this particular model would not work with my motorola q smartphone 0 
phone is sturdy as all nokia bar phones are 1 
cant say enough good things about this place 1 
if you havent gone here go now 1 
woa talk about awful 0 
the scenery that the two daughters paint and photograph are beautiful 1 
i tried the cape cod ravoli chickenwith cranberrymmmm 1 
the bipolarity of the ruthless thug one minute a ruthless killer the next minute a luvs diaper commercial is completely unconvincing 0 
spend your money and time some place else 0 
this movie is so awesome 1 
kris kristoffersen is good in this movie and really makes a difference 1 
utterly without merit on any level this is akin to torture 0 
my phone doesnt slide around my car now and the grip prevents my phone from slipping out of my hand 1 
the design is very odd as the ear clip is not very comfortable at all 0 
this phone works great 1 
definitely worth checking out 1 
highly unprofessional and rude to a loyal patron 0 
painful on the ear 0 
i own 2 of these cases and would order another 1 
battery is terrible 0 
no shifting no bubbling no peeling not even a scratch nothingi couldnt be more happier with my new one for the droid 1 
horrible 0 
it was absolutely amazing 1 
what on earth is irons doing in this film 0 
not good for the money 0 
i had a seriously solid breakfast here 1 
but now that it is out of warranty the same problems reoccurebottom line put your money somewhere else cingular will not support it 0 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
great product fast shipping 1 
we recently witnessed her poor quality of management towards other guests as well 0 
the bt headset was such a disapoinment 0 
join the club and get awesome offers via email 1 
the structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema 1 
great price too 1 
kind of flops around 0 
im super pissd 0 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
what a piece of junk i lose more calls on this phone 0 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
i probably would not go here again 0 
when a song could explain the emotions of the subjects better such as when jay adams unfortunate life was a subject of talk the song old man by neil young was played which evokes many emotions 1 
excellent phone 1 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
you need at least 3 mins to get to your phone book from the time you first turn on the phonebattery life is short 0 
ive dropped my phone more times than i can say even on concrete and my phone is still great knock on wood 1 
give this one a look 1 
even when the women finally show up there is no sign of improvement the most expected things happen and by the time the film is over you might be far asleep 0 
im super pissd 0 
the movie had you on the edge of your seat and made you somewhat afraid to go to your car at the end of the night 1 
this review is long overdue since i consider a tale of two sisters to be the single greatest film ever made 1 
for those that havent seen it dont waste your time 0 
i received my supposedly new motorola 375 and apparently there was not a match between the phone and the charger 0 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
this is a bad film with bad writing and good actorsan ugly cartoon crafted by paul haggis for people who cant handle anything but the bold strokes in storytellinga picture painted with crayons 0 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
good works fine 1 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
this was a different cut than the piece the other day but still wonderful and tender s well as well flavored 1 
mishima is extremely uninteresting 0 
the worst sappiest dialogue i could go on and on 0 
it presents a idyllic yet serious portrayal of the ups and downs of the characters lives 1 
i seriously cannot believe that the owner has so many unexperienced employees that all are running around like chickens with their heads cut off 0 
much more interesting more action more suspense and less of the unneeded controversy 1 
the place was fairly clean but the food simply wasnt worth it 0 
you share general loewenhielms exquisite joy in his partaking of the cailles en sarcophage even though you are just watching a movie but you do wish for just a small sample to savor 1 
i am not a filmmaker nor am i a director but i would hide my head in the sand if id spent whatever amount of money and time on this movie 0 
recommend with confidence 1 
its been my choice headset for yearsgreat sound good volume good noise cancellation 1 
the food was excellent and service was very good 1 
i gave it 5 stars because of the sound quality 1 
definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly will return next time im in vegas 1 
a drive thru means you do not want to wait around for half an hour for your food but somehow when we end up going here they make us wait and wait 0 
very good product well made 1 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
to sum the film up breeders is a terrible cheaply made horror movie that should be avoided like the ebola virus 0 
i get absolutely horrible reception in my apartment where with other phones i have not had this problem 0 
not recommended 0 
w810i is just superb 1 
if there was ever an indication of a writer and a directors ability to meld two highly volatile temperaments into a seamless union of creativity then this is it 1 
highly unprofessional and rude to a loyal patron 0 
the songs were the best and the muppets were so hilarious 1 
cooked to perfection and the service was impeccable 1 
it was a bit too sweet not really spicy enough and lacked flavor 0 
better than new 1 
the fries were great too 1 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
again no plot at all 0 
what a mistake that was 0 
works fine 1 
nargile i think you are great 1 
otherwise dont even waste your time on this 0 
better than new 1 
do not buy if you want to use the holster 0 
the volume for the ringer is real good you have choices how loud 1 
i got the car charger and not even after a week the charger was brokeni went to plug it in and it started smoking 0 
it was too predictable even for a chick flick 0 
great choice 1 
so for our enjoyment we get to see them run around play games and be dangerous 1 
i can think of no other film where something vitally important occurs every other minute 1 
i find wasting food to be despicable but this just wasnt food 0 
if you havent choked in your own vomit by the end by all the cheap drama and worthless dialogue youve must have bored yourself to death with this waste of time 0 
the staff is always super friendly and helpful which is especially cool when you bring two small boys and a baby 1 
generous portions and great taste 1 
the price is reasonable and the service is great 1 
the very idea of it was lame take a minor character from a mediocre pg13 film and make a complete nonsequel while changing its tone to a pgrated family movie 0 
i wear it everyday and it holds up very well 1 
its also great to see that renowned silent screenwriter frances marion hasnt missed a step going from silent to sound 1 
verizons bills however are difficult to understand even though their pricing plans are simple 0 
the pairing of the two devices was so easy it barely took a couple minutes before i started making calls with the voice dialing feature 1 
i have seen many movies starring jaclyn smith but my god this was one of her best though it came out 12 years ago 1 
however the keypads are so tinny that i sometimes reach the wrong buttons 0 
the last 15 minutes of movie are also not bad as well 1 
go to place for gyros 1 
add betty white and jean smart and you have a great cast everyone played their parts really well 1 
im super pissd 0 
service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is vegas and located inside the crystals shopping mall by aria 1 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
i particularly remember my senses being assaulted by strident cords of music that would blare out with very little warning and even less meaning 0 
paolo sorrentino has written a wonderful story about loneliness and tony has built one of the most unforgettable characters seen in movies in recent years 1 
plus it was wellpaced and suited its relatively short run time 1 
unfortunately inexperience of direction meant that scene after scene passed with little in the way of dramatic tension or conflict 0 
if there were zero stars i would give it zero stars 0 
the refried beans that came with my meal were dried out and crusty and the food was bland 0 
the chains which im no fan of beat this place easily 0 
its extremely slow and takes forever to do anything with it 0 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
but now that it is out of warranty the same problems reoccurebottom line put your money somewhere else cingular will not support it 0 
the best place to go for a tasty bowl of pho 1 
the potato chip order was sad i could probably count how many chips were in that box and it was probably around 12 0 
also its slim enough to fit into my alarm clock docking station without removing the case 1 
this was a poor remake of my best friends wedding 0 
he surely doesnt know how to make a coherent action movie from the screenwriter of air force one who was only obliged to write the script just for a big sum of money 0 
very disappointed and wondered how it could be in the oscar shortlist 0 
it was way over fried 0 
it was horrendous 0 
it feels poorly constructed the menus are difficult to navigate and the buttons are so recessed that it is difficult to push them 0 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
it quit working after id used it for about 18 months so i just purchased another one because this is the best headset ive ever owned 1 
the earpiece on this is too large or too heavyit keeps falling out of my ear 0 
kind of hard to mess up a steak but they did 0 
it even has its sweet moments 1 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
one more thing i can tolerate political incorrectness very well im all for artistic freedom and suspension of disbelief but the slavic female character was just too much 0 
he also came back to check on us regularly excellent service 1 
here in the wind and the lion we see a wonderful rendering of americas own imperial age 1 
this place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver 0 
unfortunately cover girl is an example of how hollywood used to exploit women for financial gain 0 
i highly recommend this case 1 
as i said abovepretty useless 0 
owners are really great people 1 
does not fit 0 
this item is great installed it let it charged up overnite and it has been working good every since with no problems 1 
useless phone simply deaf 0 
the music in the film is really nice too 1 
his losing his marbles so early in the proceedings is totally implausible and unconvincing 0 
so anyone near you will hear part of your conversation 0 
fast service 1 
well packaged arrived on time and works as intended 1 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
i wish i could return the unit and get back my money 0 
all in all i can assure you ill be back 1 
no one at the table thought the food was above average or worth the wait that we had for it 0 
just as good as when i had it more than a year ago 1 
i waited and waited 0 
four stars for the food the guy in the blue shirt for his great vibe still letting us in to eat 1 
great product for the price 1 
some may say this buffet is pricey but i think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot 1 
he really didnt seem to want to be hosting his voiceovers were monotonous didnt get involved with the guests 0 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
loved itfriendly servers great food wonderful and imaginative menu 1 
terrible management 0 
the staff is always super friendly and helpful which is especially cool when you bring two small boys and a baby 1 
it worked very well 1 
on three different occasions i asked for well done or medium well and all three times i got the bloodiest piece of meat on my plate 0 
the script is a big flawed mess 0 
it wasnt busy at all and now we know why 0 
i was seated immediately 1 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
about ten minutes into this film i started having second thoughts 0 
oh yeah and the storyline was pathetic too 0 
not loud enough and doesnt turn on like it should 0 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
unfortunately the ability to actually know you are receiving a call is a rather important feature and this phone is pitiful in that respect 0 
dont waste your money 0 
her lines seem to have been written by a fifteen year old though they are trying oh so so hard to sound like how a fifteen year old would really um you know well talk 0 
waaaaaayyyyyyyyyy over rated is all i am saying 0 
one character is totally annoying with a voice that gives me the feeling of fingernails on a chalkboard 0 
couldnt figure it out 0 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
mediocre food 0 
the food sucked which we expected but it sucked more than we could have imagined 0
