after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
good price 1 
jamie foxx absolutely is ray charles 1 
this is one of the best movies out there that shows such strong sibling bond for each other 1 
ill definitely be in soon again 1 
food quality has been horrible 0 
the film deserves strong kudos for taking this stand for having exceptional acting from its mostly lesserknown cast and for the superintelligent script that doesnt insult the audience or take the easy way out when it comes to white racism 1 
the sets especially designed to work with the camera are amazingstylized beautiful and effective 1 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
awesome device 1 
works well 1 
still its quite interesting and entertaining to follow 1 
her lines seem to have been written by a fifteen year old though they are trying oh so so hard to sound like how a fifteen year old would really um you know well talk 0 
the scripting of the subtle comedy is unmatched by any movie in recent years 1 
camerawork again bad 0 
in my house i was getting dropped coverage upstairs and no coverage in my basement 0 
there is a totally unnecessary trainroller coaster scene 0 
jamie foxx absolutely is ray charles 1 
but it picked up speed and got right to the point 1 
the kids are very cool too 1 
the buttons for on and off are bad 0 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
all this movie does is make you sick watching all these slackers make excuses for their stupid actions for 90 minutes 0 
im trying to return it for a refund 0 
excellent starter wireless headset 0 
a happy wonderful feel good ending 1 
im probably one of the few people to ever go to ians and not like it 0 
and service was super friendly 1 
i have to mention this and it is a huge spoiler i loved the ending how all the characters of the three films were the remaining survivors of the ferry disaster with valentine and the young judge together and the old man watching it on her tv solidifying his happiness over the suffering which he dealt with for those many years 1 
the bt headset was such a disapoinment 0 
terrible service 0 
i agree with jessica this movie is pretty bad 0 
people couldnt hear me talk and i had to pull out the earphone and talk on the phone 0 
i was so insulted 0 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
portable and it works 1 
i highly recommend these and encourage people to give them a try 1 
and the chef was generous with his time even came around twice so we can take pictures with him 1 
appears to actually outperform the original battery from china that came with my v325i 1 
really good product 1 
today was my first taste of a buldogis gourmet hot dog and i have to tell you it was more than i ever thought possible 1 
i am so pleased to know such a modern day genius is out there letting is passion for art drive him and taking us as an audience with him 1 
service was good and the company was better 1 
its worth driving up from tucson 1 
the acting was bad 0 
the plot has more holes than a pair of fishnet stockings and the direction and editing is astonishingly ham fisted 0 
a world better than 95 of the garbage in the theatres today 1 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
hackneyed writing certainly but made even worse by the bad directing 0 
overall i like there food and the service 1 
couldnt use the unit with sunglasses not good in texas 0 
it is a true classic 1 
low quality 0 
its extremely slow and takes forever to do anything with it 0 
if only someone involved with it knew how to string together narrative 0 
i literally vomited while watching this film 0 
the phone loads super 1 
i had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get some relief 0 
the macarons here are insanely good 1 
either way it sucks 0 
the range is very decent ive been able to roam around my house with the phone in the living room with no receptionsound quality issues 1 
the dining space is tiny but elegantly decorated and comfortable 1 
to sum the film up breeders is a terrible cheaply made horror movie that should be avoided like the ebola virus 0 
to sum the film up breeders is a terrible cheaply made horror movie that should be avoided like the ebola virus 0 
very easy to use 1 
i bought this to use with my kindle fire and absolutely loved it 1 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
works great 1 
worst customer service ever 0 
but the service was beyond bad 0 
and it was way to expensive 0 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
when i received my pita it was huge it did have a lot of meat in it so thumbs up there 1 
the ending is so so perfect youll shed a tear 1 
i give wirefly 1 stari will contact cingularatt and inform them of this practice 0 
i would have given no star if i was able 0 
also its slim enough to fit into my alarm clock docking station without removing the case 1 
i searched the internet and found this one to be the best value 1 
very good though 1 
it was way over fried 0 
1010 1 
it crackles with an unpredictable youthful energy but honestly i found it hard to follow and concentrate on it meanders so badly 0 
this is truly an art movieit actually has a lot of art in it 1 
there was hardly any meat 0 
kids pizza is always a hit too with lots of great side dish options for the kiddos 1 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
tasted like dirt 0 
this is some seriously good pizza and im an expertconnisseur on the topic 1 
i was bored throughout the whole damn thing 0 
will be back again 1 
we ordered some old classics and some new dishes after going there a few times and were sorely disappointed with everything 0 
no additional ear gels provided and no instructions whatsoever 0 
i love the camera its really pretty good quality 1 
a good quality bargain i bought this after i bought a cheapy from big lots that sounded awful and people on the other end couldnt hear me 1 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
my boyfriend and i sat at the bar and had a completely delightful experience 1 
this item is fantastic and works perfectly 1 
extremely tasty 1 
this movie is so awesome 1 
to call this movie a drama is ridiculous 0 
spend your money elsewhere 0 
and i really did find them funny 1 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
do not buy do not buyit sucks 0 
the warm beer didnt help 0 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
an instant classic with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits 1 
verizon tech support walked my through a few procedures none of which worked and i ended up having to do a hard reset wiping out all my data 0 
the results well are a shame 0 
my headset works just peachykeen 1 
good food good service 1 
the phone is sturdy and waterproof 1 
fans of the genre will be in heaven 1 
go and see it 1 
in short dont bother with this movie 0 
this product is great it makes working a lot easier i can go to the copier while waiting on hold for something 1 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
often the dialogue doesnt really follow from one line to another or fit the surroundings 0 
loved itfriendly servers great food wonderful and imaginative menu 1 
i loved it it was really scary 1 
i have 23 bars on my cell phone when i am home but you cant not hear anything 0 
at a time when it seems that film animation has been dominated by disneypixars cgi masterpieces it is both refreshing and comforting to know that miyazaki is still relying on traditional handdrawn animation to tell his charming and enchanting stories 1 
third the cheese on my friends burger was cold 0 
service is quick and friendly 1 
the sound quality is good and functionality is awesome 1 
i purchased this and within 2 days it was no longer working 0 
battery has no life 0 
no additional ear gels provided and no instructions whatsoever 0 
when my mom and i got home she immediately got sick and she only had a few bites of salad 0 
it was too predictable even for a chick flick 0 
talk about great customer service of course we will be back 1 
the acting is like watching wooden puppets moving around and reading from a book thats how bad it is 0 
very good phone 1 
very disappointing 0 
stay away from the q 0 
then a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use 0 
cooked to perfection and the service was impeccable 1 
this is the kind of money that is wasted properly 1 
if you hate earbugs avoid this phone by all means 0 
it came free with a dvd player i bought but i still turned the thing off halfway through because i was embarrassed for howell 0 
does not fit 0 
by the time the film ended i not only disliked it i despised it 0 
both do good jobs and are quite amusing 1 
magical help 1 
why was this film made 0 
this is an excellent tool especially when paired with your phones autoanswer 1 
its a mediocre miserable hollow laughable and predictable piece of garbage 0 
even allowing for poor production values for the time 1971 and the format some kind of miniseries this is baaaaaad 0 
graphics is far from the best part of the game 0 
why was this film made 0 
aside from its terrible lead this film has loads of other debits 0 
i highly recommend this modest priced cellular phone 1 
and the accents are absolutely abysmal 0 
the classic maine lobster roll was fantastic 1 
this one works and was priced right 1 
long whiny and pointless 0 
great for ipods too 1 
so good i am going to have to review this place twice once hereas a tribute to the place and once as a tribute to an event held here last night 1 
these are the central themes of the film and they are handled ineptly stereotypically and with no depth of imagination 0 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
comfortable nice range good battery life 1 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
at no point in the proceedings does it look remotely like america 0 
truly awful 0 
great phone 1 
1 long lasting battery you dont have to recharge it as frequentyly as some of the flip phones2 0 
this film tries to be a serious and sophisticated thrillerhorror flick and it fails miserably 0 
i will not be eating there again 0 
give this one a look 1 
in an interesting part of town this place is amazing 1 
the only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive 1 
bluetooth range is good a few days ago i left my phone in the trunk got a call and carried the conversation without a hitch 1 
it always cuts out and makes a beep beep beep sound then says signal failed 0 
maybe if they werent cold they would have been somewhat edible 0 
i love the look and feel of samsung flipphones 1 
i think that it is a must see older john wayne film 1 
love the margaritas too 1 
it has a great camera thats 2mp and the pics are nice and clear with great picture quality 1 
i believe that pitch black was done well 1 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
not much seafood and like 5 strings of pasta at the bottom 0 
i highly recommend this device to everyone 1 
then i exchanged for the same phone even that had the same problem 0 
an awesome new look for fall 2000 1 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
of course the acting is blah 0 
the selection on the menu was great and so were the prices 1 
all the bread is made inhouse 1 
do not purchase this phone 0 
this place deserves no stars 0 
i have been in more than a few bars in vegas and do not ever recall being charged for tap water 0 
it feels poorly constructed the menus are difficult to navigate and the buttons are so recessed that it is difficult to push them 0 
great phone 1 
i dont know what kind it is but they have the best iced tea 1 
not recommended 0 
appears to actually outperform the original battery from china that came with my v325i 1 
the script is bad very bad  it contains both cheesiness and unethical joke that you normally see in rated r or nc17 movie 0 
disappointed 0 
these are the nicest restaurant owners ive ever come across 1 
well im satisfied 1 
lets start with all the problemsthe acting especially from the lead professor was very very bad 0 
by the time the film ended i not only disliked it i despised it 0 
excellent product for the price 1 
magical help 1 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
total waste of time 0 
ray charles is legendary 1 
not good by any stretch of the imagination 0 
i rate this movie 910 1 
main thing i didnt enjoy is that the crowd is of older crowd around mid 30s and up 0 
i would recommend saving room for this 1 
waitress was sweet and funny 1 
still waiting im sure this item would work well if i ever recieve it 0 
even when the women finally show up there is no sign of improvement the most expected things happen and by the time the film is over you might be far asleep 0 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
im translating movies for a living and this is the first movie in my 5year working experience that i found offensive to my intelligence 0 
however bt headsets are currently not good for real time games like firstperson shooters since the audio delay messes me up 0 
the movie had you on the edge of your seat and made you somewhat afraid to go to your car at the end of the night 1 
the waitresses are very friendly 1 
if you look for authentic thai food go else where 0 
i love lane but ive never seen her in a movie this lousy 0 
this place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver 0 
this movie is greatespecially if you enjoy visual arts 1 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
this is probably one of the least effective and utterly unoriginal films i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
waited 2 hours never got either of our pizzas as many other around us who came in later did 0 
great phone 1 
the characters were all funny and had the peculiarity of not having a true lead character 1 
in addition it feels amp looks as if the phone is all lightweight cheap plastic 0 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
we loved the place 1 
if there was ever an indication of a writer and a directors ability to meld two highly volatile temperaments into a seamless union of creativity then this is it 1 
his costars dont fare much better with people like morgan freeman jonah hill and ed helms just wasted 0 
i believe that pitch black was done well 1 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
i contacted the company and they told me that although the unit was still under warranty if i couldnt produce my receipt i was out of luck 0 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
you learn a lot about the real inside emotions of people in this movie and a lot about the movie business itself 1 
the scenery that the two daughters paint and photograph are beautiful 1 
check it out 1 
i seriously cannot believe that the owner has so many unexperienced employees that all are running around like chickens with their heads cut off 0 
do not waste your money here 0 
doesnt hold charge 0 
i found the product to be easy to set up and use 1 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
the building itself seems pretty neat the bathroom is pretty trippy but i wouldnt eat here again 0 
this is one of the worst sandra bullock movie since speed 2 but not quite that bad 0 
but the movie makes a lot of serious mistakes 0 
this is one of the better buffets that i have been to 1 
great case and price 1 
however bt headsets are currently not good for real time games like firstperson shooters since the audio delay messes me up 0 
it is a true classic 1 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
the movie showed a lot of florida at its best made it look very appealing 1 
but other than that the movie seemed to drag and the heroes didnt really work for their freedom 0 
the service was terrible food was mediocre 0 
when my mom and i got home she immediately got sick and she only had a few bites of salad 0 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
excellent phone 1 
battery is terrible 0 
its also great to see that renowned silent screenwriter frances marion hasnt missed a step going from silent to sound 1 
with the originality and freshness of the first movie now spent this remake had little else to offer 0 
good item low price 1 
in fact this stinker smells like a directtovideo release 0 
performed awful muffled tinny incoming sound and severe echo for those on the other end of the call 0 
and i really did find them funny 1 
the movie had you on the edge of your seat and made you somewhat afraid to go to your car at the end of the night 1 
but it is great i would really recommend it 1 
the ambiance was incredible 1 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
the goat taco didnt skimp on the meat and wow what flavor 1 
this place is horrible and way overpriced 0 
this is probably one of the least effective and utterly unoriginal films i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
i wont be back 0 
i had a seriously solid breakfast here 1 
definitely a turn off for me i doubt ill be back unless someone else is buying 0 
they dropped more than the ball 0 
the earpiece on this is too large or too heavyit keeps falling out of my ear 0 
well never go again 0 
i have had mine for about a year and this christmas i bought some for the rest of the family 1 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
service was very prompt 1 
one character is totally annoying with a voice that gives me the feeling of fingernails on a chalkboard 0 
this is one of the best italian thrillers of the early 70s 1 
the folks at otto always make us feel so welcome and special 1 
it fits so securely that the ear hook does not even need to be used and the sound is better directed through your ear canal 1 
in fact this stinker smells like a directtovideo release 0 
the cast of veteran actors are more than just a nostalgia trip 1 
not recommended 0 
this product is clearly not ready for prime time i dont care how cool it looks if you cant tell a call is coming in its worthless 0 
i really liked that 1 
the design is very good4 1 
one more thing i can tolerate political incorrectness very well im all for artistic freedom and suspension of disbelief but the slavic female character was just too much 0 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
i would recommend purchasing the jabra jx10 series 2 which works flawlessly with my moto q go figure 1 
made very sturdy 1 
but storm trooper is not even bad enough to make it to the list of wonderfully terrible movies 0 
worst martini ever 0 
the atmosphere is modern and hip while maintaining a touch of coziness 1 
awful 0 
still waiting im sure this item would work well if i ever recieve it 0 
the movie in movie situations in the beginning and through the game that is played with her by the acting coach are fascinating 1 
this movie contained an allstar cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i havent seen before 1 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
it is zillion times away from reality 0 
the burger i got the gold standard a 17 burger and was kind of disappointed 0 
graphics is far from the best part of the game 0 
if you dont find it too bad as again the unit comes with one earpad onlyi would not recommend this to anyone 0 
lets start with all the problemsthe acting especially from the lead professor was very very bad 0 
only had this a month but its worked flawlessly so far 1 
your brain will attempt to shutdown as part of a primal impulse of selfpreservation 0 
very happy with this product 1 
if you do watch it however there are small consolations the actresses playing annes sisters each do a wonderful job with their roles 1 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
this movie contained an allstar cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i havent seen before 1 
the death row scenes were entirely unmoving 0 
please dont waste your money 0 
black water is a thriller that manages to completely transcend its limitations its an indie flick by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience 1 
i came over from verizon because cingulair has nicer cell phones the first thing i noticed was the really bad service 0 
seriously its not worth wasting your or your kids time on 0 
the keyboard is a nice compromise between a full qwerty and the basic cell phone number keypad 1 
i have had problems wit hit dropping signal and more 0 
the best place in vegas for breakfast just check out a sat or sun 1 
this movie is excellentangel is beautiful and scamp is adorablehis little yelps when hes scaredand the funniest parts are whenscamp is caught under the curtain and when angel and scamp are singing ive never had this feeling beforei totally recommend this movieits coming out on special edition on june 20the cover has scamp on a garbage can and angel underneath the lid 1 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
cinematography noteworthy including fine views of barcelona and its famed gaudi towers 1 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
the cinematography is simply stunning to say the least and the fx are nothing if not stateoftheart 1 
good price 1 
sprint charges for this service 0 
the service was great even the manager came and helped with our table 1 
food was great and so was the serivce 1 
i rate this movie 910 1 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
i liked this movie way too much 1 
not a good bargain 0 
it was a pale color instead of nice and char and has no flavor 0 
i have been very happy with the 510 and have had no complaints from any one regarding my sound quality on their end 1 
works well 1 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
the plastic breaks really easy on this clip 0 
seriously flavorful delights folks 1 
those phones are working just fine now 1 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
on the negative its insipid enough to cause regret for another 2 hours of life wasted in front of the screen 0 
this movie totally grates on my nerves 0 
it failed to convey the broad sweep of landscapes that were a great part of the original 0 
but in any case the best part is you can download these pictures to your laptop using ir or even send pictures from your laptop to the phone 1 
great place to relax and have an awesome burger and beer 1 
made very sturdy 1 
the loudspeaker option is great the bumpers with the lights is very appealing 0 
great place to eat reminds me of the little mom and pop shops in the san francisco bay area 1 
but then they came back cold 0 
my girlfriends veal was very bad 0 
its kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly its embarrassing how childlike the company is 0 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
it was pretty gross 0 
you could only take 2 videos at a time and the quality was very poor 0 
aside from its terrible lead this film has loads of other debits 0 
horrible dont waste your time and money 0 
duris has a wholesome appearance and gives a fine performance 1 
service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is vegas and located inside the crystals shopping mall by aria 1 
it was also the right balance of war and love 1 
it was an inexpensive piece but i would still have expected better quality 0 
i want my money back 0 
dont buy this product 0 
this hole in the wall has great mexican street tacos and friendly staff 1 
totally different with loads of understatement and black comedy this is a film few get to see but those who do will remember it 1 
our server was very nice and even though he looked a little overwhelmed with all of our needs he stayed professional and friendly until the end 1 
but then they came back cold 0 
their regular toasted bread was equally satisfying with the occasional pats of butter mmmm 1 
im so happy to be here 1 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
the telephone repair man was really funny and his reactions to the nuts and bitchy boss were truly genuine 1 
you cant relate with them hell you barely can understand them 0 
great it was new packaged nice works good no problems and it came in less time then i expected 1 
imdb ratings only go as low 1 for awful its time to get some negative numbers in there for cases such as these 0 
the new characters werent all that memorable and i found myself forgetting who was who 0 
omg i felt like i had never eaten thai food until this dish 1 
it is shameful 0 
in fact i liked it better than interview with a vampire and i liked this lestat stuart townsend better than cruises attempt 1 
there is nothing authentic about this place 0 
classywarm atmosphere fun and fresh appetizers succulent steaks baseball steak 1 
saw the movie today and thought it was a good effort good messages for kids 1 
they have a really nice atmosphere 1 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
its very attractive and appears to be of good quality 1 
also makes it easier to hold on to 1 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
i dont think well be going back anytime soon 0 
i like steiners because its dark and it feels like a bar 1 
my first visit to hiro was a delight 1 
great phone 1 
i guess i should have known that this place would suck because it is inside of the excalibur but i didnt use my common sense 0 
you wont forget this movie 1 
awesome service and food 1 
these were so good we ordered them twice 1 
was not happy 0 
overall a delight 1 
the best phone in market 1 
waited and waited and waited 0 
doesnt work at all i bougth it for my l7c and its not working 0 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
one thing i hate is the mode set button at the side 0 
for a product that costs as much as this one does i expect it to work far better and with greater ease than this thing does 0 
we waited for forty five minutes in vain 0 
full of unconvincing cardboard characters it is blandly written by edward chodorov who also produced and is surprisingly directed by jean negulesco from whom one would expect a great deal more 0 
the bartender was also nice 1 
i was amazed at the quick arrival of the two original lg cell phone batteries and and at a fraction of the price 1 
this greedy corporation will never see another dime from me 0 
this may be the only bad film he ever made 0 
took an hour to get our food only 4 tables in restaurant my food was luke warm our sever was running around like he was totally overwhelmed 0 
these headphones were a great find and i think they are perhaps the best purchase ive made in the last several years seriously 1 
i probably wont be coming back here 0 
its been my choice headset for yearsgreat sound good volume good noise cancellation 1 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
very nice and relaxing late night viewing 1 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
i had a salad with the wings and some ice cream for dessert and left feeling quite satisfied 1 
absolutely great 1 
even allowing for poor production values for the time 1971 and the format some kind of miniseries this is baaaaaad 0 
star trek v the final frontier is the worst in the series 0 
the cable looks so thin and flimsy it is scary 0 
didnt laugh or even smile once 0 
exceptionally bad 0 
we had so much to say about the place before we walked in that he expected it to be amazing but was quickly disappointed 0 
this phone is pretty sturdy and ive never had any large problems with it 1 
great time family dinner on a sunday night 1 
all in all an excellent restaurant highlighted by great service a unique menu and a beautiful setting 1 
with great sound effects and impressive special effects i cant recommend this movie enough 1 
if you love death and decay and shakespears lyrics this is the one 1 
they have horrible attitudes towards customers and talk down to each one when customers dont enjoy their food 0 
the food sucked which we expected but it sucked more than we could have imagined 0 
the service was extremely slow 0 
disappointed with battery 0 
perabo has a nice energy level and is obviously very comfortable in front of a camera 1 
not good for the money 0 
those phones are working just fine now 1 
the food is not tasty at all not to say its real traditional hunan style 0 
we have gotten a lot of compliments on it 1 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
there is no plot here to keep you going in the first place 0 
the two main characters may be two of the most believable children i ever saw put on screen 1 
as for the service i thought it was good 1 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
a happy wonderful feel good ending 1 
i have been in more than a few bars in vegas and do not ever recall being charged for tap water 0 
plug was the wrong size 0 
total waste of time 0 
trying to make a call on these is an exercise in frustration 0 
the price is reasonable and the service is great 1 
not good when wearing a hat or sunglasses 0 
the acting helps the writing along very well maybe the idiotsavant sister could have been played better and it is a real joy to watch 1 
okay i like to consider myself a fair critic so ill give credit where credits duethe creature effects were actually pretty cool 1 
weve have gotten a much better service from the pizza place next door than the services we received from this restaurant 0 
the cashier was friendly and even brought the food out to me 1 
this is a disgrace 0 
nice docking station for home or work 1 
it is easy to turn on and off when you are in the car and the volume controls are quite accessable 1 
i keep watching it over and over 1 
i will not be eating there again 0 
and generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode 0 
dont buy this product 0 
food was really boring 0 
five star plus plus 1 
i was hoping for more 0 
bought mainly for the charger which broke soon after purchasing 0 
tonight i had the elk filet specialand it sucked 0 
magical help 1 
i think this restaurant suffers from not trying hard enough 0 
i never walked out of a movie faster 0 
yeah the movie pretty much sucked 0 
my drink was never empty and he made some really great menu suggestions 1 
the story is also both funny and poignant at times 1 
its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
this is simply the best bluetooth headset for sound quality 1 
come hungry leave happy and stuffed 1 
i took back my money and got outta there 0 
i will continue to come here on ladies night andddd date night highly recommend this place to anyone who is in the area 1 
the only thing i did like was the prime rib and dessert section 1 
this is probably one of the least effective and utterly unoriginal films i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
this is an outstanding little restaurant with some of the best food i have ever tasted 1 
the eargels channel the sound directly into your ear and seem to increase the sound volume and clarity 1 
its one of the movies i need to see whenever it comes on tvnever mind the fact that i already have it memorized 1 
very very disappointed ordered the 35 big bay plater 0 
works fine 1 
its the one movie that never ceases to interest me simply because it keeps me alert as i try to attempt to decipher its meanings 1 
the pan cakes everyone are raving about taste like a sugary disaster tailored to the palate of a six year old 0 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
the chips and salsa were really good the salsa was very fresh 1 
it is not good 0 
the food was great as always compliments to the chef 1 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
dessert panna cotta was amazing 1 
the buffet at bellagio was far from what i anticipated 0 
however bt headsets are currently not good for real time games like firstperson shooters since the audio delay messes me up 0 
funny clever hip just like prays previous film hype 1 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
the results well are a shame 0 
the igo chargers and tips are really great 1 
by the time the film ended i not only disliked it i despised it 0 
i saw mirrormask last night and it was an unsatisfactory experience 0 
this is the first phone ive had that has been so cheaply made 0 
you can find better movies at youtube 0 
not loud enough and doesnt turn on like it should 0 
babie bop is very cute 1 
five star plus plus 1 
utterly without merit on any level this is akin to torture 0 
i liked it 1 
disappointed 0 
works great 1 
this place is not quality sushi it is not a quality restaurant 0 
the sound quality is good and functionality is awesome 1 
best tater tots in the southwest 1 
do not buy do not buyit sucks 0 
if good intentions made a film great then this film might be one of the greatest films ever made 1 
exactly what i wanted 1 
sooooo good 1 
good item low price 1 
the movie is terribly boring in places 0 
we recently witnessed her poor quality of management towards other guests as well 0 
the cashier was friendly and even brought the food out to me 1 
this is some seriously good pizza and im an expertconnisseur on the topic 1 
piece of junk 0 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
much more interesting more action more suspense and less of the unneeded controversy 1 
the football scenes at the end were perplexing 0 
we watched our waiter pay a lot more attention to other tables and ignore us 0 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
the acting was bad the dialogs were extremely shallow and insincere 0 
the battery runs down quickly 0 
defective crap 0 
adapter does not provide enough charging current 0 
as a courtroom drama its compelling as an indictment on the american justice system its frightening 1 
damn good steak 1 
jawbone era is awesome too 1 
fans of the genre will be in heaven 1 
excellent product for the price 1 
it is wonderful and inspiring to watch and i hope that it gets released again on to video or dvd 1 
it works fine on my motorola 325 cellphone and a lot better than the wornout battery did 1 
i own 2 of these cases and would order another 1 
things that went wrong they burned the saganaki 0 
i received my supposedly new motorola 375 and apparently there was not a match between the phone and the charger 0 
the volume for the ringer is real good you have choices how loud 1 
i wish i could enter negative values admins 0 
this pda rocks 1 
there is nothing privileged about workingeating there 0 
the tracfonewebsite is user friendly and makes it easy toactivate etc 1 
was not happy 0 
battery is terrible 0 
the charger worked for about a week and then completely stopped charging my phone 0 
the only suspense i was feeling was the frustration at just how retarded the girls were 0 
mediocre food 0 
good service very clean and inexpensive to boot 1 
awesome service and food 1 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
the characters are fleshed out surprisingly well particularly grimes and blake and all the actors deliver their sharply scripted lines with just the right amount of deadpan tongue in cheek to make the dialogue both hilarious and realistic 1 
this product is clearly not ready for prime time i dont care how cool it looks if you cant tell a call is coming in its worthless 0 
i love this place 1 
there is nothing authentic about this place 0 
dont waste your on this one 0 
also the area where my unit broke im not too fond of the magnetic strap 0 
but the service was beyond bad 0 
i would highly recommend this product 1 
i didnt know pulled pork could be soooo delicious 1 
the nachos are a must have 1 
what is even more stupid is that who had thought an idea that there should be a volcano in los angeles 0 
this is the place where i first had pho and it was amazing 1 
not what i wanted 0 
youd have to have the iq of particularly stupid mollusk not to see that one coming 0 
the pizza tasted old super chewy in not a good way 0 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
i think that it is a must see older john wayne film 1 
will go back next trip out 1 
spend your money and time some place else 0 
it was packed 0 
really good product 1 
the dining space is tiny but elegantly decorated and comfortable 1 
very good phone 1 
cant say enough good things about this place 1 
an hour and a half i wish i could bring back 0 
we loved the place 1 
the dialogue is composed of things that make little sense 0 
our server was super nice and checked on us many times 1 
pretty piece of junk 0 
the speaker is of low quality so as making the ring tones sound very cheap 0 
i can assure you that you wont be disappointed 1 
if you have several dozen or several hundred contacts then imagine the fun of sending each of them one by one 0 
i have had tmobile service for 2 or 3 years now and i am pretty happy with it 1 
the pizza tasted old super chewy in not a good way 0 
worked perfectly 1 
good item low price 1 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
but this movie is not funny considering the ridiculousness of it 0 
this one wants to surf on the small wave of space movies in 1998 deep impact and armageddon and this one fails everywhere 0 
this case seems well made 1 
up there with the best of melville 1 
perfect for the ps3 1 
the inside is really quite nice and very clean 1 
i wont spoil it but the ending in pretty amazing 1 
has been working great 1 
i swung in to give them a try but was deeply disappointed 0 
at around 4 pm i bought it at around 8pm i started to watch at around 815pm i fast forwarded the remaining film to see if there was anything left watchable for a human being with a brain but there wasnt 0 
we ordered some old classics and some new dishes after going there a few times and were sorely disappointed with everything 0 
coming here is like experiencing an underwhelming relationship where both parties cant wait for the other person to ask to break up 0 
that was nice 1 
very disappointing 0 
if you are looking for a good quality motorola headset keep looking this isnt it 0 
it holds a charge for a long time is reasonably comfortable under longwearing conditions and the quality of sound is tremendous 1 
i have seen many movies starring jaclyn smith but my god this was one of her best though it came out 12 years ago 1 
overall i am psyched to have a phone which has all my appointments and contacts in and gets great reception 1 
who in their right mind is gonna buy this battery 0 
the best scene in the movie was when gerardo is trying to find a song that keeps running through his head 1 
this is probably one of the least effective and utterly unoriginal films i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
if she had not rolled the eyes we may have stayed not sure if we will go back and try it again 0 
it also had a new problem 0 
im super pissd 0 
not recommended 0 
its very attractive and appears to be of good quality 1 
the soundtrack wasnt terrible either 1 
very very disappointed ordered the 35 big bay plater 0 
the 12 mega pixel camera being a part of a phone is reasonably good7 1 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
i was deeply impressed with the character he played 1 
bad day or not i have a very low tolerance for rude customer service people it is your job to be nice and polite wash dishes otherwise 0 
i think not again 0 
light weight i hardly notice it is there 1 
after the first charge kept going dead after 12 minutes 0 
this scene is very strong and unpleasant 0 
maybe its just their vegetarian fare but ive been twice and i thought it was average at best 0 
the best part about nurse betty is its unpredictability 1 
great product 1 
your staff spends more time talking to themselves than me 0 
all of the tapas dishes were delicious 1 
its like a really sexy party in your mouth where youre outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party 1 
another note about this phones appearance is that it really looks rather bland especially in the all black model 0 
i hope this place sticks around 1 
i have been in more than a few bars in vegas and do not ever recall being charged for tap water 0 
if there is a wind it is completely useless 0 
definitely worth checking out 1 
however i needed some better instructions 0 
the chains which im no fan of beat this place easily 0 
this scene is very strong and unpleasant 0 
the only place good for this film is in the garbage 0 
very good phone 1 
the death row scenes were entirely unmoving 0 
you get what you pay for i guess 0 
the only place good for this film is in the garbage 0 
lets start with all the problemsthe acting especially from the lead professor was very very bad 0 
good transmit audio 1 
terrible service 0 
hot dishes are not hot cold dishes are close to room tempi watched staff prepare food with bare hands no gloveseverything is deep fried in oil 0 
and there wasnt a single sour note struck actingwise either some surprisingly solid casting here 1 
either way it sucks 0 
horrible had to switch 3 times 0 
not my thing 0 
if you plan to use this in a car forget about it 0 
i want my money back 0 
the pairing of the two devices was so easy it barely took a couple minutes before i started making calls with the voice dialing feature 1 
hes a national treasure 1 
very good though 1 
really awful 0 
but it wasnt until i watched this film that i realised how great he actually was 1 
great value 1 
the dialogue is composed of things that make little sense 0 
i know this is not like the other restaurants at all something is very off here 0 
i really like this product over the motorola because it is allot clearer on the ear piece and the mic 1 
warning stay away 0 
definitely worth checking out 1 
from what my dinner companions told meeverything was very fresh with nice texture and taste 1 
this is truly an art movieit actually has a lot of art in it 1 
i love my 350 headset my jabra350 bluetooth headset is great the reception is very good and the ear piece is a comfortable fit 1 
a pretty good product 1 
go to place for gyros 1 
bt50 battery junk 0 
fits comfortably came with three sizes of earbud tips 1 
they know how to make them here 1 
the instructions didnt explain that a microphone jack could be used 0 
who in their right mind is gonna buy this battery 0 
that was nice 1 
great earpiece 1 
not as good as i had hoped 0 
unfortunately it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees 0 
i heart this place 1 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
food was delicious 1 
i would have given no star if i was able 0 
it will drive you barking mad 0 
please dont waste your money 0 
the movie was very interesting from beginning to the end 1 
the battery works great 1 
worst service to boot but that is the least of their worries 0 
but i thought his acting was skilled 1 
seafood was limited to boiled shrimp and crab legs but the crab legs definitely did not taste fresh 0 
one character is totally annoying with a voice that gives me the feeling of fingernails on a chalkboard 0 
small sleek impressive looking practical setup with ample storage in place 1 
the food is about on par with dennys which is to say not good at all 0 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
you wont regret it 1 
very unreliable service from tmobile 0 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
however the keypads are so tinny that i sometimes reach the wrong buttons 0 
bluetooth range is good a few days ago i left my phone in the trunk got a call and carried the conversation without a hitch 1 
the sets especially designed to work with the camera are amazingstylized beautiful and effective 1 
it was a pale color instead of nice and char and has no flavor 0 
there was no chemistry between ben affleck and sandra bullock in this film and i couldnt understand why he would consider even leaving his wifetobe for this chick that he supposedly was knocked out by 0 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
lange had become a great actress 1 
editing the editing of this film was phenomenal in my opinion 1 
all this movie does is make you sick watching all these slackers make excuses for their stupid actions for 90 minutes 0 
this is a very average phone with bad battery life that operates on a weak network 0 
in the span of an hour i had two people exclaim whoa is that the new phone on tv 1 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
the selection on the menu was great and so were the prices 1 
waited and waited and waited 0 
if you want a real scare rent this one 1 
i will not be eating there again 0 
we got sitting fairly fast but ended up waiting 40 minutes just to place our order another 30 minutes before the food arrived 0 
what i really like there is the crepe station 1 
sound quality on both end is excellent i use headset to call my wife and ask my wife to use headset to call me 2 1 
the only thing i wasnt too crazy about was their guacamole as i dont like it puréed 0 
good prices 1 
i saw this film over christmas and what a great film it was 1 
nobody identifies with these characters because theyre all cardboard cutouts and stereotypes or predictably reversestereotypes 0 
very nice and relaxing late night viewing 1 
give this one a look 1 
however i needed some better instructions 0 
the croutons also taste homemade which is an extra plus 1 
my friend did not like his bloody mary 0 
theres really nothing bad i can say about this headset 0 
i came back today since they relocated and still not impressed 0 
10 out of 10 for both the movie and trilogy 1 
great phone 1 
i love this thing 1 
i got the car charger and not even after a week the charger was brokeni went to plug it in and it started smoking 0 
the headsets are easy to use and everyone loves them 1 
hot dishes are not hot cold dishes are close to room tempi watched staff prepare food with bare hands no gloveseverything is deep fried in oil 0 
it even has its sweet moments 1 
this is the first phone ive had that has been so cheaply made 0 
i enjoyed reading this book to my children when they were little 1 
this is a bad film with bad writing and good actorsan ugly cartoon crafted by paul haggis for people who cant handle anything but the bold strokes in storytellinga picture painted with crayons 0 
great food and great service in a clean and friendly setting 1 
the microphone also works well but according to people i have called it applifies everything 1 
i still maintain that monkeys shouldnt make headphones we just obviously dont share enough dna to copy the design over to humans 0 
then as if i hadnt wasted enough of my life there they poured salt in the wound by drawing out the time it took to bring the check 0 
conclusion very filling meals 1 
we watched our waiter pay a lot more attention to other tables and ignore us 0 
i cant believe theres even a sequel to this 0 
this second appearance of mickey mouse following the silent plane crazy earlier that year is probably his most famous filmmostly because it was so groundbreaking 1 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
soyo technology sucks 0 
useless phone simply deaf 0 
the movie seemed a little slow at first 0 
was not happy 0 
the food was outstanding and the prices were very reasonable 1 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
by far the best cheesecurds we have ever had 1 
just as good as when i had it more than a year ago 1 
i found this move beautiful enjoyable and uplifting 1 
then i watched it again two sundays ago march 20th 2005 and i began to really enjoy it and this time i taped the entire thing 1 
the things that the four kids get themselves into is absolutely hilarious to watch 1 
definitely worth checking out 1 
just dont know why they were so slow 0 
a pretty good product 1 
well im satisfied 1 
it is indescribably the most annoying and idiotic show i have ever seen 0 
i find wasting food to be despicable but this just wasnt food 0 
the story starts too fast with absolutely no suspense or buildup in the slightest 0 
i guess i liked the details of his dysfunctionhe was believable 1 
the atmosphere is modern and hip while maintaining a touch of coziness 1 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
battery has no life 0 
were jerks on the phone 0 
and there wasnt a single sour note struck actingwise either some surprisingly solid casting here 1 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
great place fo take out or eat in 1 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
trouble is the writing and directing make it impossible to establish those things that make a movie watchable like character story theme and so on 0 
i find this inexcusable and so will probably be returning this phone and perhaps changing carriers 0 
an amazing finale to possibly the best trilogy of all time 1 
ill give this film 10 out of 10 1 
this is a bad film with bad writing and good actorsan ugly cartoon crafted by paul haggis for people who cant handle anything but the bold strokes in storytellinga picture painted with crayons 0 
black water is a thriller that manages to completely transcend its limitations its an indie flick by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience 1 
yeah the movie pretty much sucked 0 
nargile i think you are great 1 
generally it just lacked imagination 0 
omg the food was delicioso 1 
their menu is diverse and reasonably priced 1 
this movie has a cutting edge to it 1 
the film has great actors a master director a significant themeat least a wouldbe significant theme undertone of fifties existential worldweariness aerial scenes that ought to have thrilled both senses and imagination and characters about which one might deeply care 1 
you learn a lot about the real inside emotions of people in this movie and a lot about the movie business itself 1 
its not what it says it is 0 
food was good service was good prices were good 1 
but the duet between the astronaut and his doctor at the beginning of the movie is a perfect exchange if one considers that this movie was made well into the cold war and the astronauts biggest fear is that he has crashed in the ussr 1 
it also took her forever to bring us the check when we asked for it 0 
to those who find this movie intelligent or even masterful i can only say its your intelligence and your imagination you obviously used to try and make some sense of this pitiful attempt its in our human nature to try and make sense of things 0 
im terribly disappointed that this film would receive so many awards and accolades especially when there are far more deserving works of film out there 0 
they were excellent 1 
the characters are interesting and you want to find out more about them the longer the movie goes on and i think people will be surprised by who does and doesnt make it 1 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
the movie was very interesting from beginning to the end 1 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
ryans bar is definitely one edinburgh establishment i wont be revisiting 0 
echo problemvery unsatisfactory 0 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
overall i am psyched to have a phone which has all my appointments and contacts in and gets great reception 1 
buttons are too small 0 
adapter does not provide enough charging current 0 
phenomenal food service and ambiance 1 
everything about it is just bad 0 
an amazing finale to possibly the best trilogy of all time 1 
i dont each much pasta but i love the homemade hand made pastas and thin pizzas here 1 
it was so bad i had lost the heart to finish it 0 
his use of the colours of the french flag in the three films was nothing short of incredible every shot every scene was like a work of art 1 
will never ever go back and have told many people what had happened 0 
i would recommend this 1 
my only complaint is the standard sound volume is a little low even when turned up to 5of 5 0 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
better than new 1 
please dont waste your money 0 
but the actingeven that of such professionals as drago and debbie rochonwas terrible the directing worse perhaps contributory to the former the dialog chimplike and the camera work barely tolerable 0 
be sure to order dessert even if you need to pack it togo the tiramisu and cannoli are both to die for 1 
great hands free device 1 
at no point in the proceedings does it look remotely like america 0 
there was so much hype over this phone that i assumed it was the best my mistake 0 
this case seems well made 1 
i love being able to use one headset for both by landline and cell 1 
wont work right or atleast for me 0 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
very disappointed in accessoryone 0 
all in all ha long bay was a bit of a flop 0 
i love their fries and their beans 1 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
excellent product for the price 1 
emily watsons character is very strong and she has only to give a quick glance and you understand everything 1 
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0 
it dit not work most of the time with my nokia 5320 0 
steer clear of this product and go with the genuine palm replacementr pens which come in a threepack 0 
jamie foxx absolutely is ray charles 1 
a fly was in my apple juice a fly 0 
i wouldnt return 0 
i bought this to use with my kindle fire and absolutely loved it 1 
it was a riot to see hugo weaving play a sexobsessed gay real estate salesman who uses his clients houses for his trysts with the flaming darren tom hollander 1 
babie bop is very cute 1 
could not get strong enough signal 0 
things that went wrong they burned the saganaki 0 
the point is the journey a journey that touches every member of the family 1 
if you stay in vegas you must get breakfast here at least once 1 
my gyro was basically lettuce only 0 
it didnt make me scared horrified or make me sympathetic towards the characters it was simply annoying 0 
not much flavor to them and very poorly constructed 0 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
there arent death scenes like in previous movies and the fx are terrible 0 
i guess i liked the details of his dysfunctionhe was believable 1 
the plot simply rumbles on like a machine desperately depending on the addition of new scenes 0 
but she is still a bad actress repeating her robotic face moves in each of her pictures 0 
it holds a charge for a long time is reasonably comfortable under longwearing conditions and the quality of sound is tremendous 1 
warning stay away 0 
it worked very well 1 
never going back 0 
i love this cable it allows me to connect any miniusb device to my pc 1 
dont waste your money 0 
it feels poorly constructed the menus are difficult to navigate and the buttons are so recessed that it is difficult to push them 0 
the only place good for this film is in the garbage 0 
at any rate this film stinks its not funny and fulci should have stayed with giallo and supernatural zombie movies 0 
i know this is not like the other restaurants at all something is very off here 0 
we sat another ten minutes and finally gave up and left 0 
each day of the week they have a different deal and its all so delicious 1 
he cant act one of the least scary villains i have ever seen he cant write did he write this damn movie in his sleep 0 
the company shipped my product very promptly and it works well 1 
any grandmother can make a roasted chicken better than this one 0 
it also took her forever to bring us the check when we asked for it 0 
i just saw this film and i recommend it 1 
if only someone involved with it knew how to string together narrative 0 
tom wilkinson broke my heart at the end and everyone elses judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike 1 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
i am pairing this with my iphone and i could not be happier with it so far 1 
yet plantronincs continues to use the same flawed charger design 0 
the dining space is tiny but elegantly decorated and comfortable 1 
its a little geeky but i think thats its sex on toast and it rocks and oozes sex right down to its battery embedded sleek stylish leather case 1 
aside from its terrible lead this film has loads of other debits 0 
highly recommend for any one who has a blue tooth phone 1 
horrible 0 
and service was super friendly 1 
there was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters 0 
he came running after us when he realized my husband had left his sunglasses on the table 1 
a good film by a great director 1 
i guess maybe we went on an off night but it was disgraceful 0 
the management is rude 0 
good transmit audio 1 
food quality has been horrible 0 
the sweet potato tots were good but the onion rings were perfection or as close as i have had 1 
it is perfect for a sitdown family meal or get together with a few friends 1 
the attention given to every character and complex psychological portrayals detailing loyalty treachery love and hope are tremendous 1 
the bathroom is just next door and very nice 1 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
spend your money and time some place else 0 
you also cannot take pictures with it in the case because the lense is covered 0 
the loudspeaker option is great the bumpers with the lights is very appealing 0 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
these are fabulous 1 
very true to shakespear and a must for all shakespear fans 1 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
this is actually a very smart movie 1 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
yet plantronincs continues to use the same flawed charger design 0 
2 times very bad customer service 0 
this place is way too overpriced for mediocre food 0 
i ordered albondigas soup which was just warm and tasted like tomato soup with frozen meatballs 0 
anyways the food was definitely not filling at all and for the price you pay you should expect more 0 
of course the footage from the 70s was grainy but that only enhanced the film 1 
their monster chicken fried steak and eggs is my all time favorite 1 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
weve tried to like this place but after 10 times i think were done with them 0 
as for the mains also uninspired 0 
terrible phone holder 0 
this is my new fav vegas buffet spot 1 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
not loud enough and doesnt turn on like it should 0 
the ambiance isnt much better 0 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
too bad you have to pay up to a month for the service 0 
as many people complained i found this headsets microphone was very weak 0 
worst ever 0 
and there wasnt a single sour note struck actingwise either some surprisingly solid casting here 1 
i ended up sliding it on the edge of my pants or back pockets instead 1 
i like design and look of jabra behing the ear headsets and 5020 is pretty comfortible to wear 24 hours a day without pain in the ear 1 
be sure to order dessert even if you need to pack it togo the tiramisu and cannoli are both to die for 1 
we arent ones to make a scene at restaurants but i just dont get itdefinitely lost the love after this one 0 
the incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film 1 
maybe if they werent cold they would have been somewhat edible 0 
unfortunately inexperience of direction meant that scene after scene passed with little in the way of dramatic tension or conflict 0 
great food and great service in a clean and friendly setting 1 
happy so far 1 
overall i am psyched to have a phone which has all my appointments and contacts in and gets great reception 1 
makes it easier to keep up with my bluetooth when im not wearing it 0 
what happened next was prettyoff putting 0 
it was so bad i had lost the heart to finish it 0 
its a little geeky but i think thats its sex on toast and it rocks and oozes sex right down to its battery embedded sleek stylish leather case 1 
the phone gets extremely hot 0 
i bought this battery with a coupon from amazon and im very happy with my purchase 1 
i was shocked because no signs indicate cash only 0 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
the owners are super friendly and the staff is courteous 1 
i love the look and feel of samsung flipphones 1 
weve have gotten a much better service from the pizza place next door than the services we received from this restaurant 0 
no actress has been worse used that june allison in this movie 0 
overall the film is interesting and thoughtprovoking 1 
the pancake was also really good and pretty large at that 1 
this is one of the better buffets that i have been to 1 
also the area where my unit broke im not too fond of the magnetic strap 0 
you truly take this journey through the eyes and soul of a child 1 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
they do not care about the consumer one bit 0 
the selection of food was not the best 0 
not recommended 0 
during several different 2 minute calls i experienced 5 drops and it was in an area that had 5 bars 0 
the han nan chicken was also very tasty 1 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
the service was terrible though 0 
linksys should have some way to exchange a bad phone for a refurb unit or something 0 
weve tried to like this place but after 10 times i think were done with them 0 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
i would recommend purchasing the jabra jx10 series 2 which works flawlessly with my moto q go figure 1 
the acting was bad the dialogs were extremely shallow and insincere 0 
we waited for forty five minutes in vain 0 
i highly recommend these and encourage people to give them a try 1 
the service was a little slow considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace 0 
lasted one day and then blew up 0 
however my girl was complain that some time the phone doesnt wake up like normal phone does 0 
i could eat their bruschetta all day it is devine 1 
case was more or less an extra that i originally put on but later discarded because it scratched my ear 0 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
i would give this television series a 10 plus if i could 1 
bad day or not i have a very low tolerance for rude customer service people it is your job to be nice and polite wash dishes otherwise 0 
what should have been a hilarious yummy christmas eve dinner to remember was the biggest fail of the entire trip for us 0 
overall i was not impressed and would not go back 0 
lots of holes in the script 0 
the headset fulfills my requirements so i am happy with my purchase 1 
its really easy 1 
it was attached to a gas station and that is rarely a good sign 0 
the building itself seems pretty neat the bathroom is pretty trippy but i wouldnt eat here again 0 
the delivery was on time 1 
then scene where they debated whether or not to sack the trumpeter who falsely was accused for the murder is pure horror really stupid 0 
i would recommend purchasing the jabra jx10 series 2 which works flawlessly with my moto q go figure 1 
this item is great installed it let it charged up overnite and it has been working good every since with no problems 1 
hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in 0 
i received my orders well within the shipping timeframe everything was in good working order and overall i am very excited to have this source 1 
they have a really nice atmosphere 1 
nice quality build unlike some cheap s out there 1 
worthwhile 1 
this movie is a good and humorous comment on life in 2006 1 
totally different with loads of understatement and black comedy this is a film few get to see but those who do will remember it 1 
the volume for the ringer is real good you have choices how loud 1 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
the only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive 1 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
friends pasta also bad he barely touched it 0 
it wasnt busy at all and now we know why 0 
not much seafood and like 5 strings of pasta at the bottom 0 
she carries the movie well 1 
after my phone got to be about a year old its been slowly breaking despite much care on my part 0 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
camerawork again bad 0 
very disappointed in accessoryone 0 
from what my dinner companions told meeverything was very fresh with nice texture and taste 1 
easy to use 1 
i give it 2 thumbs down 0 
the poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying 0 
the worst experience ever 0 
the instructions didnt explain that a microphone jack could be used 0 
lucy bell is so much higher than this crap and for her to sink this low is quite depressing 0 
i was shocked because no signs indicate cash only 0 
its just painful 0 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
the pairing of the two devices was so easy it barely took a couple minutes before i started making calls with the voice dialing feature 1 
never been to hard rock casino before will never ever step forward in it again 0 
i could eat their bruschetta all day it is devine 1 
the result is a powerhouse achievement made more timely now perhaps because of our cultures disturbing fascination with celebrity and its distorted interpretations of fame 1 
i enjoyed reading this book to my children when they were little 1 
this item is great installed it let it charged up overnite and it has been working good every since with no problems 1 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
well packaged arrived on time and works as intended 1 
there was no chemistry between ben affleck and sandra bullock in this film and i couldnt understand why he would consider even leaving his wifetobe for this chick that he supposedly was knocked out by 0 
does not fit 0 
great product and price 1 
i also decided not to send it back because our waitress looked like she was on the verge of having a heart attack 0 
for a product that costs as much as this one does i expect it to work far better and with greater ease than this thing does 0 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
i loved it 1 
but the service was beyond bad 0 
simply beautiful 1 
full of unconvincing cardboard characters it is blandly written by edward chodorov who also produced and is surprisingly directed by jean negulesco from whom one would expect a great deal more 0 
good value great food great service 1 
the warmth it generates is in contrast to its austere backdrop 1 
buyer beware you could flush money right down the toilet 0 
i also decided not to send it back because our waitress looked like she was on the verge of having a heart attack 0 
four stars for the food the guy in the blue shirt for his great vibe still letting us in to eat 1 
if you are looking for a good quality motorola headset keep looking this isnt it 0 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
service is quick and even to go orders are just like we like it 1 
the ambience is wonderful and there is music playing 1 
check it out 1 
trumbull on i love lucy 1 
the nokia ca42 usb cable did not work with my phone 0 
on three different occasions i asked for well done or medium well and all three times i got the bloodiest piece of meat on my plate 0 
this product is great it makes working a lot easier i can go to the copier while waiting on hold for something 1 
verizon tech support walked my through a few procedures none of which worked and i ended up having to do a hard reset wiping out all my data 0 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
there is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again 0 
poor sound quality 0 
i purchased this and within 2 days it was no longer working 0 
when i placed my treo into the case not only was it not snug but there was a lot of extra room on the sides 0 
try them in the airport to experience some tasty food and speedy friendly service 1 
just dont know why they were so slow 0 
i love their fries and their beans 1 
definitely worth seeing its the sort of thought provoking film that forces you to question your own threshold of loneliness 1 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
horrible horrible protector 0 
the servers went back and forth several times not even so much as an are you being helped 0 
but it wasnt until i watched this film that i realised how great he actually was 1 
to call this movie a drama is ridiculous 0 
shrimp when i unwrapped it i live only 12 a mile from brushfire it was literally ice cold 0 
this is truly an art movieit actually has a lot of art in it 1 
what on earth is irons doing in this film 0 
the manager was the worst 0 
i searched the internet and found this one to be the best value 1 
beautiful styling though 1 
the meat was pretty dry i had the sliced brisket and pulled pork 0 
do not purchase this phone 0 
despite the pans of reviewers i liked this movie 1 
very very fun chef 1 
the igo chargers and tips are really great 1 
both actors truly understand and become their particular character delivering a convincing sincere performance 1 
if you check the directors filmography on this site you will see why this film didnt have a chance 0 
i have read others reviews here but i havent had any problem with it 1 
a fantastic neighborhood gem 1 
it was quite comfortable in the ear 1 
good food good service 1 
i have bought this nokia cell phone a few weeks ago and it was a nightmare 0 
im super pissd 0 
ill give this film 10 out of 10 1 
im pleased 1 
my only problem is i thought the actor playing the villain was a low rent michael ironside 0 
i was very disappointed in the movie 0 
mobile phone tools are a must have 1 
plus it was wellpaced and suited its relatively short run time 1 
i get absolutely horrible reception in my apartment where with other phones i have not had this problem 0 
im big fan of rpg games too but this movie its a disgrace to any selfrespecting rpger there is 0 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
at first glance it is a lovely bakery cafe nice ambiance clean friendly staff 1 
this is a beautiful phone 1 
good product good seller 1 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
i dont have very many words to say about this place but it does everything pretty well 1 
this place has it 1 
i get absolutely horrible reception in my apartment where with other phones i have not had this problem 0 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
some great music and terrific scenery 1 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
horrible had to switch 3 times 0 
it was probably dirt 0 
not even good for camp value 0 
the roast beef sandwich tasted really good 1 
the screen size is big key pad lit well enough and the camera quality is excellent for a camera phone 1 
the headset fulfills my requirements so i am happy with my purchase 1 
by far the best cheesecurds we have ever had 1 
the acting is like watching wooden puppets moving around and reading from a book thats how bad it is 0 
the acting is beyond abysmal 0 
ps the only scene in the movie that was cool is when the central character finds her room blown up 1 
i have had tmobile service for 2 or 3 years now and i am pretty happy with it 1 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
my husband and i ate lunch here and were very disappointed with the food and service 0 
i great reception all the time 1 
worst ever 0 
as many people complained i found this headsets microphone was very weak 0 
trying to make a call on these is an exercise in frustration 0 
disappointment i hate anything that goes in my ear 0 
the movie is terribly boring in places 0 
this is a beautiful phone 1 
this hole in the wall has great mexican street tacos and friendly staff 1 
if you plan to use this in a car forget about it 0 
conclusion i loved it 1 
i tried talking real loud but shouting on the telephone gets old and i was still told it wasnt great 0 
i would recommend purchasing the jabra jx10 series 2 which works flawlessly with my moto q go figure 1 
product is useless since it does not have enough charging current to charge the 2 cellphones i was planning to use it with 0 
this is probably the most irritating show i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
they have a really nice atmosphere 1 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
fast service 1 
but i dont like it 0 
the burger i got the gold standard a 17 burger and was kind of disappointed 0 
barney is definitely super de duper 1 
things that went wrong they burned the saganaki 0 
good works fine 1 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
schrader has made a resume full of lousy amateurish films 0 
i would definitely recommend the jabra bt250v for those who are looking for comfort clarity and a great price 1 
it never condescends all the characters have good genuine hearts and believable problems 1 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
the food is not tasty at all not to say its real traditional hunan style 0 
what makes this story different are the terrific production values faultless photography composition and editing the terrific casting the underappreciated brian keith playing a bully teddy and vivid history 1 
worked great 1 
happy so far 1 
mishima is extremely uninteresting 0 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
the charger worked for about a week and then completely stopped charging my phone 0 
i also decided not to send it back because our waitress looked like she was on the verge of having a heart attack 0 
this is my new fav vegas buffet spot 1 
we had a group of 70 when we claimed we would only have 40 and they handled us beautifully 1 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
spend your money and time some place else 0 
this film offers many delights and surprises 1 
steamboat willie is an amazingly important film to our cinema history 1 
my order was not correct 0 
a good film by a great director 1 
performed awful muffled tinny incoming sound and severe echo for those on the other end of the call 0 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
dont waste your money 0 
dont do it 0 
sucked most of the stuff does not work with my phone 0 
its one of the movies i need to see whenever it comes on tvnever mind the fact that i already have it memorized 1 
timely shipment and quality product 1 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
there was hardly any meat 0 
at a time when it seems that film animation has been dominated by disneypixars cgi masterpieces it is both refreshing and comforting to know that miyazaki is still relying on traditional handdrawn animation to tell his charming and enchanting stories 1 
a happy wonderful feel good ending 1 
my gyro was basically lettuce only 0 
i will continue to come here on ladies night andddd date night highly recommend this place to anyone who is in the area 1 
cumbersome design 0 
my sanyo has survived dozens of drops on blacktop without ill effect 1 
but it wasnt until i watched this film that i realised how great he actually was 1 
if there were zero stars i would give it zero stars 0 
this if the first movie ive given a 10 to in years 1 
just whatever you do avoid groove as its the antithesis of all that is good about human traffic 0 
worked perfectly 1 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
it will drive you barking mad 0 
but when someone strives for greatness and poetry but delivers a muddled and often ridiculous story a bunch of disparate scenes pretentious dialogue then you get the worst kind of a movie that some other reviewer very accurately defined as pretentious crap 0 
best ive found so far ive tried 2 other bluetooths and this one has the best quality for both me and the listener as well as ease of using 1 
very disappointing 0 
fantastic service here 1 
its very slow 0 
i came back today since they relocated and still not impressed 0 
people who like european films and art movies will like this movie 1 
there arent death scenes like in previous movies and the fx are terrible 0 
good product incredible value 1 
i wasnt expecting oscar material but this 0 
my salad had a bland vinegrette on the baby greens and hearts of palm 0 
plug was the wrong size 0 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
then theres the plot holes 0 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
loved itfriendly servers great food wonderful and imaginative menu 1 
the movie had you on the edge of your seat and made you somewhat afraid to go to your car at the end of the night 1 
steer clear of this product and go with the genuine palm replacementr pens which come in a threepack 0 
the dialogue sucked 0 
first off the reception sucks i have never had more than 2 bars ever 0 
it was a riot to see hugo weaving play a sexobsessed gay real estate salesman who uses his clients houses for his trysts with the flaming darren tom hollander 1 
not impressed 0 
service was fantastic 1 
really really good rice all the time 1 
i recently tried caballeros and i have been back every week since 1 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
an instant classic with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits 1 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
food quality has been horrible 0 
much better than the other ayce sushi place i went to in vegas 1 
everything was fresh and delicious 1 
last night was my second time dining here and i was so happy i decided to go back 1 
it didnt charge for me 0 
service was very prompt 1 
i wasted my little money with this earpiece 0 
the story starts too fast with absolutely no suspense or buildup in the slightest 0 
plug was the wrong size 0 
the food was terrible 0 
great audio 1 
they made this case too small and is very difficult to install 0 
i keep watching it over and over 1 
every thing on phone work perfectly she like it 1 
total letdown i would much rather just go to the camelback flower shop and cartel coffee 0 
this is simply the best bluetooth headset for sound quality 1 
avoid at all costs 0 
my phone doesnt slide around my car now and the grip prevents my phone from slipping out of my hand 1 
excellent sound battery life and inconspicuous to boot 1 
dont waste your time 0 
youll love how thin it is 1 
jawbone era is awesome too 1 
it never condescends all the characters have good genuine hearts and believable problems 1 
top line dont waste your time and money on this one its as bad as it comes 0 
the voice recognition thru the handset is excellent 1 
watching washing machine twirling around wouldnt hurt your eyes as much as this show 0 
i recommend this for everyone who loves film movies anythinga work of art 1 
looks great and is strong 1 
great brunch spot 1 
the grilled chicken was so tender and yellow from the saffron seasoning 1 
another thing i didnt really like is when a character got punched in the face a gallon of blood would spew forth soon after 0 
the only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port irda 0 
this is so embarassing and also my ears hurt if i try to push the ear plug into my ear 0 
the loudspeaker option is great the bumpers with the lights is very appealing 0 
weve have gotten a much better service from the pizza place next door than the services we received from this restaurant 0 
the cast was great 1 
what this film lacks is a convincing script 0 
will never ever go back 0 
all the characters in this film are tremendously well played 1 
the music in the film is really nice too 1 
i heart this place 1 
the attempts at humor were pitiful and story is so awful it dosent bear thinking about which basically involves a vulcan stealing the enterprise to find god seriously i just didnt care about any of this film and oh not to mention uhura does a belly dance to distract male guards 0 
great for the jawbone 1 
stay away from the q 0 
best headset ever 1 
first the bathrooms at this location were dirty seat covers were not replenished just plain yucky 0 
bacon is hella salty 1 
i cant wait to go back 1 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
i have had problems wit hit dropping signal and more 0 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
the casting is also horrible cause all you see is a really really bad actors period 0 
but whatever it was that cost them so much it didnt translate to quality thats for sure 0 
this is such a fun and funny movie 1 
but what really made it unwatchable was the direction 0 
this movie was kind of long in length but i enjoyed every minute of it 1 
comfortable fit you need your headset to be comfortable for at least an hour at a time if not for an entire day 1 
i had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get some relief 0 
it feels poorly constructed the menus are difficult to navigate and the buttons are so recessed that it is difficult to push them 0 
the results well are a shame 0 
very tough and very short on flavor 0 
the potato chip order was sad i could probably count how many chips were in that box and it was probably around 12 0 
it only recognizes the phone as its storage device 0 
painful on the ear 0 
the service was great even the manager came and helped with our table 1 
my friend did not like his bloody mary 0 
the potatoes were like rubber and you could tell they had been made up ahead of time being kept under a warmer 0 
all in all im quite satisfied with this purchase 1 
its not what it says it is 0 
they are so easy to love but even more easy to identify with 1 
dont do it 0 
this was my first time and i cant wait until the next 1 
the acting was bad 0 
dont waste your money 0 
10 out of 10 for both the movie and trilogy 1 
how can you call yourself a steakhouse if you cant properly cook a steak i dont understand 0 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
the waiter wasnt helpful or friendly and rarely checked on us 0 
he deserves 5 stars 1 
great product 1 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
paolo sorrentino has written a wonderful story about loneliness and tony has built one of the most unforgettable characters seen in movies in recent years 1 
some great music and terrific scenery 1 
this is a beautiful phone 1 
its one of the movies i need to see whenever it comes on tvnever mind the fact that i already have it memorized 1 
artless camerawork endlessly presents us with the ugliest setting imaginable ie 0 
oh the charger seems to work fine 1 
he came running after us when he realized my husband had left his sunglasses on the table 1 
also its slim enough to fit into my alarm clock docking station without removing the case 1 
there was so much hype over this phone that i assumed it was the best my mistake 0 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
there was a warm feeling with the service and i felt like their guest for a special treat 1 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
for the price on amazon it is an excellent product which i would highly recommend 1 
i want my money back 0 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
excellent service 1 
the battery is unreliable as well as the service use antena 0 
im not really sure how joeys was voted best hot dog in the valley by readers of phoenix magazine 0 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
we ordered some old classics and some new dishes after going there a few times and were sorely disappointed with everything 0 
the acting is fantastic the stories are seamlessly woven together and the dogs are splendid a must rent view or see 1 
if you do go see this movie bring a pillow or a girlfriendboyfriend to keep you occupied through out 0 
it felt too light and tinny 0 
none of them are engaging or exciting 0 
its a long time since i was so entertained by a movie 1 
this phone might well be the worst ive ever had in any brand 0 
judith light is one of my favorite actresses and i think she does a superb job in this film 1 
it is super charged up for use as a small hybrid palmtopcameracellphone and excels in those roles 1 
phenomenal food service and ambiance 1 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
if i take a picture the battery drops a bar and starts beeping letting me know its dieing 0 
i kept catching the cable on the seat and i had to pull the phone out to turn it on an off 0 
food was average at best 0 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
the hockey scenes are terrible defensemen playing like theyre 5 years old goalies diving at shots that are 10 feet wide of the net etc 0 
very satisifed with that 1 
join the club and get awesome offers via email 1 
i want my money back 0 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
you never know if you pushed it hard enough or the right number of times for the function you want or not 0 
favorite place in town for shawarrrrrrma 1 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
the poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying 0 
definitely worth checking out 1 
i guess that nobody at the network that aired this dribble watched it before putting it on 0 
i used bitpim a free program you can find on the internetto transfer data to the phonethe price of the cable was excellent 1 
in fact im going to round up to 4 stars just because she was so awesome 1 
cute quaint simple honest 1 
doesnt work at all i bougth it for my l7c and its not working 0 
the concert sequences just sucked 0 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
doesnt work 0 
often the dialogue doesnt really follow from one line to another or fit the surroundings 0 
the cast is always entertaining as usual 1 
really ugly 0 
clear skype calls long battery life long range 1 
the nokia ca42 usb cable did not work with my phone 0 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
but the movie makes a lot of serious mistakes 0 
then our food came out disappointment ensued 0 
this is a witty and delightful adaptation of the dr seuss book brilliantly animated by upas finest and thoroughly deserving of its academy award 1 
everything about it is just bad 0 
the only thing i wasnt too crazy about was their guacamole as i dont like it puréed 0 
the casting is also horrible cause all you see is a really really bad actors period 0 
even in my bmw 3 series which is fairly quiet i have trouble hearing what the other person is saying 0 
perhaps my phone is defective but people cannot hear me when i use this 0 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
a very very very slowmoving aimless movie about a distressed drifting young man 0 
what a waste of time 0 
personally i think it shows that people should learn to find a compromise them self without involving other people into issue 1 
worst customer service 0 
disapointing results 0 
definitely worth checking out 1 
this place is overpriced not consistent with their boba and it really is overpriced 0 
in fact this stinker smells like a directtovideo release 0 
so far so good 1 
this movie was kind of long in length but i enjoyed every minute of it 1 
makes it easier to keep up with my bluetooth when im not wearing it 0 
and generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode 0 
the scenes are often funny and occasionally touching as the characters evaluate their lives and where they are going 1 
not enough volume 0 
just dont know why they were so slow 0 
also were served hot bread and butter and home made potato chips with bacon bits on topvery original and very good 1 
i think the most wonderful parts literally full of wonder are the excerpts from his works 1 
i have been very happy with the 510 and have had no complaints from any one regarding my sound quality on their end 1 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
for that price i can think of a few place i would have much rather gone 0 
in an interesting part of town this place is amazing 1 
after i pulled up my car i waited for another 15 minutes before being acknowledged 0 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
the sets especially designed to work with the camera are amazingstylized beautiful and effective 1 
a pretty good product 1 
is it possible for a movie to get any worse than this 0 
it has all the features i want 1 
bad fit way too big 0 
nice docking station for home or work 1 
none of it works just dont buy it 0 
very well made and fits my surefire gx2 perfectly 1 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
this short film certainly pulls no punches 0 
you truly take this journey through the eyes and soul of a child 1 
everything about this product is wrongfirst 0 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
i paid too much 0 
what i really like there is the crepe station 1 
coming here is like experiencing an underwhelming relationship where both parties cant wait for the other person to ask to break up 0 
everything from acting to cinematography was solid 1 
what i really like there is the crepe station 1 
it was a great phone 1 
but the premise of the film was so ridiculous that the president of the us 0 
the atmosphere is modern and hip while maintaining a touch of coziness 1 
see both films if you can 1 
reception is terrible and full of static 0 
okay i like to consider myself a fair critic so ill give credit where credits duethe creature effects were actually pretty cool 1 
this is one of the worst sandra bullock movie since speed 2 but not quite that bad 0 
the movie lacks visual interest drama expression of feeling and celebration of the very patriotism that underlines the narrative 0 
a film not easily forgotten 1 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
i checked out this place a couple years ago and was not impressed 0 
highly recommended 1 
if you stay in vegas you must get breakfast here at least once 1 
that one didnt work either 0 
because both ears are occupied background is not distracting at all 1 
good service very clean and inexpensive to boot 1 
im not sure what he was trying to do with this film 0 
internet is excrutiatingly slow 0 
this place is overpriced not consistent with their boba and it really is overpriced 0 
it had some average acting from the main person and it was a low budget as you clearly can see 0 
the nokia ca42 usb cable did not work with my phone 0 
i go to far too many places and ive never seen any restaurant that serves a 1 egg breakfast especially for 400 0 
eew this location needs a complete overhaul 0 
ive missed numerous calls because of this reason 0 
this is a great product sure beats using your fingers 1 
worst foodservice ive had in a while 0 
its like a bad two hour tv movie 0 
soggy and not good 0 
none of them are engaging or exciting 0 
these headphones were a great find and i think they are perhaps the best purchase ive made in the last several years seriously 1 
do not waste your time 0 
great food and service huge portions and they give a military discount 1 
very happy with this product 1 
in my house i was getting dropped coverage upstairs and no coverage in my basement 0 
it was equally awful 0 
another thing i didnt really like is when a character got punched in the face a gallon of blood would spew forth soon after 0 
your servers suck wait correction our server heimer sucked 0 
the casting is also horrible cause all you see is a really really bad actors period 0 
delete this film from your mind 0 
not a weekly haunt but definitely a place to come back to every once in a while 1 
this movie is bad 0 
for readers who have already seen one of miyazakis films he is still in top form and made another worthwhile experience 1 
not much seafood and like 5 strings of pasta at the bottom 0 
the real killer is the volume and of course it breaking 0 
but i thought his acting was skilled 1 
we literally sat there for 20 minutes with no one asking to take our order 0 
the attention given to every character and complex psychological portrayals detailing loyalty treachery love and hope are tremendous 1 
i dont think you will be disappointed 1 
the service was terrible food was mediocre 0 
one of my favorite purchases ever 1 
both great 1 
on the good side the staff was genuinely pleasant and enthusiastic a real treat 1 
the movie lacks visual interest drama expression of feeling and celebration of the very patriotism that underlines the narrative 0 
the food was great as always compliments to the chef 1 
attempting artiness with black white and clever camera angles the movie disappointed became even more ridiculous as the acting was poor and the plot and lines almost nonexistent 0 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
the croutons also taste homemade which is an extra plus 1 
the noise shield is incrediable 1 
at first i thought i was grtting a good deal at 744 until i plugged it into my phone v3c razr 0 
this is a simple little phone to use but the breakage is unacceptible 0 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
not a good item it worked for a while then started having problems in my auto reverse tape player 0 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
that just screams legit in my booksomethats also pretty rare here in vegas 1 
probably never coming back and wouldnt recommend it 0 
the death row scenes were entirely unmoving 0 
a good quality bargain i bought this after i bought a cheapy from big lots that sounded awful and people on the other end couldnt hear me 1 
i saw this short film on hbo the other day and absolutely loved it 1 
it doesnt make you look cool 0 
all in all a great disappointment 0 
the movie has almost no action scenes in it and very little comedy 0 
weve tried to like this place but after 10 times i think were done with them 0 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
friends pasta also bad he barely touched it 0 
an amazing finale to possibly the best trilogy of all time 1 
hayao miyazakis latest and eighth film for studio ghibili gake no ue no ponyo ponyo on the cliff by the sea is a wonderfully fun and imaginative look at childhood 1 
i own a jabra earset and was very happy with it but the sound quality especially outgoing on this is better 1 
its too bad that everyone else involved didnt share crowes level of dedication to quality for if they did wed have a far better film on our hands than this subpar mess 0 
this pair of headphones is the worst that i have ever had soundwise 0 
hence the whole story lacks a certain energy 0 
a drive thru means you do not want to wait around for half an hour for your food but somehow when we end up going here they make us wait and wait 0 
great audio 1 
this place was such a nice surprise 1 
why are these sad little vegetables so overcooked 0 
really awful 0 
its like a bad two hour tv movie 0 
with great sound effects and impressive special effects i cant recommend this movie enough 1 
i like design and look of jabra behing the ear headsets and 5020 is pretty comfortible to wear 24 hours a day without pain in the ear 1 
overall a great experience 1 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
still its quite interesting and entertaining to follow 1 
all in all i can assure you ill be back 1 
generous portions and great taste 1 
i love the look and feel of samsung flipphones 1 
so just beware 0 
doesnt hold charge 0 
all in all i can assure you ill be back 1 
both great 1 
really really good rice all the time 1 
this was a different cut than the piece the other day but still wonderful and tender s well as well flavored 1 
it is just the sort of pap that is screened in the afternoon to punish the unemployed for not having jobs 0 
i have only had it for a few weeks but so far so good 1 
i left with a stomach ache and felt sick the rest of the day 0 
i would recommend this 1 
also the area where my unit broke im not too fond of the magnetic strap 0 
battery is holding up well 1 
great food 1 
ive never been treated so bad 0 
the last 15 minutes of movie are also not bad as well 1 
also its slim enough to fit into my alarm clock docking station without removing the case 1 
didnt laugh or even smile once 0 
service sucks 0 
the nano stated itmy son was dissapointed 0 
this is one of peter watkins most accessible films 1 
it only recognizes the phone as its storage device 0 
ambience is perfect 1 
the fact is this film is a wonderful heartwarming tale about two people chasing their dreams 1 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
we literally sat there for 20 minutes with no one asking to take our order 0 
id love to go back 1 
this movie does an excellent job of revealing the complexity of the task and the incredible challenges facing south africa 1 
this would not even be good as a made for tv flick 0 
i tried the cape cod ravoli chickenwith cranberrymmmm 1 
add betty white and jean smart and you have a great cast everyone played their parts really well 1 
waste your money on this game 1 
good works fine 1 
he really didnt seem to want to be hosting his voiceovers were monotonous didnt get involved with the guests 0 
omg the food was delicioso 1 
i am a fan of his this movie sucked really bad 0 
simple lightweight and great fit 1 
the best place in vegas for breakfast just check out a sat or sun 1 
perabo has a nice energy level and is obviously very comfortable in front of a camera 1 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
have been going since 2007 and every meal has been awesome 1 
the servers went back and forth several times not even so much as an are you being helped 0 
weve have gotten a much better service from the pizza place next door than the services we received from this restaurant 0 
the service was not up to par either 0 
thats how id describe this painfully dreary timewaster of a film 0 
last time buying from you 0 
in particular the relationship between the bakery assistant and the waitress just didnt work for me at all 0 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
i checked everywhere and there is no feature for it which is really disappointing 0 
the plot simply rumbles on like a machine desperately depending on the addition of new scenes 0 
dont waste your money 0 
works great 1 
battery life is also great 1 
i loved it 1 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
her role was played well 1 
our server was super nice and checked on us many times 1 
the worst one of the series 0 
the memories are murky but i can only say that i enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show 1 
the restaurant is very clean and has a family restaurant feel to it 1 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
the keyboard is a nice compromise between a full qwerty and the basic cell phone number keypad 1 
pretty good beer selection too 1 
in my house i was getting dropped coverage upstairs and no coverage in my basement 0 
the casting is also horrible cause all you see is a really really bad actors period 0 
see both films if you can 1 
it was so bad i had lost the heart to finish it 0 
the chips and salsa were really good the salsa was very fresh 1 
then the film just dropped the ball 0 
this is probably the most irritating show i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
i give it 2 thumbs down 0 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
very disappointed 0 
im happy about this purchase good quality and low price 1 
very bad experience 0 
go watch it 1 
cool phone 1 
the chips and salsa were really good the salsa was very fresh 1 
poor voice clarity 0 
the food was terrible 0 
the script is was there a script 0 
i cant wait to go back 1 
the design is very odd as the ear clip is not very comfortable at all 0 
good value works fine power via usb car or wall outlet 1 
gets a signal when other verizon phones wont 1 
took an hour to get our food only 4 tables in restaurant my food was luke warm our sever was running around like he was totally overwhelmed 0 
the acting sucks the music sucks the script sucks the pacing sucks the special fx suck the directing sucks basically this movie sucks 0 
they know how to make them here 1 
however the ear pads come off easily and after only one week i lost one 0 
ps the only scene in the movie that was cool is when the central character finds her room blown up 1 
he was very impressed when going from the original battery to the extended battery 1 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
i contacted the company and they told me that although the unit was still under warranty if i couldnt produce my receipt i was out of luck 0 
the story is lame not interesting and never really explains the sinister origins of the puppets 0 
regardless the film fails on most levels 0 
if only someone involved with it knew how to string together narrative 0 
improper description i had to return it 0 
battery is holding up well 1 
highly recommended 1 
best headset ever 1 
i was not impressed by this product 0 
the camera on the phone may be used as a dustpan when indoors id rather be using a disposable then this 0 
any grandmother can make a roasted chicken better than this one 0 
ive had no trouble accessing the internet downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions 1 
i live in the neighborhood so i am disappointed i wont be back here because it is a convenient location 0 
service sucks 0 
the directing and the cinematography arent quite as good 0 
it is super charged up for use as a small hybrid palmtopcameracellphone and excels in those roles 1 
theres barely a boring moment in the film and there are plenty of humorous parts 1 
your brain will attempt to shutdown as part of a primal impulse of selfpreservation 0 
the script is bad very bad  it contains both cheesiness and unethical joke that you normally see in rated r or nc17 movie 0 
regrettably the film fails 0 
the igo chargers and tips are really great 1 
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1 
i saw this film over christmas and what a great film it was 1 
the goat taco didnt skimp on the meat and wow what flavor 1 
when a song could explain the emotions of the subjects better such as when jay adams unfortunate life was a subject of talk the song old man by neil young was played which evokes many emotions 1 
this gets a 1 out of 10 simply because theres nothing lower 0 
the writer gorman bechard undoubtedly did his homework because all references are industry and characterage appropriate 1 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
i literally vomited while watching this film 0 
dont waste your money 0 
the only thing that i think could improve is the sound leaks out from the headset 0 
disappointed 0 
i dont know what kind it is but they have the best iced tea 1 
anyways the food was definitely not filling at all and for the price you pay you should expect more 0 
these are the nicest restaurant owners ive ever come across 1 
we definately enjoyed ourselves 1 
not a good bargain 0 
great hands free device 1 
simple lightweight and great fit 1 
i was very pleased to see that i could replace my well travled swivel holster for my blackberry flip 1 
waitress was a little slow in service 0 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
this is the kind of money that is wasted properly 1 
very very fun chef 1 
this place is disgusting 0 
none of it works just dont buy it 0 
finally after three or four times the spring of the latch broke and i could not use it any longer on the visor 0 
also notable is john baileys fine crisp beautifully colored cinematography and the great production design costumes by eiko ishioka who went on to do the memorable costumes for coppolas dracula for which she received a well deserved oscar 1 
brilliance indeed 1 
the bathrooms are clean and the place itself is well decorated 1 
editing the editing of this film was phenomenal in my opinion 1 
im so sorry but i really cant recommend it to anyone 0 
the meat was pretty dry i had the sliced brisket and pulled pork 0 
all of the tapas dishes were delicious 1 
it was a pale color instead of nice and char and has no flavor 0 
the only downside is the service 0 
the story is also both funny and poignant at times 1 
great earpiece 1 
this is an outstanding little restaurant with some of the best food i have ever tasted 1 
if you havent gone here go now 1 
you truly take this journey through the eyes and soul of a child 1 
this was one of the worst films i have ever seen 0 
the potatoes were great and so was the biscuit 1 
what the hell kind of crap is that 0 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
the film has great actors a master director a significant themeat least a wouldbe significant theme undertone of fifties existential worldweariness aerial scenes that ought to have thrilled both senses and imagination and characters about which one might deeply care 1 
the desserts were a bit strange 0 
everything on the menu is terrific and we were also thrilled that they made amazing accommodations for our vegetarian daughter 1 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
good servicecheck 1 
give this one a look 1 
the food wasnt good 0 
there is however some pretty good acting at least for this type of film 1 
this is one of the best movies out there that shows such strong sibling bond for each other 1 
it was a long time that i didnt see a so charismatic actor on screen 1 
i will come back here every time im in vegas 1 
my order was not correct 0 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
i have 23 bars on my cell phone when i am home but you cant not hear anything 0 
it was a bit too sweet not really spicy enough and lacked flavor 0 
i would definitely recommend the jabra bt250v for those who are looking for comfort clarity and a great price 1 
works well 1 
perhaps my phone is defective but people cannot hear me when i use this 0 
do not buy do not buyit sucks 0 
i had about two bites and refused to eat anymore 0 
the selection on the menu was great and so were the prices 1 
the explosion of the gas tanks at the end was just as awful 0 
nice blanket of moz over top but i feel like this was done to cover up the subpar food 1 
i do think tom hanks is a good actor 1 
up there with the best of melville 1 
it looked like a wonderful story 1 
but i thought his acting was skilled 1 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
also the fries are without a doubt the worst fries ive ever had 0 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
i was able to do voice dialing in the car with no problem 1 
an absolute must visit 1 
nonlinear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well 1 
its like a really sexy party in your mouth where youre outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party 1 
they keep getting better and better this is my third one and ive had numerous palms too 1 
terrible my car will not accept this cassette 0 
its a case of so bad it is laughable 0 
but whatever it was that cost them so much it didnt translate to quality thats for sure 0 
it deserves strong love 1 
cant say enough good things about this place 1 
the steak and the shrimp are in my opinion the best entrees at gc 1 
your brain will attempt to shutdown as part of a primal impulse of selfpreservation 0 
i really do recommend this place you can go wrong with this donut place 1 
it felt like a very gripping intelligent stage play but without the overly theatrical feeling one actually gets from watching people on a stage which plays on everyones terror of a white lie escalating to monstrous consequences 1 
an awesome new look for fall 2000 1 
this is an unbelievable bargain 1 
my only problem is i thought the actor playing the villain was a low rent michael ironside 0 
everything about it is just bad 0 
will be back again 1 
not only did the software do a great job of this i could also make my own ringtones form my existing cds without an internet connection 1 
im trying to return it for a refund 0 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
when achille and philippa beautifully sing a duet from don giovanni that perfectly describes their situation in the movie you appreciate the subtle layers of this excellent film 1 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
bt50 battery junk 0 
the plot simply rumbles on like a machine desperately depending on the addition of new scenes 0 
you wont regret it 1 
the croutons also taste homemade which is an extra plus 1 
will definitely be back 1 
better than youd expect 1 
great phone 1 
the poor actors 0 
unfortunately the ability to actually know you are receiving a call is a rather important feature and this phone is pitiful in that respect 0 
im probably one of the few people to ever go to ians and not like it 0 
although i very much liked the look and sound of this place the actual experience was a bit disappointing 0 
the flat reenactments dont hold your attention because they are emotionally adrift and stagy 0 
however after seeing the short again after about 25 years i was amazed at how timeless the film actually is 1 
pricing is a bit of a concern at mellow mushroom 0 
sending it back 0 
main thing i didnt enjoy is that the crowd is of older crowd around mid 30s and up 0 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
thanks again to amazon for having the things i need for a good price 1 
portable and it works 1 
the waitress and manager are so friendly 1 
i do love sushi but i found kabuki to be overpriced overhip and underservices 0 
what should have been a hilarious yummy christmas eve dinner to remember was the biggest fail of the entire trip for us 0 
worthwhile 1 
i guess i liked the details of his dysfunctionhe was believable 1 
i was shocked because no signs indicate cash only 0 
however the ear pads come off easily and after only one week i lost one 0 
appears to actually outperform the original battery from china that came with my v325i 1 
for the price this was a great deal 1 
after the first charge kept going dead after 12 minutes 0 
i kept looking at the time and it had soon become 35 minutes yet still no food 0 
the least said about the acting the better 0 
you truly take this journey through the eyes and soul of a child 1 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
this place deserves no stars 0 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
simple lightweight and great fit 1 
very serious spoilers this movie was a huge disappointment 0 
i am very impressed with the job that motorola did on the sturdiness of this phone 1 
the decor is nice and the piano music soundtrack is pleasant 1 
the chefs were friendly and did a good job 1 
dont buy it 0 
as always the evening was wonderful and the food delicious 1 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
i advise everyone do not be fooled 0 
this is a great restaurant at the mandalay bay 1 
i great reception all the time 1 
it doesnt make you look cool 0 
it felt too light and tinny 0 
all of the tapas dishes were delicious 1 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
i was totally fascinated by the music the dancing everything 1 
coming here is like experiencing an underwhelming relationship where both parties cant wait for the other person to ask to break up 0 
i mean really how do you get so famous for your fish and chips when its so terrible 0 
i felt as though her going to ireland did absolutely nothing whatsoever 0 
it looks very nice 1 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
an excellent new restaurant by an experienced frenchman 1 
you get extra minutes so that you can carry out the call and not get cut off 1 
works great 1 
very displeased 0 
its extremely slow and takes forever to do anything with it 0 
it is just the sort of pap that is screened in the afternoon to punish the unemployed for not having jobs 0 
unreliable im giving up 0 
kris kristoffersen is good in this movie and really makes a difference 1 
victor mclaglen was even bad and brian donlevy was almost unrecognizable 0 
for sushi on the strip this is the place to go 1 
it is an insane game 1 
not a good item it worked for a while then started having problems in my auto reverse tape player 0 
the calls drop the phone comes on and off at will the screen goes black and the worst of all it stops ringing intermittently 0 
it just blew 0 
i am glad i purchased it 1 
the noise shield is incrediable 1 
the chips and sals a here is amazing 1 
was not happy 0 
it is light easy to use and has very clear reception and transmission 1 
the poor actors 0 
the guys all had steaks and our steak loving son who has had steak at the best and worst places said it was the best steak hes ever eaten 1 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
i like armand assante my cable companys summary sounded interesting so i watched it twice already and probably will again 1 
worked great 1 
its also great to see that renowned silent screenwriter frances marion hasnt missed a step going from silent to sound 1 
avoid this one if you can 0 
i think that it is a must see older john wayne film 1 
emily watsons character is very strong and she has only to give a quick glance and you understand everything 1 
in an interesting part of town this place is amazing 1 
it only recognizes the phone as its storage device 0 
1 long lasting battery you dont have to recharge it as frequentyly as some of the flip phones2 0 
did not like at all 0 
reversible plug works great 1 
crisp and clear 1 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
seriously flavorful delights folks 1 
the lighting is awful 0 
i loved their mussels cooked in this wine reduction the duck was tender and their potato dishes were delicious 1 
the bottowm lineanother worthless cheap gimmick from sprint 0 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
omg i felt like i had never eaten thai food until this dish 1 
so absolutley fantastic 1 
the concert sequences just sucked 0 
so i bought about 10 of these and saved alot of money 1 
bt50 battery junk 0 
this is simply the best bluetooth headset for sound quality 1 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
i rate this movie 910 1 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
very unreliable service from tmobile 0 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
this one is simply a disappointment 0 
if you simply want a small flip phone look elsewhere as the extra bells whistles are mediocre 0 
this place is not quality sushi it is not a quality restaurant 0 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
too bad cause i know its family owned i really wanted to like this place 0 
i am a fan of his this movie sucked really bad 0 
yes its shiny on front side and i love it 1 
the secondary plot line is incomprehensible and its relation to the primary plot line is mystifying 0 
battery chargelife is quite long 1 
what a piece of junk i lose more calls on this phone 0 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
i know that sounds funny but to me it seemed like sketchy technology that wouldnt work wellwell this one works great 1 
is it possible for a movie to get any worse than this 0 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
but it is great i would really recommend it 1 
last night was my second time dining here and i was so happy i decided to go back 1 
as i said abovepretty useless 0 
the owners are super friendly and the staff is courteous 1 
this item is great installed it let it charged up overnite and it has been working good every since with no problems 1 
i dont recommend unless your car breaks down in front of it and you are starving 0 
not easy to watch 0 
just whatever you do avoid groove as its the antithesis of all that is good about human traffic 0 
meredith m was better than all right 1 
all of the tapas dishes were delicious 1 
give this one a look 1 
my first visit to hiro was a delight 1 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
the voice recognition thru the handset is excellent 1 
the ambiance isnt much better 0 
so in a nutshell 1 the restaraunt smells like a combination of a dirty fish market and a sewer 0 
i guess i liked the details of his dysfunctionhe was believable 1 
i was hoping for more 0 
it rocked my world and is certainly a must see for anyone with no social or physical outlets 1 
i might have gotten a defect but i would not risk buying it again because of the built quality alone 0 
what a big waste of time 0 
the films sole bright spot was jonah hill who will look almost unrecognizable to fans of the recent superbad due to the amount of weight he lost in the interim 1 
i totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is 1 
in addition it feels amp looks as if the phone is all lightweight cheap plastic 0 
we are so glad we found this place 1 
nice quality build unlike some cheap s out there 1 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
this movie does an excellent job of revealing the complexity of the task and the incredible challenges facing south africa 1 
i recommend this for everyone who loves film movies anythinga work of art 1 
great movie 1 
lame would be the best way to describe it 0 
the noise shield is incrediable 1 
have been going since 2007 and every meal has been awesome 1 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
i like design and look of jabra behing the ear headsets and 5020 is pretty comfortible to wear 24 hours a day without pain in the ear 1 
thats how id describe this painfully dreary timewaster of a film 0 
verizons bills however are difficult to understand even though their pricing plans are simple 0 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
it really created a unique feeling though 1 
level 5 spicy was perfect where spice didnt overwhelm the soup 1 
loved itfriendly servers great food wonderful and imaginative menu 1 
i mean really how do you get so famous for your fish and chips when its so terrible 0 
after my phone got to be about a year old its been slowly breaking despite much care on my part 0 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
magical help 1 
i probably would not go here again 0 
this product is great it makes working a lot easier i can go to the copier while waiting on hold for something 1 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
that just screams legit in my booksomethats also pretty rare here in vegas 1 
this is the first phone ive had that has been so cheaply made 0 
the mic is great 1 
you cant relate with them hell you barely can understand them 0 
it is perfect for a sitdown family meal or get together with a few friends 1 
in fact im going to round up to 4 stars just because she was so awesome 1 
it is indescribably the most annoying and idiotic show i have ever seen 0 
this item is great installed it let it charged up overnite and it has been working good every since with no problems 1 
even when the women finally show up there is no sign of improvement the most expected things happen and by the time the film is over you might be far asleep 0 
so anyone near you will hear part of your conversation 0 
the football scenes at the end were perplexing 0 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
it is a really good show to watch 1 
woa talk about awful 0 
it wasnt busy at all and now we know why 0 
nonlinear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well 1 
it feels poorly constructed the menus are difficult to navigate and the buttons are so recessed that it is difficult to push them 0 
there was a warm feeling with the service and i felt like their guest for a special treat 1 
then as if i hadnt wasted enough of my life there they poured salt in the wound by drawing out the time it took to bring the check 0 
very bad performance plays angela bennett a computer expert who is at home all the time 0 
yes its that bad 0 
i have eaten here multiple times and each time the food was delicious 1 
we loved the biscuits 1 
not a good item it worked for a while then started having problems in my auto reverse tape player 0 
awsome device works great 1 
go watch it 1 
wont ever go here again 0 
i have two more years left in this contract and i hate this phone 0 
though the wind and the lion is told largely through the eyes of the son every member of the family can identify with one of the characters whether it be sean connerys noble brigand candace bergens feisty heroine john hustons wily john hay or steve kanalys spiffy radiant ruthless cando lieutenant roosevelts big stick 1 
who in their right mind is gonna buy this battery 0 
waitress was good though 1 
five star plus plus 1 
nothing short of magnificent photographycinematography in this film 1 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
this movie is excellentangel is beautiful and scamp is adorablehis little yelps when hes scaredand the funniest parts are whenscamp is caught under the curtain and when angel and scamp are singing ive never had this feeling beforei totally recommend this movieits coming out on special edition on june 20the cover has scamp on a garbage can and angel underneath the lid 1 
will definitely be back 1 
we waited for forty five minutes in vain 0 
so i bought about 10 of these and saved alot of money 1 
we sat another ten minutes and finally gave up and left 0 
i was very excited to get this headset because i thought it was really cute 1 
still waiting im sure this item would work well if i ever recieve it 0 
the problem i have is that they charge 1199 for a sandwich that is no bigger than a subway sub which offers better and more amount of vegetables 0 
you share general loewenhielms exquisite joy in his partaking of the cailles en sarcophage even though you are just watching a movie but you do wish for just a small sample to savor 1 
fantastic food 1 
this is the place where i first had pho and it was amazing 1 
the bathroom is just next door and very nice 1 
ill definitely be in soon again 1 
simply beautiful 1 
delicious and i will absolutely be back 1 
would not recommend to others 0 
it kept getting worse and worse so now im officially done 0 
what happened next was prettyoff putting 0 
it looses connection to the phone even when it is within a couple feet between the two 0 
brilliant 1 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
an excellent new restaurant by an experienced frenchman 1 
go and see it 1 
as a courtroom drama its compelling as an indictment on the american justice system its frightening 1 
i just cant explain this movie more than romanticcharminghilariousand adorablethe junkyard scenes are funnyall the junkyard dogs have something specialtoo funny i laughedkids will love itbuy it when it comes outit has new features 1 
they have a plethora of salads and sandwiches and everything ive tried gets my seal of approval 1 
i had strawberry tea which was good 1 
and the beans and rice were mediocre at best 0 
i probably would not go here again 0 
the plot has more holes than a pair of fishnet stockings and the direction and editing is astonishingly ham fisted 0 
internet is excrutiatingly slow 0 
ive dropped my phone more times than i can say even on concrete and my phone is still great knock on wood 1 
clear skype calls long battery life long range 1 
i have eaten here multiple times and each time the food was delicious 1 
the pairing of the two devices was so easy it barely took a couple minutes before i started making calls with the voice dialing feature 1 
the art style has the appearance of crayonpencil drawings and is wonderfully colorful and fanciful 1 
the biggest complaint i have is the battery drains superfast 0 
i came back today since they relocated and still not impressed 0 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
i was mortified 0 
a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it 1 
i guess it was supposed to be clever twist then shed some light on the situation but it was just stupid 0 
shrimp when i unwrapped it i live only 12 a mile from brushfire it was literally ice cold 0 
the lighting is just dark enough to set the mood 1 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
everything is appalling 0 
you truly take this journey through the eyes and soul of a child 1 
the kids are very cool too 1 
i have tried these cables with my computer and my ipod and it works just fine 1 
this may be the only bad film he ever made 0 
the very idea of it was lame take a minor character from a mediocre pg13 film and make a complete nonsequel while changing its tone to a pgrated family movie 0 
not to mention the combination of pears almonds and bacon is a big winner 1 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
the live music on fridays totally blows 0 
a world better than 95 of the garbage in the theatres today 1 
a must study for anyone interested in the worst sins of industrial design 0 
the delivery was on time 1 
good value great food great service 1 
its kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly its embarrassing how childlike the company is 0 
in particular the relationship between the bakery assistant and the waitress just didnt work for me at all 0 
i tried the cape cod ravoli chickenwith cranberrymmmm 1 
if only someone involved with it knew how to string together narrative 0 
it plays louder than any other speaker of this size the price is so low that most would think the quality is lacking however its not 1 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
special thanks to dylan t for the recommendation on what to order all yummy for my tummy 1 
how can that bethe audio quality is poor 0 
point your finger at any item on the menu order it and you wont be disappointed 1 
it only recognizes the phone as its storage device 0 
superb phone on a great network 1 
it was delicious 1 
by the time the film ended i not only disliked it i despised it 0 
this early film from future goremeister lucio fulci is a very good addition to the giallo subgenre 1 
every thing on phone work perfectly she like it 1 
the food sucked which we expected but it sucked more than we could have imagined 0 
my side greek salad with the greek dressing was so tasty and the pita and hummus was very refreshing 1 
dont buy it 0 
okay i like to consider myself a fair critic so ill give credit where credits duethe creature effects were actually pretty cool 1 
poor voice clarity 0 
this is hands down the best phone ive ever had 1 
i hate movies like that 0 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
great pork sandwich 1 
i got this phone on reccomendation from a relative and im glad i did 1 
then our food came out disappointment ensued 0 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
does everything it should and more 1 
great hands free device 1 
but when someone strives for greatness and poetry but delivers a muddled and often ridiculous story a bunch of disparate scenes pretentious dialogue then you get the worst kind of a movie that some other reviewer very accurately defined as pretentious crap 0 
it is simple to use and i like it 1 
the plot such as it is is so derivative and predictable that the ending is like a mercy killing 0 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
i just saw this film and i recommend it 1 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
overall i was not impressed and would not go back 0 
when it opens the battery connection is broken and the device is turned off 0 
this is hands down the best phone ive ever had 1 
used and dirty 0 
food was delicious 1 
i also decided not to send it back because our waitress looked like she was on the verge of having a heart attack 0 
in conclusion i will not bother with this movie because a volcano in los angeles is nothing but nonsense 0 
soggy and not good 0 
the seasonal fruit was fresh white peach puree 1 
i get absolutely horrible reception in my apartment where with other phones i have not had this problem 0 
i want my money back 0 
we got the food and apparently they have never heard of salt and the batter on the fish was chewy 0 
maybe there would be a reasonable explanation for this atrocity 0 
how awesome is that 1 
bad reception 0 
well never go again 0 
aside from its terrible lead this film has loads of other debits 0 
once you get inside youll be impressed with the place 1 
none of the three sizes they sent with the headset would stay in my ears 0 
its still wild stuff though and is highly recommended to fans of giallo cinema 1 
i literally vomited while watching this film 0 
his performance is simply genius 1 
my fella got the huevos rancheros and they didnt look too appealing 0 
you get extra minutes so that you can carry out the call and not get cut off 1 
we wont be going back 0 
this is a great restaurant at the mandalay bay 1 
this particular model would not work with my motorola q smartphone 0 
thus far have only visited twice and the food was absolutely delicious each time 1 
this is one of peter watkins most accessible films 1 
seriously killer hot chai latte 1 
not much dialogue not much music the whole film was shot as elaborately and aesthetically like a sculpture 1 
i totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is 1 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
this one works and was priced right 1 
adapter does not provide enough charging current 0 
food was so gooodd 1 
conclusion very filling meals 1 
this place deserves one star and 90 has to do with the food 0 
very funny 1 
oh the charger seems to work fine 1 
that one didnt work either 0 
food was great and so was the serivce 1 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
who in their right mind is gonna buy this battery 0 
this is by far the worst purchase ive made on amazon 0 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
simple lightweight and great fit 1 
watching washing machine twirling around wouldnt hurt your eyes as much as this show 0 
he was very impressed when going from the original battery to the extended battery 1 
otherwise dont even waste your time on this 0 
how this piece of trash was ever released is beyond me the acting the story the characters the supposedly special effects etcits all wrong 0 
warning do not buy 0 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
it was a pale color instead of nice and char and has no flavor 0 
cant store anything but phone numbers to sim 0 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
at first i thought i was grtting a good deal at 744 until i plugged it into my phone v3c razr 0 
the worst piece of crap ever along with the verizon customer service 0 
poor construction 0 
made very sturdy 1 
this is definitely a cult classic well worth viewing and sharing with others 1 
recommend with confidence 1 
during several different 2 minute calls i experienced 5 drops and it was in an area that had 5 bars 0 
definitely worth checking out 1 
do not make the same mistake as me 0 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
plug was the wrong size 0 
this scene is very strong and unpleasant 0 
at first glance it is a lovely bakery cafe nice ambiance clean friendly staff 1 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
jawbone era is awesome too 1 
the ri style calamari was a joke 0 
this is probably the most irritating show i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
i received my orders well within the shipping timeframe everything was in good working order and overall i am very excited to have this source 1 
i love that they put their food in nice plastic containers as opposed to cramming it in little paper takeout boxes 1 
i got the car charger and not even after a week the charger was brokeni went to plug it in and it started smoking 0 
the price was very good and with the free shipping and all it was a good purchase 1 
its an empty hollow shell of a movie 0 
the film has an ultracheap look to it 0 
poor voice clarity 0 
for those that havent seen it dont waste your time 0 
the mic there is a joke and the volume is quite low 0 
an interesting premise and billy drago is always good as a dangerous nutbag side note id love to see drago stephen mchattie and lance hendrikson in a flick together talk about raging cheekbones 1 
one more thing i can tolerate political incorrectness very well im all for artistic freedom and suspension of disbelief but the slavic female character was just too much 0 
this is a great phone 1 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
i could not understand what kind of idiot would produce this mess in the first place not to mention several season 0 
the flair bartenders are absolutely amazing 1 
after all the rave reviews i couldnt wait to eat herewhat a disappointment 0 
the best phone in market 1 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
the only thing worse than taylors acting was stanwycks singing 0 
much better than the other ayce sushi place i went to in vegas 1 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
i never walked out of a movie faster 0 
it was quite comfortable in the ear 1 
but i thought his acting was skilled 1 
and generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode 0 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
at no point in the proceedings does it look remotely like america 0 
then i exchanged for the same phone even that had the same problem 0 
the bipolarity of the ruthless thug one minute a ruthless killer the next minute a luvs diaper commercial is completely unconvincing 0 
does not work 0 
but if you liked movies like the matrix and better yet their sequels i think youll appreciate the thought provoking mindblowing experience this film will give you 1 
best breakfast buffet 1 
if you are looking for a good quality motorola headset keep looking this isnt it 0 
as a courtroom drama its compelling as an indictment on the american justice system its frightening 1 
simple lightweight and great fit 1 
it was also the right balance of war and love 1 
the first thing that happened was that the tracking was off 0 
good item low price 1 
you get extra minutes so that you can carry out the call and not get cut off 1 
wow what a bad film 0 
though the wind and the lion is told largely through the eyes of the son every member of the family can identify with one of the characters whether it be sean connerys noble brigand candace bergens feisty heroine john hustons wily john hay or steve kanalys spiffy radiant ruthless cando lieutenant roosevelts big stick 1 
also the fries are without a doubt the worst fries ive ever had 0 
ill give this film 10 out of 10 1 
that company is a joke 0 
the characters were all funny and had the peculiarity of not having a true lead character 1 
the dialogue is composed of things that make little sense 0 
the film is well paced understated and one of the best courtroom documentaries ive seen 1 
worst foodservice ive had in a while 0 
excellent phone 1 
i highly recommend this device to everyone 1 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
it was so bad i had lost the heart to finish it 0 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
i love this cable it allows me to connect any miniusb device to my pc 1 
it was attached to a gas station and that is rarely a good sign 0 
the telephone repair man was really funny and his reactions to the nuts and bitchy boss were truly genuine 1 
it was attached to a gas station and that is rarely a good sign 0 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
the best electronics of the available fm transmitters 1 
jawbone era is awesome too 1 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
for readers who have already seen one of miyazakis films he is still in top form and made another worthwhile experience 1 
similarly the delivery man did not say a word of apology when our food was 45 minutes late 0 
this product is clearly not ready for prime time i dont care how cool it looks if you cant tell a call is coming in its worthless 0 
he cant act one of the least scary villains i have ever seen he cant write did he write this damn movie in his sleep 0 
this pair of headphones is the worst that i have ever had soundwise 0 
i tried talking real loud but shouting on the telephone gets old and i was still told it wasnt great 0 
i searched the internet and found this one to be the best value 1 
this film offers many delights and surprises 1 
nine out of ten for a truly lovely film 1 
the show would begin with smart ass ed comments to each other that would be totally off the wall and uncalled for 0 
but this movie is not funny considering the ridiculousness of it 0 
down the drain because of a weak snap 0 
his use of the colours of the french flag in the three films was nothing short of incredible every shot every scene was like a work of art 1 
this phone tries very hard to do everything but fails at its very ability to be a phone 0 
great product 1 
all in all ha long bay was a bit of a flop 0 
so anyone near you will hear part of your conversation 0 
the acting was decidely wooden though no worse than a period universal b movie 0 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
i love this place 1 
it was absolutely amazing 1 
i think that it is a must see older john wayne film 1 
it really created a unique feeling though 1 
the last 15 minutes of movie are also not bad as well 1 
of course the footage from the 70s was grainy but that only enhanced the film 1 
nothing new there 0 
it is so small and you dont even realize that it is there after a while of getting used to it 1 
nothing special 0 
this one is simply a disappointment 0 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
the script is a big flawed mess 0 
i guess maybe we went on an off night but it was disgraceful 0 
great pizza and salads 1 
it was just too horrible 0 
recommend with confidence 1 
rating 1 out of 10 0 
worst hour and a half of my lifeoh my gosh 0 
the acting was bad 0 
the nachos are a must have 1 
obviously they have a terrible customer service so you get what you pay for 0 
what this film lacks is a convincing script 0 
the first time i ever came here i had an amazing experience i still tell people how awesome the duck was 1 
a pretty good product 1 
the food wasnt good 0 
im glad the film didnt go for the most obvious choice as a lesser film certainly would have 1 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
their rotating beers on tap is also a highlight of this place 1 
looks great and is strong 1 
this movie is terrible 0 
its too bad the food is so damn generic 0 
the least said about the acting the better 0 
this is hands down the best phone ive ever had 1 
overall i like there food and the service 1 
im terribly disappointed that this film would receive so many awards and accolades especially when there are far more deserving works of film out there 0 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
the things that the four kids get themselves into is absolutely hilarious to watch 1 
it rocked my world and is certainly a must see for anyone with no social or physical outlets 1 
the dialogue sucked 0 
regardless the film fails on most levels 0 
great phone 1 
often the dialogue doesnt really follow from one line to another or fit the surroundings 0 
so there is no way for me to plug it in here in the us unless i go by a converter 0 
very good stuff for the price 1 
the jabra eargels fit my ears very well 1 
if it were possible to give them zero stars theyd have it 0 
the vegetables are so fresh and the sauce feels like authentic thai 1 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
the food is very good for your typical bar food 1 
there is really nothing for me at postinos hope your experience is better 0 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
just does not work 0 
and generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode 0 
the bus boy on the other hand was so rude 0 
plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job 1 
this was a poor remake of my best friends wedding 0 
the bt headset was such a disapoinment 0 
we definately enjoyed ourselves 1 
it isnt even an achievement as a sobaditsgood or sobaditsmemorable movie 0 
i would advise to not purchase this item it never worked very well 0 
my friend did not like his bloody mary 0 
the price was very good and with the free shipping and all it was a good purchase 1 
dont waste your time 0 
join the club and get awesome offers via email 1 
lovely little thriller from hitchcock with lots of nice shenanigans surrounding a murdered spy a kidnapped child a nasty church a foreign plot and some random taxidermists 1 
love this headset 1 
we started with the tuna sashimi which was brownish in color and obviously wasnt fresh 0 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
its a great tool for entertainment communication and data managementoh be sure to use activesync 42 for optimal data synchronization results 1 
the burrittos blah 0 
the poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying 0 
the film succeeds despite or perhaps because of an obviously meagre budget 1 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
a happy wonderful feel good ending 1 
the two main characters may be two of the most believable children i ever saw put on screen 1 
i was very disappointed in the movie 0 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
it has a great camera thats 2mp and the pics are nice and clear with great picture quality 1 
i checked out this place a couple years ago and was not impressed 0 
highly unprofessional and rude to a loyal patron 0 
kids pizza is always a hit too with lots of great side dish options for the kiddos 1 
the headsets are easy to use and everyone loves them 1 
the potatoes were great and so was the biscuit 1 
our server was super nice and checked on us many times 1 
its a case of so bad it is laughable 0 
i had to go to a store and bought a new nokia phone which is working great 1 
the yellowtail carpaccio was melt in your mouth fresh 1 
i was hoping for more 0 
an hour and a half i wish i could bring back 0 
not loud enough and doesnt turn on like it should 0 
i was sitting in my vehicle with the cradle on my belt and the headset lost signal 0 
this one is simply a disappointment 0 
conclusion i loved it 1 
not a weekly haunt but definitely a place to come back to every once in a while 1 
the only place good for this film is in the garbage 0 
the staff was very attentive 1 
the service was terrible food was mediocre 0 
this is a great restaurant at the mandalay bay 1 
if you are reading this please dont go there 0 
del taco is pretty nasty and should be avoided if possible 0 
it presents a idyllic yet serious portrayal of the ups and downs of the characters lives 1 
it was a drive to get there 0 
if you hate earbugs avoid this phone by all means 0 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
i have been to very few places to eat that under no circumstances would i ever return to and this tops the list 0 
i kept catching the cable on the seat and i had to pull the phone out to turn it on an off 0 
im surprised this is a good quality car charger and theres not much reviews about it 1 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
regrettably the film fails 0 
we wont be returning 0 
eclectic selection 1 
i didnt realize how wonderful the short really is until the last two scenes 1 
horrible horrible protector 0 
filmiing was less expansive 0 
top line dont waste your time and money on this one its as bad as it comes 0 
comes with a strong light that you can use to light up your camera shots and even flash sos signals seriously 1 
in an interesting part of town this place is amazing 1 
went for lunch service was slow 0 
dont bother go to the store 0 
i was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar not only because the quality is great but the service is fast and the food impeccable 1 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
he surely doesnt know how to make a coherent action movie from the screenwriter of air force one who was only obliged to write the script just for a big sum of money 0 
i love this place 1 
also notable is john baileys fine crisp beautifully colored cinematography and the great production design costumes by eiko ishioka who went on to do the memorable costumes for coppolas dracula for which she received a well deserved oscar 1 
i tried the cape cod ravoli chickenwith cranberrymmmm 1 
the folks at otto always make us feel so welcome and special 1 
makes it easier to keep up with my bluetooth when im not wearing it 0 
its still wild stuff though and is highly recommended to fans of giallo cinema 1 
there arent death scenes like in previous movies and the fx are terrible 0 
i recently tried caballeros and i have been back every week since 1 
i am very impressed with this headset from plantronics 1 
when achille and philippa beautifully sing a duet from don giovanni that perfectly describes their situation in the movie you appreciate the subtle layers of this excellent film 1 
i only hear garbage for audio 0 
the staff are also very friendly and efficient 1 
you truly take this journey through the eyes and soul of a child 1 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
i had the chicken pho and it tasted very bland 0 
the last 15 minutes of movie are also not bad as well 1 
these are certainly very comfortable and functionality is decent 1 
battery life is also great 1 
this film offers many delights and surprises 1 
this is probably the most irritating show i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
small sleek impressive looking practical setup with ample storage in place 1 
the fries were great too 1 
the movie is littered with overt racial slurs towards the black cast members and in return the whites are depicted as morons and boobs 0 
that just screams legit in my booksomethats also pretty rare here in vegas 1 
the service was outshining i definitely recommend the halibut 1 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
i loved it it was really scary 1 
it also took her forever to bring us the check when we asked for it 0 
excellent 1 
the kids are very cool too 1 
this is an excellent tool especially when paired with your phones autoanswer 1 
the black eyed peas and sweet potatoes unreal 1 
this movie is possibly one of the most creative works of horror ever 1 
waited and waited and waited 0 
i was deeply impressed with the character he played 1 
rating 010 grade z note the show is so bad that even mother of the cast pull her daughter out of the show 0 
you can find better movies at youtube 0 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
this allows the possibility of double booking for the same date and time after the first 0 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
battery is terrible 0 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
we got sitting fairly fast but ended up waiting 40 minutes just to place our order another 30 minutes before the food arrived 0 
im glad the film didnt go for the most obvious choice as a lesser film certainly would have 1 
its too bad the food is so damn generic 0 
and considering the two of us left there very full and happy for about 20 you just cant go wrong 1 
a very very very slowmoving aimless movie about a distressed drifting young man 0 
any grandmother can make a roasted chicken better than this one 0 
even when the women finally show up there is no sign of improvement the most expected things happen and by the time the film is over you might be far asleep 0 
first time there and might just be the last 0 
at any rate this film stinks its not funny and fulci should have stayed with giallo and supernatural zombie movies 0 
brilliance indeed 1 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
i am very impressed with the job that motorola did on the sturdiness of this phone 1 
even in my bmw 3 series which is fairly quiet i have trouble hearing what the other person is saying 0 
the warm beer didnt help 0 
shrimp when i unwrapped it i live only 12 a mile from brushfire it was literally ice cold 0 
in addition it feels amp looks as if the phone is all lightweight cheap plastic 0 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
the cashier was friendly and even brought the food out to me 1 
an instant classic with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits 1 
loved itfriendly servers great food wonderful and imaginative menu 1 
this was utterly confusing at first which caused me to lose a couple of very very important contacts 0 
the loudspeaker option is great the bumpers with the lights is very appealing 0 
works great 1 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
it looses connection to the phone even when it is within a couple feet between the two 0 
great audio 1 
the reception is excellent 1 
really bad 0 
very good stuff for the price 1 
its pretty easy 1 
after two i felt disgusting 0 
warning do not buy 0 
overall i would recommend this phone over the new walkman 1 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
the plot well i said id let that one go 0 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
it didnt make me scared horrified or make me sympathetic towards the characters it was simply annoying 0 
it was an inexpensive piece but i would still have expected better quality 0 
i love it 1 
very dissapointing performance 0 
the instruction manual is lacking 0 
i will not return 0 
food quality has been horrible 0 
perabo has a nice energy level and is obviously very comfortable in front of a camera 1 
i love that they put their food in nice plastic containers as opposed to cramming it in little paper takeout boxes 1 
i really loved the story line and the poler bear was kinda cutebut if anyone has a question about fort steele just ask away 1 
great price also 1 
the structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema 1 
the staff is always super friendly and helpful which is especially cool when you bring two small boys and a baby 1 
back to good bbq lighter fare reasonable pricing and tell the public they are back to the old ways 1 
once your food arrives its meh 0 
love it great armband 1 
you wont forget this movie 1 
when my order arrived one of the gyros was missing 0 
i give it 2 thumbs down 0 
i great reception all the time 1 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
overall i wasnt very impressed with noca 0 
the refried beans that came with my meal were dried out and crusty and the food was bland 0 
ive never been more insulted or felt disrespected 0 
i dont recommend unless your car breaks down in front of it and you are starving 0 
i might have gotten a defect but i would not risk buying it again because of the built quality alone 0 
it was horrible 0 
in fact this stinker smells like a directtovideo release 0 
the directing and the cinematography arent quite as good 0 
i got this phone on reccomendation from a relative and im glad i did 1 
the bus boy on the other hand was so rude 0 
waaaaaayyyyyyyyyy over rated is all i am saying 0 
we are so glad we found this place 1 
youll love how thin it is 1 
i love this bluetooth 1 
very bad experience 0 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
there are the usual hitchcock logic flaws 0 
it looked like a wonderful story 1 
this case seems well made 1 
this would not even be good as a made for tv flick 0 
the desserts were a bit strange 0 
i guess maybe we went on an off night but it was disgraceful 0 
i ordered the lemon raspberry ice cocktail which was also incredible 1 
it was that loudglad to say that the plantronics 510 maintains a flawless connection to my cell and with no static during normal use 1 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
alexander nevsky is a great film 1 
loved the casting of jimmy buffet as the science teacher 1 
it holds a charge for a long time is reasonably comfortable under longwearing conditions and the quality of sound is tremendous 1 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
this movie was kind of long in length but i enjoyed every minute of it 1 
worthwhile 1 
very good product well made 1 
all the bread is made inhouse 1 
sprint charges for this service 0 
worse theres an incredibly weak subplot thrown in that follows a little band of latterday mansonites as they go after a reporter whos working on a story on the anniversary of the killings 0 
they keep getting better and better this is my third one and ive had numerous palms too 1 
great audio 1 
he was extremely rude and really there are so many other restaurants i would love to dine at during a weekend in vegas 0 
worst hour and a half of my lifeoh my gosh 0 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
the point is the journey a journey that touches every member of the family 1 
great phone 1 
mark my words this is one of those cult films like evil dead 2 or phantasm that people will still be discovering and falling in love with 20 30 40 years down the line 1 
although i very much liked the look and sound of this place the actual experience was a bit disappointing 0 
when my order arrived one of the gyros was missing 0 
also its slim enough to fit into my alarm clock docking station without removing the case 1 
i saw this film over christmas and what a great film it was 1 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
we watched our waiter pay a lot more attention to other tables and ignore us 0 
i came over from verizon because cingulair has nicer cell phones the first thing i noticed was the really bad service 0 
i ordered the lemon raspberry ice cocktail which was also incredible 1 
it is an hour and half waste of time following a bunch of very pretty high schoolers whine and cry about life 0 
the acting is like watching wooden puppets moving around and reading from a book thats how bad it is 0 
seriously killer hot chai latte 1 
i have had this phone for over a year now and i will tell you its not that great 0 
it probably would have been better if the director hadnt spent most of the movie showcasing his own art work which really isnt that noteworthy 0 
its a little geeky but i think thats its sex on toast and it rocks and oozes sex right down to its battery embedded sleek stylish leather case 1 
honeslty it didnt taste that fresh 0 
10 out of 10 for both the movie and trilogy 1 
by the time the film ended i not only disliked it i despised it 0 
its fits like a glove and is strong secure and durable 1 
this movie is a good and humorous comment on life in 2006 1 
worthless product 0 
to sum the film up breeders is a terrible cheaply made horror movie that should be avoided like the ebola virus 0 
this is a great little item 1 
everything from acting to cinematography was solid 1 
i do love sushi but i found kabuki to be overpriced overhip and underservices 0 
the place was fairly clean but the food simply wasnt worth it 0 
the ri style calamari was a joke 0 
better than new 1 
never again will i be dining at this place 0 
i have eaten here multiple times and each time the food was delicious 1 
reversible plug works great 1 
i did not have any problem with this item and would order it again if needed 1 
first off the reception sucks i have never had more than 2 bars ever 0 
this is one of the best italian thrillers of the early 70s 1 
we loved the place 1 
very disappointed 0 
the acting sucks the music sucks the script sucks the pacing sucks the special fx suck the directing sucks basically this movie sucks 0 
i ordered the voodoo pasta and it was the first time id had really excellent pasta since going gluten free several years ago 1 
this is a great place to eat 1 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
this is an unbelievable bargain 1 
loved itfriendly servers great food wonderful and imaginative menu 1 
down the drain because of a weak snap 0 
and the chef was generous with his time even came around twice so we can take pictures with him 1 
i sat riveted to the tv screen 1 
i ordered the lemon raspberry ice cocktail which was also incredible 1 
very very disappointed ordered the 35 big bay plater 0 
this is a witty and delightful adaptation of the dr seuss book brilliantly animated by upas finest and thoroughly deserving of its academy award 1 
the sweet potato fries were very good and seasoned well 1 
this is one of the best movies out there that shows such strong sibling bond for each other 1 
maybe if they werent cold they would have been somewhat edible 0 
the live music on fridays totally blows 0 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
its a mediocre miserable hollow laughable and predictable piece of garbage 0 
i am so tired of clichés that is just lazy writing and here they come in thick and fast 0 
i got it because it was so small and adorable 1 
definitely worth checking out 1 
worst customer service 0 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
this battery is an excellent bargain 1 
it definitely was not as good as my s11 1 
worst customer service ever 0 
i cant use this case because the smell is disgusting 0 
mic doesnt work 0 
the food was terrible 0 
if you simply want a small flip phone look elsewhere as the extra bells whistles are mediocre 0 
an interesting premise and billy drago is always good as a dangerous nutbag side note id love to see drago stephen mchattie and lance hendrikson in a flick together talk about raging cheekbones 1 
and the beans and rice were mediocre at best 0 
looks great and is strong 1 
it is worth the drive 1 
great headset very impressed h500 1 
they keep getting better and better this is my third one and ive had numerous palms too 1 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
give this one a look 1 
this one is simply a disappointment 0 
just dont know why they were so slow 0 
an excellent new restaurant by an experienced frenchman 1 
the characters are fleshed out surprisingly well particularly grimes and blake and all the actors deliver their sharply scripted lines with just the right amount of deadpan tongue in cheek to make the dialogue both hilarious and realistic 1 
but if you liked movies like the matrix and better yet their sequels i think youll appreciate the thought provoking mindblowing experience this film will give you 1 
i dont like this nokia either 0 
i have always used corded headsets and the freedom from the wireless is very helpful 1 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
it was equally awful 0 
shrimp when i unwrapped it i live only 12 a mile from brushfire it was literally ice cold 0 
i just wanted to leave 0 
maybe if they werent cold they would have been somewhat edible 0 
fantastic buy and will get again for whatever my next phone is 1 
why are these sad little vegetables so overcooked 0 
we would recommend these to others 1 
the acting by the whole cast could be put on a scale and balanced perfectly between overacting and underacting 0 
i want to first say our server was great and we had perfect service 1 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
treo and tmobile refused to replace it again and forced me to buy another phone without any kind of upgrade discount 0 
easily none other cartoon made me laugh in a tender way before getting into dark sitcoms oriented for teenagers 1 
it even has its sweet moments 1 
cinematography noteworthy including fine views of barcelona and its famed gaudi towers 1 
both do good jobs and are quite amusing 1 
i have been in more than a few bars in vegas and do not ever recall being charged for tap water 0 
this is truly an art movieit actually has a lot of art in it 1 
in fact i liked it better than interview with a vampire and i liked this lestat stuart townsend better than cruises attempt 1 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
only had this a month but its worked flawlessly so far 1 
frozen pucks of disgust with some of the worst people behind the register 0 
yes i am simplifying things here for the sake of brevity for this really is at the core of the problems with this film it has too much going on without any real fulfilling explanation 0 
the flair bartenders are absolutely amazing 1 
to sum the film up breeders is a terrible cheaply made horror movie that should be avoided like the ebola virus 0 
i was very excited to get this headset because i thought it was really cute 1 
the desserts were a bit strange 0 
great service and food 1 
the ambiance isnt much better 0 
keep up the good work amazon 1 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
there are many continuity errors one other user commented on different cars in the garage joes glassesthe one that got to me the most was the fact joes facial hair configuration seemed to change from scene to scene 0 
very good lunch spot 1 
the staff are great the ambiance is great 1 
my breakfast was perpared great with a beautiful presentation of 3 giant slices of toast lightly dusted with powdered sugar 1 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
the food was delicious our bartender was attentive and personable and we got a great deal 1 
the structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema 1 
does everything it should and more 1 
it is a true classic 1 
brilliance indeed 1 
they were goldencrispy and delicious 1 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
the film deserves strong kudos for taking this stand for having exceptional acting from its mostly lesserknown cast and for the superintelligent script that doesnt insult the audience or take the easy way out when it comes to white racism 1 
i got the car charger and not even after a week the charger was brokeni went to plug it in and it started smoking 0 
if there was ever an indication of a writer and a directors ability to meld two highly volatile temperaments into a seamless union of creativity then this is it 1 
what this film lacks is a convincing script 0 
some may say this buffet is pricey but i think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot 1 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
eew this location needs a complete overhaul 0 
i find wasting food to be despicable but this just wasnt food 0 
i went on motorolas website and followed all directions but could not get it to pair again 0 
1 long lasting battery you dont have to recharge it as frequentyly as some of the flip phones2 0 
it is unusable in a moving car at freeway speed 0 
overall i would recommend this phone over the new walkman 1 
i have to mention this and it is a huge spoiler i loved the ending how all the characters of the three films were the remaining survivors of the ferry disaster with valentine and the young judge together and the old man watching it on her tv solidifying his happiness over the suffering which he dealt with for those many years 1 
you wont be disappointed 1 
disappointment i hate anything that goes in my ear 0 
def coming back to bowl next time 1 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
a cheap and cheerless heist movie with poor characterisation lots of underbite style stoic emoting think chow yun fat in a better tomorrow and some cheesy clichés thrown into an abandoned factory ready for a few poorly executed flying judo rolls a la john woo 0 
the ri style calamari was a joke 0 
fantastic service here 1 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
their regular toasted bread was equally satisfying with the occasional pats of butter mmmm 1 
it was a waste of my money 0 
dont waste your time here 0 
took an hour to get our food only 4 tables in restaurant my food was luke warm our sever was running around like he was totally overwhelmed 0 
this is an unbelievable bargain 1 
the battery life is highly unacceptable 0 
i enjoyed it 1 
great audio 1 
personally i think it shows that people should learn to find a compromise them self without involving other people into issue 1 
the movie seemed a little slow at first 0 
i was mortified 0 
host staff were for lack of a better word bitches 0 
went in for happy hour great list of wines 1 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
for 40 bucks a head i really expect better food 0 
i recommend this for everyone who loves film movies anythinga work of art 1 
but when someone strives for greatness and poetry but delivers a muddled and often ridiculous story a bunch of disparate scenes pretentious dialogue then you get the worst kind of a movie that some other reviewer very accurately defined as pretentious crap 0 
the holster that arrived did not match the photo in the ad 0 
when it opens the battery connection is broken and the device is turned off 0 
it had some average acting from the main person and it was a low budget as you clearly can see 0 
i guess maybe we went on an off night but it was disgraceful 0 
the only place good for this film is in the garbage 0 
i just cant explain this movie more than romanticcharminghilariousand adorablethe junkyard scenes are funnyall the junkyard dogs have something specialtoo funny i laughedkids will love itbuy it when it comes outit has new features 1 
and the beans and rice were mediocre at best 0
