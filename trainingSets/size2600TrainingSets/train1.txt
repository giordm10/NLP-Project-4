this place is not quality sushi it is not a quality restaurant 0 
it deserves strong love 1 
i was bored throughout the whole damn thing 0 
the worst piece of crap ever along with the verizon customer service 0 
this convention never worked well in the past and certainly doesnt work here 0 
the mic there is a joke and the volume is quite low 0 
the kids are annoying 0 
a fly was in my apple juice a fly 0 
works fine 1 
i paid too much 0 
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
very serious spoilers this movie was a huge disappointment 0 
service is quick and friendly 1 
maybe its just their vegetarian fare but ive been twice and i thought it was average at best 0 
very unreliable service from tmobile 0 
i really recommend this faceplates since it looks very nice elegant and cool 1 
this place is pretty good nice little vibe in the restaurant 1 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
the shipping time was also very quick 1 
the construction of the headsets is poor 0 
no ear loop needed its tiny and the sound is great 1 
lot of holes in the plot theres nothing about how he became the emperor nothing about where he spend 20 years between his childhood and mature age 0 
great food and awesome service 1 
very good though 1 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0

there was no chemistry between ben affleck and sandra bullock in this film and i couldnt understand why he would consider even leaving his wifetobe for this chick that he supposedly was knocked out by 0 
the service was outshining i definitely recommend the halibut 1 
krussel always good 1 
yes i am simplifying things here for the sake of brevity for this really is at the core of the problems with this film it has too much going on without any real fulfilling explanation 0 
do not waste your money here 0 
each day of the week they have a different deal and its all so delicious 1 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
gave up trying to eat any of the crust teeth still sore 0 
sorry i will not be getting food from here anytime soon 0 
perabo has a nice energy level and is obviously very comfortable in front of a camera 1 
despite how hard i rate businesses its actually rare for me to give a 1 star 0 
the food sucked which we expected but it sucked more than we could have imagined 0 
i had a pretty satifying experience 1 
this place has it 1 
this is was due to the fact that it took 20 minutes to be acknowledged then another 35 minutes to get our foodand they kept forgetting things 0 
its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
what a mistake 0 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
star trek v the final frontier is the worst in the series 0 
10 out of 10 for both the movie and trilogy 1 
recommend with confidence 1 
it doesnt make you look cool 0 
glad i didnt pay to see it 0 
thank you for wasting my money 0 
pricing is a bit of a concern at mellow mushroom 0 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
ive missed numerous calls because of this reason 0 
wont work right or atleast for me 0 
very much disappointed with this company 0 
hackneyed writing certainly but made even worse by the bad directing 0 
when my mom and i got home she immediately got sick and she only had a few bites of salad 0 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
i have been very happy with the 510 and have had no complaints from any one regarding my sound quality on their end 1 
i gave it 5 stars then and im giving it 5 stars now 1 
i even fully charged it before i went to bed and turned off blue tooth and wifi and noticed that it only had 20 left in the morning 0 
o my gosh the best phone i have ever had 1 
i just saw this film and i recommend it 1 
its one of the most boring horror movies from the 90s mainly because it starts slow and centers in a boring atmosphere 0 
the dialogue is composed of things that make little sense 0 
the directing seems too pretentious 0 
performed awful muffled tinny incoming sound and severe echo for those on the other end of the call 0 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
very bad experience 0 
its one of the movies i need to see whenever it comes on tvnever mind the fact that i already have it memorized 1 
it always cuts out and makes a beep beep beep sound then says signal failed 0 
about ten minutes into this film i started having second thoughts 0 
there are the usual hitchcock logic flaws 0 
i purchased this and within 2 days it was no longer working 0 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
i exchanged the sony ericson z500a for this and im pretty happy with that decision 1 
do not buy do not buyit sucks 0 
the film is way too long 0 
really bad 0 
i had a pretty satifying experience 1 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
it is indescribably the most annoying and idiotic show i have ever seen 0 
we were promptly greeted and seated 1 
the buffet at bellagio was far from what i anticipated 0 
better than new 1 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
if you want healthy authentic or ethic food try this place 1 
the waitress and manager are so friendly 1 
as for the mains also uninspired 0 
it definitely was not as good as my s11 1 
i thoroughly enjoyed it when christopher eccleston took control of the tardis and the continuation of the series 1 
the result is a powerhouse achievement made more timely now perhaps because of our cultures disturbing fascination with celebrity and its distorted interpretations of fame 1 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
simply beautiful 1 
product is exactly as described 1 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
all of the tapas dishes were delicious 1 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
very displeased 0 
better than youd expect 1 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
headset works great was packaged nicely to avoid any damage 1 
please dont waste your money 0 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
the food wasnt good 0 
what this film lacks is a convincing script 0 
his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic 1 
it felt too light and tinny 0 
defective crap 0 
unfortunately the ability to actually know you are receiving a call is a rather important feature and this phone is pitiful in that respect 0 
this pda rocks 1 
there was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters 0 
this is the place where i first had pho and it was amazing 1 
if it was to turn my good day feeling into a night of disturbing memories than i guess he succeeded 0 
battery chargelife is quite long 1 
the plot has more holes than a pair of fishnet stockings and the direction and editing is astonishingly ham fisted 0 
constantine gives everything the right intensity and seems to have a good understanding of the underlying psychological motivations 1 
it is perfect for a sitdown family meal or get together with a few friends 1 
after i pulled up my car i waited for another 15 minutes before being acknowledged 0 
their steaks are 100 recommended 1 
i was sitting in my vehicle with the cradle on my belt and the headset lost signal 0 
muddy low quality sound and the casing around the wires insert was poorly super glued and slid off 0 
the selection of food was not the best 0 
its a total package 1 
this place is like chipotle but better 1 
yet i enjoy watching it 1 
seafood was limited to boiled shrimp and crab legs but the crab legs definitely did not taste fresh 0 
avoid at any and all costs 0 
ive had better not only from dedicated boba tea spots but even from jenni pho 0 
to summarize the food was incredible nay transcendant but nothing brings me joy quite like the memory of the pneumatic condiment dispenser 1 
terrible phone holder 0 
i particularly remember my senses being assaulted by strident cords of music that would blare out with very little warning and even less meaning 0 
cant say enough good things about this place 1 
so bad 0 
i have only had it for a few weeks but so far so good 1 
this is by far the worst purchase ive made on amazon 0 
i contacted the company and they told me that although the unit was still under warranty if i couldnt produce my receipt i was out of luck 0 
the characters were all funny and had the peculiarity of not having a true lead character 1 
the acting is beyond abysmal 0 
so badwellits just bad 0 
i hate those things as much as cheap quality black olives 0 
the acting helps the writing along very well maybe the idiotsavant sister could have been played better and it is a real joy to watch 1 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
the goat taco didnt skimp on the meat and wow what flavor 1 
still i do like this movie for its empowerment of women theres not enough movies out there like this one 1 
now you know why i gave it a 10 1 
i dont think there are any redeeming qualities in this remake 0 
freezes frequently4 0 
keep up the good work amazon 1 
battery has no life 0 
camera color balance is awful 0 
the service was great even the manager came and helped with our table 1 
from what my dinner companions told meeverything was very fresh with nice texture and taste 1 
disappointment i hate anything that goes in my ear 0 
this would not even be good as a made for tv flick 0 
she carries the movie well 1 
and i really did find them funny 1 
no one at the table thought the food was above average or worth the wait that we had for it 0 
it was also the right balance of war and love 1 
the macarons here are insanely good 1 
her role was played well 1 
the holster that arrived did not match the photo in the ad 0 
the mic there is a joke and the volume is quite low 0 
service was good and the company was better 1 
in the summer you can dine in a charming outdoor patio so very delightful 1 
if you look for authentic thai food go else where 0 
not enough volume 0 
very poor service 0 
what a piece of junk i lose more calls on this phone 0 
the plot well i said id let that one go 0 
judith light is one of my favorite actresses and i think she does a superb job in this film 1 
excellent 1 
meredith m was better than all right 1 
i cant use this case because the smell is disgusting 0 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
very disappointed 0 
eew this location needs a complete overhaul 0 
blue ant is easy to use 1 
you never know if you pushed it hard enough or the right number of times for the function you want or not 0 
ordered burger rare came in well done 0 
then theres the plot holes 0 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
how can anyone in their right mind ask for anything more from a movie than this 1 
excellent cast story line performances 1 
the dialogue is composed of things that make little sense 0 
good beer drink selection and good food selection 1 
if youre not familiar check it out 1 
ill even say it again  this is torture 0 
those phones are working just fine now 1 
this place was such a nice surprise 1 
food arrived quickly 1 
this phone might well be the worst ive ever had in any brand 0 
too bad cause i know its family owned i really wanted to like this place 0 
the service here leaves a lot to be desired 0 
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
which are small and not worth the price 0 
just whatever you do avoid groove as its the antithesis of all that is good about human traffic 0 
it is the best charger i have seen on the market yet 1 
very good phone 1 
i love all the features and form factor 1 
there is so much good food in vegas that i feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to rice and company 0 
will go back next trip out 1 
then our food came out disappointment ensued 0 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
it doesnt make you look cool 0 
it was packed 0 
same evening him and i are both drastically sick 0 
this movie has a cutting edge to it 1 
the story starts too fast with absolutely no suspense or buildup in the slightest 0 
sorry i will not be getting food from here anytime soon 0 
perhaps i caught them on an off night judging by the other reviews but im not inspired to go back 0 
i love the pho and the spring rolls oh so yummy you have to try 1 
ive only had my bluetooth for a few weeks but i really like it 1 
i found the product to be easy to set up and use 1 
in a word it is embarrassing 0 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
the buttons for on and off are bad 0 
there was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters 0 
i could not recommend these more 0 
its one of the most boring horror movies from the 90s mainly because it starts slow and centers in a boring atmosphere 0 
if you do go see this movie bring a pillow or a girlfriendboyfriend to keep you occupied through out 0 
awsome device works great 1 
yes its that bad 0 
their menu is diverse and reasonably priced 1 
total waste of time 0 
the warm beer didnt help 0 
i received my supposedly new motorola 375 and apparently there was not a match between the phone and the charger 0 
the potatoes were great and so was the biscuit 1 
rating 010 grade z note the show is so bad that even mother of the cast pull her daughter out of the show 0 
i did not have any problem with this item and would order it again if needed 1 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
i received my supposedly new motorola 375 and apparently there was not a match between the phone and the charger 0 
im not sure what he was trying to do with this film 0 
the performances are not improved by improvisation because the actors now have twice as much to worry about not only whether theyre delivering the line well but whether the line itself is any good 0 
we waited for forty five minutes in vain 0 
love the margaritas too 1 
we got the food and apparently they have never heard of salt and the batter on the fish was chewy 0 
imdb ratings only go as low 1 for awful its time to get some negative numbers in there for cases such as these 0 
this is actually a very smart movie 1 
these are fabulous 1 
once your food arrives its meh 0 
works great 1 
i wasted my little money with this earpiece 0 
the movie showed a lot of florida at its best made it look very appealing 1 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
it is worth the drive 1 
ive missed numerous calls because of this reason 0 
freezes frequently4 0 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
i seriously cannot believe that the owner has so many unexperienced employees that all are running around like chickens with their heads cut off 0 
nice leather 1 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
so just beware 0 
however paul schrader has indeed made a film about mishima that is both superb complex 1 
i love the pho and the spring rolls oh so yummy you have to try 1 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
my friend loved the salmon tartar 1 
im pleased 1 
the hockey scenes are terrible defensemen playing like theyre 5 years old goalies diving at shots that are 10 feet wide of the net etc 0 
cinematography the film was shot in an interesting way 1 
we literally sat there for 20 minutes with no one asking to take our order 0 
i know this is not like the other restaurants at all something is very off here 0 
seriously its not worth wasting your or your kids time on 0 
this was my first and only vegas buffet and it did not disappoint 1 
the scenes are often funny and occasionally touching as the characters evaluate their lives and where they are going 1 
so dont go there if you are looking for good food 0 
i have to mention this and it is a huge spoiler i loved the ending how all the characters of the three films were the remaining survivors of the ferry disaster with valentine and the young judge together and the old man watching it on her tv solidifying his happiness over the suffering which he dealt with for those many years 1 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
this movie does an excellent job of revealing the complexity of the task and the incredible challenges facing south africa 1 
its a feelgood film and thats how i felt when i came out of the cinema 1 
if she had not rolled the eyes we may have stayed not sure if we will go back and try it again 0 
the feel of the dining room was more college cooking course than high class dining and the service was slow at best 0 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
sooooo good 1 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
phone now holds charge like it did when it was new 1 
but despite these few flaws this case is of exceptional quality and well worth the additional costs of owning an official oem product 1 
the building itself seems pretty neat the bathroom is pretty trippy but i wouldnt eat here again 0 
i find wasting food to be despicable but this just wasnt food 0 
the nachos are a must have 1 
couldnt ask for a more satisfying meal 1 
i kept catching the cable on the seat and i had to pull the phone out to turn it on an off 0 
the movie is not completely perfect but titta di girolamo will stay with you for a long time after the vision of the movie 1 
ill put this gem up against any movie in terms of screenplay cinematography acting postproduction editing directing or any other aspect of filmmaking 1 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
saggy floppy piece of junk 0 
please dont waste your money 0 
this place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver 0 
it is not good 0 
then i exchanged for the same phone even that had the same problem 0 
never again will i be dining at this place 0 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
kind of hard to mess up a steak but they did 0 
the new characters werent all that memorable and i found myself forgetting who was who 0 
i knew when i saw the film that more great things were to come from this gifted actor 1 
everything from acting to cinematography was solid 1 
it is an insane game 1 
obviously they have a terrible customer service so you get what you pay for 0 
the range is very decent ive been able to roam around my house with the phone in the living room with no receptionsound quality issues 1 
it is an insane game 1 
despite how hard i rate businesses its actually rare for me to give a 1 star 0 
its extremely slow and takes forever to do anything with it 0 
i was disgusted because i was pretty sure that was human hair 0 
and i really did find them funny 1 
i work in the hospitality industry in paradise valley and have refrained from recommending cibo any longer 0 
their frozen margaritas are way too sugary for my taste 0 
the food was outstanding and the prices were very reasonable 1 
simple lightweight and great fit 1 
if you hate earbugs avoid this phone by all means 0 
it just blew 0 
its worth driving up from tucson 1 
the food is very good for your typical bar food 1 
go rent it 1 
generous portions and great taste 1 
the design is very odd as the ear clip is not very comfortable at all 0 
special mention should be made of the superb music score and sound effects which are an integral element in helping to make this such a memorable and enjoyable cartoon 1 
performed awful muffled tinny incoming sound and severe echo for those on the other end of the call 0 
the waitress and manager are so friendly 1 
great phone 1 
its been my choice headset for yearsgreat sound good volume good noise cancellation 1 
i dont think well be going back anytime soon 0 
great food and great service in a clean and friendly setting 1 
i found this place by accident and i could not be happier 1 
my girlfriends veal was very bad 0 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
nonlinear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well 1 
buttons are too small 0 
i exchanged the sony ericson z500a for this and im pretty happy with that decision 1 
i tried the cape cod ravoli chickenwith cranberrymmmm 1 
well packaged arrived on time and works as intended 1 
this place lacked style 0 
at no point in the proceedings does it look remotely like america 0 
the chips that came out were dripping with grease and mostly not edible 0 
incredible 1 
dont waste your on this one 0 
this frog phone charm is adorable and very eye catching 1 
every element of this story was so over the top excessively phony and contrived that it was painful to sit through 0 
what a piece of junk i lose more calls on this phone 0 
after two i felt disgusting 0 
not nearly as good looking as the amazon picture makes it look 0 
server did a great job handling our large rowdy table 1 
an amazing finale to possibly the best trilogy of all time 1 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
i have had tmobile service for 2 or 3 years now and i am pretty happy with it 1 
theres barely a boring moment in the film and there are plenty of humorous parts 1 
they have horrible attitudes towards customers and talk down to each one when customers dont enjoy their food 0 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
this phone might well be the worst ive ever had in any brand 0 
her lines seem to have been written by a fifteen year old though they are trying oh so so hard to sound like how a fifteen year old would really um you know well talk 0 
i will not be eating there again 0 
that was done in the second movie 0 
i give wirefly 1 stari will contact cingularatt and inform them of this practice 0 
i dont recommend unless your car breaks down in front of it and you are starving 0 
go to place for gyros 1 
i purchased this and within 2 days it was no longer working 0 
kids pizza is always a hit too with lots of great side dish options for the kiddos 1 
what i really like there is the crepe station 1 
will be back again 1 
then as if i hadnt wasted enough of my life there they poured salt in the wound by drawing out the time it took to bring the check 0 
good service very clean and inexpensive to boot 1 
i literally vomited while watching this film 0 
the cast is good 1 
i love being able to use one headset for both by landline and cell 1 
i would recommend purchasing the jabra jx10 series 2 which works flawlessly with my moto q go figure 1 
this product is great it makes working a lot easier i can go to the copier while waiting on hold for something 1 
i asked multiple times for the wine list and after some time of being ignored i went to the hostess and got one myself 0 
you cant beat the price on these 1 
i guess that nobody at the network that aired this dribble watched it before putting it on 0 
insults profound deuchebaggery and had to go outside for a smoke break while serving just to solidify it 0 
i got it because it was so small and adorable 1 
comfort for our whole family 1 
i left with a stomach ache and felt sick the rest of the day 0 
the film has an ultracheap look to it 0 
instead we got a bore fest about a whiny spoiled brat babysitting 0 
dont waste your time watching this rubbish nonresearched film 0 
it works fine on my motorola 325 cellphone and a lot better than the wornout battery did 1 
this is one of the best italian thrillers of the early 70s 1 
it has kept up very well 1 
the service was extremely slow 0 
this review is long overdue since i consider a tale of two sisters to be the single greatest film ever made 1 
nargile i think you are great 1 
i love this cable it allows me to connect any miniusb device to my pc 1 
my fella got the huevos rancheros and they didnt look too appealing 0 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
the cashier was friendly and even brought the food out to me 1 
id say that would be the hardest decision honestly all of ms dishes taste how they are supposed to taste amazing 1 
this is truly an art movieit actually has a lot of art in it 1 
definitely a turn off for me i doubt ill be back unless someone else is buying 0 
i just saw this film and i recommend it 1 
so badwellits just bad 0 
but in any case the best part is you can download these pictures to your laptop using ir or even send pictures from your laptop to the phone 1 
but it picked up speed and got right to the point 1 
earbud piece breaks easily 0 
the staff are also very friendly and efficient 1 
the charger arrived within the promised timeframe but it did not work 0 
it is a really good show to watch 1 
i kept catching the cable on the seat and i had to pull the phone out to turn it on an off 0 
from here on the widmark character turns unintentionally comical 0 
no actress has been worse used that june allison in this movie 0 
i highly recommend this device to everyone 1 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
it is easy to turn on and off when you are in the car and the volume controls are quite accessable 1 
will not be back 0 
the food amazing 1 
this place is good 1 
easy to pair with my samsung cell 1 
will go back next trip out 1 
i think that it is a must see older john wayne film 1 
its a feelgood film and thats how i felt when i came out of the cinema 1 
i checked everywhere and there is no feature for it which is really disappointing 0 
dont waste your money 0 
they have a plethora of salads and sandwiches and everything ive tried gets my seal of approval 1 
seriously killer hot chai latte 1 
having to humour him just to get by and get through the day was so apt 1 
i bought this to use with my kindle fire and absolutely loved it 1 
but i definitely would not eat here again 0 
this movie is a good and humorous comment on life in 2006 1 
he surely doesnt know how to make a coherent action movie from the screenwriter of air force one who was only obliged to write the script just for a big sum of money 0 
the death row scenes were entirely unmoving 0 
our server was very nice and even though he looked a little overwhelmed with all of our needs he stayed professional and friendly until the end 1 
but other than that the movie seemed to drag and the heroes didnt really work for their freedom 0 
excellent hands free tool 1 
the concert sequences just sucked 0 
the awful dialogue and hopeless overacting by everyone who gets shot top off a real waste of space and time 0 
its one of the movies i need to see whenever it comes on tvnever mind the fact that i already have it memorized 1 
by the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant i was bored and didnt care what happened next and so i switched off 0 
the cast is good 1 
the warmth it generates is in contrast to its austere backdrop 1 
so for our enjoyment we get to see them run around play games and be dangerous 1 
i didnt know pulled pork could be soooo delicious 1 
crisp and clear 1 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
steve martin delivers a really funny performance of a middleaged upper class uptight white guy 1 
so dont go there if you are looking for good food 0 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
great product 1 
this product is great it makes working a lot easier i can go to the copier while waiting on hold for something 1 
i was bored throughout the whole damn thing 0 
there is a lot of beautiful places 1 
why was this film made 0 
con spotty service 0 
spend your money and time some place else 0 
the service was a little slow considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace 0 
i wear glasses and it fits fine with them 1 
then a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use 0 
the only thing that i think could improve is the sound leaks out from the headset 0 
it really is impressive that the place hasnt closed down 0 
i have to jiggle the plug to get it to line up right to get decent volume 0 
everything about this movie is stupid 0 
reaching for the bottom row is uncomfortable and the send and end keys are not where i expect them to be3 0 
very happy with this product 1 
good beer drink selection and good food selection 1 
i have been to very few places to eat that under no circumstances would i ever return to and this tops the list 0 
im terribly disappointed that this film would receive so many awards and accolades especially when there are far more deserving works of film out there 0 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
the text messaging feature is really tricky to use 0 
in an interesting part of town this place is amazing 1 
this was such an awesome movie that i bought it off of ebay 1 
you wont be disappointed 1 
this was one of the worst films i have ever seen 0 
food was so gooodd 1 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
their rotating beers on tap is also a highlight of this place 1 
linksys should have some way to exchange a bad phone for a refurb unit or something 0 
it is worth the drive 1 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
everything captain howdy says is either laughable or just plain stupid 0 
not much seafood and like 5 strings of pasta at the bottom 0 
the pizza tasted old super chewy in not a good way 0 
all things considered a job very well done 1 
i guess maybe we went on an off night but it was disgraceful 0 
i highly recommend this case 1 
you could drive a semi truck into these holes 0 
the best place to go for a tasty bowl of pho 1 
the concert sequences just sucked 0 
these are the nicest restaurant owners ive ever come across 1 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
after the first charge kept going dead after 12 minutes 0 
the movie is not completely perfect but titta di girolamo will stay with you for a long time after the vision of the movie 1 
it was a bit too sweet not really spicy enough and lacked flavor 0 
keep up the good work amazon 1 
this is actually a very smart movie 1 
the script is bad very bad  it contains both cheesiness and unethical joke that you normally see in rated r or nc17 movie 0 
my fiancé and i came in the middle of the day and we were greeted and seated right away 1 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
their regular toasted bread was equally satisfying with the occasional pats of butter mmmm 1 
i bought this to use with my kindle fire and absolutely loved it 1 
110 and only because there is no setting for 010 0 
total waste of time 0 
not impressed 0 
this is a simple little phone to use but the breakage is unacceptible 0 
great for the jawbone 1 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
it plays louder than any other speaker of this size the price is so low that most would think the quality is lacking however its not 1 
basically the service was very bad 0 
there are the usual hitchcock logic flaws 0 
excellent hands free tool 1 
this is simply the best bluetooth headset for sound quality 1 
i ordered the voodoo pasta and it was the first time id had really excellent pasta since going gluten free several years ago 1 
service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is vegas and located inside the crystals shopping mall by aria 1 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
works like a charm it work the same as the one i got with the phone 1 
the story unfolds in 18th century jutland and the use of period music played on period instruments is just one more fine touch 1 
worked great 1 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
last time buying from you 0 
they will customize your order any way youd like my usual is eggplant with green bean stir fry love it 1 
she carries the movie well 1 
imdb ratings only go as low 1 for awful its time to get some negative numbers in there for cases such as these 0 
the movie was so boring that i sometimes found myself occupied peaking in the paper instead of watching never happened during a columbo movie before 0 
constantine gives everything the right intensity and seems to have a good understanding of the underlying psychological motivations 1 
if only someone involved with it knew how to string together narrative 0 
sam shepards portrayal of a gung ho marine was sobering 1 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
the descriptions said yum yum sauce and another said eel sauce yet another said spicy mayowell none of the rolls had sauces on them 0 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
nothing special 0 
tom wilkinson broke my heart at the end and everyone elses judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike 1 
for those that havent seen it dont waste your time 0 
the poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying 0 
not sure who was more lost the flat characters or the audience nearly half of whom walked out 0 
really bad 0 
both actors truly understand and become their particular character delivering a convincing sincere performance 1 
my mother and brother had to do thiswhen i saw robert ryan portraying this type of man it was a very good imitation of this type of individual and i was impressed 1 
i dont think ive ever gone to a movie and disliked it as much 0 
you share general loewenhielms exquisite joy in his partaking of the cailles en sarcophage even though you are just watching a movie but you do wish for just a small sample to savor 1 
this isnt a small family restaurant this is a fine dining establishment 1 
the stories were powerful explorations of the nature of man and of art 1 
doesnt do the job 0 
it looses connection to the phone even when it is within a couple feet between the two 0 
the writers were smack on and i think the best actors and actresses were a bonus to the showthese characters were so real 1 
the plot was the same as pretty much every other cheap horror 0 
if the food isnt bad enough for you then enjoy dealing with the worlds worstannoying drunk people 0 
their regular toasted bread was equally satisfying with the occasional pats of butter mmmm 1 
the warm beer didnt help 0 
i have had tmobile service for 2 or 3 years now and i am pretty happy with it 1 
reaching for the bottom row is uncomfortable and the send and end keys are not where i expect them to be3 0 
easy to use 1 
bland not a liking this place for a number of reasons and i dont want to waste time on bad reviewing ill leave it at that 0 
these headphones were a great find and i think they are perhaps the best purchase ive made in the last several years seriously 1 
i also didnt like the on button it felt like it would crack with use 0 
you have to hold the phone at a particular angle for the other party to hear you clearly 0 
ill be looking for a new earpiece 0 
i was so insulted 0 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
the characters were all funny and had the peculiarity of not having a true lead character 1 
this place has it 1 
maybe its just their vegetarian fare but ive been twice and i thought it was average at best 0 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
he surely doesnt know how to make a coherent action movie from the screenwriter of air force one who was only obliged to write the script just for a big sum of money 0 
i bought two of them and neither will charge 0 
best fish ive ever had in my life 1 
there are massive levels massive unlockable characters its just a massive game 1 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
the service was outshining i definitely recommend the halibut 1 
unfortunately the ability to actually know you are receiving a call is a rather important feature and this phone is pitiful in that respect 0 
now the burgers arent as good the pizza which used to be amazing is doughy and flavorless 0 
arrived quickly and much less expensive than others being sold 1 
which are small and not worth the price 0 
ive seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie 0 
no real improvement 0 
would not reccommend 0 
reception is terrible and full of static 0 
but now i was completely grossed out 0 
it was that year however that reminded us that huston was still at the top of his game as evinced by his faithful adaptation of james joyces acclaimed novella the dead 1 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
horrible phone 0 
an amazing finale to possibly the best trilogy of all time 1 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
great time family dinner on a sunday night 1 
if you look for authentic thai food go else where 0 
you also cannot take pictures with it in the case because the lense is covered 0 
the film is well paced understated and one of the best courtroom documentaries ive seen 1 
her lines seem to have been written by a fifteen year old though they are trying oh so so hard to sound like how a fifteen year old would really um you know well talk 0 
main thing i didnt enjoy is that the crowd is of older crowd around mid 30s and up 0 
i have to use the smallest earpieces provided but it stays on pretty well 1 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
this is the first phone ive had that has been so cheaply made 0 
but if you liked movies like the matrix and better yet their sequels i think youll appreciate the thought provoking mindblowing experience this film will give you 1 
the best electronics of the available fm transmitters 1 
the movie is terribly boring in places 0 
food arrived quickly 1 
this results in the phone being either stuck at max volume or mute 0 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
the lines the cuts the audio everything is wrong 0 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
terrible management 0 
but it does get better reception and clarity than any phone ive had before 1 
the veggitarian platter is out of this world 1 
not a good item it worked for a while then started having problems in my auto reverse tape player 0 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
the color is even prettier than i thought it would be and the graphics are incredibly sharp 1 
im terribly disappointed that this film would receive so many awards and accolades especially when there are far more deserving works of film out there 0 
steamboat willie is an amazingly important film to our cinema history 1 
were jerks on the phone 0 
overall i like this place a lot 1 
there are so many problems i dont know where to start 0 
terrible my car will not accept this cassette 0 
the steak was amazingrge fillet relleno was the best seafood plate i have ever had 1 
if that bug never showed up i would have given a 4 for sure but on the other side of the wall where this bug was climbing was the kitchen 0 
maybe there would be a reasonable explanation for this atrocity 0 
the lighting is awful 0 
not worth it 0 
the dining space is tiny but elegantly decorated and comfortable 1 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
all the bread is made inhouse 1 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
better than new 1 
no ear loop needed its tiny and the sound is great 1 
for those that havent seen it dont waste your time 0 
everything was gross 0 
if it was to turn my good day feeling into a night of disturbing memories than i guess he succeeded 0 
this is a witty and delightful adaptation of the dr seuss book brilliantly animated by upas finest and thoroughly deserving of its academy award 1 
the yellowtail carpaccio was melt in your mouth fresh 1 
anyways the food was definitely not filling at all and for the price you pay you should expect more 0 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
the sweet potato fries were very good and seasoned well 1 
i have had mine for about a year and this christmas i bought some for the rest of the family 1 
the salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop which was perfectly cooked 1 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
the calls drop the phone comes on and off at will the screen goes black and the worst of all it stops ringing intermittently 0 
i dont recommend unless your car breaks down in front of it and you are starving 0 
i really wanted the plantronics 510 to be the right one but it has too many issues for methe good 0 
an amazing finale to possibly the best trilogy of all time 1 
there was a warm feeling with the service and i felt like their guest for a special treat 1 
meredith m was better than all right 1 
the sound quality is excellent as well 1 
if you dont find it too bad as again the unit comes with one earpad onlyi would not recommend this to anyone 0 
lasted one day and then blew up 0 
amazon sucks 0 
the bipolarity of the ruthless thug one minute a ruthless killer the next minute a luvs diaper commercial is completely unconvincing 0 
very good product well made 1 
by far the best cheesecurds we have ever had 1 
waste of 13 bucks 0 
this is a great deal 1 
see it 1 
a piece of cinematic garbage captured on celluloid 0 
after two i felt disgusting 0 
those burgers were amazing 1 
the tracfonewebsite is user friendly and makes it easy toactivate etc 1 
it doesnt make you look cool 0 
hackneyed writing certainly but made even worse by the bad directing 0 
product is useless since it does not have enough charging current to charge the 2 cellphones i was planning to use it with 0 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
excellent sound battery life and inconspicuous to boot 1 
nice solid keyboard 1 
great audio 1 
my breakfast was perpared great with a beautiful presentation of 3 giant slices of toast lightly dusted with powdered sugar 1 
the burger is good beef cooked just right 1 
the owners are super friendly and the staff is courteous 1 
but this movie is not funny considering the ridiculousness of it 0 
warning stay away 0 
i tried talking real loud but shouting on the telephone gets old and i was still told it wasnt great 0 
my drink was never empty and he made some really great menu suggestions 1 
the waitresses are very friendly 1 
restored my phone to like new performance 1 
timely shipment and quality product 1 
food was so gooodd 1 
i left the theater with a lilt in my step joy in my heart and hope for the human race 1 
i was mortified 0 
this is so embarassing and also my ears hurt if i try to push the ear plug into my ear 0 
great place to relax and have an awesome burger and beer 1 
the characters are interesting even if a bit predictable 1 
dont bother coming here 0 
everything stinks 0 
macbeth jason connery moved me to tears with his final monolog out brief candle outhe gave the sphere of moral decay and dark forces a human face which makes it the more interesting 1 
soggy and not good 0 
as for the service im a fan because its quick and youre being served by some nice folks 1 
this fixes all the problems 1 
last night was my second time dining here and i was so happy i decided to go back 1 
both of the egg rolls were fantastic 1 
unfortunately it did not work 0 
this place is way too overpriced for mediocre food 0 
this movie is excellentangel is beautiful and scamp is adorablehis little yelps when hes scaredand the funniest parts are whenscamp is caught under the curtain and when angel and scamp are singing ive never had this feeling beforei totally recommend this movieits coming out on special edition on june 20the cover has scamp on a garbage can and angel underneath the lid 1 
it is a really good show to watch 1 
you truly take this journey through the eyes and soul of a child 1 
the film is way too long 0 
the block was amazing 1 
i really loved the story line and the poler bear was kinda cutebut if anyone has a question about fort steele just ask away 1 
the football scenes at the end were perplexing 0 
the acting by the whole cast could be put on a scale and balanced perfectly between overacting and underacting 0 
if you are razr owneryou must have this 1 
recommend with confidence 1 
in short dont bother with this movie 0 
it was a great phone 1 
its been my choice headset for yearsgreat sound good volume good noise cancellation 1 
i had to wait over 30 minutes to get my drink and longer to get 2 arepas 0 
fantastic buy and will get again for whatever my next phone is 1 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
the sergeant pepper beef sandwich with auju sauce is an excellent sandwich as well 1 
i love this cable it allows me to connect any miniusb device to my pc 1 
i must say i have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again 1 
oh this is such a thing of beauty this restaurant 1 
the acting was decidely wooden though no worse than a period universal b movie 0 
all in all its an insult to ones intelligence and a huge waste of money 0 
the worst one of the series 0 
this is high adventure at its best 1 
great place fo take out or eat in 1 
it was delicious 1 
in the summer you can dine in a charming outdoor patio so very delightful 1 
the dialogue is composed of things that make little sense 0 
the reception has been generally good 1 
great phone 1 
i had absolutely no problem with this headset linking to my 8530 blackberry curve 1 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
the film has great actors a master director a significant themeat least a wouldbe significant theme undertone of fifties existential worldweariness aerial scenes that ought to have thrilled both senses and imagination and characters about which one might deeply care 1 
comfortable nice range good battery life 1 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
also if your phone is dropped this case is not going to save it specially when dropped face down 0 
i would have casted her in that role after ready the script 1 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
it fits so securely that the ear hook does not even need to be used and the sound is better directed through your ear canal 1 
but the movie makes a lot of serious mistakes 0 
i love this cable it allows me to connect any miniusb device to my pc 1 
i give wirefly 1 stari will contact cingularatt and inform them of this practice 0 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
this is infuriating 0 
perabo has a nice energy level and is obviously very comfortable in front of a camera 1 
best of luck to the rude and noncustomer service focused new management 0 
i struggle to find anything bad to say about it 1 
we received a white colored battery that goes dead after a couple hoursthe original used to last a week but still lasts longer than thereplacement 0 
damian is so talented and versatile in so many ways of writing and portraying different characters on screen 1 
this case seems well made 1 
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
this movie suffered because of the writing it needed more suspense 0 
you learn a lot about the real inside emotions of people in this movie and a lot about the movie business itself 1 
ive never been more insulted or felt disrespected 0 
so just beware 0 
but other than that the movie seemed to drag and the heroes didnt really work for their freedom 0 
appetite instantly gone 0 
very serious spoilers this movie was a huge disappointment 0 
one of the worst shows of all time 0 
absolutely great 1 
voice quality signal strength dropped calls 0 
if good intentions made a film great then this film might be one of the greatest films ever made 1 
heres where the movie really pied me off 0 
i wasted my little money with this earpiece 0 
a cheap and cheerless heist movie with poor characterisation lots of underbite style stoic emoting think chow yun fat in a better tomorrow and some cheesy clichés thrown into an abandoned factory ready for a few poorly executed flying judo rolls a la john woo 0 
there was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth but it didnt really work into the rest of the plot 0 
the fries were great too 1 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
i can take a little bad service but the food sucks 0 
when a song could explain the emotions of the subjects better such as when jay adams unfortunate life was a subject of talk the song old man by neil young was played which evokes many emotions 1 
none of it works just dont buy it 0 
after my phone got to be about a year old its been slowly breaking despite much care on my part 0 
nobody identifies with these characters because theyre all cardboard cutouts and stereotypes or predictably reversestereotypes 0 
i am very impressed with the job that motorola did on the sturdiness of this phone 1 
the most annoying thing about cover girl is the way in which rita hayworth is put up on a pedestal 0 
i asked multiple times for the wine list and after some time of being ignored i went to the hostess and got one myself 0 
i felt asleep the first time i watched it so i can recommend it for insomniacs 0 
it features an outlandish array of memorable psychotic but lovable nuts 1 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
they really want to make your experience a good one 1 
if there is a wind it is completely useless 0 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
all in all a great disappointment 0 
i checked everywhere and there is no feature for it which is really disappointing 0 
on three different occasions i asked for well done or medium well and all three times i got the bloodiest piece of meat on my plate 0 
it is indescribably the most annoying and idiotic show i have ever seen 0 
works well 1 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
unless youre just out to visually collect all extant films of austens work you can skip this one 0 
dessert panna cotta was amazing 1 
one nice thing was that they added gratuity on the bill since our party was larger than 6 or 8 and they didnt expect more tip than that 1 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
instead we got a bore fest about a whiny spoiled brat babysitting 0 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
everything was good and tasty 1 
for people who are first timers in film making i think they did an excellent job 1 
its one of the most boring horror movies from the 90s mainly because it starts slow and centers in a boring atmosphere 0 
its a sad movie but very good 1 
there was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth but it didnt really work into the rest of the plot 0 
what possesed me to get this junk i have no idea 0 
excellent cast story line performances 1 
really good product 1 
the service was terrible though 0 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
the warm beer didnt help 0 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
i only hear garbage for audio 0 
this phone might well be the worst ive ever had in any brand 0 
overall i was not impressed and would not go back 0 
i didnt know pulled pork could be soooo delicious 1 
the fish is badly made and some of its underwater shots are repeated a thousand times in the film 0 
conclusion very filling meals 1 
i received my supposedly new motorola 375 and apparently there was not a match between the phone and the charger 0 
this is just a great movie 1 
the film is way too long 0 
the selection on the menu was great and so were the prices 1 
the chains which im no fan of beat this place easily 0 
best fish ive ever had in my life 1 
now this is a movie i really dislike 0 
does not work 0 
initially the local sites in the film which was filmed here in buffalo intrigued me 1 
by this time our side of the restaurant was almost empty so there was no excuse 0 
this movie is a good and humorous comment on life in 2006 1 
however after seeing the short again after about 25 years i was amazed at how timeless the film actually is 1 
if you dont find it too bad as again the unit comes with one earpad onlyi would not recommend this to anyone 0 
the battery works great 1 
im surprised this is a good quality car charger and theres not much reviews about it 1 
the buttons for on and off are bad 0 
the secondary plot line is incomprehensible and its relation to the primary plot line is mystifying 0 
ordered an appetizer and took 40 minutes and then the pizza another 10 minutes 0 
it was equally awful 0 
the phone takes forever to charge like 2 to 5 hours literally 0 
dont make the same mistake that i did and please dont buy this phone 0 
in fact im going to round up to 4 stars just because she was so awesome 1 
this little device has transformed my organizational capability and made my life a whole lot easier 1 
now the burgers arent as good the pizza which used to be amazing is doughy and flavorless 0 
service is friendly and inviting 1 
when achille and philippa beautifully sing a duet from don giovanni that perfectly describes their situation in the movie you appreciate the subtle layers of this excellent film 1 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
that one didnt work either 0 
keep up the good work amazon 1 
saw the movie today and thought it was a good effort good messages for kids 1 
id love to go back 1 
steamboat willie is an amazingly important film to our cinema history 1 
warning do not buy 0 
the waitresses are very friendly 1 
very very disappointed ordered the 35 big bay plater 0 
i found this place by accident and i could not be happier 1 
theres also enough hypocrisy in this film to make me vomit 0 
would come back again if i had a sushi craving while in vegas 1 
tied to charger for conversations lasting more than 45 minutesmajor problems 0 
the acting is beyond abysmal 0 
terrible my car will not accept this cassette 0 
great price too 1 
there is no plot here to keep you going in the first place 0 
avoid this film at all costs 0 
about half way through this film i started to dislike it 0 
i loved their mussels cooked in this wine reduction the duck was tender and their potato dishes were delicious 1 
like the other reviewer said you couldnt pay me to eat at this place again 0 
my girlfriends veal was very bad 0 
painful on the ear 0 
this battery is an excellent bargain 1 
bad characters bad story and bad acting 0 
i was deeply impressed with the character he played 1 
the screen does get smudged easily because it touches your ear and face 0 
i ended up sliding it on the edge of my pants or back pockets instead 1 
this film has no redeeming features 0 
audio quality is poor very poor 0 
how can that bethe audio quality is poor 0 
for a product that costs as much as this one does i expect it to work far better and with greater ease than this thing does 0 
it also had a new problem 0 
the service was outshining i definitely recommend the halibut 1 
he was terrible 0 
nothing short of magnificent photographycinematography in this film 1 
cooked to perfection and the service was impeccable 1 
couldnt use the unit with sunglasses not good in texas 0 
excellent dualpurpose headset 1 
my friend loved the salmon tartar 1 
four stars for the food the guy in the blue shirt for his great vibe still letting us in to eat 1 
the food amazing 1 
its reception is very very poor 0 
it was a pale color instead of nice and char and has no flavor 0 
i got home to see the driest damn wings ever 0 
the potato chip order was sad i could probably count how many chips were in that box and it was probably around 12 0 
you get extra minutes so that you can carry out the call and not get cut off 1 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
this movie creates its own universe and is fascinating in every way 1 
so flavorful and has just the perfect amount of heat 1 
total brunch fail 0 
i had a seriously solid breakfast here 1 
then a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use 0 
went for lunch service was slow 0 
the staff are also very friendly and efficient 1 
overall a delight 1 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
and the beans and rice were mediocre at best 0 
the lead man is charismafree 0 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
all in all i give this one a resounding 9 out of 10 1 
her lines seem to have been written by a fifteen year old though they are trying oh so so hard to sound like how a fifteen year old would really um you know well talk 0 
an absolute must visit 1 
there is no plot here to keep you going in the first place 0 
i even fully charged it before i went to bed and turned off blue tooth and wifi and noticed that it only had 20 left in the morning 0 
its one of the movies i need to see whenever it comes on tvnever mind the fact that i already have it memorized 1 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
not a good bargain 0 
bt50 battery junk 0 
poor reliability 0 
other than that the leather is nice and soft the fit is very tight the cut out for the face is a good shape 1 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
they really want to make your experience a good one 1 
the fries were not hot and neither was my burger 0 
youll love it 1 
cooked to perfection and the service was impeccable 1 
not easy to watch 0 
there is a totally unnecessary trainroller coaster scene 0 
i love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it 1 
i could not understand what kind of idiot would produce this mess in the first place not to mention several season 0 
ive owned this phone for 7 months now and can say that its the best mobile phone ive had 1 
o my gosh the best phone i have ever had 1 
ill even say it again  this is torture 0 
their steaks are 100 recommended 1 
i love the camera its really pretty good quality 1 
he also came back to check on us regularly excellent service 1 
the food was delicious our bartender was attentive and personable and we got a great deal 1 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic 1 
plus it was wellpaced and suited its relatively short run time 1 
what did bother me was the slow service 0 
we got sitting fairly fast but ended up waiting 40 minutes just to place our order another 30 minutes before the food arrived 0 
dont make the same mistake that i did and please dont buy this phone 0 
nice quality build unlike some cheap s out there 1 
someone shouldve invented this sooner 1 
the movie lacks visual interest drama expression of feeling and celebration of the very patriotism that underlines the narrative 0 
i really recommend this faceplates since it looks very nice elegant and cool 1 
he owns the film just as spacek owned coal miners daughter and quaid owned great balls of fire 1 
there is really nothing for me at postinos hope your experience is better 0 
sound quality on both end is excellent i use headset to call my wife and ask my wife to use headset to call me 2 1 
by far the best cheesecurds we have ever had 1 
he owns the film just as spacek owned coal miners daughter and quaid owned great balls of fire 1 
ambience is perfect 1 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
he came running after us when he realized my husband had left his sunglasses on the table 1 
paolo sorrentino has written a wonderful story about loneliness and tony has built one of the most unforgettable characters seen in movies in recent years 1 
everything about it is fine and reasonable for the price ie 1 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
the atmosphere was great with a lovely duo of violinists playing songs we requested 1 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
bad day or not i have a very low tolerance for rude customer service people it is your job to be nice and polite wash dishes otherwise 0 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
the phone crashed completely and now i have to get it replaced 0 
i asked multiple times for the wine list and after some time of being ignored i went to the hostess and got one myself 0 
10 out of 10 stars 1 
a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it 1 
it is a true classic 1 
best breakfast buffet 1 
i was mortified 0 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
if you hate earbugs avoid this phone by all means 0 
some applause should be given to the prelude however 1 
i can take a little bad service but the food sucks 0 
the service here leaves a lot to be desired 0 
i did not expect this to be so good 1 
it features an outlandish array of memorable psychotic but lovable nuts 1 
well im satisfied 1 
and the red curry had so much bamboo shoots and wasnt very tasty to me 0 
what should have been a hilarious yummy christmas eve dinner to remember was the biggest fail of the entire trip for us 0 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
also the fries are without a doubt the worst fries ive ever had 0 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
i wont spoil it but the ending in pretty amazing 1 
the burrittos blah 0 
all in all its an insult to ones intelligence and a huge waste of money 0 
i heart this place 1 
later i found myself lost in the power of the film 1 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
of course the footage from the 70s was grainy but that only enhanced the film 1 
the construction of the headsets is poor 0 
it is zillion times away from reality 0 
but whatever it was that cost them so much it didnt translate to quality thats for sure 0 
the opening sequence of this gem is a classic and the cat n mouse games that follow are a delight to watch 1 
i rather enjoyed it 1 
i was deeply impressed with the character he played 1 
ive owned this phone for 7 months now and can say that its the best mobile phone ive had 1 
trouble is the writing and directing make it impossible to establish those things that make a movie watchable like character story theme and so on 0 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
doesnt last long 0 
o my gosh the best phone i have ever had 1 
waste of money 0 
on three different occasions i asked for well done or medium well and all three times i got the bloodiest piece of meat on my plate 0 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
a great way to finish a great 1 
while you dont yet hear mickey speak there are tons of sound effects and music throughout the filmsomething we take for granted now but which was a huge crowd pleaser in 1928 1 
as many people complained i found this headsets microphone was very weak 0 
i will continue to come here on ladies night andddd date night highly recommend this place to anyone who is in the area 1 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
2 times very bad customer service 0 
bad characters bad story and bad acting 0 
the movie was so boring that i sometimes found myself occupied peaking in the paper instead of watching never happened during a columbo movie before 0 
excellent sound quality 1 
the warm beer didnt help 0 
i think this restaurant suffers from not trying hard enough 0 
it holds a charge for a long time is reasonably comfortable under longwearing conditions and the quality of sound is tremendous 1 
the cinematography is simply stunning to say the least and the fx are nothing if not stateoftheart 1 
terrible service 0 
none of the new ones have ever quite worked properly 0 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
i never come again 0 
i could care less the interior is just beautiful 1 
poor reliability 0 
its very slow 0 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
it also had a new problem 0 
im not eating here 0 
this product had a strong rubberpetroleum smell that was unbearable after a while and caused me to return it 0 
save your money ive had this item for 11 months now 0 
this place is like chipotle but better 1 
freezes frequently4 0 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
its this pandering to the audience that sabotages most of his films 0 
i wasted my little money with this earpiece 0 
i really hope the team behind this movie makes more movies and that they will continue to do so in their own some kinda weird style 1 
still waiting im sure this item would work well if i ever recieve it 0 
this film has no redeeming features 0 
the most annoying thing about cover girl is the way in which rita hayworth is put up on a pedestal 0 
great phone 1 
and dont even get me started on the jerky camerawork 0 
this is a masterful piece of filmmaking with many themes simmering and occasionally boiling over in this warts and all study of the poets bohemian selfindulgent wartime years that span the aerial bombardments of london and the outward tranquillity of a welsh coastal retreat the borderlines between friendship lust and love dedication to art and experience versus practical concerns jealousy rivalry cowardice and egotism versus heroism and selfsacrifice and more 1 
we waited for thirty minutes to be seated although there were 8 vacant tables and we were the only folks waiting 0 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
walked in and the place smelled like an old grease trap and only 2 others there eating 0 
i love lane but ive never seen her in a movie this lousy 0 
id rather eat airline food seriously 0 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
see it 1 
i saw this film over christmas and what a great film it was 1 
awsome device works great 1 
my 5year old nokia 2160 from tracfone holds the charge a lot better than this 0 
great phone 1 
the cocktails are all handmade and delicious 1 
i can assure you that you wont be disappointed 1 
awsome device works great 1 
that was nice 1 
our server was super nice and checked on us many times 1 
i have been to very few places to eat that under no circumstances would i ever return to and this tops the list 0 
kind of hard to mess up a steak but they did 0 
will not be back 0 
so badwellits just bad 0 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
a standout scene 1 
clear crisp sound 1 
all in all a great disappointment 0 
i know that sounds funny but to me it seemed like sketchy technology that wouldnt work wellwell this one works great 1 
this greedy corporation will never see another dime from me 0 
honeslty it didnt taste that fresh 0 
waited 2 hours never got either of our pizzas as many other around us who came in later did 0 
i think i was one of the people who found this another one of roths pearls 1 
its just painful 0 
what i really like there is the crepe station 1 
very disappointed in accessoryone 0 
everything about it is fine and reasonable for the price ie 1 
the food sucked which we expected but it sucked more than we could have imagined 0 
wont ever go here again 0 
the shipping time was also very quick 1 
the greek dressing was very creamy and flavorful 1 
i really recommend this faceplates since it looks very nice elegant and cool 1 
what the hell kind of crap is that 0 
it was a long time that i didnt see a so charismatic actor on screen 1 
waste of 13 bucks 0 
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1 
freezes frequently4 0 
if you love authentic mexican food and want a whole bunch of interesting yet delicious meats to choose from you need to try this place 1 
i love the camera its really pretty good quality 1 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
this place lacked style 0 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
id advise anyone to go and see it 1 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
i want to first say our server was great and we had perfect service 1 
i totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is 1 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
walked in and the place smelled like an old grease trap and only 2 others there eating 0 
sweetest phone 1 
the film succeeds despite or perhaps because of an obviously meagre budget 1 
the pizza selections are good 1 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
i wear glasses and it fits fine with them 1 
you share general loewenhielms exquisite joy in his partaking of the cailles en sarcophage even though you are just watching a movie but you do wish for just a small sample to savor 1 
attempting artiness with black white and clever camera angles the movie disappointed became even more ridiculous as the acting was poor and the plot and lines almost nonexistent 0 
of course the footage from the 70s was grainy but that only enhanced the film 1 
its just lame 0 
the cast is good 1 
duris has a wholesome appearance and gives a fine performance 1 
thus far have only visited twice and the food was absolutely delicious each time 1 
just really good so far probably the best bt headset i have ever had 1 
conclusion i loved it 1 
spend your money elsewhere 0 
worst customer service ever 0 
internet is excrutiatingly slow 0 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
the biggest complaint i have is the battery drains superfast 0 
the waiter wasnt helpful or friendly and rarely checked on us 0 
i hope this place sticks around 1 
sending it back 0 
star trek v the final frontier is the worst in the series 0 
i had heard good things about this place but it exceeding every hope i could have dreamed of 1 
much more interesting more action more suspense and less of the unneeded controversy 1 
all in all i give this one a resounding 9 out of 10 1 
this is an outstanding little restaurant with some of the best food i have ever tasted 1 
i purcashed this for the car charger and it does not work 0 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
the structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema 1 
linked to my phone without effort 1 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
extremely tasty 1 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
the best example of how dumb the writing is when its established that you can turn the zombiestudents back into humans by removing a necklace containing a piece of the meteorite 0 
i dont know what kind it is but they have the best iced tea 1 
so anyone near you will hear part of your conversation 0 
my first visit to hiro was a delight 1 
excellent starter wireless headset 0 
food was good service was good prices were good 1 
the whole experience was underwhelming and i think well just go to ninja sushi next time 0 
this is a great deal 1 
the bathroom is just next door and very nice 1 
the acting is terrible and the writing is worse 0 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
point your finger at any item on the menu order it and you wont be disappointed 1 
this is a great deal 1 
eclectic selection 1 
the food was delicious our bartender was attentive and personable and we got a great deal 1 
but then they came back cold 0 
item arrived quickly and works great with my metro pcs samsung schr450 slider phone and sony premium sound in ear plugs 1 
this is infuriating 0 
the chefs were friendly and did a good job 1 
unfortunately inexperience of direction meant that scene after scene passed with little in the way of dramatic tension or conflict 0 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
the service here leaves a lot to be desired 0 
this item is fantastic and works perfectly 1 
think it over when you plan to own this onethis sure is the last moto phone for me 0 
i checked out this place a couple years ago and was not impressed 0 
its pretty easy 1 
its just painful 0 
our server was very nice and even though he looked a little overwhelmed with all of our needs he stayed professional and friendly until the end 1 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
and the sound quality is great 1 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
works like a charm it work the same as the one i got with the phone 1 
i had absolutely no problem with this headset linking to my 8530 blackberry curve 1 
having trouble with volume 0 
the service was great even the manager came and helped with our table 1 
it was packed 0 
just whatever you do avoid groove as its the antithesis of all that is good about human traffic 0 
all in all its an insult to ones intelligence and a huge waste of money 0 
one more thing i can tolerate political incorrectness very well im all for artistic freedom and suspension of disbelief but the slavic female character was just too much 0 
highly recommended 1 
ive had better not only from dedicated boba tea spots but even from jenni pho 0 
lifetime does not air it enough so if anyone knows what store sells it let me know because this is a musthave 1 
oh this is such a thing of beauty this restaurant 1 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
but now that it is out of warranty the same problems reoccurebottom line put your money somewhere else cingular will not support it 0 
very prompt service 1 
the headset fulfills my requirements so i am happy with my purchase 1 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
headset works great was packaged nicely to avoid any damage 1 
this place deserves no stars 0 
i had the chicken pho and it tasted very bland 0 
the entire audience applauded at the conclusion of the film 1 
not good by any stretch of the imagination 0 
what makes this story different are the terrific production values faultless photography composition and editing the terrific casting the underappreciated brian keith playing a bully teddy and vivid history 1 
the servers are not pleasant to deal with and they dont always honor pizza hut coupons 0 
works as described 1 
its still wild stuff though and is highly recommended to fans of giallo cinema 1 
the igo chargers and tips are really great 1 
her lines seem to have been written by a fifteen year old though they are trying oh so so hard to sound like how a fifteen year old would really um you know well talk 0 
so absolutley fantastic 1 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
it is a joy to use 1 
graphics is far from the best part of the game 0 
it was pretty gross 0 
its worth driving up from tucson 1 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
great pocket pc phone combination 1 
go rent it 1 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
the staff is great the food is delish and they have an incredible beer selection 1 
great product 1 
this is a stunning movie 1 
have been going since 2007 and every meal has been awesome 1 
after i pulled up my car i waited for another 15 minutes before being acknowledged 0 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
black water is a thriller that manages to completely transcend its limitations its an indie flick by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience 1 
when i saw it in the theater i thought i was going to be sick 0 
incredible 1 
i will continue to come here on ladies night andddd date night highly recommend this place to anyone who is in the area 1 
i never come again 0 
it felt like a very gripping intelligent stage play but without the overly theatrical feeling one actually gets from watching people on a stage which plays on everyones terror of a white lie escalating to monstrous consequences 1 
the kids are very cool too 1 
so far so good 1 
it was packed 0 
i wish i could return the unit and get back my money 0 
you learn a lot about the real inside emotions of people in this movie and a lot about the movie business itself 1 
overall i like this place a lot 1 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
if you have several dozen or several hundred contacts then imagine the fun of sending each of them one by one 0 
great software for motorolas 1 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
i have read others reviews here but i havent had any problem with it 1 
join the club and get awesome offers via email 1 
horrible dont waste your time and money 0 
great product 1 
the basic premise is wasted since it is sidelined by the inexplicable focus on the documentary crew 0 
well never go again 0 
i really recommend this faceplates since it looks very nice elegant and cool 1 
lange had become a great actress 1 
is it possible for a movie to get any worse than this 0 
the company shipped my product very promptly and it works well 1 
this was a poor remake of my best friends wedding 0 
ive only had my bluetooth for a few weeks but i really like it 1 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
my salad had a bland vinegrette on the baby greens and hearts of palm 0 
level 5 spicy was perfect where spice didnt overwhelm the soup 1 
unfortunately it was not good 0 
it was absolutely amazing 1 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
a cheap and cheerless heist movie with poor characterisation lots of underbite style stoic emoting think chow yun fat in a better tomorrow and some cheesy clichés thrown into an abandoned factory ready for a few poorly executed flying judo rolls a la john woo 0 
however after seeing the short again after about 25 years i was amazed at how timeless the film actually is 1 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
i have been to very few places to eat that under no circumstances would i ever return to and this tops the list 0 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
great earpiece 1 
but kevin spacey is an excellent verbal tsunami as buddy ackerman  and totally believable because he is a great actor 1 
in the summer you can dine in a charming outdoor patio so very delightful 1 
so dont go there if you are looking for good food 0 
none of it works just dont buy it 0 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
ive never been treated so bad 0 
the food wasnt good 0 
the cashier had no care what so ever on what i had to say it still ended up being wayyy overpriced 0 
i cannot believe that the actors agreed to do this film 0 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
after arguing with verizon regarding the dropped calls we returned the phones after two days 0 
for the price on amazon it is an excellent product which i would highly recommend 1 
then i watched it again two sundays ago march 20th 2005 and i began to really enjoy it and this time i taped the entire thing 1 
if you are razr owneryou must have this 1 
the cinematographyif it can be called thatsucked 0 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
if you stay in vegas you must get breakfast here at least once 1 
i really loved the story line and the poler bear was kinda cutebut if anyone has a question about fort steele just ask away 1 
it also took her forever to bring us the check when we asked for it 0 
the food was outstanding and the prices were very reasonable 1 
this is by far the worst purchase ive made on amazon 0 
item does not match picture 0 
service stinks here 0 
they refuse to refund or replace 0 
the acting is like watching wooden puppets moving around and reading from a book thats how bad it is 0 
so flavorful and has just the perfect amount of heat 1 
eew this location needs a complete overhaul 0 
the story is beyond stupid 0 
i was very pleased to see that i could replace my well travled swivel holster for my blackberry flip 1 
babie bop is very cute 1 
the biggest complaint i have is the battery drains superfast 0 
both rickman and stowe play their roles to the hilt in this tale of a childrens book writer who maybe has written a subversive tract 1 
the delivery was on time 1 
i dont think there are any redeeming qualities in this remake 0 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
i ordered albondigas soup which was just warm and tasted like tomato soup with frozen meatballs 0 
best tacos in town by far 1 
but when someone strives for greatness and poetry but delivers a muddled and often ridiculous story a bunch of disparate scenes pretentious dialogue then you get the worst kind of a movie that some other reviewer very accurately defined as pretentious crap 0 
my boyfriend tried the mediterranean chicken salad and fell in love 1 
great phone 1 
i guess i should have known that this place would suck because it is inside of the excalibur but i didnt use my common sense 0 
i gave it 5 stars because of the sound quality 1 
its pretty easy 1 
i felt as though her going to ireland did absolutely nothing whatsoever 0 
i wasted my little money with this earpiece 0 
i am far from a sushi connoisseur but i can definitely tell the difference between good food and bad food and this was certainly bad food 0 
theres also enough hypocrisy in this film to make me vomit 0 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
the lighting is awful 0 
there is nothing privileged about workingeating there 0 
i consider this theft 0 
feelings thoughtsgabriels discomfort during the danceall these intangibles leap to life and come within the viewers grasp in hustons portrayal 1 
its so bad its actually worth seeing just for that reason 0 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
thank you for such great service 1 
definitely worth checking out 1 
the seller is very understanding and patient i would definitely buy from them again 1 
never heard of any of them except cole who was totally unbelievable in the part 0 
the place was fairly clean but the food simply wasnt worth it 0 
mic doesnt work 0 
the best example of how dumb the writing is when its established that you can turn the zombiestudents back into humans by removing a necklace containing a piece of the meteorite 0 
good product good seller 1 
the range is very decent ive been able to roam around my house with the phone in the living room with no receptionsound quality issues 1 
if there were zero stars i would give it zero stars 0 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
very disappointed 0 
im pleased 1 
prosgood camera very nice pictures also has cool styles like black and white and more 1 
this place is way too overpriced for mediocre food 0 
very very sad 0 
i paid too much 0 
after a year the battery went completely dead on my headset 0 
overall a great experience 1 
dont miss it 1 
the sweet potato tots were good but the onion rings were perfection or as close as i have had 1 
recommend with confidence 1 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
the reception has been generally good 1 
much more interesting more action more suspense and less of the unneeded controversy 1 
this allows the possibility of double booking for the same date and time after the first 0 
overall i wasnt very impressed with noca 0 
trouble is the writing and directing make it impossible to establish those things that make a movie watchable like character story theme and so on 0 
this film tries to be a serious and sophisticated thrillerhorror flick and it fails miserably 0 
reversible plug works great 1 
great headset very impressed h500 1 
hated it 0 
its pretty surprising that this wonderful film was made in 1949 as hollywood generally had its collective heads in the sand concerning black and white issues at that time 1 
itll be a regular stop on my trips to phoenix 1 
i enjoyed it 1 
overall i was not impressed and would not go back 0 
comes with a strong light that you can use to light up your camera shots and even flash sos signals seriously 1 
im really disappointed all i have now is a charger that doesnt work 0 
i have purchased these for both family and friends and all enjoy their clarity and ease of use 1 
everything about this film is simply incredible 1 
i immediately said i wanted to talk to the manager but i did not want to talk to the guy who was doing shots of fireball behind the bar 0 
point your finger at any item on the menu order it and you wont be disappointed 1 
voice quality signal strength dropped calls 0 
ive missed numerous calls because of this reason 0 
this game rocks 1 
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
almost all of the songs in cover girl are oldfashioned and not very tuneful 0 
im not impressed with the concept or the food 0 
good product good seller 1 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
the acting is like watching wooden puppets moving around and reading from a book thats how bad it is 0 
it was a bit too sweet not really spicy enough and lacked flavor 0 
actually the graphics were good at the time 1 
yeah the movie pretty much sucked 0 
the potatoes were great and so was the biscuit 1 
their onscreen chemistry critical to the entire film is genuine 1 
the headsets are easy to use and everyone loves them 1 
no one at the table thought the food was above average or worth the wait that we had for it 0 
also the area where my unit broke im not too fond of the magnetic strap 0 
if there were zero stars i would give it zero stars 0 
makes it easier to keep up with my bluetooth when im not wearing it 0 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
we enjoy their pizza and brunch 1 
i found the product to be easy to set up and use 1 
does not work 0 
i think that it is a must see older john wayne film 1 
ive had this for nearly 2 years and it has worked great for me 1 
i would avoid this place if you are staying in the mirage 0 
horrible phone 0 
the noise shield is incrediable 1 
im terribly disappointed that this film would receive so many awards and accolades especially when there are far more deserving works of film out there 0 
dont buy this product it fails 0 
both do good jobs and are quite amusing 1 
if you look for authentic thai food go else where 0 
i highly recommend this device to everyone 1 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
great for ipods too 1 
if you are looking for a good quality motorola headset keep looking this isnt it 0 
some highlights great quality nigiri here 1 
couldnt use the unit with sunglasses not good in texas 0 
worthless product 0 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
maybe its just their vegetarian fare but ive been twice and i thought it was average at best 0 
very very sad 0 
its just lame 0 
i contacted the company and they told me that although the unit was still under warranty if i couldnt produce my receipt i was out of luck 0 
everything about it is just bad 0 
needless to say i wont be going back anytime soon 0 
great pork sandwich 1 
this place is disgusting 0 
but whatever it was that cost them so much it didnt translate to quality thats for sure 0 
and i really did find them funny 1 
but kevin spacey is an excellent verbal tsunami as buddy ackerman  and totally believable because he is a great actor 1 
i was disgusted because i was pretty sure that was human hair 0 
he also came back to check on us regularly excellent service 1 
one character is totally annoying with a voice that gives me the feeling of fingernails on a chalkboard 0 
the result is a powerhouse achievement made more timely now perhaps because of our cultures disturbing fascination with celebrity and its distorted interpretations of fame 1 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
the pleather case doesnt fit 0 
the roast beef sandwich tasted really good 1 
the food was excellent and service was very good 1 
i will continue to come here on ladies night andddd date night highly recommend this place to anyone who is in the area 1 
kind of flops around 0 
its very slow 0 
this place deserves no stars 0 
i think this restaurant suffers from not trying hard enough 0 
absolutely great 1 
this movie is so awesome 1 
very prompt service 1 
the biggest complaint i have is the battery drains superfast 0 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
i gave it 5 stars then and im giving it 5 stars now 1 
and finally after all that we get to an ending that wouldve been great had it been handled by competent people and not jerry falwell 0 
it was a very superficial movie and it gave me the feeling that i was watching play rather than a film 0 
all the bread is made inhouse 1 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
i purcashed this for the car charger and it does not work 0 
it has kept up very well 1 
thats how id describe this painfully dreary timewaster of a film 0 
my brother in law who works at the mall ate here same day and guess what he was sick all night too 0 
but she is still a bad actress repeating her robotic face moves in each of her pictures 0 
if you look for authentic thai food go else where 0 
great service and food 1 
if you want healthy authentic or ethic food try this place 1 
very disappointed 0 
nice ambiance 1 
i cant see how this movie can be an inspiration to anyone to come out or overcome fear and rejection 0 
it works 1 
the only thing worse than taylors acting was stanwycks singing 0 
but the duet between the astronaut and his doctor at the beginning of the movie is a perfect exchange if one considers that this movie was made well into the cold war and the astronauts biggest fear is that he has crashed in the ussr 1 
it looks very nice 1 
i love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it 1 
they refuse to refund or replace 0 
i checked everywhere and there is no feature for it which is really disappointing 0 
total letdown i would much rather just go to the camelback flower shop and cartel coffee 0 
the waitress and manager are so friendly 1 
bela lugosi was totally extraneous intoning odd lines 0 
great brunch spot 1 
it is perfect for a sitdown family meal or get together with a few friends 1 
it is an insane game 1 
their rotating beers on tap is also a highlight of this place 1 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
it is a very well acted and done tv movie 1 
waitress was good though 1 
very bad performance plays angela bennett a computer expert who is at home all the time 0 
yes its that bad 0 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
you never know if you pushed it hard enough or the right number of times for the function you want or not 0 
it failed to convey the broad sweep of landscapes that were a great part of the original 0 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
ive seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie 0 
i found this move beautiful enjoyable and uplifting 1 
it is so small and you dont even realize that it is there after a while of getting used to it 1 
i love the look and feel of samsung flipphones 1 
save your money ive had this item for 11 months now 0 
so far so good 1 
the sweet potato fries were very good and seasoned well 1 
the construction of the headsets is poor 0 
i love this bluetooth 1 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
the potatoes were like rubber and you could tell they had been made up ahead of time being kept under a warmer 0 
i love this place 1 
it definitely was not as good as my s11 1 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
what should have been a hilarious yummy christmas eve dinner to remember was the biggest fail of the entire trip for us 0 
star trek v the final frontier is the worst in the series 0 
it is light easy to use and has very clear reception and transmission 1 
restaurant is always full but never a wait 1 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
victor mclaglen was even bad and brian donlevy was almost unrecognizable 0 
feelings thoughtsgabriels discomfort during the danceall these intangibles leap to life and come within the viewers grasp in hustons portrayal 1 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
ive never been more insulted or felt disrespected 0 
i have seen many movies starring jaclyn smith but my god this was one of her best though it came out 12 years ago 1 
my boyfriend tried the mediterranean chicken salad and fell in love 1 
disapointing results 0 
i know this is not like the other restaurants at all something is very off here 0 
think it over when you plan to own this onethis sure is the last moto phone for me 0 
unfortunately this is a bad movie that is just plain bad 0 
only like 3 or 4 buildings used a couple of locations maybe poor hummh 0 
i knew when i saw the film that more great things were to come from this gifted actor 1 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
spend your money elsewhere 0 
not worth it 0 
customer service was terrible 0 
i cant wait to go back 1 
a disappointment 0 
if you love authentic mexican food and want a whole bunch of interesting yet delicious meats to choose from you need to try this place 1 
i can say that the desserts were yummy 1 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
black water is a thriller that manages to completely transcend its limitations its an indie flick by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience 1 
great audio 1 
we will not be coming back 0 
they never brought a salad we asked for 0 
horrible dont waste your time and money 0 
having to humour him just to get by and get through the day was so apt 1 
i have purchased these for both family and friends and all enjoy their clarity and ease of use 1 
i am going to have to be the first to negatively review this product 0 
the warmth it generates is in contrast to its austere backdrop 1 
the acting is terrible and the writing is worse 0 
his use of the colours of the french flag in the three films was nothing short of incredible every shot every scene was like a work of art 1 
the real killer is the volume and of course it breaking 0 
none of the new ones have ever quite worked properly 0 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
if good intentions made a film great then this film might be one of the greatest films ever made 1 
the bipolarity of the ruthless thug one minute a ruthless killer the next minute a luvs diaper commercial is completely unconvincing 0 
im translating movies for a living and this is the first movie in my 5year working experience that i found offensive to my intelligence 0 
meredith m was better than all right 1 
my sashimi was poor quality being soggy and tasteless 0 
it is wonderful and inspiring to watch and i hope that it gets released again on to video or dvd 1 
easy to pair with my samsung cell 1 
food is way overpriced and portions are fucking small 0 
his costars dont fare much better with people like morgan freeman jonah hill and ed helms just wasted 0 
it lasts less than 3o minutes if i actually try to use the phonemy wife has the same phone with the same problem 0 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
worked very well paired with a treo 700w and as a skype headset on my pc using a usb bluetooth transceiver 1 
for people who are first timers in film making i think they did an excellent job 1 
unfortunately it will not recharge my iphone 4s despite connecting it from multiple power sources imac external battery wall outlet etc 0 
im really disappointed all i have now is a charger that doesnt work 0 
the cocktails are all handmade and delicious 1 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
the bt headset was such a disapoinment 0 
did not like at all 0 
the veggitarian platter is out of this world 1 
highly unrecommended 0 
then our food came out disappointment ensued 0 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
the flat reenactments dont hold your attention because they are emotionally adrift and stagy 0 
im happy about this purchase good quality and low price 1 
i think i was one of the people who found this another one of roths pearls 1 
it was so cool 1 
from here on the widmark character turns unintentionally comical 0 
crisp and clear 1 
after a year the battery went completely dead on my headset 0 
very cheap plastic creaks like an old wooden floor 0 
first the bathrooms at this location were dirty seat covers were not replenished just plain yucky 0 
i wasnt expecting oscar material but this 0 
best fish ive ever had in my life 1 
that was nice 1 
couldnt ask for a more satisfying meal 1 
the owners are super friendly and the staff is courteous 1 
try them in the airport to experience some tasty food and speedy friendly service 1 
there was so much hype over this phone that i assumed it was the best my mistake 0 
cheap but hey it works was pleasantly suprised given the low cost of this item 1 
a great touch 1 
i probably would not go here again 0 
i ordered the lemon raspberry ice cocktail which was also incredible 1 
couldnt figure it out 0 
i cant tell you how disappointed i was 0 
check it out 1 
i would recommend this 1 
ample portions and good prices 1 
i will come back here every time im in vegas 1 
the desserts were a bit strange 0 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
service is quick and friendly 1 
im surprised this is a good quality car charger and theres not much reviews about it 1 
always a great time at dos gringos 1 
both do good jobs and are quite amusing 1 
i highly recommend this case 1 
i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
better than new 1 
lovely little thriller from hitchcock with lots of nice shenanigans surrounding a murdered spy a kidnapped child a nasty church a foreign plot and some random taxidermists 1 
reception is terrible and full of static 0 
there was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters 0 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
the acting is like watching wooden puppets moving around and reading from a book thats how bad it is 0 
this was my first and only vegas buffet and it did not disappoint 1 
the acting by the whole cast could be put on a scale and balanced perfectly between overacting and underacting 0 
recommend with confidence 1 
hitchcock is a great director 1 
generally it just lacked imagination 0 
the 12 mega pixel camera being a part of a phone is reasonably good7 1 
there is no real plot 0 
the restaurant is very clean and has a family restaurant feel to it 1 
fantastic food 1 
much more interesting more action more suspense and less of the unneeded controversy 1 
the script is a big flawed mess 0 
they have a really nice atmosphere 1 
brilliance indeed 1 
this pair of headphones is the worst that i have ever had soundwise 0 
itll be a regular stop on my trips to phoenix 1 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
i wasnt really impressed with strip steak 0 
it is the best charger i have seen on the market yet 1 
never heard of any of them except cole who was totally unbelievable in the part 0 
will be back again 1 
this was a poor remake of my best friends wedding 0 
its kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly its embarrassing how childlike the company is 0 
linksys should have some way to exchange a bad phone for a refurb unit or something 0 
however paul schrader has indeed made a film about mishima that is both superb complex 1 
an italian reviewer called this a small great film and thats right 1 
this place is good 1 
loved the casting of jimmy buffet as the science teacher 1 
i did not expect this to be so good 1 
the football scenes at the end were perplexing 0 
the desserts were a bit strange 0 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
doesnt do the job 0 
it was so cool 1 
we have gotten a lot of compliments on it 1 
also the story and acting were weak 0 
well im satisfied 1 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
the result is a powerhouse achievement made more timely now perhaps because of our cultures disturbing fascination with celebrity and its distorted interpretations of fame 1 
the price was very good and with the free shipping and all it was a good purchase 1 
i can say that the desserts were yummy 1 
i am also very happy with the price 1 
mediocre food 0 
the shower area is outside so you can only rinse not take a full shower unless you dont mind being nude for everyone to see 0 
excellent product for the price 1 
adapter does not provide enough charging current 0 
painful on the ear 0 
also the fries are without a doubt the worst fries ive ever had 0 
the noise shield is incrediable 1 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
i really wanted the plantronics 510 to be the right one but it has too many issues for methe good 0 
cinematography the film was shot in an interesting way 1 
i dont think it would hold it too securly on your belt 0 
plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job 1 
for a self proclaimed coffee cafe i was wildly disappointed 0 
if there was ever a movie that needed wordofmouth to promote this is it 1 
i had to go to a store and bought a new nokia phone which is working great 1 
this is so embarassing and also my ears hurt if i try to push the ear plug into my ear 0 
yet i enjoy watching it 1 
the guys all had steaks and our steak loving son who has had steak at the best and worst places said it was the best steak hes ever eaten 1 
regardless the film fails on most levels 0 
when a song could explain the emotions of the subjects better such as when jay adams unfortunate life was a subject of talk the song old man by neil young was played which evokes many emotions 1 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
it defeats the purpose of a bluetooth headset 0 
will order from them again 1 
theres really nothing bad i can say about this headset 0 
it was that year however that reminded us that huston was still at the top of his game as evinced by his faithful adaptation of james joyces acclaimed novella the dead 1 
did not like at all 0 
this is probably the most irritating show i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
probably never coming back and wouldnt recommend it 0 
would come back again if i had a sushi craving while in vegas 1 
this movie is a good and humorous comment on life in 2006 1 
to summarize the food was incredible nay transcendant but nothing brings me joy quite like the memory of the pneumatic condiment dispenser 1 
i know he was a contract player with little control over his scripts but the acting was as bad as the script 0 
after the disappointing dinner we went elsewhere for dessert 0 
the cinematographyif it can be called thatsucked 0 
bluetooth does not work phone locks up screens just flash up and now it just makes calls randomly while in my pocket locked 0 
one of the best mexican movies ever and one of the less understood even by mexican themselves no matter how identified the should have felt with it 1 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
easy to use 1 
the food amazing 1 
at around 4 pm i bought it at around 8pm i started to watch at around 815pm i fast forwarded the remaining film to see if there was anything left watchable for a human being with a brain but there wasnt 0 
i ordered albondigas soup which was just warm and tasted like tomato soup with frozen meatballs 0 
will go back next trip out 1 
awful 0 
i saw this film over christmas and what a great film it was 1 
ive only had my bluetooth for a few weeks but i really like it 1 
i love the ownerchef his one authentic japanese cool dude 1 
excellent product for the price 1 
appetite instantly gone 0 
restored my phone to like new performance 1 
the food was barely lukewarm so it must have been sitting waiting for the server to bring it out to us 0 
it even has its sweet moments 1 
it will drive you barking mad 0 
after the first charge kept going dead after 12 minutes 0 
the phone is sturdy and waterproof 1 
terrible service 0 
unfortunately it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees 0 
horrible phone 0 
after watching this film i wanted to learn more about the works of this artist 1 
almost everyone involved must be return to school acting is utterly predictable and bad script is pile of garbage all round 0 
disappointed 0 
i thought errol flynn was brilliant as custer and has since become my favourite actor 1 
the film has great actors a master director a significant themeat least a wouldbe significant theme undertone of fifties existential worldweariness aerial scenes that ought to have thrilled both senses and imagination and characters about which one might deeply care 1 
im happy about this purchase good quality and low price 1 
the bipolarity of the ruthless thug one minute a ruthless killer the next minute a luvs diaper commercial is completely unconvincing 0 
best service and food ever maria our server was so good and friendly she made our day 1 
a piece of cinematic garbage captured on celluloid 0 
i liked it 1 
delete this film from your mind 0 
often the dialogue doesnt really follow from one line to another or fit the surroundings 0 
its reception is very very poor 0 
returned 8 hours later 0 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
unfortunately it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees 0 
not my thing 0 
service is quick and friendly 1 
the wind and the lion is well written and superbly acted 1 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
at first i thought i was grtting a good deal at 744 until i plugged it into my phone v3c razr 0 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
service sucks 0 
2 thumbs up 1 
sooooo good 1 
i will come back here every time im in vegas 1 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
id advise anyone to go and see it 1 
battery has no life 0 
painful on the ear 0 
i hope this place sticks around 1 
stopped by during the late may bank holiday off rick steve recommendation and loved it 1 
it really is impressive that the place hasnt closed down 0 
i really like this product over the motorola because it is allot clearer on the ear piece and the mic 1 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
i dont know what the big deal is about this place but i wont be back yaall 0 
what happened next was prettyoff putting 0 
great software for motorolas 1 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
but then they came back cold 0 
the phone takes forever to charge like 2 to 5 hours literally 0 
its a case of so bad it is laughable 0 
lots of holes in the script 0 
i would advise to not purchase this item it never worked very well 0 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
the construction of the headsets is poor 0 
the waitress and manager are so friendly 1 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
perfect for the ps3 1 
these are the central themes of the film and they are handled ineptly stereotypically and with no depth of imagination 0 
this is infuriating 0 
1 hour 54 minutes of sheer tedium melodrama and horrible acting a mess of a script and a sinking feeling of good lord what were they thinking 0 
both the hot sour the egg flower soups were absolutely 5 stars 1 
nothing at all to recommend 0 
buttons are too small 0 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
very bad performance plays angela bennett a computer expert who is at home all the time 0 
i wasnt expecting oscar material but this 0 
the bathrooms are clean and the place itself is well decorated 1 
i love it 1 
very disappointing 0 
this pair of headphones is the worst that i have ever had soundwise 0 
a fantastic neighborhood gem 1 
internet is excrutiatingly slow 0 
the steaks are all well trimmed and also perfectly cooked 1 
the plug did not work very well 0 
just whatever you do avoid groove as its the antithesis of all that is good about human traffic 0 
it was so cool 1 
the sound quality is excellent as well 1 
definitely worth seeing its the sort of thought provoking film that forces you to question your own threshold of loneliness 1 
great for ipods too 1 
wow what a bad film 0 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
disappointing 0 
this is some seriously good pizza and im an expertconnisseur on the topic 1 
i would have casted her in that role after ready the script 1 
your servers suck wait correction our server heimer sucked 0 
disappointing 0 
the management is rude 0 
the pan cakes everyone are raving about taste like a sugary disaster tailored to the palate of a six year old 0 
im not eating here 0 
bland not a liking this place for a number of reasons and i dont want to waste time on bad reviewing ill leave it at that 0 
john wayne did an incredible job for being so young in the movie industry 1 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
the seller is very understanding and patient i would definitely buy from them again 1 
it did not work in my cell phone plug i am very up set with the charger 0 
they have a plethora of salads and sandwiches and everything ive tried gets my seal of approval 1 
i was left shattered from the experience of watching this film and i took a good two hours to fully recover 0 
seems like a good quick place to grab a bite of some familiar pub food but do yourself a favor and look elsewhere 0 
will never ever go back and have told many people what had happened 0 
was not happy 0 
i love this place 1 
black water is a thriller that manages to completely transcend its limitations its an indie flick by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience 1 
my headset works just peachykeen 1 
you cant beat that 1 
utter crap sound quality is terrible 0 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
this movie is terrible 0 
motorola finally got the voice quality of a bluetooth headset right 1 
despite the pans of reviewers i liked this movie 1 
they do not care about the consumer one bit 0 
if she had not rolled the eyes we may have stayed not sure if we will go back and try it again 0 
no im going to eat the potato that i found some strangers hair in it 0 
how awesome is that 1 
design flaw 0 
yes its shiny on front side and i love it 1 
it was a long time that i didnt see a so charismatic actor on screen 1 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
worthwhile 1 
those phones are working just fine now 1 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
server did a great job handling our large rowdy table 1 
i hate to disagree with my fellow yelpers but my husband and i were so disappointed with this place 0 
the greek dressing was very creamy and flavorful 1 
waitress was good though 1 
i must say i have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again 1 
everything was perfect the night we were in 1 
great pork sandwich 1 
worst thai ever 0 
i am going to have to be the first to negatively review this product 0 
at around 4 pm i bought it at around 8pm i started to watch at around 815pm i fast forwarded the remaining film to see if there was anything left watchable for a human being with a brain but there wasnt 0 
by the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant i was bored and didnt care what happened next and so i switched off 0 
1010 1 
my salad had a bland vinegrette on the baby greens and hearts of palm 0 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
its still wild stuff though and is highly recommended to fans of giallo cinema 1 
the keyboard is a nice compromise between a full qwerty and the basic cell phone number keypad 1 
very cheap plastic creaks like an old wooden floor 0 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
this is high adventure at its best 1 
then the film just dropped the ball 0 
the real killer is the volume and of course it breaking 0 
the writer gorman bechard undoubtedly did his homework because all references are industry and characterage appropriate 1 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
it wasnt busy at all and now we know why 0 
the battery is completely useless to me 0 
avoid at any and all costs 0 
i have to mention this and it is a huge spoiler i loved the ending how all the characters of the three films were the remaining survivors of the ferry disaster with valentine and the young judge together and the old man watching it on her tv solidifying his happiness over the suffering which he dealt with for those many years 1 
buttons are too small 0 
these headphones were a great find and i think they are perhaps the best purchase ive made in the last several years seriously 1 
waitress was a little slow in service 0 
very good quality though 1 
could not get strong enough signal 0 
a fly was in my apple juice a fly 0 
the volume switch rocketed out of the unit to a destination unknown 0 
not a weekly haunt but definitely a place to come back to every once in a while 1 
i own a jabra earset and was very happy with it but the sound quality especially outgoing on this is better 1 
i really like this product over the motorola because it is allot clearer on the ear piece and the mic 1 
this convention never worked well in the past and certainly doesnt work here 0 
the food sucked which we expected but it sucked more than we could have imagined 0 
the steak was amazingrge fillet relleno was the best seafood plate i have ever had 1 
when i saw it in the theater i thought i was going to be sick 0 
crash is a depressing little nothing that provokes emotion but teaches you nothing if you already know racism and prejudice are bad things 0 
o my gosh the best phone i have ever had 1 
i felt as though her going to ireland did absolutely nothing whatsoever 0 
great food and awesome service 1 
what a mistake that was 0 
same evening him and i are both drastically sick 0 
they are so easy to love but even more easy to identify with 1 
i was totally fascinated by the music the dancing everything 1 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
clever and a real crowdpleaserthis film still ranks among mickeys best films even after 80 wonderful years 1 
probably not in a hurry to go back 0 
there is a totally unnecessary trainroller coaster scene 0 
the folks at otto always make us feel so welcome and special 1 
i have only had it for a few weeks but so far so good 1 
we enjoy their pizza and brunch 1 
none of them are engaging or exciting 0 
the movie had you on the edge of your seat and made you somewhat afraid to go to your car at the end of the night 1 
it has a great camera thats 2mp and the pics are nice and clear with great picture quality 1 
the earpiece on this is too large or too heavyit keeps falling out of my ear 0 
the staff was very attentive 1 
the file browser offers all the options that one needshandsfree is great 1 
unfortunately it did not work 0 
youd have to have the iq of particularly stupid mollusk not to see that one coming 0 
those phones are working just fine now 1 
the sound quality is good and functionality is awesome 1 
your brain will attempt to shutdown as part of a primal impulse of selfpreservation 0 
the reception has been generally good 1 
unfortunately it will not recharge my iphone 4s despite connecting it from multiple power sources imac external battery wall outlet etc 0 
i waited and waited 0 
maybe there would be a reasonable explanation for this atrocity 0 
i was very disappointed 0 
the seasonal fruit was fresh white peach puree 1 
nobody identifies with these characters because theyre all cardboard cutouts and stereotypes or predictably reversestereotypes 0 
what a mistake that was 0 
2 times very bad customer service 0 
this is my new fav vegas buffet spot 1 
1 hour 54 minutes of sheer tedium melodrama and horrible acting a mess of a script and a sinking feeling of good lord what were they thinking 0 
elias koteasjack palance play good roles angelina is hot and gets nakedbilly drago appears in this and is cool as usual a cameo by sven ole thorsen helps make this a very enjoyable movie with good acting and a decent budget 1 
it was that loudglad to say that the plantronics 510 maintains a flawless connection to my cell and with no static during normal use 1 
well never go again 0 
crostini that came with the salad was stale 0 
and the accents are absolutely abysmal 0 
the script is was there a script 0 
an absolute must visit 1 
the jabra eargels fit my ears very well 1 
i think not again 0 
its this pandering to the audience that sabotages most of his films 0 
everything about this film is simply incredible 1 
great phone 1 
awesome device 1 
a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it 1 
pricing is a bit of a concern at mellow mushroom 0 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
it was not good 0 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
i own a jabra earset and was very happy with it but the sound quality especially outgoing on this is better 1 
if it was to turn my good day feeling into a night of disturbing memories than i guess he succeeded 0 
before i go in to why i gave a 1 star rating please know that this was my third time eating at bachi burger before writing a review 0 
we would recommend these to others 1 
after a year the battery went completely dead on my headset 0 
its so stupid to have to keep buying new chargers car chargers cradles headphones and car kits every time a new phone comes out 0 
the plot has more holes than a pair of fishnet stockings and the direction and editing is astonishingly ham fisted 0 
this product had a strong rubberpetroleum smell that was unbearable after a while and caused me to return it 0 
what a waste of money and time 0 
this film tries to be a serious and sophisticated thrillerhorror flick and it fails miserably 0 
there is a totally unnecessary trainroller coaster scene 0 
the only thing worse than taylors acting was stanwycks singing 0 
this is high adventure at its best 1 
very good food great atmosphere1 1 
soyo technology sucks 0 
up there with the best of melville 1 
gets a signal when other verizon phones wont 1 
ill be looking for a new earpiece 0 
avoid this establishment 0 
the sergeant pepper beef sandwich with auju sauce is an excellent sandwich as well 1 
uncomfortable in the ear dont use with lg vx9900 env 0 
i only hear garbage for audio 0 
service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is vegas and located inside the crystals shopping mall by aria 1 
the owner used to work at nobu so this place is really similar for half the price 1 
not only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic but it also managed to give away the entire movie and im not exaggerating every moment every plot point every joke is told in the trailer 0 
good audio quality 1 
yes its that bad 0 
the death row scenes were entirely unmoving 0 
this is my new fav vegas buffet spot 1 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
very bad performance plays angela bennett a computer expert who is at home all the time 0 
yes i am simplifying things here for the sake of brevity for this really is at the core of the problems with this film it has too much going on without any real fulfilling explanation 0 
when my mom and i got home she immediately got sick and she only had a few bites of salad 0 
the poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying 0 
unfortunately it did not work 0 
the chefs were friendly and did a good job 1 
their onscreen chemistry critical to the entire film is genuine 1 
i loved their mussels cooked in this wine reduction the duck was tender and their potato dishes were delicious 1 
will order from them again 1 
i recommend igo to anyone with different brand cell phonesmp3 players in the family 1 
when my mom and i got home she immediately got sick and she only had a few bites of salad 0 
its like a bad two hour tv movie 0 
i like design and look of jabra behing the ear headsets and 5020 is pretty comfortible to wear 24 hours a day without pain in the ear 1 
the steak was amazingrge fillet relleno was the best seafood plate i have ever had 1 
i purchased this and within 2 days it was no longer working 0 
items stated as included from the description are not included 0 
echo problemvery unsatisfactory 0 
product is useless since it does not have enough charging current to charge the 2 cellphones i was planning to use it with 0 
echo problemvery unsatisfactory 0 
i put the latest os on it v115g and it now likes to slow to a crawl and lock up every once in a while 0 
needless to say i wont be going back anytime soon 0 
helen baxendale is a very credible lady macbeth who can be very cheerfull at times and sometimes she just looks like a naughty girl but deadly in her taste for blood and evil 1 
the manager was the worst 0 
customer service was terrible 0 
elias koteasjack palance play good roles angelina is hot and gets nakedbilly drago appears in this and is cool as usual a cameo by sven ole thorsen helps make this a very enjoyable movie with good acting and a decent budget 1 
i was very disappointed 0 
cinematography noteworthy including fine views of barcelona and its famed gaudi towers 1 
plus its only 8 bucks 1 
awesome device 1 
the acting was bad the dialogs were extremely shallow and insincere 0 
all i have to say is the food was amazing 1 
its really easy 1 
in fact im going to round up to 4 stars just because she was so awesome 1 
i dont think there are any redeeming qualities in this remake 0 
this place is amazing 1 
youd have to have the iq of particularly stupid mollusk not to see that one coming 0 
its a piece of crap 0 
a disappointment 0 
everything was fresh and delicious 1 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
really awful 0 
and the accents are absolutely abysmal 0 
i had a pretty satifying experience 1 
reaching for the bottom row is uncomfortable and the send and end keys are not where i expect them to be3 0 
clear skype calls long battery life long range 1 
overall i rate this movie a 10 out of a 110 scale 1 
not nearly as good looking as the amazon picture makes it look 0 
service was good and the company was better 1 
nice headset priced right 1 
the design is very odd as the ear clip is not very comfortable at all 0 
best tacos in town by far 1 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
then scene where they debated whether or not to sack the trumpeter who falsely was accused for the murder is pure horror really stupid 0 
if you check the directors filmography on this site you will see why this film didnt have a chance 0 
it quit working after id used it for about 18 months so i just purchased another one because this is the best headset ive ever owned 1 
maybe there would be a reasonable explanation for this atrocity 0 
very true to shakespear and a must for all shakespear fans 1 
the worst piece of crap ever along with the verizon customer service 0 
avoid this establishment 0 
nice sound 1 
the food was barely lukewarm so it must have been sitting waiting for the server to bring it out to us 0 
the best example of how dumb the writing is when its established that you can turn the zombiestudents back into humans by removing a necklace containing a piece of the meteorite 0 
this device is great in several situations1 1 
the volume switch rocketed out of the unit to a destination unknown 0 
very funny 1 
nice spicy and tender 1 
worthwhile 1 
i was very excited to get this headset because i thought it was really cute 1 
they have a really nice atmosphere 1 
the menu is always changing food quality is going down service is extremely slow 0 
dont waste your time here 0 
after trying many many handsfree gadgets this is the one that finally works well 1 
good case 1 
my boyfriend tried the mediterranean chicken salad and fell in love 1 
one of my favorite purchases ever 1 
of course the footage from the 70s was grainy but that only enhanced the film 1 
the staff is always super friendly and helpful which is especially cool when you bring two small boys and a baby 1 
i especially love the long battery life 1 
service is friendly and inviting 1 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
this product is clearly not ready for prime time i dont care how cool it looks if you cant tell a call is coming in its worthless 0 
the buttons for on and off are bad 0 
even if you love bad movies do not watch this movie 0 
the nachos are a must have 1 
i really loved the story line and the poler bear was kinda cutebut if anyone has a question about fort steele just ask away 1 
this is probably the most irritating show i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
again lame 0 
the volume for the ringer is real good you have choices how loud 1 
im trying to return it for a refund 0 
judith light is one of my favorite actresses and i think she does a superb job in this film 1 
there is nothing authentic about this place 0 
and generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode 0 
the spaghetti is nothing special whatsoever 0 
they have great dinners 1 
the only downside is the service 0 
same problem as others have mentioned 0 
this is a chilly unremarkable movie about an author livingworking in a chilly abstruse culture 0 
the food was terrible 0 
for 40 bucks a head i really expect better food 0 
i have been very happy with the 510 and have had no complaints from any one regarding my sound quality on their end 1 
the movie was so boring that i sometimes found myself occupied peaking in the paper instead of watching never happened during a columbo movie before 0 
i had about two bites and refused to eat anymore 0 
i am very impressed with this headset from plantronics 1 
doesnt do the job 0 
not a good item it worked for a while then started having problems in my auto reverse tape player 0 
very tough and very short on flavor 0 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
how can that bethe audio quality is poor 0 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
four stars for the food the guy in the blue shirt for his great vibe still letting us in to eat 1 
love the margaritas too 1 
reception is terrible and full of static 0 
i would not recommend this place 0 
weve have gotten a much better service from the pizza place next door than the services we received from this restaurant 0 
talk about useless customer service 0 
could not get strong enough signal 0 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
i wont say any more i dont like spoilers so i dont want to be one but i believe this film is worth your time 1 
today the graphics are crap 0 
the text messaging feature is really tricky to use 0 
clear crisp sound 1 
after all the rave reviews i couldnt wait to eat herewhat a disappointment 0 
great movie 1 
a fantastic neighborhood gem 1 
there is really nothing for me at postinos hope your experience is better 0 
the dialogue is composed of things that make little sense 0 
great phone 1 
the first time i ever came here i had an amazing experience i still tell people how awesome the duck was 1 
this frog phone charm is adorable and very eye catching 1 
i had a seriously solid breakfast here 1 
wont ever go here again 0 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
great movie 1 
its a piece of crap 0 
very very disappointed ordered the 35 big bay plater 0 
lets start with all the problemsthe acting especially from the lead professor was very very bad 0 
i wont be back 0 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
the plot was the same as pretty much every other cheap horror 0 
i got home to see the driest damn wings ever 0 
all the other cases ive tried normally fall apart after a few months but this one seems to be in for the long haul 1 
they have horrible attitudes towards customers and talk down to each one when customers dont enjoy their food 0 
everything was good and tasty 1 
the ambiance isnt much better 0 
voice quality signal strength dropped calls 0 
excellent sound quality 1 
waitress was good though 1 
if you want a sandwich just go to any firehouse 1 
and considering the two of us left there very full and happy for about 20 you just cant go wrong 1 
love this headset 1 
the story unfolds in 18th century jutland and the use of period music played on period instruments is just one more fine touch 1 
but it wasnt until i watched this film that i realised how great he actually was 1 
think it over when you plan to own this onethis sure is the last moto phone for me 0 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
i really enjoyed eating here 1 
unfortunately it was not good 0 
this movie is also revealing 1 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
its a sad movie but very good 1 
yes its that bad 0 
that movie was bad 0 
i wear it everyday and it holds up very well 1 
it has everything i need and i couldnt ask for more 1 
tied to charger for conversations lasting more than 45 minutesmajor problems 0 
a good commentary of todays love and undoubtedly a film worth seeing 1 
i gave it a 10 1 
you could drive a semi truck into these holes 0 
very disappointed in accessoryone 0 
her role was played well 1 
keep up the good work amazon 1 
great phone 1 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
first time there and might just be the last 0 
sending it back 0 
i have to use the smallest earpieces provided but it stays on pretty well 1 
this is was due to the fact that it took 20 minutes to be acknowledged then another 35 minutes to get our foodand they kept forgetting things 0 
they really want to make your experience a good one 1 
this mostly routine factbased tv drama gets a boost from the fine performance by cole 1 
fantastic food 1 
i saw it as a child on tv back in 1973 when it was the stranger and i loved it 1 
all of the main players are mesmerising 1 
i had to wait over 30 minutes to get my drink and longer to get 2 arepas 0 
the selection of food was not the best 0 
despite how hard i rate businesses its actually rare for me to give a 1 star 0 
i dont think ive ever gone to a movie and disliked it as much 0 
the potatoes were great and so was the biscuit 1 
it was that loudglad to say that the plantronics 510 maintains a flawless connection to my cell and with no static during normal use 1 
it quit working after id used it for about 18 months so i just purchased another one because this is the best headset ive ever owned 1 
an interesting premise and billy drago is always good as a dangerous nutbag side note id love to see drago stephen mchattie and lance hendrikson in a flick together talk about raging cheekbones 1 
the incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film 1 
i asked multiple times for the wine list and after some time of being ignored i went to the hostess and got one myself 0 
both of the egg rolls were fantastic 1 
i cannot believe that the actors agreed to do this film 0 
the football scenes at the end were perplexing 0 
great audio 1 
mic doesnt work 0 
reasonably priced also 1 
the design might be ergonomic in theory but i could not stand having these in my ear 0 
reversible plug works great 1 
as for the mains also uninspired 0 
excellent short film 1 
then as if i hadnt wasted enough of my life there they poured salt in the wound by drawing out the time it took to bring the check 0 
very easy to use 1 
the calls drop the phone comes on and off at will the screen goes black and the worst of all it stops ringing intermittently 0 
it works fine on my motorola 325 cellphone and a lot better than the wornout battery did 1 
highly recommended 1 
i ordered albondigas soup which was just warm and tasted like tomato soup with frozen meatballs 0 
the descriptions said yum yum sauce and another said eel sauce yet another said spicy mayowell none of the rolls had sauces on them 0 
waitress was sweet and funny 1 
great pizza and salads 1 
the company shipped my product very promptly and it works well 1 
kids pizza is always a hit too with lots of great side dish options for the kiddos 1 
my first visit to hiro was a delight 1 
it felt too light and tinny 0 
as a sushi lover avoid this place by all means 0 
i think that it is a must see older john wayne film 1 
this is an outstanding little restaurant with some of the best food i have ever tasted 1 
a must study for anyone interested in the worst sins of industrial design 0 
it was quite comfortable in the ear 1 
this place deserves no stars 0 
i had to go to a store and bought a new nokia phone which is working great 1 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
this movie is greatespecially if you enjoy visual arts 1 
good servicecheck 1 
their menu is diverse and reasonably priced 1 
my mother and brother had to do thiswhen i saw robert ryan portraying this type of man it was a very good imitation of this type of individual and i was impressed 1 
i bought this phone as a replacement for my startac and have regretted it since 0 
you also cannot take pictures with it in the case because the lense is covered 0 
happy so far 1 
talk about useless customer service 0 
will order from them again 1 
also its slim enough to fit into my alarm clock docking station without removing the case 1 
i was very excited to get this headset because i thought it was really cute 1 
the acting helps the writing along very well maybe the idiotsavant sister could have been played better and it is a real joy to watch 1 
all the characters in this film are tremendously well played 1 
pretty piece of junk 0 
this place is amazing 1 
you can even take self portraits with the outside exterior display very cool 1 
it is well made easy to access the phone and has a handy detachable belt clip 1 
no shifting no bubbling no peeling not even a scratch nothingi couldnt be more happier with my new one for the droid 1 
problem is that the ear loops are made of weak material and break easily 0 
this allows the possibility of double booking for the same date and time after the first 0 
the worst piece of crap ever along with the verizon customer service 0 
the phone is sturdy and waterproof 1 
ive never been more insulted or felt disrespected 0 
i have bought this nokia cell phone a few weeks ago and it was a nightmare 0 
no ear loop needed its tiny and the sound is great 1 
great value 1 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
ive never been more insulted or felt disrespected 0 
clear skype calls long battery life long range 1 
i still maintain that monkeys shouldnt make headphones we just obviously dont share enough dna to copy the design over to humans 0 
the han nan chicken was also very tasty 1 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
attempting artiness with black white and clever camera angles the movie disappointed became even more ridiculous as the acting was poor and the plot and lines almost nonexistent 0 
this results in the phone being either stuck at max volume or mute 0 
for a self proclaimed coffee cafe i was wildly disappointed 0 
much better than the other ayce sushi place i went to in vegas 1 
brilliance indeed 1 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
an hour and a half i wish i could bring back 0 
good product good seller 1 
this item is fantastic and works perfectly 1 
but whatever it was that cost them so much it didnt translate to quality thats for sure 0 
initially the local sites in the film which was filmed here in buffalo intrigued me 1 
my gyro was basically lettuce only 0 
theres barely a boring moment in the film and there are plenty of humorous parts 1 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
the acting is like watching wooden puppets moving around and reading from a book thats how bad it is 0 
highly recommend for any one who has a blue tooth phone 1 
when i saw it in the theater i thought i was going to be sick 0 
the writers were smack on and i think the best actors and actresses were a bonus to the showthese characters were so real 1 
best fish ive ever had in my life 1 
the films sole bright spot was jonah hill who will look almost unrecognizable to fans of the recent superbad due to the amount of weight he lost in the interim 1 
waiter was a jerk 0 
the movie showed a lot of florida at its best made it look very appealing 1 
we wont be returning 0 
its still wild stuff though and is highly recommended to fans of giallo cinema 1 
this movie has a cutting edge to it 1 
we had so much to say about the place before we walked in that he expected it to be amazing but was quickly disappointed 0 
im so sorry but i really cant recommend it to anyone 0 
everything was fresh and delicious 1 
portable and it works 1 
this may be the only bad film he ever made 0 
helen baxendale is a very credible lady macbeth who can be very cheerfull at times and sometimes she just looks like a naughty girl but deadly in her taste for blood and evil 1 
if you are reading this please dont go there 0 
it also had a new problem 0 
i work in the hospitality industry in paradise valley and have refrained from recommending cibo any longer 0 
your brain will attempt to shutdown as part of a primal impulse of selfpreservation 0 
easy to use 1 
couldnt use the unit with sunglasses not good in texas 0 
perfect for the ps3 1 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
my breakfast was perpared great with a beautiful presentation of 3 giant slices of toast lightly dusted with powdered sugar 1 
seafood was limited to boiled shrimp and crab legs but the crab legs definitely did not taste fresh 0 
buyerbe very careful 0 
all the bread is made inhouse 1 
both actors truly understand and become their particular character delivering a convincing sincere performance 1 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
i had a seriously solid breakfast here 1 
the chips that came out were dripping with grease and mostly not edible 0 
best tacos in town by far 1 
the service was a bit lacking 0 
all it took was one drop from about 6 inches above the kitchen counter and it was crackedi am not impressed and i am not laughing 0 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
dont waste your on this one 0 
its reception is very very poor 0 
the transfers are very good 1 
horrible phone 0 
dont go here 0 
im not really sure how joeys was voted best hot dog in the valley by readers of phoenix magazine 0 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
in summary this was a largely disappointing dining experience 0 
the service was extremely slow 0 
service was exceptional and food was a good as all the reviews 1 
fantastic buy and will get again for whatever my next phone is 1 
this movie creates its own universe and is fascinating in every way 1 
victor mclaglen was even bad and brian donlevy was almost unrecognizable 0 
very bad performance plays angela bennett a computer expert who is at home all the time 0 
i hate to disagree with my fellow yelpers but my husband and i were so disappointed with this place 0 
the acting helps the writing along very well maybe the idiotsavant sister could have been played better and it is a real joy to watch 1 
not much seafood and like 5 strings of pasta at the bottom 0 
i dont recommend unless your car breaks down in front of it and you are starving 0 
excellent product for the price 1 
our server was very nice and even though he looked a little overwhelmed with all of our needs he stayed professional and friendly until the end 1 
so absolutley fantastic 1 
the seasonal fruit was fresh white peach puree 1 
battery lasts only a few hours 0 
highly unrecommended 0 
worst ever 0 
paolo sorrentino has written a wonderful story about loneliness and tony has built one of the most unforgettable characters seen in movies in recent years 1 
it was quite comfortable in the ear 1 
reversible plug works great 1 
very disappointing 0 
of all the dishes the salmon was the best but all were great 1 
it is zillion times away from reality 0 
internet is excrutiatingly slow 0 
it looses connection to the phone even when it is within a couple feet between the two 0 
everything captain howdy says is either laughable or just plain stupid 0 
its worth driving up from tucson 1 
with great sound effects and impressive special effects i cant recommend this movie enough 1 
not nearly as good looking as the amazon picture makes it look 0 
if you simply want a small flip phone look elsewhere as the extra bells whistles are mediocre 0 
speaking of the music it is unbearably predictably and kitchy 0 
its not what it says it is 0 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
the seasonal fruit was fresh white peach puree 1 
there are the usual hitchcock logic flaws 0 
ordered an appetizer and took 40 minutes and then the pizza another 10 minutes 0 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
one nice thing was that they added gratuity on the bill since our party was larger than 6 or 8 and they didnt expect more tip than that 1 
dont buy this product 0 
overall i like this place a lot 1 
the service was outshining i definitely recommend the halibut 1 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
i keep watching it over and over 1 
your servers suck wait correction our server heimer sucked 0 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
the characters are fleshed out surprisingly well particularly grimes and blake and all the actors deliver their sharply scripted lines with just the right amount of deadpan tongue in cheek to make the dialogue both hilarious and realistic 1 
price is good too 1 
this was reflected not only in the cast but also in the belowpar script which borrowed much from the earlier classic 0 
the volume switch rocketed out of the unit to a destination unknown 0 
about half way through this film i started to dislike it 0 
good case 1 
awful service 0 
prosgood camera very nice pictures also has cool styles like black and white and more 1 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
awsome device works great 1 
always a great time at dos gringos 1 
the directing and the cinematography arent quite as good 0 
my friend loved the salmon tartar 1 
did not like at all 0 
the worst experience ever 0 
the service was terrible food was mediocre 0 
the warmth it generates is in contrast to its austere backdrop 1 
the only very disappointing thing was there was no speakerphone 0 
nargile i think you are great 1 
very satisifed with that 1 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
after all the rave reviews i couldnt wait to eat herewhat a disappointment 0 
i dressed up to be treated so rudely 0 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
which has more depth and character than the man underneath it 0 
ill put this gem up against any movie in terms of screenplay cinematography acting postproduction editing directing or any other aspect of filmmaking 1 
i dont think ill be running back to carlys anytime soon for food 0 
in my house i was getting dropped coverage upstairs and no coverage in my basement 0 
i exchanged the sony ericson z500a for this and im pretty happy with that decision 1 
delete this film from your mind 0 
this movie has a cutting edge to it 1 
i really enjoyed eating here 1 
the potato chip order was sad i could probably count how many chips were in that box and it was probably around 12 0 
i was able to do voice dialing in the car with no problem 1 
this was a different cut than the piece the other day but still wonderful and tender s well as well flavored 1 
worst ever 0 
it is light easy to use and has very clear reception and transmission 1 
i would recommend this 1 
great movie 1 
i have read others reviews here but i havent had any problem with it 1 
lifetime does not air it enough so if anyone knows what store sells it let me know because this is a musthave 1 
i used bitpim a free program you can find on the internetto transfer data to the phonethe price of the cable was excellent 1 
maybe if they werent cold they would have been somewhat edible 0 
the use of slowmotion needlessly repeats itself throughout the movie but is well backed up by bad acting and bad is a kind word here no continuity scenes that are thrown in for no reason whatsoever vehicles that looked like they were made from a corn flakes box and a directorial style that bordered on stupidity 0 
lewis blacks considerable talent is wasted here too as he is at his most incendiary when he is unrestrained which the pg13 rating certainly wont allow 0 
when i placed my treo into the case not only was it not snug but there was a lot of extra room on the sides 0 
this is one of peter watkins most accessible films 1 
i could eat their bruschetta all day it is devine 1 
good show samsung 1 
the atmosphere was great with a lovely duo of violinists playing songs we requested 1 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
imdb ratings only go as low 1 for awful its time to get some negative numbers in there for cases such as these 0 
ive only had my bluetooth for a few weeks but i really like it 1 
worth every penny 1 
the worst was the salmon sashimi 0 
the menu is always changing food quality is going down service is extremely slow 0 
it is super charged up for use as a small hybrid palmtopcameracellphone and excels in those roles 1 
saw the movie today and thought it was a good effort good messages for kids 1 
i recently tried caballeros and i have been back every week since 1 
my first visit to hiro was a delight 1 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
definitely worth checking out 1 
the management is rude 0 
but it does get better reception and clarity than any phone ive had before 1 
truly awful 0 
graphics is far from the best part of the game 0 
in my house i was getting dropped coverage upstairs and no coverage in my basement 0 
it lasts less than 3o minutes if i actually try to use the phonemy wife has the same phone with the same problem 0 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
this phone is very fast with sending any kind of messages and web browsing is significantly faster than previous phones i have used 1 
the igo chargers and tips are really great 1 
restaurant is always full but never a wait 1 
so anyone near you will hear part of your conversation 0 
so badwellits just bad 0 
that movie was bad 0 
some great music and terrific scenery 1 
nice ambiance 1 
this is a stunning movie 1 
good value great food great service 1 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
all in all i give this one a resounding 9 out of 10 1 
the battery is completely useless to me 0 
it was packed 0 
unfortunately it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees 0 
overall i like this place a lot 1 
not only did the software do a great job of this i could also make my own ringtones form my existing cds without an internet connection 1 
its fits like a glove and is strong secure and durable 1 
food was so gooodd 1 
nice leather 1 
we asked for the bill to leave without eating and they didnt bring that either 0 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
a very charming film with wonderful sentiment and heart 1 
the ending is so so perfect youll shed a tear 1 
good servicecheck 1 
of all the dishes the salmon was the best but all were great 1 
this is one of the better buffets that i have been to 1 
i like design and look of jabra behing the ear headsets and 5020 is pretty comfortible to wear 24 hours a day without pain in the ear 1 
my friend did not like his bloody mary 0 
its a long time since i was so entertained by a movie 1 
a good film by a great director 1 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
this one works and was priced right 1 
earbud piece breaks easily 0 
linked to my phone without effort 1 
main thing i didnt enjoy is that the crowd is of older crowd around mid 30s and up 0 
service is also cute 1 
great phone 1 
it clicks into place in a way that makes you wonder how long that mechanism would last 0 
excellent dualpurpose headset 1 
i could eat their bruschetta all day it is devine 1 
he cant act one of the least scary villains i have ever seen he cant write did he write this damn movie in his sleep 0 
there still are good actors around 1 
too bad cause i know its family owned i really wanted to like this place 0 
lucy bell is so much higher than this crap and for her to sink this low is quite depressing 0 
great software for motorolas 1 
what a waste of money and time 0 
i was sitting in my vehicle with the cradle on my belt and the headset lost signal 0 
great charger 1 
very disappointing 0 
join the club and get awesome offers via email 1 
of all the dishes the salmon was the best but all were great 1 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
it also had a new problem 0 
just really good so far probably the best bt headset i have ever had 1 
my phone doesnt slide around my car now and the grip prevents my phone from slipping out of my hand 1 
unreliable im giving up 0 
i hate movies like that 0 
the fries were not hot and neither was my burger 0 
i would advise to not purchase this item it never worked very well 0 
it is shameful 0 
conclusion very filling meals 1 
the soundtrack wasnt terrible either 1 
regrettably the film fails 0 
if you do go see this movie bring a pillow or a girlfriendboyfriend to keep you occupied through out 0 
this is a great product sure beats using your fingers 1 
poor reliability 0 
although i very much liked the look and sound of this place the actual experience was a bit disappointing 0 
i keep watching it over and over 1 
but its just not funny 0 
i cannot believe that the actors agreed to do this film 0 
service was fantastic 1 
if only someone involved with it knew how to string together narrative 0 
this movie is excellentangel is beautiful and scamp is adorablehis little yelps when hes scaredand the funniest parts are whenscamp is caught under the curtain and when angel and scamp are singing ive never had this feeling beforei totally recommend this movieits coming out on special edition on june 20the cover has scamp on a garbage can and angel underneath the lid 1 
the only downside is the service 0 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
att is not clear sound is very distorted and you have to yell when you talk 0 
ive seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie 0 
never going back 0 
i received it quickly and it works great 1 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
a week later after i activated it it suddenly died 0 
another thing i didnt really like is when a character got punched in the face a gallon of blood would spew forth soon after 0 
i also didnt like the on button it felt like it would crack with use 0 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
okay i like to consider myself a fair critic so ill give credit where credits duethe creature effects were actually pretty cool 1 
the only consistent thread holding the series together were the amazing performances of leni parker and anita laselva as the two taelons in quiet idealogical conflict 0 
i found this place by accident and i could not be happier 1 
couldnt ask for a more satisfying meal 1 
its a great tool for entertainment communication and data managementoh be sure to use activesync 42 for optimal data synchronization results 1 
there was a warm feeling with the service and i felt like their guest for a special treat 1 
worst customer service 0 
omg the food was delicioso 1 
great phone 1 
i recently tried caballeros and i have been back every week since 1 
still i do like this movie for its empowerment of women theres not enough movies out there like this one 1 
youll love it 1 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
seriously flavorful delights folks 1 
freezes frequently4 0 
logitech bluetooth headset is a 10 1 
i can assure you that you wont be disappointed 1 
this phone tries very hard to do everything but fails at its very ability to be a phone 0 
maybe if they werent cold they would have been somewhat edible 0 
terrible management 0 
she ordered a toasted english muffin that came out untoasted 0 
great food and great service in a clean and friendly setting 1 
meredith m was better than all right 1 
our server was super nice and checked on us many times 1 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
the hockey scenes are terrible defensemen playing like theyre 5 years old goalies diving at shots that are 10 feet wide of the net etc 0 
the keyboard is a nice compromise between a full qwerty and the basic cell phone number keypad 1 
this is one of peter watkins most accessible films 1 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
this was my first and only vegas buffet and it did not disappoint 1 
then i had to continue pairing it periodically since it somehow kept dropping 0 
trumbull on i love lucy 1 
product was excellent and works better than the verizon one and boy was it cheaper 1 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
the jalapeno bacon is soooo good 1 
i saw this film over christmas and what a great film it was 1 
this is a bad film with bad writing and good actorsan ugly cartoon crafted by paul haggis for people who cant handle anything but the bold strokes in storytellinga picture painted with crayons 0 
this allows the possibility of double booking for the same date and time after the first 0 
its pretty easy 1 
my 810 score is mostly for the plot 1 
what a waste 0 
not impressed 0 
this is a great deal 1 
linksys should have some way to exchange a bad phone for a refurb unit or something 0 
they are so easy to love but even more easy to identify with 1 
if you hate earbugs avoid this phone by all means 0 
horrible dont waste your time and money 0 
the buffet at bellagio was far from what i anticipated 0 
i was able to do voice dialing in the car with no problem 1 
still i do like this movie for its empowerment of women theres not enough movies out there like this one 1 
what should have been a hilarious yummy christmas eve dinner to remember was the biggest fail of the entire trip for us 0 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
the movie lacks visual interest drama expression of feeling and celebration of the very patriotism that underlines the narrative 0 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
so anyone near you will hear part of your conversation 0 
definitely worth seeing its the sort of thought provoking film that forces you to question your own threshold of loneliness 1 
the story is beyond stupid 0 
what makes this story different are the terrific production values faultless photography composition and editing the terrific casting the underappreciated brian keith playing a bully teddy and vivid history 1 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
the live music on fridays totally blows 0 
the instructions didnt explain that a microphone jack could be used 0 
how awful she is 0 
this is a chilly unremarkable movie about an author livingworking in a chilly abstruse culture 0 
i am not a filmmaker nor am i a director but i would hide my head in the sand if id spent whatever amount of money and time on this movie 0 
i hope this place sticks around 1 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
it was also the right balance of war and love 1 
the majority of the logitech earbud headsets failed 0 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
with great sound effects and impressive special effects i cant recommend this movie enough 1 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
overall i was not impressed and would not go back 0 
we wont be going back 0 
the story unfolds in 18th century jutland and the use of period music played on period instruments is just one more fine touch 1 
prosgood camera very nice pictures also has cool styles like black and white and more 1 
duris has a wholesome appearance and gives a fine performance 1 
there are massive levels massive unlockable characters its just a massive game 1 
i would recommend this 1 
dont waste your money 0 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
so bad 0 
perfect for someone me who only likes beer ice cold or in this case even colder 1 
how awesome is that 1 
dont buy this product 0 
not good by any stretch of the imagination 0 
one of the most disappointing aspects is the lack of notable gore 0 
the ambiance was incredible 1 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
pretty piece of junk 0 
i would advise to not purchase this item it never worked very well 0 
this is one of peter watkins most accessible films 1 
for 40 bucks a head i really expect better food 0 
the tracfonewebsite is user friendly and makes it easy toactivate etc 1 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
incredible 1 
i have 23 bars on my cell phone when i am home but you cant not hear anything 0 
they really want to make your experience a good one 1 
overall i like there food and the service 1 
i tried the cape cod ravoli chickenwith cranberrymmmm 1 
people couldnt hear me talk and i had to pull out the earphone and talk on the phone 0 
the lines the cuts the audio everything is wrong 0 
the food came out at a good pace 1 
then the film just dropped the ball 0 
this is a simple little phone to use but the breakage is unacceptible 0 
it is unusable in a moving car at freeway speed 0 
about 30 minutes of footage is wasted to show mediocre elderly actors awkwardly babbling overwrought pseudosatanic gibberish corny enough to make a teen goth blush almost always in olde english and sometimes in latin that may or may not be made up words 0 
but what really made it unwatchable was the direction 0 
its a fresh subtle and rather sublime effect 1 
food was really good and i got full petty fast 1 
the classic maine lobster roll was fantastic 1 
the plot simply rumbles on like a machine desperately depending on the addition of new scenes 0 
the story is also both funny and poignant at times 1 
i give wirefly 1 stari will contact cingularatt and inform them of this practice 0 
cinematography the film was shot in an interesting way 1 
his performance is simply genius 1 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
avoid this one if you can 0 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
lifetime does not air it enough so if anyone knows what store sells it let me know because this is a musthave 1 
there is nothing privileged about workingeating there 0 
terrible management 0 
john wayne did an incredible job for being so young in the movie industry 1 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
at first glance it is a lovely bakery cafe nice ambiance clean friendly staff 1 
worth every penny 1 
conclusion i loved it 1 
we would recommend these to others 1 
light weight i hardly notice it is there 1 
it looks very nice 1 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
ambience is perfect 1 
it looses connection to the phone even when it is within a couple feet between the two 0 
say bye bye to your tip lady 0 
it has a very good plot it holds your complete attention the acting is superb tom wilkinson was fantastic and emily watson was also very good 1 
great price also 1 
i have been to very few places to eat that under no circumstances would i ever return to and this tops the list 0 
i searched the internet and found this one to be the best value 1 
i love the camera its really pretty good quality 1 
this is a great place to eat 1 
will not be back 0 
this is by far the worst purchase ive made on amazon 0 
we loved the place 1 
i go to far too many places and ive never seen any restaurant that serves a 1 egg breakfast especially for 400 0 
if you plan to use this in a car forget about it 0 
a cheap and cheerless heist movie with poor characterisation lots of underbite style stoic emoting think chow yun fat in a better tomorrow and some cheesy clichés thrown into an abandoned factory ready for a few poorly executed flying judo rolls a la john woo 0 
i love this cable it allows me to connect any miniusb device to my pc 1 
the worst piece of crap ever along with the verizon customer service 0 
but whatever it was that cost them so much it didnt translate to quality thats for sure 0 
i dressed up to be treated so rudely 0 
i struggle to find anything bad to say about it 1 
brilliant 1 
overall i like this place a lot 1 
i had about two bites and refused to eat anymore 0 
if you love death and decay and shakespears lyrics this is the one 1 
so just beware 0 
my friend loved the salmon tartar 1 
the keyboard is a nice compromise between a full qwerty and the basic cell phone number keypad 1 
for those that havent seen it dont waste your time 0 
it also had a new problem 0 
i highly recommend this device to everyone 1 
i will not return 0 
sooooo good 1 
used and dirty 0 
also great directing and photography 1 
do not buy do not buyit sucks 0 
the goat taco didnt skimp on the meat and wow what flavor 1 
i probably wont be coming back here 0 
also the fries are without a doubt the worst fries ive ever had 0 
have been going since 2007 and every meal has been awesome 1 
the battery is completely useless to me 0 
2 times very bad customer service 0 
i own 2 of these cases and would order another 1 
also its slim enough to fit into my alarm clock docking station without removing the case 1 
the film is way too long 0 
i wasnt expecting oscar material but this 0 
good value great food great service 1 
the only thing really worth watching was the scenery and the house because it is beautiful 1 
i would have casted her in that role after ready the script 1 
delicious and i will absolutely be back 1 
so absolutley fantastic 1 
very serious spoilers this movie was a huge disappointment 0 
defective crap 0 
too bad you have to pay up to a month for the service 0 
couldnt figure it out 0 
if this premise sound stupid thats because it is 0 
very disappointing 0 
what a mistake that was 0 
the battery works great 1 
great product and price 1 
nice ambiance 1 
the script is a big flawed mess 0 
i did not expect this to be so good 1 
ive never been treated so bad 0 
excellent phone 1 
interesting decor 1 
so for our enjoyment we get to see them run around play games and be dangerous 1
