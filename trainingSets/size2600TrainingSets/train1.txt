it is very educational for children 1 to 8 years old 1 
this pda rocks 1 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
itll be a regular stop on my trips to phoenix 1 
i still maintain that monkeys shouldnt make headphones we just obviously dont share enough dna to copy the design over to humans 0 
my friend did not like his bloody mary 0 
lets start with all the problemsthe acting especially from the lead professor was very very bad 0 
the service was not up to par either 0 
no complaints 1 
i do love sushi but i found kabuki to be overpriced overhip and underservices 0 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
worst phone ever 0 
by far the best cheesecurds we have ever had 1 
the burger had absolutely no flavor the meat itself was totally bland the burger was overcooked and there was no charcoal flavor 0 
come hungry leave happy and stuffed 1 
this movie was kind of long in length but i enjoyed every minute of it 1 
the directing and the cinematography arent quite as good 0 
muddy low quality sound and the casing around the wires insert was poorly super glued and slid off 0 
overall i was not impressed and would not go back 0 
it was attached to a gas station and that is rarely a good sign 0 
often the dialogue doesnt really follow from one line to another or fit the surroundings 0 
ordered a double cheeseburger got a single patty that was falling apart picture uploaded yeah still sucks 0 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
i have had mine for about a year and this christmas i bought some for the rest of the family 1 
come hungry leave happy and stuffed 1 
for the price on amazon it is an excellent product which i would highly recommend 1 
ill even say it again  this is torture 0 
the script is a big flawed mess 0 
total brunch fail 0 
the feel of the dining room was more college cooking course than high class dining and the service was slow at best 0 
the service was terrible food was mediocre 0 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
my first visit to hiro was a delight 1 
i know he was a contract player with little control over his scripts but the acting was as bad as the script 0 
headset works great was packaged nicely to avoid any damage 1 
level 5 spicy was perfect where spice didnt overwhelm the soup 1 
omg the food was delicioso 1 
this scene is very strong and unpleasant 0 
i got the aluminum case for my new palm vx and it worked really wellit has protected my handheld perfectly so far 1 
these are fabulous 1 
we recently witnessed her poor quality of management towards other guests as well 0 
so i bought about 10 of these and saved alot of money 1 
good quality 1 
i had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get some relief 0 
this is just a great movie 1 
very good lunch spot 1 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
i love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it 1 
i highly recommend this device to everyone 1 
regardless the film fails on most levels 0 
the croutons also taste homemade which is an extra plus 1 
i received my supposedly new motorola 375 and apparently there was not a match between the phone and the charger 0 
i ate there twice on my last visit and especially enjoyed the salmon salad 1 
sam shepards portrayal of a gung ho marine was sobering 1 
i probably wont be coming back here 0 
comfortable nice range good battery life 1 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
will not be back 0 
this is hands down the best phone ive ever had 1 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
this was a poor remake of my best friends wedding 0 
the price was very good and with the free shipping and all it was a good purchase 1 
portable and it works 1 
best headset ever 1 
someone shouldve invented this sooner 1 
this product is clearly not ready for prime time i dont care how cool it looks if you cant tell a call is coming in its worthless 0 
no complaints 1 
this case has passed the one year mark and while it shows signs of wear it is 100 functional 1 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
it was absolutely amazing 1 
it has northern humour and positive about the community it represents 1 
good transmit audio 1 
worthwhile 1 
the phone gets extremely hot 0 
the desserts were a bit strange 0 
i dont think ive ever gone to a movie and disliked it as much 0 
everything is appalling 0 
i wouldnt see this movie again for free 0 
it also took her forever to bring us the check when we asked for it 0 
the soundtrack wasnt terrible either 1 
its worth driving up from tucson 1 
lasted one day and then blew up 0 
call me a nut but i think this is one of the best movies ever 1 
first of all there are enough racial stereotypes and racial jokes to offend everyone 0 
lots of holes in the script 0 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
i have to use the smallest earpieces provided but it stays on pretty well 1 
so i basically threw my money out the window for nothing 0 
only like 3 or 4 buildings used a couple of locations maybe poor hummh 0 
they work about 2 weeks then break 0 
went in for happy hour great list of wines 1 
the only very disappointing thing was there was no speakerphone 0 
very comfortable 1 
the voice recognition thru the handset is excellent 1 
item does not match picture 0 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
what this film lacks is a convincing script 0 
when i received my pita it was huge it did have a lot of meat in it so thumbs up there 1 
this is the place where i first had pho and it was amazing 1 
it is not good 0 
there is really nothing for me at postinos hope your experience is better 0 
there is no real plot 0 
nice ambiance 1 
fantastic service here 1 
camerawork again bad 0 
the result is a powerhouse achievement made more timely now perhaps because of our cultures disturbing fascination with celebrity and its distorted interpretations of fame 1 
the movie is littered with overt racial slurs towards the black cast members and in return the whites are depicted as morons and boobs 0 
excellent product 1 
this early film from future goremeister lucio fulci is a very good addition to the giallo subgenre 1 
great phone 1 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
the chains which im no fan of beat this place easily 0 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
after all the rave reviews i couldnt wait to eat herewhat a disappointment 0 
i still maintain that monkeys shouldnt make headphones we just obviously dont share enough dna to copy the design over to humans 0 
i would advise to not purchase this item it never worked very well 0 
the sets especially designed to work with the camera are amazingstylized beautiful and effective 1 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
the food was barely lukewarm so it must have been sitting waiting for the server to bring it out to us 0 
this movie is so awesome 1 
nothing at all to recommend 0 
the atmosphere was great with a lovely duo of violinists playing songs we requested 1 
great product for the price 1 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
overall i was not impressed and would not go back 0 
1010 1 
i as well wouldve given godfathers zero stars if possible 0 
this place has it 1 
the sound is clear and the people i talk to on it are amazed at the quality too 1 
the bartender was also nice 1 
the soundtrack wasnt terrible either 1 
and if that isnt enough of a mess of a movie for you the picture is also marred with a constant use of studio sets and indoor exteriors 0 
updatewent back for a second time and it was still just as amazing 1 
the update procedure is difficult and cumbersome 0 
it was that loudglad to say that the plantronics 510 maintains a flawless connection to my cell and with no static during normal use 1 
what a piece of junk i lose more calls on this phone 0 
im not really sure how joeys was voted best hot dog in the valley by readers of phoenix magazine 0 
paolo sorrentino has written a wonderful story about loneliness and tony has built one of the most unforgettable characters seen in movies in recent years 1 
furthermore you cant even find hours of operation on the website 0 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
he was very impressed when going from the original battery to the extended battery 1 
we received a white colored battery that goes dead after a couple hoursthe original used to last a week but still lasts longer than thereplacement 0 
very disappointing 0 
only pros large seating area nice bar area great simple drink menu the best brick oven pizza with homemade dough 1 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
the new characters werent all that memorable and i found myself forgetting who was who 0 
we are sending it back 0 
the scenes are often funny and occasionally touching as the characters evaluate their lives and where they are going 1 
i must say i have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again 1 
i advise you to look out for it 1 
that just screams legit in my booksomethats also pretty rare here in vegas 1 
what this film lacks is a convincing script 0 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
you need at least 3 mins to get to your phone book from the time you first turn on the phonebattery life is short 0 
back to good bbq lighter fare reasonable pricing and tell the public they are back to the old ways 1 
the steak and the shrimp are in my opinion the best entrees at gc 1 
the plot has more holes than a pair of fishnet stockings and the direction and editing is astonishingly ham fisted 0 
i love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it 1 
i recently had problems where i could not stay connected for more than 10 minutes before being disconnected 0 
that was done in the second movie 0 
the cast was great 1 
the fried rice was dry as well 0 
wow loved this place 1 
some may say this buffet is pricey but i think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot 1 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
overall i wasnt very impressed with noca 0 
omelets are to die for 1 
coming here is like experiencing an underwhelming relationship where both parties cant wait for the other person to ask to break up 0 
this blueant supertooth handsfree phone speaker is awesome 1 
this place deserves one star and 90 has to do with the food 0 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
very clear quality sound and you dont have to mess with the sound on your ipod since you have the sound buttons on the headset 1 
good price 1 
some may say this buffet is pricey but i think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot 1 
as an earlier review noted plug in this charger and nothing happens 0 
it is worth the drive 1 
the fries were great too 1 
krussel always good 1 
the sides are delish mixed mushrooms yukon gold puree white corn beateous 1 
never going back 0 
unfortunately it was not good 0 
the cow tongue and cheek tacos are amazing 1 
i think it was robert ryans best film because he portrayed someone like my father and he was a schizophrenic in real lifemy father although he never murdered anyone but was affected more so during the second world war which made him worse 1 
poor voice clarity 0 
the dialogue is composed of things that make little sense 0 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
but storm trooper is not even bad enough to make it to the list of wonderfully terrible movies 0 
and those baby owls were adorable 1 
and i just love the colors 1 
i probably would not go here again 0 
i saw this film over christmas and what a great film it was 1 
i would not recommend this place 0 
very disappointing 0 
love it great armband 1 
battery life is also great 1 
problem is that the ear loops are made of weak material and break easily 0 
im returning them 0 
i give wirefly 1 stari will contact cingularatt and inform them of this practice 0 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
everything captain howdy says is either laughable or just plain stupid 0 
poor voice clarity 0 
left very frustrated 0 
unfortunately it was not good 0 
this case seems well made 1 
the attractive set used throughout most of the film is an eyepleasing gem 1 
this review is long overdue since i consider a tale of two sisters to be the single greatest film ever made 1 
end of days is one of the worst bigbudget action movies ive ever seen 0 
there is no real plot 0 
i have tried these cables with my computer and my ipod and it works just fine 1 
i would recommend it 1 
overall i am psyched to have a phone which has all my appointments and contacts in and gets great reception 1 
if you want a sandwich just go to any firehouse 1 
i advise everyone do not be fooled 0 
i am also very happy with the price 1 
works for me 1 
on three different occasions i asked for well done or medium well and all three times i got the bloodiest piece of meat on my plate 0 
much better than the other ayce sushi place i went to in vegas 1 
the buffet at bellagio was far from what i anticipated 0 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
i really loved the story line and the poler bear was kinda cutebut if anyone has a question about fort steele just ask away 1 
for a product that costs as much as this one does i expect it to work far better and with greater ease than this thing does 0 
again lame 0 
my 5year old nokia 2160 from tracfone holds the charge a lot better than this 0 
they have horrible attitudes towards customers and talk down to each one when customers dont enjoy their food 0 
i had ordered a motorola data cable got a very well finished and working product 1 
we sat another ten minutes and finally gave up and left 0 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
cant say enough good things about this place 1 
the fish is badly made and some of its underwater shots are repeated a thousand times in the film 0 
im not sure what he was trying to do with this film 0 
avoid at any and all costs 0 
my fiancé and i came in the middle of the day and we were greeted and seated right away 1 
good item low price 1 
im super pissd 0 
i have yet to run this new battery below two bars and thats three days without charging 1 
very tough and very short on flavor 0 
an hour seriously 0 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
i ate there twice on my last visit and especially enjoyed the salmon salad 1 
eew this location needs a complete overhaul 0 
just does not work 0 
disappointing experience 0 
i am going to have to be the first to negatively review this product 0 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
its a little geeky but i think thats its sex on toast and it rocks and oozes sex right down to its battery embedded sleek stylish leather case 1 
definitely worth seeing its the sort of thought provoking film that forces you to question your own threshold of loneliness 1 
you wont forget this movie 1 
and if that isnt enough of a mess of a movie for you the picture is also marred with a constant use of studio sets and indoor exteriors 0 
you could drive a semi truck into these holes 0 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
but in any case the best part is you can download these pictures to your laptop using ir or even send pictures from your laptop to the phone 1 
2 times very bad customer service 0 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
sooooo good 1 
avoid this one if you can 0 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
due to this happening on every call i was forced to stop using this headset 0 
10 out of 10 stars 1 
it is a joy to use 1 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
i can assure you that you wont be disappointed 1 
waited and waited and waited 0 
saw the movie today and thought it was a good effort good messages for kids 1 
very disappointing 0 
its pure brilliance 1 
will go back next trip out 1 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
very disappointing 0 
their regular toasted bread was equally satisfying with the occasional pats of butter mmmm 1 
the cinematographyif it can be called thatsucked 0 
he was terrible 0 
very dissapointing performance 0 
i knew when i saw the film that more great things were to come from this gifted actor 1 
everything was gross 0 
i would recommend saving room for this 1 
love this product 1 
ive dropped my phone more times than i can say even on concrete and my phone is still great knock on wood 1 
then the film just dropped the ball 0 
does not fit 0 
horrible dont waste your time and money 0 
the fish is badly made and some of its underwater shots are repeated a thousand times in the film 0 
it works 1 
i paid too much 0 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
service is friendly and inviting 1 
its too bad that everyone else involved didnt share crowes level of dedication to quality for if they did wed have a far better film on our hands than this subpar mess 0 
i will never go back to this place and will never ever recommended this place to anyone 0 
they made this case too small and is very difficult to install 0 
the shower area is outside so you can only rinse not take a full shower unless you dont mind being nude for everyone to see 0 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
very disappointed 0 
i would recommend saving room for this 1 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
works good 1 
i would not recommend this place 0 
i saw this short film on hbo the other day and absolutely loved it 1 
overall i would recommend this phone over the new walkman 1 
go rent it 1 
it was attached to a gas station and that is rarely a good sign 0 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
my salad had a bland vinegrette on the baby greens and hearts of palm 0 
the sound is clear and the people i talk to on it are amazed at the quality too 1 
clever and a real crowdpleaserthis film still ranks among mickeys best films even after 80 wonderful years 1 
lange had become a great actress 1 
lange had become a great actress 1 
a fantastic neighborhood gem 1 
summary the witticisms werent witty 0 
once you get inside youll be impressed with the place 1 
rude inconsiderate management 0 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
mic doesnt work 0 
if there were zero stars i would give it zero stars 0 
mark my words this is one of those cult films like evil dead 2 or phantasm that people will still be discovering and falling in love with 20 30 40 years down the line 1 
beautiful styling though 1 
excellent product 1 
the chefs were friendly and did a good job 1 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
this place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver 0 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
but the premise of the film was so ridiculous that the president of the us 0 
excellent starter wireless headset 0 
wow loved this place 1 
the flair bartenders are absolutely amazing 1 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
lovely little thriller from hitchcock with lots of nice shenanigans surrounding a murdered spy a kidnapped child a nasty church a foreign plot and some random taxidermists 1 
in other words the content level of this film is enough to easily fill a dozen other films 1 
they have a plethora of salads and sandwiches and everything ive tried gets my seal of approval 1 
id rather eat airline food seriously 0 
service is perfect and the family atmosphere is nice to see 1 
used and dirty 0 
the film succeeds despite or perhaps because of an obviously meagre budget 1 
the food is not tasty at all not to say its real traditional hunan style 0 
about half way through this film i started to dislike it 0 
magical help 1 
an italian reviewer called this a small great film and thats right 1 
the jabra eargels fit my ears very well 1 
you get what you pay for i guess 0 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
cheap but hey it works was pleasantly suprised given the low cost of this item 1 
really bad 0 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
first the bathrooms at this location were dirty seat covers were not replenished just plain yucky 0 
good protection and does not make phone too bulky 1 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
the pairing of the two devices was so easy it barely took a couple minutes before i started making calls with the voice dialing feature 1 
putting the race card aside lets look at the major flaw in the film they destroy latifas character 0 
the chips and sals a here is amazing 1 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
what happened next was prettyoff putting 0 
you get what you pay for i guess 0 
now we were chosen to be tortured with this disgusting piece of blatant american propaganda 0 
not much seafood and like 5 strings of pasta at the bottom 0 
this item worked great but it broke after 6 months of use 0 
better than expected 1 
i knew when i saw the film that more great things were to come from this gifted actor 1 
rip off over charge shipping 0 
though the wind and the lion is told largely through the eyes of the son every member of the family can identify with one of the characters whether it be sean connerys noble brigand candace bergens feisty heroine john hustons wily john hay or steve kanalys spiffy radiant ruthless cando lieutenant roosevelts big stick 1 
in my house i was getting dropped coverage upstairs and no coverage in my basement 0 
this is a simple little phone to use but the breakage is unacceptible 0 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
seafood was limited to boiled shrimp and crab legs but the crab legs definitely did not taste fresh 0 
i know this is not like the other restaurants at all something is very off here 0 
great phone 1 
good prices 1 
dont waste your time watching this rubbish nonresearched film 0 
then our food came out disappointment ensued 0 
the fact is this film is a wonderful heartwarming tale about two people chasing their dreams 1 
the writer gorman bechard undoubtedly did his homework because all references are industry and characterage appropriate 1 
i couldnt think of a better way to end the film but a smile on my face great way to wrap up an amazing film and trilogy 1 
you could only take 2 videos at a time and the quality was very poor 0 
worked perfectly 1 
it was equally awful 0 
total waste of time 0 
main thing i didnt enjoy is that the crowd is of older crowd around mid 30s and up 0 
i dont know what kind it is but they have the best iced tea 1 
eew this location needs a complete overhaul 0 
the fries were not hot and neither was my burger 0 
started watching this but didnt believe in any of the characters 0 
the chips and salsa were really good the salsa was very fresh 1 
we arent ones to make a scene at restaurants but i just dont get itdefinitely lost the love after this one 0 
will be back again 1 
great phone 1 
full of unconvincing cardboard characters it is blandly written by edward chodorov who also produced and is surprisingly directed by jean negulesco from whom one would expect a great deal more 0 
youd have to have the iq of particularly stupid mollusk not to see that one coming 0 
i connected my wifes bluetoothmotorola hs850 to my phone and it worked like a charm whether the phone was in my pocket or the case 1 
lightweight and works well 1 
works well 1 
definitely a turn off for me i doubt ill be back unless someone else is buying 0 
this particular model would not work with my motorola q smartphone 0 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
i received my headset in good time and was happy with it 1 
we would recommend these to others 1 
that being said for a phone the camera is very nice many cool effects to play with and video is decent as well 1 
great place to eat reminds me of the little mom and pop shops in the san francisco bay area 1 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
really awful 0 
the phone was unusable and was not new 0 
you also cannot take pictures with it in the case because the lense is covered 0 
this is a disgrace 0 
i have two more years left in this contract and i hate this phone 0 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
the worst was the salmon sashimi 0 
an amazing finale to possibly the best trilogy of all time 1 
excellent product 1 
we walked away stuffed and happy about our first vegas buffet experience 1 
hard to judge whether these sides were good because we were grossed out by the melted styrofoam and didnt want to eat it for fear of getting sick 0 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
i as well wouldve given godfathers zero stars if possible 0 
if you look for authentic thai food go else where 0 
its practically perfect in all of them  a true masterpiece in a sea of faux masterpieces 1 
their menu is diverse and reasonably priced 1 
predictable but not a bad watch 1 
once your food arrives its meh 0 
then i exchanged for the same phone even that had the same problem 0 
phone now holds charge like it did when it was new 1 
they really want to make your experience a good one 1 
both rickman and stowe play their roles to the hilt in this tale of a childrens book writer who maybe has written a subversive tract 1 
it was a good thing that the tickets only cost five dollars because i would be mad if id have paid 750 to see this crap 0 
the sergeant pepper beef sandwich with auju sauce is an excellent sandwich as well 1 
nothing special 0 
we walked away stuffed and happy about our first vegas buffet experience 1 
i have recommended it to friends 1 
good price 1 
see it with your kids if you have a chanceit will open up some amazing dialog about how far race relations have come in the last 50 years 1 
its like a really sexy party in your mouth where youre outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party 1 
very very sad 0 
as a courtroom drama its compelling as an indictment on the american justice system its frightening 1 
these are the central themes of the film and they are handled ineptly stereotypically and with no depth of imagination 0 
avoid at any and all costs 0 
great charger 1 
for a product that costs as much as this one does i expect it to work far better and with greater ease than this thing does 0 
schrader has made a resume full of lousy amateurish films 0 
it was so funny 1 
every time he opened his mouth you expect to hear you see kids pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show 0 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
truly awful 0 
even worse than ticker 0 
i love the pho and the spring rolls oh so yummy you have to try 1 
how can you call yourself a steakhouse if you cant properly cook a steak i dont understand 0 
it is an excellent drama an excellent thriller and an excellent film 1 
i would highly recommend this product 1 
i bought this to use with my kindle fire and absolutely loved it 1 
it shouldnt take 30 min for pancakes and eggs 0 
this movie is bad 0 
the menu is always changing food quality is going down service is extremely slow 0 
great product 1 
not a pleasant voyage of selfdiscovery 0 
it ranks highly as a great noircrimedrama incredible performances by belmondo and lino ventura 1 
it is rare when a filmmaker takes the time to tell a worthy moral tale with care and love that doesnt fall into the trap of being overly syrupy or over indulgent 1 
i thought errol flynn was brilliant as custer and has since become my favourite actor 1 
an extensive menu provides lots of options for breakfast 1 
if you love authentic mexican food and want a whole bunch of interesting yet delicious meats to choose from you need to try this place 1 
not loud enough and doesnt turn on like it should 0 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
good audio quality 1 
funny clever hip just like prays previous film hype 1 
now imagine that every single one of those decisions was made wrong 0 
the results well are a shame 0 
really awful 0 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
good food good service 1 
the best scene in the movie was when gerardo is trying to find a song that keeps running through his head 1 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
portable and it works 1 
check it out 1 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
it really is impressive that the place hasnt closed down 0 
i want my money back 0 
youll love how thin it is 1 
ive had this bluetoooth headset for some time now and still not comfortable with the way it fits on the ear 0 
i might have gotten a defect but i would not risk buying it again because of the built quality alone 0 
i really loved the story line and the poler bear was kinda cutebut if anyone has a question about fort steele just ask away 1 
my husband and i ate lunch here and were very disappointed with the food and service 0 
buttons are too small 0 
however after about a year the fliptop started to get loose and wobbly and eventually my screen went black and i couldnt receive and place calls 0 
everything on the menu is terrific and we were also thrilled that they made amazing accommodations for our vegetarian daughter 1 
it is so small and you dont even realize that it is there after a while of getting used to it 1 
the voice recognition thru the handset is excellent 1 
my sanyo has survived dozens of drops on blacktop without ill effect 1 
lame would be the best way to describe it 0 
but the movie makes a lot of serious mistakes 0 
good product good seller 1 
the characters are interesting and you want to find out more about them the longer the movie goes on and i think people will be surprised by who does and doesnt make it 1 
nicest chinese restaurant ive been in a while 1 
it was not good 0 
i was deeply impressed with the character he played 1 
i advise everyone do not be fooled 0 
the loudspeaker option is great the bumpers with the lights is very appealing 0 
im so sorry but i really cant recommend it to anyone 0 
it features an outlandish array of memorable psychotic but lovable nuts 1 
i was very excited to get this headset because i thought it was really cute 1 
i love lane but ive never seen her in a movie this lousy 0 
i have been to very few places to eat that under no circumstances would i ever return to and this tops the list 0 
i was able to do voice dialing in the car with no problem 1 
w810i is just superb 1 
we recently witnessed her poor quality of management towards other guests as well 0 
very dissapointing performance 0 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
also great directing and photography 1 
but it is great i would really recommend it 1 
i believe the screenwriter did a good job of tying up the loose ends 1 
emily watsons character is very strong and she has only to give a quick glance and you understand everything 1 
for that its worth checking out 1 
this if the first movie ive given a 10 to in years 1 
seriously flavorful delights folks 1 
nice sound 1 
the structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema 1 
phone falls out easily 0 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
i especially love the long battery life 1 
the first thing that happened was that the tracking was off 0 
this case has passed the one year mark and while it shows signs of wear it is 100 functional 1 
an extensive menu provides lots of options for breakfast 1 
restaurant is always full but never a wait 1 
it is practically useless and did not add any kind of boost to my reception after i bought it 0 
absolutely great 1 
the food came out at a good pace 1 
its one of the movies i need to see whenever it comes on tvnever mind the fact that i already have it memorized 1 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
i really recommend this faceplates since it looks very nice elegant and cool 1 
service sucks 0 
you have to hold the phone at a particular angle for the other party to hear you clearly 0 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
will be back again 1 
a happy wonderful feel good ending 1 
a very charming film with wonderful sentiment and heart 1 
end of days is one of the worst bigbudget action movies ive ever seen 0 
strike 2 who wants to be rushed 0 
the secondary plot line is incomprehensible and its relation to the primary plot line is mystifying 0 
i keep watching it over and over 1 
in fact this stinker smells like a directtovideo release 0 
ive had this for nearly 2 years and it has worked great for me 1 
the salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop which was perfectly cooked 1 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
definitely will come back here again 1 
insults profound deuchebaggery and had to go outside for a smoke break while serving just to solidify it 0 
ray charles is legendary 1 
the ending is so so perfect youll shed a tear 1 
unless youre just out to visually collect all extant films of austens work you can skip this one 0 
crust is not good 0 
point your finger at any item on the menu order it and you wont be disappointed 1 
doesnt do the job 0 
the movie showed a lot of florida at its best made it look very appealing 1 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
also the area where my unit broke im not too fond of the magnetic strap 0 
i really liked that 1 
i own 2 of these cases and would order another 1 
i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
an interesting premise and billy drago is always good as a dangerous nutbag side note id love to see drago stephen mchattie and lance hendrikson in a flick together talk about raging cheekbones 1 
i checked everywhere and there is no feature for it which is really disappointing 0 
host staff were for lack of a better word bitches 0 
so anyone near you will hear part of your conversation 0 
call me a nut but i think this is one of the best movies ever 1 
unreliable im giving up 0 
i am sorry i made this purchase 0 
his costars dont fare much better with people like morgan freeman jonah hill and ed helms just wasted 0 
he is an amazing film artist one of the most important whoever lived 1 
however after seeing the short again after about 25 years i was amazed at how timeless the film actually is 1 
cinematography noteworthy including fine views of barcelona and its famed gaudi towers 1 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
the cast is good 1 
im in az all the time and now have my new spot 1 
hard to judge whether these sides were good because we were grossed out by the melted styrofoam and didnt want to eat it for fear of getting sick 0 
appetite instantly gone 0 
we wont be returning 0 
in my house i was getting dropped coverage upstairs and no coverage in my basement 0 
the han nan chicken was also very tasty 1 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
after the disappointing dinner we went elsewhere for dessert 0 
the food is rich so order accordingly 1 
i advise everyone do not be fooled 0 
great time family dinner on a sunday night 1 
lastly the mozzarella sticks they were the best thing we ordered 1 
so i basically threw my money out the window for nothing 0 
the potatoes were great and so was the biscuit 1 
i had strawberry tea which was good 1 
the restaurant is very clean and has a family restaurant feel to it 1 
the chips and sals a here is amazing 1 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
it holds a charge for a long time is reasonably comfortable under longwearing conditions and the quality of sound is tremendous 1 
i got the aluminum case for my new palm vx and it worked really wellit has protected my handheld perfectly so far 1 
waaaaaayyyyyyyyyy over rated is all i am saying 0 
do not buy for d807wrongly advertised for d807 0 
this is definitely a cult classic well worth viewing and sharing with others 1 
i love being able to use one headset for both by landline and cell 1 
the buffet at bellagio was far from what i anticipated 0 
definitely not worth the 3 i paid 0 
id love to go back 1 
when my mom and i got home she immediately got sick and she only had a few bites of salad 0 
just what i wanted 1 
this place is not worth your time let alone vegas 0 
highly recommended a 1 
id rather eat airline food seriously 0 
it rocked my world and is certainly a must see for anyone with no social or physical outlets 1 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
i have tried these cables with my computer and my ipod and it works just fine 1 
we loved the place 1 
host staff were for lack of a better word bitches 0 
everything was gross 0 
tom wilkinson broke my heart at the end and everyone elses judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike 1 
yes this film does require a rather significant amount of puzzlesolving but the pieces fit together to create a beautiful picture 1 
just what i wanted 1 
defective crap 0 
the construction of the headsets is poor 0 
it was horrendous 0 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
a usable keyboard actually turns a pda into a realworld useful machine instead of just a neat gadget 1 
but now i was completely grossed out 0 
jabra ear gels r the best 1 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
very good product well made 1 
krussel always good 1 
the reception has been generally good 1 
disappointing experience 0 
i work in the hospitality industry in paradise valley and have refrained from recommending cibo any longer 0 
do not waste your time 0 
it was so bad i had lost the heart to finish it 0 
there is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again 0 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
so badwellits just bad 0 
the color is even prettier than i thought it would be and the graphics are incredibly sharp 1 
my only problem is i thought the actor playing the villain was a low rent michael ironside 0 
it was a long time that i didnt see a so charismatic actor on screen 1 
definitely worth checking out 1 
the incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film 1 
this was one of the worst films i have ever seen 0 
the buttons for on and off are bad 0 
poor voice clarity 0 
it is an excellent drama an excellent thriller and an excellent film 1 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
the very idea of it was lame take a minor character from a mediocre pg13 film and make a complete nonsequel while changing its tone to a pgrated family movie 0 
i would recommend it 1 
but this movie is definitely a below average rent 0 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
there is however some pretty good acting at least for this type of film 1 
exactly what i wanted 1 
we walked away stuffed and happy about our first vegas buffet experience 1 
trying to make a call on these is an exercise in frustration 0 
the chicken i got was definitely reheated and was only ok the wedges were cold and soggy 0 
we waited for forty five minutes in vain 0 
omit watching this 0 
one nice thing was that they added gratuity on the bill since our party was larger than 6 or 8 and they didnt expect more tip than that 1 
it was so cool 1 
ordered burger rare came in well done 0 
but this movie really got to me 1 
even worse than ticker 0 
i like the fact that it rests lightly against your ear rather than inside 1 
items stated as included from the description are not included 0 
the ambience is wonderful and there is music playing 1 
you get what you pay for i guess 0 
i wasted my little money with this earpiece 0 
the waiter wasnt helpful or friendly and rarely checked on us 0 
omit watching this 0 
if you stay in vegas you must get breakfast here at least once 1 
very disappointing 0 
an awesome new look for fall 2000 1 
verizon tech support walked my through a few procedures none of which worked and i ended up having to do a hard reset wiping out all my data 0 
i had a seriously solid breakfast here 1 
great character actors telly savalas and peter boyle 1 
this is the first phone ive had that has been so cheaply made 0 
his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic 1 
it was that loudglad to say that the plantronics 510 maintains a flawless connection to my cell and with no static during normal use 1 
i can take a little bad service but the food sucks 0 
obviously they have a terrible customer service so you get what you pay for 0 
everyone is very attentive providing excellent customer service 1 
same problem as others have mentioned 0 
piece of junk 0 
this is an excellent tool especially when paired with your phones autoanswer 1 
the design is very odd as the ear clip is not very comfortable at all 0 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
this film highlights the fundamental flaws of the legal process that its not about discovering guilt or innocence but rather is about who presents better in court 1 
you could only take 2 videos at a time and the quality was very poor 0 
also its slim enough to fit into my alarm clock docking station without removing the case 1 
but this movie is definitely a below average rent 0 
i would advise to not purchase this item it never worked very well 0 
i would recommend purchasing the jabra jx10 series 2 which works flawlessly with my moto q go figure 1 
they do not care about the consumer one bit 0 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
yes its that bad 0 
product is useless since it does not have enough charging current to charge the 2 cellphones i was planning to use it with 0 
great software for motorolas 1 
great software for motorolas 1 
i must say i have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again 1 
overall a great experience 1 
ordered burger rare came in well done 0 
for people who are first timers in film making i think they did an excellent job 1 
over rated 0 
it was a very superficial movie and it gave me the feeling that i was watching play rather than a film 0 
the result is a powerhouse achievement made more timely now perhaps because of our cultures disturbing fascination with celebrity and its distorted interpretations of fame 1 
the block was amazing 1 
the movie lacks visual interest drama expression of feeling and celebration of the very patriotism that underlines the narrative 0 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
wont go back 0 
they have great dinners 1 
this movie does an excellent job of revealing the complexity of the task and the incredible challenges facing south africa 1 
i am very impressed with the job that motorola did on the sturdiness of this phone 1 
the chicken i got was definitely reheated and was only ok the wedges were cold and soggy 0 
the phone crashed completely and now i have to get it replaced 0 
it plays louder than any other speaker of this size the price is so low that most would think the quality is lacking however its not 1 
everything about this product is wrongfirst 0 
in short dont bother with this movie 0 
unfortunately it was not good 0 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
if you love authentic mexican food and want a whole bunch of interesting yet delicious meats to choose from you need to try this place 1 
none of it works just dont buy it 0 
i hate writing bad reviews about films especially those in which i really like the star but this film is so bad i dont believe for one second that anyone could have been proud of it 0 
today the graphics are crap 0 
emily watsons character is very strong and she has only to give a quick glance and you understand everything 1 
it was an inexpensive piece but i would still have expected better quality 0 
the eargels channel the sound directly into your ear and seem to increase the sound volume and clarity 1 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
very bad performance plays angela bennett a computer expert who is at home all the time 0 
now we were chosen to be tortured with this disgusting piece of blatant american propaganda 0 
the plot simply rumbles on like a machine desperately depending on the addition of new scenes 0 
i love this device 1 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
overpriced for what you are getting 0 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
this convention never worked well in the past and certainly doesnt work here 0 
furthermore you cant even find hours of operation on the website 0 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
probably not in a hurry to go back 0 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
ample portions and good prices 1 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
at around 4 pm i bought it at around 8pm i started to watch at around 815pm i fast forwarded the remaining film to see if there was anything left watchable for a human being with a brain but there wasnt 0 
but it is great i would really recommend it 1 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
shrimp when i unwrapped it i live only 12 a mile from brushfire it was literally ice cold 0 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
glad i didnt pay to see it 0 
worst hour and a half of my lifeoh my gosh 0 
an instant classic with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits 1 
first of all there are enough racial stereotypes and racial jokes to offend everyone 0 
bad fit way too big 0 
those phones are working just fine now 1 
conclusion i loved it 1 
used and dirty 0 
im very disappointed with my decision 0 
the cocktails are all handmade and delicious 1 
i just cant explain this movie more than romanticcharminghilariousand adorablethe junkyard scenes are funnyall the junkyard dogs have something specialtoo funny i laughedkids will love itbuy it when it comes outit has new features 1 
ive never been treated so bad 0 
the fries were great too 1 
obviously they have a terrible customer service so you get what you pay for 0 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
this case has passed the one year mark and while it shows signs of wear it is 100 functional 1 
its the best headset i have used 1 
if there is a wind it is completely useless 0 
it has a great camera thats 2mp and the pics are nice and clear with great picture quality 1 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
disappointed 0 
so far so good 1 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
very very sad 0 
it was equally awful 0 
conclusion i loved it 1 
the construction of the headsets is poor 0 
definitely not worth the 3 i paid 0 
no plot whatsoever 0 
the bathroom is just next door and very nice 1 
judith light is one of my favorite actresses and i think she does a superb job in this film 1 
i can assure you that you wont be disappointed 1 
thank you for such great service 1 
all in all i think it was a good investment 1 
the ri style calamari was a joke 0 
the chips that came out were dripping with grease and mostly not edible 0 
i didnt know pulled pork could be soooo delicious 1 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
service was good and the company was better 1 
first off the reception sucks i have never had more than 2 bars ever 0 
we had 7 at our table and the service was pretty fast 1 
the handsfree part works fine but then the car tries to download the address book and the treo rebootsoverall i still rate this device high 1 
i dont have very many words to say about this place but it does everything pretty well 1 
seriously its not worth wasting your or your kids time on 0 
the scenes are often funny and occasionally touching as the characters evaluate their lives and where they are going 1 
i paid too much 0 
i have had problems wit hit dropping signal and more 0 
due to this happening on every call i was forced to stop using this headset 0 
this is a disgrace 0 
another thing i didnt really like is when a character got punched in the face a gallon of blood would spew forth soon after 0 
the scenery that the two daughters paint and photograph are beautiful 1 
i can barely ever hear on it and am constantly saying what 0 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
ive never been treated so bad 0 
everything on the menu is terrific and we were also thrilled that they made amazing accommodations for our vegetarian daughter 1 
cheap but hey it works was pleasantly suprised given the low cost of this item 1 
its a total package 1 
their regular toasted bread was equally satisfying with the occasional pats of butter mmmm 1 
that one didnt work either 0 
however my girl was complain that some time the phone doesnt wake up like normal phone does 0 
as a courtroom drama its compelling as an indictment on the american justice system its frightening 1 
when i placed my treo into the case not only was it not snug but there was a lot of extra room on the sides 0 
and the accents are absolutely abysmal 0 
he is one of my favourite directors and one of the most talented directors in the history of cinema 1 
weird vibe from owners 0 
one of the worst shows of all time 0 
it is wonderful and inspiring to watch and i hope that it gets released again on to video or dvd 1 
no complaints 1 
i would recommend purchasing the jabra jx10 series 2 which works flawlessly with my moto q go figure 1 
worst service to boot but that is the least of their worries 0 
frozen pucks of disgust with some of the worst people behind the register 0 
in my house i was getting dropped coverage upstairs and no coverage in my basement 0 
the performances are real and gripping the crocdodile is extremely well done indeed if the black water website is to be believed thats because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous 1 
great place to eat reminds me of the little mom and pop shops in the san francisco bay area 1 
i connected my wifes bluetoothmotorola hs850 to my phone and it worked like a charm whether the phone was in my pocket or the case 1 
this is the kind of money that is wasted properly 1 
an hour seriously 0 
its practically perfect in all of them  a true masterpiece in a sea of faux masterpieces 1 
i totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is 1 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
if you see it you should probably just leave it on the shelf 0 
i had ordered a motorola data cable got a very well finished and working product 1 
plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job 1 
i can barely ever hear on it and am constantly saying what 0 
i struggle to find anything bad to say about it 1 
damn good steak 1 
i had about two bites and refused to eat anymore 0 
i wasnt the least bit interested 0 
it is light has plenty of battery capacity and is very confortable to wear for somewhat extended periods of time 1 
the plantains were the worst ive ever tasted 0 
i give wirefly 1 stari will contact cingularatt and inform them of this practice 0 
same problem as others have mentioned 0 
krussel always good 1 
if you want healthy authentic or ethic food try this place 1 
this movie is greatespecially if you enjoy visual arts 1 
will never ever go back and have told many people what had happened 0 
i would recommend it 1 
this is a bad film with bad writing and good actorsan ugly cartoon crafted by paul haggis for people who cant handle anything but the bold strokes in storytellinga picture painted with crayons 0 
adapter does not provide enough charging current 0 
the real killer is the volume and of course it breaking 0 
the restaurant is very clean and has a family restaurant feel to it 1 
very serious spoilers this movie was a huge disappointment 0 
it was a long time that i didnt see a so charismatic actor on screen 1 
the grilled chicken was so tender and yellow from the saffron seasoning 1 
we wont be going back anytime soon 0 
better than expected 1 
i especially love the long battery life 1 
this place receives stars for their appetizers 1 
this place should honestly be blown up 0 
my mother and brother had to do thiswhen i saw robert ryan portraying this type of man it was a very good imitation of this type of individual and i was impressed 1 
lots of holes in the script 0 
the spaghetti is nothing special whatsoever 0 
an hour seriously 0 
the grilled chicken was so tender and yellow from the saffron seasoning 1 
the two main characters may be two of the most believable children i ever saw put on screen 1 
the eargels channel the sound directly into your ear and seem to increase the sound volume and clarity 1 
any grandmother can make a roasted chicken better than this one 0 
just whatever you do avoid groove as its the antithesis of all that is good about human traffic 0 
generous portions and great taste 1 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
i came over from verizon because cingulair has nicer cell phones the first thing i noticed was the really bad service 0 
the cg opening sequence in space looked like it could have been created on microsoft slideshow for gods sake 0 
camerawork again bad 0 
the warm beer didnt help 0 
its this pandering to the audience that sabotages most of his films 0 
dont do it 0 
phenomenal food service and ambiance 1 
i know this is not like the other restaurants at all something is very off here 0 
see it with your kids if you have a chanceit will open up some amazing dialog about how far race relations have come in the last 50 years 1 
his performance as awarded was stunning 1 
poor voice clarity 0 
the jabra eargels fit my ears very well 1 
its worth driving up from tucson 1 
my gyro was basically lettuce only 0 
110 and only because there is no setting for 010 0 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
product is useless since it does not have enough charging current to charge the 2 cellphones i was planning to use it with 0 
i was sitting in my vehicle with the cradle on my belt and the headset lost signal 0 
i would not recommend this place 0 
if you stay in vegas you must get breakfast here at least once 1 
hes a national treasure 1 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
cinematography noteworthy including fine views of barcelona and its famed gaudi towers 1 
it also took her forever to bring us the check when we asked for it 0 
pretty piece of junk 0 
exactly what i wanted 1 
worked perfectly 1 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
much less than the jawbone i was going to replace it with 1 
the food sucked which we expected but it sucked more than we could have imagined 0 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
saw the movie today and thought it was a good effort good messages for kids 1 
the cast is always entertaining as usual 1 
after 3 months screen just went black all of a sudden 0 
it was horrendous 0 
the plastic breaks really easy on this clip 0 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in 0 
i had about two bites and refused to eat anymore 0 
crust is not good 0 
so bad 0 
i have purchased these for both family and friends and all enjoy their clarity and ease of use 1 
if you are looking for a good quality motorola headset keep looking this isnt it 0 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
its a little geeky but i think thats its sex on toast and it rocks and oozes sex right down to its battery embedded sleek stylish leather case 1 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
there is a totally unnecessary trainroller coaster scene 0 
maybe there would be a reasonable explanation for this atrocity 0 
the pleather case doesnt fit 0 
i wasnt the least bit interested 0 
great charger 1 
it makes very strange ticking noises before it ends the call 0 
but it does get better reception and clarity than any phone ive had before 1 
avoid at any and all costs 0 
the directing and the cinematography arent quite as good 0 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
perhaps i caught them on an off night judging by the other reviews but im not inspired to go back 0 
i could barely stomach the meal but didnt complain because it was a business lunch 0 
i just wanted to leave 0 
left very frustrated 0 
there are many continuity errors one other user commented on different cars in the garage joes glassesthe one that got to me the most was the fact joes facial hair configuration seemed to change from scene to scene 0 
i think the most wonderful parts literally full of wonder are the excerpts from his works 1 
because both ears are occupied background is not distracting at all 1 
the script is a big flawed mess 0 
bought mainly for the charger which broke soon after purchasing 0 
the waitress and manager are so friendly 1 
its practically perfect in all of them  a true masterpiece in a sea of faux masterpieces 1 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
it was a waste of my money 0 
the classic maine lobster roll was fantastic 1 
bland and flavorless is a good way of describing the barely tepid meat 0 
definitely a bargain 1 
everything was good and tasty 1 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
total letdown i would much rather just go to the camelback flower shop and cartel coffee 0 
which has more depth and character than the man underneath it 0 
this review is long overdue since i consider a tale of two sisters to be the single greatest film ever made 1 
sucked most of the stuff does not work with my phone 0 
spend your money and time some place else 0 
i was deeply impressed with the character he played 1 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
wont go back 0 
tried to go here for lunch and it was a madhouse 0 
he was terrible 0 
doesnt hold charge 0 
gets a signal when other verizon phones wont 1 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
the instruction manual is lacking 0 
ordered an appetizer and took 40 minutes and then the pizza another 10 minutes 0 
the basic premise is wasted since it is sidelined by the inexplicable focus on the documentary crew 0 
reasonably priced also 1 
sorry i will not be getting food from here anytime soon 0 
say bye bye to your tip lady 0 
the company shipped my product very promptly and it works well 1 
i let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this bad idea we both hated it 0 
i cant tell you how disappointed i was 0 
but now i was completely grossed out 0 
that was done in the second movie 0 
the veggitarian platter is out of this world 1 
this is an excellent tool especially when paired with your phones autoanswer 1 
and sometimes it was so embarrassing that i had to look away 0 
very disappointed 0 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
this gets a 1 out of 10 simply because theres nothing lower 0 
the film gives meaning to the phrase never in the history of human conflict has so much been owed by so many to so few 1 
the staff is great the food is delish and they have an incredible beer selection 1 
their steaks are 100 recommended 1 
bland and flavorless is a good way of describing the barely tepid meat 0 
i could not recommend these more 0 
i was very disappointed 0 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
as a courtroom drama its compelling as an indictment on the american justice system its frightening 1 
we had 7 at our table and the service was pretty fast 1 
youd have to have the iq of particularly stupid mollusk not to see that one coming 0 
the burger i got the gold standard a 17 burger and was kind of disappointed 0 
my first visit to hiro was a delight 1 
the plantains were the worst ive ever tasted 0 
i had verizon 2 years ago and really liked their service 1 
almost everyone involved must be return to school acting is utterly predictable and bad script is pile of garbage all round 0 
i was mortified 0 
do not buy do not buyit sucks 0 
highly unprofessional and rude to a loyal patron 0 
great hands free device 1 
very friendly staff 1 
the mic there is a joke and the volume is quite low 0 
we are sending it back 0 
not a good bargain 0 
keep up the good work amazon 1 
battery life is also great 1 
it looked like a wonderful story 1 
it was either too cold not enough flavor or just bad 0 
the only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port irda 0 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
ray charles life provided excellent biographical material for the film which goes well beyond being just another movie about a musician 1 
greatno problems at all 1 
the potatoes were like rubber and you could tell they had been made up ahead of time being kept under a warmer 0 
from what my dinner companions told meeverything was very fresh with nice texture and taste 1 
this movie totally grates on my nerves 0 
end of days is one of the worst bigbudget action movies ive ever seen 0 
the meat was pretty dry i had the sliced brisket and pulled pork 0 
the kids are annoying 0 
everything about this film is simply incredible 1 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
items stated as included from the description are not included 0 
the jamaican mojitos are delicious 1 
and the sound quality is great 1 
i would advise to not purchase this item it never worked very well 0 
nevertheless yet another wonderful film from the great masters stable 1 
the story which was told so eloquently by francis ford coppola 25 years earlier really unfolds gradually and leaves room for the characters to develop 1 
however i recently watched the whole thing again on dvd and i was completely struck by how extremely stupid the storyline was how it contained holes inconsistencies and frankly a whole lot of crap and how horrid the dancing was 0 
itll be a regular stop on my trips to phoenix 1 
excellent sound battery life and inconspicuous to boot 1 
i exchanged the sony ericson z500a for this and im pretty happy with that decision 1 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
great case and price 1 
the best scene in the movie was when gerardo is trying to find a song that keeps running through his head 1 
however after finally watching this film i realized that not only had i had a closed mind to the brilliance it depicts i also found myself watching it over and over again 1 
i was mortified 0 
just really good so far probably the best bt headset i have ever had 1 
so i basically threw my money out the window for nothing 0 
my friend did not like his bloody mary 0 
some highlights great quality nigiri here 1 
of course the footage from the 70s was grainy but that only enhanced the film 1 
it felt like a very gripping intelligent stage play but without the overly theatrical feeling one actually gets from watching people on a stage which plays on everyones terror of a white lie escalating to monstrous consequences 1 
used and dirty 0 
not worth it 0 
this is an excellent film 1 
i can assure you that you wont be disappointed 1 
all in all ha long bay was a bit of a flop 0 
its pretty surprising that this wonderful film was made in 1949 as hollywood generally had its collective heads in the sand concerning black and white issues at that time 1 
its extremely slow and takes forever to do anything with it 0 
overpriced for what you are getting 0 
they have a really nice atmosphere 1 
yes its shiny on front side and i love it 1 
what a disappointment 0 
nice design and quality 1 
who in their right mind is gonna buy this battery 0 
the service was not up to par either 0 
not a good item it worked for a while then started having problems in my auto reverse tape player 0 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
truly awful 0 
bluetooth range is good a few days ago i left my phone in the trunk got a call and carried the conversation without a hitch 1 
i can barely ever hear on it and am constantly saying what 0 
this is definitely a cult classic well worth viewing and sharing with others 1 
the success of the film depends on the casting of sydney greenstreet as the alexander yardley character 1 
seriously killer hot chai latte 1 
it always cuts out and makes a beep beep beep sound then says signal failed 0 
the screen does get smudged easily because it touches your ear and face 0 
the steak was amazingrge fillet relleno was the best seafood plate i have ever had 1 
think it over when you plan to own this onethis sure is the last moto phone for me 0 
it deserves strong love 1 
the shrimp tender and moist 1 
cooked to perfection and the service was impeccable 1 
you can even take self portraits with the outside exterior display very cool 1 
comes with a strong light that you can use to light up your camera shots and even flash sos signals seriously 1 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
that company is a joke 0 
her role was played well 1 
we loved the biscuits 1 
the kids are very cool too 1 
their monster chicken fried steak and eggs is my all time favorite 1 
i would not recommend this place 0 
its a total package 1 
it was clear that she had the range and ability to pull off this part 1 
dont bother go to the store 0 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
the best place in vegas for breakfast just check out a sat or sun 1 
bluetooth range is good a few days ago i left my phone in the trunk got a call and carried the conversation without a hitch 1 
disappointed 0 
i dont think i will be back for a very long time 0 
very tough and very short on flavor 0 
how can anyone in their right mind ask for anything more from a movie than this 1 
just dont know why they were so slow 0 
if you hate earbugs avoid this phone by all means 0 
if there was ever an indication of a writer and a directors ability to meld two highly volatile temperaments into a seamless union of creativity then this is it 1 
i work in the hospitality industry in paradise valley and have refrained from recommending cibo any longer 0 
great bluetooth 1 
i love the camera its really pretty good quality 1 
i loved their mussels cooked in this wine reduction the duck was tender and their potato dishes were delicious 1 
i have had problems wit hit dropping signal and more 0 
conclusion i loved it 1 
nice leather 1 
essentially you can forget microsofts tech support 0 
really bad 0 
the waitress was friendly and happy to accomodate for veganveggie options 1 
it presents a idyllic yet serious portrayal of the ups and downs of the characters lives 1 
spend your money elsewhere 0 
it was a great phone 1 
this is an excellent tool especially when paired with your phones autoanswer 1 
this place has it 1 
omelets are to die for 1 
secondly hitchcock pretty much perfected the thriller and chase movie 1 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
110 and only because there is no setting for 010 0 
unfortunately the ability to actually know you are receiving a call is a rather important feature and this phone is pitiful in that respect 0 
ample portions and good prices 1 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
its fits like a glove and is strong secure and durable 1 
they brought a fresh batch of fries and i was thinking yay something warm but no 0 
the bottowm lineanother worthless cheap gimmick from sprint 0 
this is my new fav vegas buffet spot 1 
there is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again 0 
plus it was wellpaced and suited its relatively short run time 1 
it also had a new problem 0 
one more thing i can tolerate political incorrectness very well im all for artistic freedom and suspension of disbelief but the slavic female character was just too much 0 
we had fantastic service and were pleased by the atmosphere 1 
not easy to watch 0 
went in for happy hour great list of wines 1 
in fact its hard to remember that the part of ray charles is being acted and not played by the man himself 1 
its the best headset i have used 1 
dont waste your on this one 0 
dont waste your money and time 0 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
at least think to refill my water before i struggle to wave you over for 10 minutes 0 
you can even take self portraits with the outside exterior display very cool 1 
the real disappointment was our waiter 0 
ill even say it again  this is torture 0 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
wonderful lil tapas and the ambience made me feel all warm and fuzzy inside 1 
the lighting is awful 0 
the movie has almost no action scenes in it and very little comedy 0 
there is no plot or storyline 0 
the construction of the headsets is poor 0 
first of all there are enough racial stereotypes and racial jokes to offend everyone 0 
i wont be back 0 
characters are onedimensional even the good guys and especially the bad guys 0 
the battery works great 1 
nice blanket of moz over top but i feel like this was done to cover up the subpar food 1 
on three different occasions i asked for well done or medium well and all three times i got the bloodiest piece of meat on my plate 0 
from what my dinner companions told meeverything was very fresh with nice texture and taste 1 
they are so cool 1 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
service is also cute 1 
i was very excited to get this headset because i thought it was really cute 1 
i had a salad with the wings and some ice cream for dessert and left feeling quite satisfied 1 
great movie 1 
it was a great phone 1 
by this time our side of the restaurant was almost empty so there was no excuse 0 
the real killer is the volume and of course it breaking 0 
and i just love the colors 1 
they know how to make them here 1 
reception is terrible and full of static 0 
never been to hard rock casino before will never ever step forward in it again 0 
very disappointed and wondered how it could be in the oscar shortlist 0 
excellent service 1 
this was reflected not only in the cast but also in the belowpar script which borrowed much from the earlier classic 0 
jabra ear gels r the best 1 
great charger 1 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
it wasnt busy at all and now we know why 0 
with great sound effects and impressive special effects i cant recommend this movie enough 1 
but what really made it unwatchable was the direction 0 
this is definitely one of the better documentaries i have seen looking at family relationships and marriage 1 
your servers suck wait correction our server heimer sucked 0 
i had a pretty satifying experience 1 
i recently tried caballeros and i have been back every week since 1 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
perhaps my phone is defective but people cannot hear me when i use this 0 
i bought this phone as a replacement for my startac and have regretted it since 0 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
superb phone on a great network 1 
overall a great experience 1 
i could not stand to even watch it for very long for fear of losing iq 0 
i was bored throughout the whole damn thing 0 
we waited an hour for what was a breakfast i could have done 100 times better at home 0 
i would give this television series a 10 plus if i could 1 
its just lame 0 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
wont go back 0 
itll be a regular stop on my trips to phoenix 1 
i love the ownerchef his one authentic japanese cool dude 1 
there is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again 0 
the grilled chicken was so tender and yellow from the saffron seasoning 1 
took an hour to get our food only 4 tables in restaurant my food was luke warm our sever was running around like he was totally overwhelmed 0 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
and service was super friendly 1 
you could only take 2 videos at a time and the quality was very poor 0 
on three different occasions i asked for well done or medium well and all three times i got the bloodiest piece of meat on my plate 0 
fantastic buy and will get again for whatever my next phone is 1 
the sweet potato fries were very good and seasoned well 1 
cant say enough good things about this place 1 
a very very very slowmoving aimless movie about a distressed drifting young man 0 
the acting was decidely wooden though no worse than a period universal b movie 0 
this is the kind of money that is wasted properly 1 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
good product good seller 1 
it fits so securely that the ear hook does not even need to be used and the sound is better directed through your ear canal 1 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
highly recommended a 1 
i also decided not to send it back because our waitress looked like she was on the verge of having a heart attack 0 
however my girl was complain that some time the phone doesnt wake up like normal phone does 0 
gave up trying to eat any of the crust teeth still sore 0 
highly unrecommended 0 
dont buy this product it fails 0 
really awful 0 
case was more or less an extra that i originally put on but later discarded because it scratched my ear 0 
think it over when you plan to own this onethis sure is the last moto phone for me 0 
it is the best charger i have seen on the market yet 1 
food quality has been horrible 0 
there is no plot here to keep you going in the first place 0 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
furthermore you cant even find hours of operation on the website 0 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it 1 
the food is very good for your typical bar food 1 
their daily specials are always a hit with my group 1 
i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
phenomenal food service and ambiance 1 
point your finger at any item on the menu order it and you wont be disappointed 1 
youll love it 1 
this product is great it makes working a lot easier i can go to the copier while waiting on hold for something 1 
the story is also both funny and poignant at times 1 
the use of slowmotion needlessly repeats itself throughout the movie but is well backed up by bad acting and bad is a kind word here no continuity scenes that are thrown in for no reason whatsoever vehicles that looked like they were made from a corn flakes box and a directorial style that bordered on stupidity 0 
this is one of the best italian thrillers of the early 70s 1 
never going back 0 
drinks took close to 30 minutes to come out at one point 0 
but i definitely would not eat here again 0 
there were too many close ups 0 
go to place for gyros 1 
needless to say we will never be back here again 0 
absolutely great 1 
wont ever go here again 0 
this place is overpriced not consistent with their boba and it really is overpriced 0 
i checked everywhere and there is no feature for it which is really disappointing 0 
bland and flavorless is a good way of describing the barely tepid meat 0 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
i have two more years left in this contract and i hate this phone 0 
i believe every one should see this movie as i think few people outside of south africa understand its past and what is being attempted in the truth and reconciliation process 1 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
this phone might well be the worst ive ever had in any brand 0 
great brunch spot 1 
awesome service and food 1 
the story starts too fast with absolutely no suspense or buildup in the slightest 0 
there is however some pretty good acting at least for this type of film 1 
do not purchase this phone 0 
nine out of ten for a truly lovely film 1 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
i was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar not only because the quality is great but the service is fast and the food impeccable 1 
it was attached to a gas station and that is rarely a good sign 0 
the use of slowmotion needlessly repeats itself throughout the movie but is well backed up by bad acting and bad is a kind word here no continuity scenes that are thrown in for no reason whatsoever vehicles that looked like they were made from a corn flakes box and a directorial style that bordered on stupidity 0 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
there is a lot of beautiful places 1 
only like 3 or 4 buildings used a couple of locations maybe poor hummh 0 
will be back again 1 
however the keypads are so tinny that i sometimes reach the wrong buttons 0 
nicest chinese restaurant ive been in a while 1 
great bluetooth 1 
the steaks are all well trimmed and also perfectly cooked 1 
the bathrooms are clean and the place itself is well decorated 1 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
great value 1 
i would have given no star if i was able 0 
because both ears are occupied background is not distracting at all 1 
the charger worked for about a week and then completely stopped charging my phone 0 
the ambience is wonderful and there is music playing 1 
the only thing worse than taylors acting was stanwycks singing 0 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
amazon sucks 0 
dont waste your money and time 0 
john wayne did an incredible job for being so young in the movie industry 1 
which has more depth and character than the man underneath it 0 
i love the scream movies and all horror movies and this one ranks way up there 1 
the secondary plot line is incomprehensible and its relation to the primary plot line is mystifying 0 
it was way over fried 0 
worst customer service 0 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
the steak was amazingrge fillet relleno was the best seafood plate i have ever had 1 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
great service and food 1 
the movie is terribly boring in places 0 
they could serve it with just the vinaigrette and it may make for a better overall dish but it was still very good 1 
it was quite comfortable in the ear 1 
really really good rice all the time 1 
i know this is not like the other restaurants at all something is very off here 0 
i connected my wifes bluetoothmotorola hs850 to my phone and it worked like a charm whether the phone was in my pocket or the case 1 
great movie 1 
the casting is also horrible cause all you see is a really really bad actors period 0 
battery life is also great 1 
very well made and fits my surefire gx2 perfectly 1 
the film is well paced understated and one of the best courtroom documentaries ive seen 1 
ps the only scene in the movie that was cool is when the central character finds her room blown up 1 
this film tries to be a serious and sophisticated thrillerhorror flick and it fails miserably 0 
i did not have any problem with this item and would order it again if needed 1 
the waiter wasnt helpful or friendly and rarely checked on us 0 
it was equally awful 0 
if you havent choked in your own vomit by the end by all the cheap drama and worthless dialogue youve must have bored yourself to death with this waste of time 0 
nice headset priced right 1 
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
the cinematographyif it can be called thatsucked 0 
motorola finally got the voice quality of a bluetooth headset right 1 
they never brought a salad we asked for 0 
i wont spoil it but the ending in pretty amazing 1 
the ripped banana was not only ripped but petrified and tasteless 0 
this place is great 1 
i really liked that 1 
nevertheless yet another wonderful film from the great masters stable 1 
the cashier was friendly and even brought the food out to me 1 
i was so insulted 0 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
they refuse to refund or replace 0 
this was such an awesome movie that i bought it off of ebay 1 
i dont understand how this garbage got on the shelves of the movie store its not even a real movie 0 
doesnt hold charge 0 
saw the movie today and thought it was a good effort good messages for kids 1 
this place deserves one star and 90 has to do with the food 0 
there is a lot of beautiful places 1 
the scallop dish is quite appalling for value as well 0 
this if the first movie ive given a 10 to in years 1 
horrible phone 0 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
both of the egg rolls were fantastic 1 
last time buying from you 0 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
this is high adventure at its best 1 
come hungry leave happy and stuffed 1 
simply beautiful 1 
service sucks 0 
good transmit audio 1 
it is zillion times away from reality 0 
lastly the mozzarella sticks they were the best thing we ordered 1 
tom wilkinson broke my heart at the end and everyone elses judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike 1 
kris kristoffersen is good in this movie and really makes a difference 1 
w810i is just superb 1 
this is a great deal 1 
blue ant is easy to use 1 
it was probably dirt 0 
i just saw this film and i recommend it 1 
great headset very impressed h500 1 
nicest chinese restaurant ive been in a while 1 
the chips and sals a here is amazing 1 
im trying to return it for a refund 0 
at a time when it seems that film animation has been dominated by disneypixars cgi masterpieces it is both refreshing and comforting to know that miyazaki is still relying on traditional handdrawn animation to tell his charming and enchanting stories 1 
better than expected 1 
and considering the two of us left there very full and happy for about 20 you just cant go wrong 1 
its really easy 1 
that was nice 1 
the cast is always entertaining as usual 1 
we thought youd have to venture further away to get good sushi but this place really hit the spot that night 1 
dont waste your time here 0 
this would not even be good as a made for tv flick 0 
on the negative its insipid enough to cause regret for another 2 hours of life wasted in front of the screen 0 
he was extremely rude and really there are so many other restaurants i would love to dine at during a weekend in vegas 0 
it was attached to a gas station and that is rarely a good sign 0 
it has a very good plot it holds your complete attention the acting is superb tom wilkinson was fantastic and emily watson was also very good 1 
for the price this was a great deal 1 
after 3 months screen just went black all of a sudden 0 
this phone is pretty sturdy and ive never had any large problems with it 1 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
this is probably one of the least effective and utterly unoriginal films i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
the jabra eargels fit my ears very well 1 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
bad purchase 0 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
but kevin spacey is an excellent verbal tsunami as buddy ackerman  and totally believable because he is a great actor 1 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
horrible dont waste your time and money 0 
i believe that pitch black was done well 1 
when i opened the sandwich i was impressed but not in a good way 0 
its too bad that everyone else involved didnt share crowes level of dedication to quality for if they did wed have a far better film on our hands than this subpar mess 0 
this phone might well be the worst ive ever had in any brand 0 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
the directing and the cinematography arent quite as good 0 
check it out 1 
great service and food 1 
total letdown i would much rather just go to the camelback flower shop and cartel coffee 0 
as for the service im a fan because its quick and youre being served by some nice folks 1 
they have horrible attitudes towards customers and talk down to each one when customers dont enjoy their food 0 
i received my headset in good time and was happy with it 1 
great atmosphere friendly and fast service 1 
i went on motorolas website and followed all directions but could not get it to pair again 0 
down the drain because of a weak snap 0 
and considering the two of us left there very full and happy for about 20 you just cant go wrong 1 
i rather enjoyed it 1 
a usable keyboard actually turns a pda into a realworld useful machine instead of just a neat gadget 1 
i know this is not like the other restaurants at all something is very off here 0 
a very good film indeed about great and unconditional love 1 
all of the main players are mesmerising 1 
my drink was never empty and he made some really great menu suggestions 1 
an interesting premise and billy drago is always good as a dangerous nutbag side note id love to see drago stephen mchattie and lance hendrikson in a flick together talk about raging cheekbones 1 
their chow mein is so good 1 
aailiyah was pretty good as akasha in places compelling her first entrance and mini dance scene 1 
they do not last forever but is not overly expensive to replaceeasy to operate and the sound is much better than others i have tried 1 
things that went wrong they burned the saganaki 0 
2 times very bad customer service 0 
lets start with all the problemsthe acting especially from the lead professor was very very bad 0 
terrible phone holder 0 
i left with a stomach ache and felt sick the rest of the day 0 
i am a fan of his this movie sucked really bad 0 
i am sorry i made this purchase 0 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
buttons are too small 0 
this place is amazing 1 
i was disgusted because i was pretty sure that was human hair 0 
i gave it a 10 1 
i think not again 0 
first the bathrooms at this location were dirty seat covers were not replenished just plain yucky 0 
very serious spoilers this movie was a huge disappointment 0 
that being said for a phone the camera is very nice many cool effects to play with and video is decent as well 1 
they brought a fresh batch of fries and i was thinking yay something warm but no 0 
unfortunately the ability to actually know you are receiving a call is a rather important feature and this phone is pitiful in that respect 0 
the use of slowmotion needlessly repeats itself throughout the movie but is well backed up by bad acting and bad is a kind word here no continuity scenes that are thrown in for no reason whatsoever vehicles that looked like they were made from a corn flakes box and a directorial style that bordered on stupidity 0 
not a good item it worked for a while then started having problems in my auto reverse tape player 0 
spend your money elsewhere 0 
1 long lasting battery you dont have to recharge it as frequentyly as some of the flip phones2 0 
not good for the money 0 
it is very comfortable to wear as well which is probably the most important aspect about using a case 1 
unfortunately inexperience of direction meant that scene after scene passed with little in the way of dramatic tension or conflict 0 
the burrittos blah 0 
not what i wanted 0 
i ended up sliding it on the edge of my pants or back pockets instead 1 
it was a pale color instead of nice and char and has no flavor 0 
the chicken dishes are ok the beef is like shoe leather 0 
not even a hello we will be right with you 0 
bluetooth does not work phone locks up screens just flash up and now it just makes calls randomly while in my pocket locked 0 
i bought this to use with my kindle fire and absolutely loved it 1 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
so bad 0 
their daily specials are always a hit with my group 1 
just really good so far probably the best bt headset i have ever had 1 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
if there were zero stars i would give it zero stars 0 
this was reflected not only in the cast but also in the belowpar script which borrowed much from the earlier classic 0 
really bad 0 
too politically correct 0 
if that bug never showed up i would have given a 4 for sure but on the other side of the wall where this bug was climbing was the kitchen 0 
the food is not tasty at all not to say its real traditional hunan style 0 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
poor reliability 0 
this is simply the best bluetooth headset for sound quality 1 
love the margaritas too 1 
otherwise easy to install and use clear sound 1 
but i dont like it 0 
excellent bluetooth headset 1 
the budget was evidently very limited 0 
poor reliability 0 
not much dialogue not much music the whole film was shot as elaborately and aesthetically like a sculpture 1 
every thing on phone work perfectly she like it 1 
people who like european films and art movies will like this movie 1 
no plot whatsoever 0 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
again lame 0 
the building itself seems pretty neat the bathroom is pretty trippy but i wouldnt eat here again 0 
go to place for gyros 1 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
and the chef was generous with his time even came around twice so we can take pictures with him 1 
blue ant is easy to use 1 
nice case feels good in your hands 1 
there are so many problems i dont know where to start 0 
sorry i will not be getting food from here anytime soon 0 
his performance as awarded was stunning 1 
now the burgers arent as good the pizza which used to be amazing is doughy and flavorless 0 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
im big fan of rpg games too but this movie its a disgrace to any selfrespecting rpger there is 0 
however i recently watched the whole thing again on dvd and i was completely struck by how extremely stupid the storyline was how it contained holes inconsistencies and frankly a whole lot of crap and how horrid the dancing was 0 
but the convoluted plot just didnt convince me and much of the film was watched with a weird questioning glance 0 
seafood was limited to boiled shrimp and crab legs but the crab legs definitely did not taste fresh 0 
then i had to continue pairing it periodically since it somehow kept dropping 0 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
over rated 0 
excellent service 1 
very bad performance plays angela bennett a computer expert who is at home all the time 0 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
another note about this phones appearance is that it really looks rather bland especially in the all black model 0 
arrived quickly and much less expensive than others being sold 1 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
the cg opening sequence in space looked like it could have been created on microsoft slideshow for gods sake 0 
i mean in a realistic world she would never have gotten into that ballet repertory the whole thing was quite pathetic 0 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
their research and development division obviously knows what theyre doing 1 
full of unconvincing cardboard characters it is blandly written by edward chodorov who also produced and is surprisingly directed by jean negulesco from whom one would expect a great deal more 0 
its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
it was probably dirt 0 
the phone loads super 1 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
its pure brilliance 1 
the shower area is outside so you can only rinse not take a full shower unless you dont mind being nude for everyone to see 0 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
a lot of websites have been rating this a very good phone and so do i 1 
very bad experience 0 
join the club and get awesome offers via email 1 
i guess i liked the details of his dysfunctionhe was believable 1 
i ordered the lemon raspberry ice cocktail which was also incredible 1 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
my husband and i ate lunch here and were very disappointed with the food and service 0 
my 5year old nokia 2160 from tracfone holds the charge a lot better than this 0 
a standout scene 1 
excellent product 1 
good food good service 1 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
i have had mine for about a year and this christmas i bought some for the rest of the family 1 
the folks at otto always make us feel so welcome and special 1 
i dont have to be an accountant to know im getting screwed 0 
the phone loads super 1 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
none of them are engaging or exciting 0 
overall i was not impressed and would not go back 0 
best of all is the rotating feature very helpful 1 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
i left the theater with a lilt in my step joy in my heart and hope for the human race 1 
i would recommend purchasing the jabra jx10 series 2 which works flawlessly with my moto q go figure 1 
the story line is totally predictable 0 
this is was due to the fact that it took 20 minutes to be acknowledged then another 35 minutes to get our foodand they kept forgetting things 0 
it had some average acting from the main person and it was a low budget as you clearly can see 0 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
food was great and so was the serivce 1 
its a feelgood film and thats how i felt when i came out of the cinema 1 
not recommended 0 
while you dont yet hear mickey speak there are tons of sound effects and music throughout the filmsomething we take for granted now but which was a huge crowd pleaser in 1928 1 
to my disbelief each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods i have ever tasted 0 
stay away from this store be careful 0 
i like steiners because its dark and it feels like a bar 1 
everything was good and tasty 1 
no actress has been worse used that june allison in this movie 0 
this movie was kind of long in length but i enjoyed every minute of it 1 
this place is pretty good nice little vibe in the restaurant 1 
really bad 0 
however i recently watched the whole thing again on dvd and i was completely struck by how extremely stupid the storyline was how it contained holes inconsistencies and frankly a whole lot of crap and how horrid the dancing was 0 
i also didnt like the on button it felt like it would crack with use 0 
there was no chemistry between ben affleck and sandra bullock in this film and i couldnt understand why he would consider even leaving his wifetobe for this chick that he supposedly was knocked out by 0 
no real improvement 0 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
seller shipped quickly and much cheaper than the competitors 1 
your servers suck wait correction our server heimer sucked 0 
what a big waste of time 0 
my 5year old nokia 2160 from tracfone holds the charge a lot better than this 0 
the interplay between martin and emilio contains the same wonderful chemistry we saw in wall street with martin and charlie 1 
great value 1 
i have seen many movies starring jaclyn smith but my god this was one of her best though it came out 12 years ago 1 
i waited and waited 0 
then our food came out disappointment ensued 0 
very good food great atmosphere1 1 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
makes it easier to keep up with my bluetooth when im not wearing it 0 
i seriously cannot believe that the owner has so many unexperienced employees that all are running around like chickens with their heads cut off 0 
poor product 0 
i go to far too many places and ive never seen any restaurant that serves a 1 egg breakfast especially for 400 0 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
both of them were truly unbelievably good and i am so glad we went back 1 
it was delicious 1 
not impressed 0 
it features an outlandish array of memorable psychotic but lovable nuts 1 
an awesome new look for fall 2000 1 
damian is so talented and versatile in so many ways of writing and portraying different characters on screen 1 
the grilled chicken was so tender and yellow from the saffron seasoning 1 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
a great film by a great director 1 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
the first thing that happened was that the tracking was off 0 
this film tries to be a serious and sophisticated thrillerhorror flick and it fails miserably 0 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
nargile i think you are great 1 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
try them in the airport to experience some tasty food and speedy friendly service 1 
i had a pretty satifying experience 1 
very unreliable service from tmobile 0 
the vanilla ice cream was creamy and smooth while the profiterole choux pastry was fresh enough 1 
the food came out at a good pace 1 
the chips that came out were dripping with grease and mostly not edible 0 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
definitely worth seeing its the sort of thought provoking film that forces you to question your own threshold of loneliness 1 
graphics is far from the best part of the game 0 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
call me a nut but i think this is one of the best movies ever 1 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
great food and great service in a clean and friendly setting 1 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
overall i like this place a lot 1 
we watched our waiter pay a lot more attention to other tables and ignore us 0 
at first glance it is a lovely bakery cafe nice ambiance clean friendly staff 1 
i wasted my little money with this earpiece 0 
this item worked great but it broke after 6 months of use 0 
for people who are first timers in film making i think they did an excellent job 1 
plus it was wellpaced and suited its relatively short run time 1 
i got to enjoy the seafood salad with a fabulous vinegrette 1 
happy so far 1 
the inside is really quite nice and very clean 1 
i had about two bites and refused to eat anymore 0 
it shouldnt take 30 min for pancakes and eggs 0 
i have to jiggle the plug to get it to line up right to get decent volume 0 
my friend loved the salmon tartar 1 
i received my headset in good time and was happy with it 1 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
con spotty service 0 
i tried the cape cod ravoli chickenwith cranberrymmmm 1 
bad fit way too big 0 
he is an amazing film artist one of the most important whoever lived 1 
not good when wearing a hat or sunglasses 0 
seriously its not worth wasting your or your kids time on 0 
not much seafood and like 5 strings of pasta at the bottom 0 
food was below average 0 
but then they came back cold 0 
damian is so talented and versatile in so many ways of writing and portraying different characters on screen 1 
everything was perfect the night we were in 1 
instead we got a bore fest about a whiny spoiled brat babysitting 0 
the food was excellent and service was very good 1 
kids pizza is always a hit too with lots of great side dish options for the kiddos 1 
very good lunch spot 1 
the service was not up to par either 0 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
lately they have been extremely nice and helpful on the phone 1 
this phone might well be the worst ive ever had in any brand 0 
any ring toneoverall good phone to buy 1 
it was quite comfortable in the ear 1 
the majority of the logitech earbud headsets failed 0 
the point is the journey a journey that touches every member of the family 1 
none of it works just dont buy it 0 
i struggle to find anything bad to say about it 1 
so far so good 1 
in fact im going to round up to 4 stars just because she was so awesome 1 
one of my favorite purchases ever 1 
its a campy sort of film thats a joy to watch 1 
great case and price 1 
the seasonal fruit was fresh white peach puree 1 
this place should honestly be blown up 0 
great character actors telly savalas and peter boyle 1 
very disappointed and wondered how it could be in the oscar shortlist 0 
worst phone ever 0 
doesnt do the job 0 
the nokia ca42 usb cable did not work with my phone 0 
it was a riot to see hugo weaving play a sexobsessed gay real estate salesman who uses his clients houses for his trysts with the flaming darren tom hollander 1 
great food and great service in a clean and friendly setting 1 
kids pizza is always a hit too with lots of great side dish options for the kiddos 1 
the ripped banana was not only ripped but petrified and tasteless 0 
this movie was kind of long in length but i enjoyed every minute of it 1 
so far it has worked like a charm 1 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
star trek v the final frontier is the worst in the series 0 
the live music on fridays totally blows 0 
the acting as youd expect from this cast is top notch 1 
overall i was not impressed and would not go back 0 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
i went on motorolas website and followed all directions but could not get it to pair again 0 
disappointed 0 
i great reception all the time 1 
feelings thoughtsgabriels discomfort during the danceall these intangibles leap to life and come within the viewers grasp in hustons portrayal 1 
probably not in a hurry to go back 0 
the incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film 1 
you cant beat that 1 
by this time our side of the restaurant was almost empty so there was no excuse 0 
this is an extraordinary film 1 
the movie showed a lot of florida at its best made it look very appealing 1 
no additional ear gels provided and no instructions whatsoever 0 
rating 1 out of 10 0 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
the scallop dish is quite appalling for value as well 0 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
but in any case the best part is you can download these pictures to your laptop using ir or even send pictures from your laptop to the phone 1 
loved itfriendly servers great food wonderful and imaginative menu 1 
i dont think well be going back anytime soon 0 
truly awful 0 
ive seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie 0 
i immediately said i wanted to talk to the manager but i did not want to talk to the guy who was doing shots of fireball behind the bar 0 
total waste of time 0 
i gave it a 10 1 
spend your money and time some place else 0 
for that its worth checking out 1 
if the food isnt bad enough for you then enjoy dealing with the worlds worstannoying drunk people 0 
this movie does an excellent job of revealing the complexity of the task and the incredible challenges facing south africa 1 
the place was fairly clean but the food simply wasnt worth it 0 
this is some seriously good pizza and im an expertconnisseur on the topic 1 
ill be looking for a new earpiece 0 
we enjoy their pizza and brunch 1 
this convention never worked well in the past and certainly doesnt work here 0 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
the service was terrible food was mediocre 0 
portable and it works 1 
an interesting premise and billy drago is always good as a dangerous nutbag side note id love to see drago stephen mchattie and lance hendrikson in a flick together talk about raging cheekbones 1 
i definitly recommend 1 
i loved it it was really scary 1 
the charger worked for about a week and then completely stopped charging my phone 0 
i really like this product over the motorola because it is allot clearer on the ear piece and the mic 1 
i heart this place 1 
at a time when it seems that film animation has been dominated by disneypixars cgi masterpieces it is both refreshing and comforting to know that miyazaki is still relying on traditional handdrawn animation to tell his charming and enchanting stories 1 
the telephone repair man was really funny and his reactions to the nuts and bitchy boss were truly genuine 1 
yet plantronincs continues to use the same flawed charger design 0 
despite the pans of reviewers i liked this movie 1 
the food is about on par with dennys which is to say not good at all 0 
their regular toasted bread was equally satisfying with the occasional pats of butter mmmm 1 
wow loved this place 1 
tonight i had the elk filet specialand it sucked 0 
it finds my cell phone right away when i enter the car 1 
well im satisfied 1 
simply beautiful 1 
ive owned this phone for 7 months now and can say that its the best mobile phone ive had 1 
good service very clean and inexpensive to boot 1 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
i received my supposedly new motorola 375 and apparently there was not a match between the phone and the charger 0 
pretty piece of junk 0 
these products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet 0 
the very idea of it was lame take a minor character from a mediocre pg13 film and make a complete nonsequel while changing its tone to a pgrated family movie 0 
perfect for the ps3 1 
i work in the hospitality industry in paradise valley and have refrained from recommending cibo any longer 0 
horrible dont waste your time and money 0 
before i go in to why i gave a 1 star rating please know that this was my third time eating at bachi burger before writing a review 0 
very comfortable 1 
i recently tried caballeros and i have been back every week since 1 
piece of trash 0 
we sat another ten minutes and finally gave up and left 0 
the refried beans that came with my meal were dried out and crusty and the food was bland 0 
what happened next was prettyoff putting 0 
the ambience is wonderful and there is music playing 1 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
everything stinks 0 
thats how id describe this painfully dreary timewaster of a film 0 
i was very disappointed in the movie 0 
this is an extraordinary film 1 
a truly truly bad film 0 
this greedy corporation will never see another dime from me 0 
today the graphics are crap 0 
camera color balance is awful 0 
overall i am psyched to have a phone which has all my appointments and contacts in and gets great reception 1 
the battery is working well as a replacement for the original that came with the phone over 2 years ago 1 
never heard of any of them except cole who was totally unbelievable in the part 0 
the decor is nice and the piano music soundtrack is pleasant 1 
so just beware 0 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
on three different occasions i asked for well done or medium well and all three times i got the bloodiest piece of meat on my plate 0 
and it was way to expensive 0 
what should have been a hilarious yummy christmas eve dinner to remember was the biggest fail of the entire trip for us 0 
this is a bad film with bad writing and good actorsan ugly cartoon crafted by paul haggis for people who cant handle anything but the bold strokes in storytellinga picture painted with crayons 0 
this film offers many delights and surprises 1 
this is a stunning movie 1 
my brother in law who works at the mall ate here same day and guess what he was sick all night too 0 
however bt headsets are currently not good for real time games like firstperson shooters since the audio delay messes me up 0 
the food is rich so order accordingly 1 
the telephone repair man was really funny and his reactions to the nuts and bitchy boss were truly genuine 1 
the phone gets extremely hot 0 
he is an amazing film artist one of the most important whoever lived 1 
if you simply want a small flip phone look elsewhere as the extra bells whistles are mediocre 0 
lets start with all the problemsthe acting especially from the lead professor was very very bad 0 
this movie totally grates on my nerves 0 
speaking of the music it is unbearably predictably and kitchy 0 
piece of trash 0 
poor quality and service 0 
again no plot at all 0 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
works well 1 
the volume for the ringer is real good you have choices how loud 1 
the only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive 1 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
same problem as others have mentioned 0 
the inside is really quite nice and very clean 1 
the only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port irda 0 
ive had better not only from dedicated boba tea spots but even from jenni pho 0 
im pleased 1 
ive also had problems with the phone reading the memory card in which i always turn it on and then off again 0 
as for the service im a fan because its quick and youre being served by some nice folks 1 
it was equally awful 0 
must have been an off night at this place 0 
sounds good reasonably priced and effective its that simple 1 
im probably one of the few people to ever go to ians and not like it 0 
awesome selection of beer 1 
this if the first movie ive given a 10 to in years 1 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
the ri style calamari was a joke 0 
iam very pleased with my purchase 1 
my first visit to hiro was a delight 1 
i like steiners because its dark and it feels like a bar 1 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
integrated seamlessly with the motorola razr phone 1 
item does not match picture 0 
there still are good actors around 1 
the selection was probably the worst ive seen in vegasthere was none 0 
i received it quickly and it works great 1 
at around 4 pm i bought it at around 8pm i started to watch at around 815pm i fast forwarded the remaining film to see if there was anything left watchable for a human being with a brain but there wasnt 0 
uncomfortable in the ear dont use with lg vx9900 env 0 
it didnt make me scared horrified or make me sympathetic towards the characters it was simply annoying 0 
i still maintain that monkeys shouldnt make headphones we just obviously dont share enough dna to copy the design over to humans 0 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
the scripting of the subtle comedy is unmatched by any movie in recent years 1 
i know he was a contract player with little control over his scripts but the acting was as bad as the script 0 
great food and great service in a clean and friendly setting 1 
honeslty it didnt taste that fresh 0 
id advise anyone to go and see it 1 
item does not match picture 0 
the real killer is the volume and of course it breaking 0 
it ranks highly as a great noircrimedrama incredible performances by belmondo and lino ventura 1 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
the instruction manual is lacking 0 
worked perfectly 1 
setup couldnt have been simpler 1 
today was my first taste of a buldogis gourmet hot dog and i have to tell you it was more than i ever thought possible 1 
the nano stated itmy son was dissapointed 0 
disappointment i hate anything that goes in my ear 0 
i saw this short film on hbo the other day and absolutely loved it 1 
disappointed 0 
excellent phone 1 
unfortunately this is a bad movie that is just plain bad 0 
works good 1 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
what the hell kind of crap is that 0 
this would not even be good as a made for tv flick 0 
for the price on amazon it is an excellent product which i would highly recommend 1 
disapointing results 0 
food was delicious 1 
it is an excellent drama an excellent thriller and an excellent film 1 
could not get strong enough signal 0 
we were promptly greeted and seated 1 
nice ambiance 1 
we sat another ten minutes and finally gave up and left 0 
delicious and i will absolutely be back 1 
best ive found so far ive tried 2 other bluetooths and this one has the best quality for both me and the listener as well as ease of using 1 
the service was meh 0 
i got it because it was so small and adorable 1 
an hour seriously 0 
but now that it is out of warranty the same problems reoccurebottom line put your money somewhere else cingular will not support it 0 
things that went wrong they burned the saganaki 0 
no im going to eat the potato that i found some strangers hair in it 0 
and sometimes it was so embarrassing that i had to look away 0 
a usable keyboard actually turns a pda into a realworld useful machine instead of just a neat gadget 1 
that one didnt work either 0 
the movie is littered with overt racial slurs towards the black cast members and in return the whites are depicted as morons and boobs 0 
i searched the internet and found this one to be the best value 1 
i love the ownerchef his one authentic japanese cool dude 1 
case was more or less an extra that i originally put on but later discarded because it scratched my ear 0 
the pleather case doesnt fit 0 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
the cinematographyif it can be called thatsucked 0 
i have been to very few places to eat that under no circumstances would i ever return to and this tops the list 0 
this place receives stars for their appetizers 1 
so just beware 0 
nobody identifies with these characters because theyre all cardboard cutouts and stereotypes or predictably reversestereotypes 0 
what happened next was prettyoff putting 0 
this is hands down the best phone ive ever had 1 
owners are really great people 1 
im pleased 1 
i dont know what the big deal is about this place but i wont be back yaall 0 
my wife had the lobster bisque soup which was lukewarm 0 
yet plantronincs continues to use the same flawed charger design 0 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
the folks at otto always make us feel so welcome and special 1 
i loved their mussels cooked in this wine reduction the duck was tender and their potato dishes were delicious 1 
but kevin spacey is an excellent verbal tsunami as buddy ackerman  and totally believable because he is a great actor 1 
avoid at all cost 0 
my fiancé and i came in the middle of the day and we were greeted and seated right away 1 
love this headset 1 
very tough and very short on flavor 0 
i struggle to find anything bad to say about it 1 
weird vibe from owners 0 
only had this a month but its worked flawlessly so far 1 
just really good so far probably the best bt headset i have ever had 1 
what should have been a hilarious yummy christmas eve dinner to remember was the biggest fail of the entire trip for us 0 
phone falls out easily 0 
but even the talented carrell cant save this 0 
not a weekly haunt but definitely a place to come back to every once in a while 1 
and then tragedy struck 0 
poor product 0 
the update procedure is difficult and cumbersome 0 
i enjoyed it 1 
for 40 bucks a head i really expect better food 0 
worth every penny 1 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
obviously they have a terrible customer service so you get what you pay for 0 
just whatever you do avoid groove as its the antithesis of all that is good about human traffic 0 
having to humour him just to get by and get through the day was so apt 1 
id advise anyone to go and see it 1 
point your finger at any item on the menu order it and you wont be disappointed 1 
unreliable im giving up 0 
this would not even be good as a made for tv flick 0 
i had ordered a motorola data cable got a very well finished and working product 1 
i saw mirrormask last night and it was an unsatisfactory experience 0 
dont waste your money 0 
the design might be ergonomic in theory but i could not stand having these in my ear 0 
the film is way too long 0 
raw and sublimely moving 1 
if you love authentic mexican food and want a whole bunch of interesting yet delicious meats to choose from you need to try this place 1 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
we wont be returning 0 
poor quality 0 
the food sucked which we expected but it sucked more than we could have imagined 0 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
better than expected 1 
i really like this product over the motorola because it is allot clearer on the ear piece and the mic 1 
very friendly staff 1 
he cant act one of the least scary villains i have ever seen he cant write did he write this damn movie in his sleep 0 
today the graphics are crap 0 
even the squibs look awful 0 
its very attractive and appears to be of good quality 1 
i went on motorolas website and followed all directions but could not get it to pair again 0 
not good when wearing a hat or sunglasses 0 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
it is just the sort of pap that is screened in the afternoon to punish the unemployed for not having jobs 0 
later i found myself lost in the power of the film 1 
unfortunately it was not good 0 
i waited and waited 0 
if you stay in vegas you must get breakfast here at least once 1 
the soundtrack wasnt terrible either 1 
the scenes with the ohsomature neighbourgirl are a misplace 0 
used and dirty 0 
if you are reading this please dont go there 0 
a good film by a great director 1 
that was funny 1 
the acting is like watching wooden puppets moving around and reading from a book thats how bad it is 0 
i really recommend this faceplates since it looks very nice elegant and cool 1 
must have been an off night at this place 0 
i guess maybe we went on an off night but it was disgraceful 0 
maybe its just their vegetarian fare but ive been twice and i thought it was average at best 0 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
i will never forget it now 1 
ive had this for nearly 2 years and it has worked great for me 1 
it will drive you barking mad 0 
instead we got a bore fest about a whiny spoiled brat babysitting 0 
my friend loved the salmon tartar 1 
i liked this movie way too much 1 
they work about 2 weeks then break 0 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
itll be a regular stop on my trips to phoenix 1 
it plays louder than any other speaker of this size the price is so low that most would think the quality is lacking however its not 1 
the chips and salsa were really good the salsa was very fresh 1 
it did not work in my cell phone plug i am very up set with the charger 0 
the lines the cuts the audio everything is wrong 0 
the movie was so boring that i sometimes found myself occupied peaking in the paper instead of watching never happened during a columbo movie before 0 
the phone crashed completely and now i have to get it replaced 0 
there was a warm feeling with the service and i felt like their guest for a special treat 1 
that one didnt work either 0 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
the server was very negligent of our needs and made us feel very unwelcome i would not suggest this place 0 
the steaks are all well trimmed and also perfectly cooked 1 
they work about 2 weeks then break 0 
it felt like a very gripping intelligent stage play but without the overly theatrical feeling one actually gets from watching people on a stage which plays on everyones terror of a white lie escalating to monstrous consequences 1 
in addition it feels amp looks as if the phone is all lightweight cheap plastic 0 
the film has great actors a master director a significant themeat least a wouldbe significant theme undertone of fifties existential worldweariness aerial scenes that ought to have thrilled both senses and imagination and characters about which one might deeply care 1 
the charger worked for about a week and then completely stopped charging my phone 0 
ordered burger rare came in well done 0 
terrible my car will not accept this cassette 0 
cinematography noteworthy including fine views of barcelona and its famed gaudi towers 1 
the staff is great the food is delish and they have an incredible beer selection 1 
i left the theater with a lilt in my step joy in my heart and hope for the human race 1 
we also ordered the spinach and avocado salad the ingredients were sad and the dressing literally had zero taste 0 
omg the food was delicioso 1 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
the movie had you on the edge of your seat and made you somewhat afraid to go to your car at the end of the night 1 
you wont regret it 1 
the only downside is the service 0 
highly unprofessional and rude to a loyal patron 0 
the worst phone ive ever had only had it for a few months 0 
the characters are interesting even if a bit predictable 1 
hackneyed writing certainly but made even worse by the bad directing 0 
then i had to continue pairing it periodically since it somehow kept dropping 0 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
excellent product 1 
does not fit 0 
we made the drive all the way from north scottsdale and i was not one bit disappointed 1 
simply beautiful 1 
i wish i could enter negative values admins 0 
the food was outstanding and the prices were very reasonable 1 
youll love it 1 
i went on motorolas website and followed all directions but could not get it to pair again 0 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
you also cannot take pictures with it in the case because the lense is covered 0 
it was a drive to get there 0 
the food is about on par with dennys which is to say not good at all 0 
good transmit audio 1 
the dining space is tiny but elegantly decorated and comfortable 1 
this is a bad film with bad writing and good actorsan ugly cartoon crafted by paul haggis for people who cant handle anything but the bold strokes in storytellinga picture painted with crayons 0 
the company shipped my product very promptly and it works well 1 
i left with a stomach ache and felt sick the rest of the day 0 
what a big waste of time 0 
do not purchase this phone 0 
the nano stated itmy son was dissapointed 0 
glad i didnt pay to see it 0 
this is a really fantastic thai restaurant which is definitely worth a visit 1 
there is no real plot 0 
poor sound quality 0 
totally different with loads of understatement and black comedy this is a film few get to see but those who do will remember it 1 
i never walked out of a movie faster 0 
poor construction 0 
there is really nothing for me at postinos hope your experience is better 0 
enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film 1 
the plot simply rumbles on like a machine desperately depending on the addition of new scenes 0 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
the hockey scenes are terrible defensemen playing like theyre 5 years old goalies diving at shots that are 10 feet wide of the net etc 0 
this place is amazing 1 
the screen does get smudged easily because it touches your ear and face 0 
has been working great 1 
cant say enough good things about this place 1 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
iam very pleased with my purchase 1 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
unless youre just out to visually collect all extant films of austens work you can skip this one 0 
i swung in to give them a try but was deeply disappointed 0 
they have horrible attitudes towards customers and talk down to each one when customers dont enjoy their food 0 
very disappointed and wondered how it could be in the oscar shortlist 0 
ordered burger rare came in well done 0 
the death row scenes were entirely unmoving 0 
phone falls out easily 0 
the chips that came out were dripping with grease and mostly not edible 0 
just does not work 0 
this movie was kind of long in length but i enjoyed every minute of it 1 
overall a delight 1 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
were jerks on the phone 0 
im so sorry but i really cant recommend it to anyone 0 
the only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive 1 
id rather eat airline food seriously 0 
the dining space is tiny but elegantly decorated and comfortable 1 
will definitely be back 1 
we have tried 2 units and they both failed within 2 months pros 0 
good product good seller 1 
he is one of my favourite directors and one of the most talented directors in the history of cinema 1 
then i exchanged for the same phone even that had the same problem 0 
i was so insulted 0 
the only good thing was that it fits comfortably on small ears 1 
seafood was limited to boiled shrimp and crab legs but the crab legs definitely did not taste fresh 0 
phone now holds charge like it did when it was new 1 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
my sister has one also and she loves it 1 
sauce was tasteless 0 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
good value works fine power via usb car or wall outlet 1 
horrible horrible protector 0 
the battery is completely useless to me 0 
one of the most disappointing aspects is the lack of notable gore 0 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
does not work for listening to music with the cingular 8125 0 
also difficult to put onid recommend avoiding this product 0 
it never condescends all the characters have good genuine hearts and believable problems 1 
i received it quickly and it works great 1 
this film and i use that word loosely is an insult to the moviegoing public 0 
it works fine on my motorola 325 cellphone and a lot better than the wornout battery did 1 
prosgood camera very nice pictures also has cool styles like black and white and more 1 
it was way over fried 0 
i dressed up to be treated so rudely 0 
did not like at all 0 
the price is reasonable and the service is great 1 
as for the mains also uninspired 0 
the inside is really quite nice and very clean 1 
it presents a idyllic yet serious portrayal of the ups and downs of the characters lives 1 
terrible management 0 
50 down the drain 0 
an italian reviewer called this a small great film and thats right 1 
this is a great little item 1 
fantastic food 1 
first time going but i think i will quickly become a regular 1 
my mother and brother had to do thiswhen i saw robert ryan portraying this type of man it was a very good imitation of this type of individual and i was impressed 1 
as always the evening was wonderful and the food delicious 1 
i recently had problems where i could not stay connected for more than 10 minutes before being disconnected 0 
definitely a turn off for me i doubt ill be back unless someone else is buying 0 
it was probably dirt 0 
at no point in the proceedings does it look remotely like america 0 
thus far have only visited twice and the food was absolutely delicious each time 1 
i have purchased these for both family and friends and all enjoy their clarity and ease of use 1 
disappointed 0 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
excellent product 1 
this scene is very strong and unpleasant 0 
i am a fan of his this movie sucked really bad 0 
at first glance it is a lovely bakery cafe nice ambiance clean friendly staff 1 
at a time when it seems that film animation has been dominated by disneypixars cgi masterpieces it is both refreshing and comforting to know that miyazaki is still relying on traditional handdrawn animation to tell his charming and enchanting stories 1 
the ri style calamari was a joke 0 
seafood was limited to boiled shrimp and crab legs but the crab legs definitely did not taste fresh 0 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
a great way to finish a great 1 
its worth driving up from tucson 1 
it looked like a wonderful story 1 
the real killer is the volume and of course it breaking 0 
not much flavor to them and very poorly constructed 0 
this game rocks 1 
doesnt work 0 
this is one of the best movies out there that shows such strong sibling bond for each other 1 
this film tries to be a serious and sophisticated thrillerhorror flick and it fails miserably 0 
nobody identifies with these characters because theyre all cardboard cutouts and stereotypes or predictably reversestereotypes 0 
i had a salad with the wings and some ice cream for dessert and left feeling quite satisfied 1 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
it is just the sort of pap that is screened in the afternoon to punish the unemployed for not having jobs 0 
now you know why i gave it a 10 1 
better than new 1 
this film highlights the fundamental flaws of the legal process that its not about discovering guilt or innocence but rather is about who presents better in court 1 
weird vibe from owners 0 
you could only take 2 videos at a time and the quality was very poor 0 
im in az all the time and now have my new spot 1 
the classic maine lobster roll was fantastic 1 
it works 1 
about half way through this film i started to dislike it 0 
i promise they wont disappoint 1 
the screen does get smudged easily because it touches your ear and face 0 
im super pissd 0 
a good quality bargain i bought this after i bought a cheapy from big lots that sounded awful and people on the other end couldnt hear me 1 
if you are reading this please dont go there 0 
the wind and the lion is well written and superbly acted 1 
love this product 1 
we made the drive all the way from north scottsdale and i was not one bit disappointed 1 
if you hate earbugs avoid this phone by all means 0 
nice ambiance 1 
ill even say it again  this is torture 0 
id love to go back 1 
both of them were truly unbelievably good and i am so glad we went back 1 
your servers suck wait correction our server heimer sucked 0 
in the span of an hour i had two people exclaim whoa is that the new phone on tv 1 
while you dont yet hear mickey speak there are tons of sound effects and music throughout the filmsomething we take for granted now but which was a huge crowd pleaser in 1928 1 
the poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying 0 
this place is way too overpriced for mediocre food 0 
the two main characters may be two of the most believable children i ever saw put on screen 1 
unfortunately inexperience of direction meant that scene after scene passed with little in the way of dramatic tension or conflict 0 
everything about this product is wrongfirst 0 
my only problem is i thought the actor playing the villain was a low rent michael ironside 0 
there is a totally unnecessary trainroller coaster scene 0 
avoid at all cost 0 
much better than the other ayce sushi place i went to in vegas 1 
i believe every one should see this movie as i think few people outside of south africa understand its past and what is being attempted in the truth and reconciliation process 1 
ray charles is legendary 1 
i dont know what the big deal is about this place but i wont be back yaall 0 
i dont think it would hold it too securly on your belt 0 
does everything it should and more 1 
that company is a joke 0 
nothing special 0 
still i do like this movie for its empowerment of women theres not enough movies out there like this one 1 
you truly take this journey through the eyes and soul of a child 1 
nothing special 0 
it defeats the purpose of a bluetooth headset 0 
but i definitely would not eat here again 0 
but this movie is definitely a below average rent 0 
buttons are too small 0 
he is almost unbearable to watch on screen he has little to no charisma and terrible comedic timing 0 
they do not care about the consumer one bit 0 
but other than that the movie seemed to drag and the heroes didnt really work for their freedom 0 
first time there and might just be the last 0 
i am pairing this with my iphone and i could not be happier with it so far 1 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
they have been around for years and carries the highest quality of antiglare screen protector that i have found to date 1 
the warm beer didnt help 0 
it didnt work people can not hear me when i talk 0 
there were several moments in the movie that just didnt need to be there and were excruciatingly slow moving 0 
however the keypads are so tinny that i sometimes reach the wrong buttons 0 
after my phone got to be about a year old its been slowly breaking despite much care on my part 0 
ordered an appetizer and took 40 minutes and then the pizza another 10 minutes 0 
the dialogue sucked 0 
the place was fairly clean but the food simply wasnt worth it 0 
were jerks on the phone 0 
i guess maybe we went on an off night but it was disgraceful 0 
its extremely slow and takes forever to do anything with it 0 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
pretty piece of junk 0 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
this phone tries very hard to do everything but fails at its very ability to be a phone 0 
but in any case the best part is you can download these pictures to your laptop using ir or even send pictures from your laptop to the phone 1 
it presents a idyllic yet serious portrayal of the ups and downs of the characters lives 1 
that movie was bad 0 
the food was excellent and service was very good 1 
absolutel junk 0 
the scripting of the subtle comedy is unmatched by any movie in recent years 1 
yeah the movie pretty much sucked 0 
nargile i think you are great 1 
very much disappointed with this company 0 
great sound and service 1 
five star plus plus 1 
a drive thru means you do not want to wait around for half an hour for your food but somehow when we end up going here they make us wait and wait 0 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
the plug did not work very well 0 
i would not recommend this place 0 
nobody identifies with these characters because theyre all cardboard cutouts and stereotypes or predictably reversestereotypes 0 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
mark my words this is one of those cult films like evil dead 2 or phantasm that people will still be discovering and falling in love with 20 30 40 years down the line 1 
steve martin delivers a really funny performance of a middleaged upper class uptight white guy 1 
very pleased with this headset 1 
so absolutley fantastic 1 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
you truly take this journey through the eyes and soul of a child 1 
phenomenal food service and ambiance 1 
i love this cable it allows me to connect any miniusb device to my pc 1 
great steak great sides great wine amazing desserts 1 
it was a good thing that the tickets only cost five dollars because i would be mad if id have paid 750 to see this crap 0 
does not work 0 
worst foodservice ive had in a while 0 
this movie is greatespecially if you enjoy visual arts 1 
frozen pucks of disgust with some of the worst people behind the register 0 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
i had heard good things about this place but it exceeding every hope i could have dreamed of 1 
my breakfast was perpared great with a beautiful presentation of 3 giant slices of toast lightly dusted with powdered sugar 1 
it is worth the drive 1 
2 times very bad customer service 0 
this movie was kind of long in length but i enjoyed every minute of it 1 
have been going since 2007 and every meal has been awesome 1 
couldnt use the unit with sunglasses not good in texas 0 
its worth driving up from tucson 1 
i enjoyed it 1 
probably not in a hurry to go back 0 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
food quality has been horrible 0 
i was very pleased to see that i could replace my well travled swivel holster for my blackberry flip 1 
great movie 1 
walked in and the place smelled like an old grease trap and only 2 others there eating 0 
definitely will come back here again 1 
the best scene in the movie was when gerardo is trying to find a song that keeps running through his head 1 
very bad performance plays angela bennett a computer expert who is at home all the time 0 
it defeats the purpose of a bluetooth headset 0 
classywarm atmosphere fun and fresh appetizers succulent steaks baseball steak 1 
i kept catching the cable on the seat and i had to pull the phone out to turn it on an off 0 
this second appearance of mickey mouse following the silent plane crazy earlier that year is probably his most famous filmmostly because it was so groundbreaking 1 
which has more depth and character than the man underneath it 0 
all i have to say is the food was amazing 1 
i was left shattered from the experience of watching this film and i took a good two hours to fully recover 0 
the sangria was about half of a glass wine full and was 12 ridiculous 0 
but what really made it unwatchable was the direction 0 
we had fantastic service and were pleased by the atmosphere 1 
the place was fairly clean but the food simply wasnt worth it 0 
for those that havent seen it dont waste your time 0 
for 40 bucks a head i really expect better food 0 
schrader has made a resume full of lousy amateurish films 0 
i gave it a 10 1 
and i really did find them funny 1 
good audio quality 1 
i loved it 1 
the only good thing was that it fits comfortably on small ears 1 
i just cant explain this movie more than romanticcharminghilariousand adorablethe junkyard scenes are funnyall the junkyard dogs have something specialtoo funny i laughedkids will love itbuy it when it comes outit has new features 1 
garbo who showed right off the bat that her talents could carry over from the silent era i wanted to see some of her silent work but netflix doesnt seem to be stocking them 1 
if you do go see this movie bring a pillow or a girlfriendboyfriend to keep you occupied through out 0 
it is an excellent drama an excellent thriller and an excellent film 1 
a film not easily forgotten 1 
the movie in movie situations in the beginning and through the game that is played with her by the acting coach are fascinating 1 
highly recommended a 1 
however after about a year the fliptop started to get loose and wobbly and eventually my screen went black and i couldnt receive and place calls 0 
it was a great phone 1 
i guess maybe we went on an off night but it was disgraceful 0 
this is cool because most cases are just open there allowing the screen to get all scratched up 1 
the desserts were a bit strange 0 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
you will leave the theater wanting to go out and dance under the stars 1 
im probably one of the few people to ever go to ians and not like it 0 
plug was the wrong size 0 
this convention never worked well in the past and certainly doesnt work here 0 
all i have to say is the food was amazing 1 
price is good too 1 
battery chargelife is quite long 1 
i believe the screenwriter did a good job of tying up the loose ends 1 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
this movie is greatespecially if you enjoy visual arts 1 
this case seems well made 1 
what a great double cheeseburger 1 
horrible dont waste your time and money 0 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
treo and tmobile refused to replace it again and forced me to buy another phone without any kind of upgrade discount 0 
thats how id describe this painfully dreary timewaster of a film 0 
but now that it is out of warranty the same problems reoccurebottom line put your money somewhere else cingular will not support it 0 
trouble is the writing and directing make it impossible to establish those things that make a movie watchable like character story theme and so on 0 
i can barely ever hear on it and am constantly saying what 0 
the fact is this film is a wonderful heartwarming tale about two people chasing their dreams 1 
i saw this film over christmas and what a great film it was 1 
however after seeing the short again after about 25 years i was amazed at how timeless the film actually is 1 
i cannot believe that the actors agreed to do this film 0 
what a great double cheeseburger 1 
now the burgers arent as good the pizza which used to be amazing is doughy and flavorless 0 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
very very fun chef 1 
needless to say i wont be going back anytime soon 0 
this place is way too overpriced for mediocre food 0 
the only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive 1 
director paul matthews who also wrotedirected the weak 1995 monster movie grim clearly doesnt know how to pace his films 0 
the building itself seems pretty neat the bathroom is pretty trippy but i wouldnt eat here again 0 
stay away from this store be careful 0 
the potatoes were great and so was the biscuit 1 
the chefs were friendly and did a good job 1 
i can say that the desserts were yummy 1 
i probably would not go here again 0 
it was a pale color instead of nice and char and has no flavor 0 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
a film not easily forgotten 1 
very true to shakespear and a must for all shakespear fans 1 
i was able to do voice dialing in the car with no problem 1 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
i would have casted her in that role after ready the script 1 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
it was so funny 1 
im in az all the time and now have my new spot 1 
it crackles with an unpredictable youthful energy but honestly i found it hard to follow and concentrate on it meanders so badly 0 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
today the graphics are crap 0 
what on earth is irons doing in this film 0 
i dont know what kind it is but they have the best iced tea 1 
seller shipped quickly and much cheaper than the competitors 1 
when i opened the sandwich i was impressed but not in a good way 0 
the pairing of the two devices was so easy it barely took a couple minutes before i started making calls with the voice dialing feature 1 
it was a great phone 1 
the jerky camera movements were also annoying 0 
both of them were truly unbelievably good and i am so glad we went back 1 
do not buy do not buyit sucks 0 
i gave it a 10 1 
it is just the sort of pap that is screened in the afternoon to punish the unemployed for not having jobs 0 
the presentation of the food was awful 0 
stay away from the q 0 
audio quality is poor very poor 0 
if you have not seen this movie i definitely recommend it 1 
emily watsons character is very strong and she has only to give a quick glance and you understand everything 1 
he is almost unbearable to watch on screen he has little to no charisma and terrible comedic timing 0 
i mean in a realistic world she would never have gotten into that ballet repertory the whole thing was quite pathetic 0 
i didnt know pulled pork could be soooo delicious 1 
after the first charge kept going dead after 12 minutes 0 
whatever prompted such a documentary is beyond me 0 
i really recommend this faceplates since it looks very nice elegant and cool 1 
was not happy 0 
crust is not good 0 
the sound is clear and the people i talk to on it are amazed at the quality too 1 
in fact its hard to remember that the part of ray charles is being acted and not played by the man himself 1 
its worth driving up from tucson 1 
first the bathrooms at this location were dirty seat covers were not replenished just plain yucky 0 
chinese forgeries abound 0 
the price was very good and with the free shipping and all it was a good purchase 1 
this is a really fantastic thai restaurant which is definitely worth a visit 1 
it is very educational for children 1 to 8 years old 1 
for that its worth checking out 1 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
the food was terrible 0 
people who like european films and art movies will like this movie 1 
one nice thing was that they added gratuity on the bill since our party was larger than 6 or 8 and they didnt expect more tip than that 1 
we started with the tuna sashimi which was brownish in color and obviously wasnt fresh 0 
excellent sound battery life and inconspicuous to boot 1 
and the chef was generous with his time even came around twice so we can take pictures with him 1 
ive also had problems with the phone reading the memory card in which i always turn it on and then off again 0 
i had the mac salad and it was pretty bland so i will not be getting that again 0 
i bought two of them and neither will charge 0 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
bad quality 0 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
its this pandering to the audience that sabotages most of his films 0 
just what i wanted 1 
great earpiece 1 
very well made and fits my surefire gx2 perfectly 1 
in addition it feels amp looks as if the phone is all lightweight cheap plastic 0 
so i basically threw my money out the window for nothing 0 
ive only had my bluetooth for a few weeks but i really like it 1 
i left the theater with a lilt in my step joy in my heart and hope for the human race 1 
my boyfriend and i sat at the bar and had a completely delightful experience 1 
i was disgusted because i was pretty sure that was human hair 0 
this review is long overdue since i consider a tale of two sisters to be the single greatest film ever made 1 
and there wasnt a single sour note struck actingwise either some surprisingly solid casting here 1 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
then the film just dropped the ball 0 
the concert sequences just sucked 0 
this place is great 1 
the food is very good for your typical bar food 1 
i was very excited to get this headset because i thought it was really cute 1 
the sweet potato fries were very good and seasoned well 1 
lots of holes in the script 0 
beautiful styling though 1 
when it opens the battery connection is broken and the device is turned off 0 
i felt as though her going to ireland did absolutely nothing whatsoever 0 
this is actually a very smart movie 1 
i left the theater with a lilt in my step joy in my heart and hope for the human race 1 
however the keypads are so tinny that i sometimes reach the wrong buttons 0 
their chow mein is so good 1 
mic doesnt work 0 
by this time our side of the restaurant was almost empty so there was no excuse 0 
everyone is very attentive providing excellent customer service 1 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
each track commands sentiment actually contributing to the scenes and characters 1 
service was exceptional and food was a good as all the reviews 1 
the classic maine lobster roll was fantastic 1 
this is a stunning movie 1 
if it was to turn my good day feeling into a night of disturbing memories than i guess he succeeded 0 
this is a stunning movie 1 
this is an extraordinary film 1 
it worked very well 1 
if you are razr owneryou must have this 1 
customer service was terrible 0 
it was so bad i had lost the heart to finish it 0 
the volume for the ringer is real good you have choices how loud 1 
not good by any stretch of the imagination 0 
overall the film is interesting and thoughtprovoking 1 
good item low price 1 
all in all a great disappointment 0 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
but she is still a bad actress repeating her robotic face moves in each of her pictures 0 
but then they came back cold 0 
arrived quickly and much less expensive than others being sold 1 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
he is one of my favourite directors and one of the most talented directors in the history of cinema 1 
the malta settings are as dry and as barren as the dialogue 0 
im still infatuated with this phone 1 
i was very disappointed in the movie 0 
why was this film made 0 
mediocre food 0 
best of luck to the rude and noncustomer service focused new management 0 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
this movie is so awesome 1 
kris kristoffersen is good in this movie and really makes a difference 1 
im surprised this is a good quality car charger and theres not much reviews about it 1 
the battery is completely useless to me 0 
i ordered the lemon raspberry ice cocktail which was also incredible 1 
the fried rice was dry as well 0 
i love this bluetooth 1 
the dialogue sucked 0 
the characters are interesting and you really care for them 1 
the waitress was friendly and happy to accomodate for veganveggie options 1 
the update procedure is difficult and cumbersome 0 
friends pasta also bad he barely touched it 0 
the chips and sals a here is amazing 1 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
piece of trash 0 
and it was boring 0 
i purcashed this for the car charger and it does not work 0 
and sometimes it was so embarrassing that i had to look away 0 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
ive had this for nearly 2 years and it has worked great for me 1 
this is one of peter watkins most accessible films 1 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
i own 2 of these cases and would order another 1 
the volume for the ringer is real good you have choices how loud 1 
not worth it 0 
each track commands sentiment actually contributing to the scenes and characters 1 
there is a lot of beautiful places 1 
it was awesome 1 
the greek dressing was very creamy and flavorful 1 
so bad 0 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
kind of flops around 0 
the chips that came out were dripping with grease and mostly not edible 0 
i would highly recommend this 1 
predictable but not a bad watch 1 
it is simple to use and i like it 1 
i think i was one of the people who found this another one of roths pearls 1 
dont waste your on this one 0 
great phone 1 
i guess i should have known that this place would suck because it is inside of the excalibur but i didnt use my common sense 0 
there is nothing authentic about this place 0 
best ive found so far ive tried 2 other bluetooths and this one has the best quality for both me and the listener as well as ease of using 1 
the soundtrack wasnt terrible either 1 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
see both films if you can 1 
the service here is fair at best 0 
clever and a real crowdpleaserthis film still ranks among mickeys best films even after 80 wonderful years 1 
they keep getting better and better this is my third one and ive had numerous palms too 1 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
very displeased 0 
last time buying from you 0 
the file browser offers all the options that one needshandsfree is great 1 
over rated 0 
you cant go wrong with any of the food here 1 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
i promise they wont disappoint 1 
the han nan chicken was also very tasty 1 
i am pairing this with my iphone and i could not be happier with it so far 1 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
i went on motorolas website and followed all directions but could not get it to pair again 0 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
ive had no trouble accessing the internet downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions 1 
woa talk about awful 0 
i was mortified 0 
total waste of time 0 
i was totally fascinated by the music the dancing everything 1 
there was a warm feeling with the service and i felt like their guest for a special treat 1 
this particular model would not work with my motorola q smartphone 0 
the service was a little slow considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace 0 
i was mortified 0 
im not really sure how joeys was voted best hot dog in the valley by readers of phoenix magazine 0 
there were too many close ups 0 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
im big fan of rpg games too but this movie its a disgrace to any selfrespecting rpger there is 0 
this is such a fun and funny movie 1 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
disappointed 0 
very satisifed with that 1 
i kept looking at the time and it had soon become 35 minutes yet still no food 0 
great choice 1 
it didnt charge for me 0 
the bartender was also nice 1 
that said our mouths and bellies were still quite pleased 1 
this is simply the best bluetooth headset for sound quality 1 
not much flavor to them and very poorly constructed 0 
theres really nothing bad i can say about this headset 0 
there is a totally unnecessary trainroller coaster scene 0 
its not user friendly 0 
we got sitting fairly fast but ended up waiting 40 minutes just to place our order another 30 minutes before the food arrived 0 
i highly recommend this movie for anyone interested in art poetry theater politics or japanese history 1 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
never again will i be dining at this place 0 
they do not care about the consumer one bit 0 
extremely tasty 1 
good audio quality 1 
the pleather case doesnt fit 0 
very displeased 0 
they made this case too small and is very difficult to install 0 
my fiancé and i came in the middle of the day and we were greeted and seated right away 1 
conclusion very filling meals 1 
i love this cable it allows me to connect any miniusb device to my pc 1 
it even has its sweet moments 1 
i really like this product over the motorola because it is allot clearer on the ear piece and the mic 1 
it was so cool 1 
there is no real plot 0 
an awesome new look for fall 2000 1 
the sweet potato fries were very good and seasoned well 1 
the pizza tasted old super chewy in not a good way 0 
the acting helps the writing along very well maybe the idiotsavant sister could have been played better and it is a real joy to watch 1 
and the chef was generous with his time even came around twice so we can take pictures with him 1 
i had strawberry tea which was good 1 
the earpiece on this is too large or too heavyit keeps falling out of my ear 0 
i love my 350 headset my jabra350 bluetooth headset is great the reception is very good and the ear piece is a comfortable fit 1 
the atmosphere was great with a lovely duo of violinists playing songs we requested 1 
con spotty service 0 
full of unconvincing cardboard characters it is blandly written by edward chodorov who also produced and is surprisingly directed by jean negulesco from whom one would expect a great deal more 0 
the service here is fair at best 0 
the film succeeds despite or perhaps because of an obviously meagre budget 1 
there is really nothing for me at postinos hope your experience is better 0 
if you are looking for a good quality motorola headset keep looking this isnt it 0 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
thats how id describe this painfully dreary timewaster of a film 0 
i dont think there are any redeeming qualities in this remake 0 
overall i am psyched to have a phone which has all my appointments and contacts in and gets great reception 1 
the performances are real and gripping the crocdodile is extremely well done indeed if the black water website is to be believed thats because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous 1 
give this one a look 1 
the sangria was about half of a glass wine full and was 12 ridiculous 0 
unfortunately it did not work 0 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
its so stupid to have to keep buying new chargers car chargers cradles headphones and car kits every time a new phone comes out 0 
just as good as when i had it more than a year ago 1 
i love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it 1 
id love to go back 1 
i find this inexcusable and so will probably be returning this phone and perhaps changing carriers 0 
what a waste of money and time 0 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
still waiting im sure this item would work well if i ever recieve it 0 
its so bad its actually worth seeing just for that reason 0 
i kept looking at the time and it had soon become 35 minutes yet still no food 0 
the dining space is tiny but elegantly decorated and comfortable 1 
poor reliability 0 
frozen pucks of disgust with some of the worst people behind the register 0 
the staff are great the ambiance is great 1 
a good commentary of todays love and undoubtedly a film worth seeing 1 
i believe the screenwriter did a good job of tying up the loose ends 1 
the characters were all funny and had the peculiarity of not having a true lead character 1 
i was very disappointed 0 
it is shameful 0 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
my boyfriend and i sat at the bar and had a completely delightful experience 1 
while i managed to bend the leaf spring back in place the metal now has enough stress that it will break on the next drop 0 
the ri style calamari was a joke 0 
wont go back 0 
very good food great atmosphere1 1 
verizons bills however are difficult to understand even though their pricing plans are simple 0 
it doesnt work in europe or asia 0 
a greasy unhealthy meal 0 
this phone might well be the worst ive ever had in any brand 0 
they really want to make your experience a good one 1 
you can even take self portraits with the outside exterior display very cool 1 
another thing i didnt really like is when a character got punched in the face a gallon of blood would spew forth soon after 0 
the dialogue sucked 0 
this totally unfunny movie is so over the top and pathetic and unrealistic that throughout the whole 90 minutes of utter torture i probably looked at my watch about 70000 times 0 
really ugly 0 
a usable keyboard actually turns a pda into a realworld useful machine instead of just a neat gadget 1 
excellent performance 1 
i wont be back 0 
the range is very decent ive been able to roam around my house with the phone in the living room with no receptionsound quality issues 1 
the refried beans that came with my meal were dried out and crusty and the food was bland 0 
the price was very good and with the free shipping and all it was a good purchase 1 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
what a disappointment 0 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
a standout scene 1 
it had some average acting from the main person and it was a low budget as you clearly can see 0 
cant say enough good things about this place 1 
but in any case the best part is you can download these pictures to your laptop using ir or even send pictures from your laptop to the phone 1 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
if youre not familiar check it out 1 
we had so much to say about the place before we walked in that he expected it to be amazing but was quickly disappointed 0 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
as an earlier review noted plug in this charger and nothing happens 0 
fans of the genre will be in heaven 1 
perhaps i caught them on an off night judging by the other reviews but im not inspired to go back 0 
it was an inexpensive piece but i would still have expected better quality 0 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
the worst one of the series 0 
eclectic selection 1 
i have purchased these for both family and friends and all enjoy their clarity and ease of use 1 
these are the central themes of the film and they are handled ineptly stereotypically and with no depth of imagination 0 
plus it was wellpaced and suited its relatively short run time 1 
i am very impressed with this headset from plantronics 1 
i liked the patio and the service was outstanding 1 
this phone tries very hard to do everything but fails at its very ability to be a phone 0 
the characters are interesting even if a bit predictable 1 
great movie 1 
50 down the drain 0 
cinematography noteworthy including fine views of barcelona and its famed gaudi towers 1 
how can anyone in their right mind ask for anything more from a movie than this 1 
they do not care about the consumer one bit 0 
sucked most of the stuff does not work with my phone 0 
and finally after all that we get to an ending that wouldve been great had it been handled by competent people and not jerry falwell 0 
never heard of any of them except cole who was totally unbelievable in the part 0 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
its also great to see that renowned silent screenwriter frances marion hasnt missed a step going from silent to sound 1 
this movie is bad 0 
your staff spends more time talking to themselves than me 0 
it was a waste of my money 0 
it is so small and you dont even realize that it is there after a while of getting used to it 1
