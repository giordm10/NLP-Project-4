this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
warning do not buy 0 
we were promptly greeted and seated 1 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
product is exactly as described 1 
schrader has made a resume full of lousy amateurish films 0 
jamie foxx absolutely is ray charles 1 
the food is about on par with dennys which is to say not good at all 0 
i am not a filmmaker nor am i a director but i would hide my head in the sand if id spent whatever amount of money and time on this movie 0 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
none of it works just dont buy it 0 
there is a totally unnecessary trainroller coaster scene 0 
thank you for wasting my money 0 
it looks very nice 1 
there is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again 0 
doesnt hold charge 0 
these are fabulous 1 
good value works fine power via usb car or wall outlet 1 
worst customer service ever 0 
elias koteasjack palance play good roles angelina is hot and gets nakedbilly drago appears in this and is cool as usual a cameo by sven ole thorsen helps make this a very enjoyable movie with good acting and a decent budget 1 
this was a different cut than the piece the other day but still wonderful and tender s well as well flavored 1 
a happy wonderful feel good ending 1 
small sleek impressive looking practical setup with ample storage in place 1 
the burger had absolutely no flavor the meat itself was totally bland the burger was overcooked and there was no charcoal flavor 0 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
just reading on the specs alone makes you say wow 1 
the story is lame not interesting and never really explains the sinister origins of the puppets 0 
will not be back 0 
never again will i be dining at this place 0 
a great film by a great director 1 
end of days is one of the worst bigbudget action movies ive ever seen 0 
the company shipped my product very promptly and it works well 1 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
if you are razr owneryou must have this 1 
this is a stunning movie 1 
the last 15 minutes of movie are also not bad as well 1 
i am pairing this with my iphone and i could not be happier with it so far 1 
what a great double cheeseburger 1 
the new characters werent all that memorable and i found myself forgetting who was who 0 
why was this film made 0 
im super pissd 0 
thats how id describe this painfully dreary timewaster of a film 0 
my first visit to hiro was a delight 1 
it was pretty gross 0 
well im satisfied 1 
and if that isnt enough of a mess of a movie for you the picture is also marred with a constant use of studio sets and indoor exteriors 0 
ive owned this phone for 7 months now and can say that its the best mobile phone ive had 1 
duris has a wholesome appearance and gives a fine performance 1 
having trouble with volume 0 
it really is impressive that the place hasnt closed down 0 
but this movie is definitely a below average rent 0 
the food was very good 1 
all the characters in this film are tremendously well played 1 
what a waste of money and time 0 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
spoilers whatever else can or cant be said about it surface is superbly crafted 1 
the service here leaves a lot to be desired 0 
adapter does not provide enough charging current 0 
there are many continuity errors one other user commented on different cars in the garage joes glassesthe one that got to me the most was the fact joes facial hair configuration seemed to change from scene to scene 0 
due to this happening on every call i was forced to stop using this headset 0 
it didnt charge for me 0 
its like a bad two hour tv movie 0 
the results well are a shame 0 
best headset ever 1 
worst thai ever 0 
yeah the movie pretty much sucked 0 
the charger worked for about a week and then completely stopped charging my phone 0 
call me a nut but i think this is one of the best movies ever 1 
if she had not rolled the eyes we may have stayed not sure if we will go back and try it again 0 
great price too 1 
the meat was pretty dry i had the sliced brisket and pulled pork 0 
you have to hold the phone at a particular angle for the other party to hear you clearly 0 
a great touch 1 
that said our mouths and bellies were still quite pleased 1 
i wont spoil it but the ending in pretty amazing 1 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
conclusion i loved it 1 
we waited for forty five minutes in vain 0 
i thoroughly enjoyed it when christopher eccleston took control of the tardis and the continuation of the series 1 
i bought this battery with a coupon from amazon and im very happy with my purchase 1 
that being said for a phone the camera is very nice many cool effects to play with and video is decent as well 1 
so they performed 1 
i dont recommend unless your car breaks down in front of it and you are starving 0 
it was packed 0 
great atmosphere friendly and fast service 1 
of course the footage from the 70s was grainy but that only enhanced the film 1 
i received my supposedly new motorola 375 and apparently there was not a match between the phone and the charger 0 
perhaps i caught them on an off night judging by the other reviews but im not inspired to go back 0 
will not be back 0 
service was very prompt 1 
works for me 1 
i would have given no star if i was able 0 
crisp and clear 1 
did not like at all 0 
yes its shiny on front side and i love it 1 
if you plan to use this in a car forget about it 0 
i was bored throughout the whole damn thing 0 
i really loved the story line and the poler bear was kinda cutebut if anyone has a question about fort steele just ask away 1 
eew this location needs a complete overhaul 0 
i love this phone 1 
this place should honestly be blown up 0 
all it took was one drop from about 6 inches above the kitchen counter and it was crackedi am not impressed and i am not laughing 0 
very good food great atmosphere1 1 
they know how to make them here 1 
my boyfriend and i sat at the bar and had a completely delightful experience 1 
i received my supposedly new motorola 375 and apparently there was not a match between the phone and the charger 0 
no shifting no bubbling no peeling not even a scratch nothingi couldnt be more happier with my new one for the droid 1 
its extremely slow and takes forever to do anything with it 0 
unfortunately any virtue in this films production work was lost on a regrettable script 0 
treo and tmobile refused to replace it again and forced me to buy another phone without any kind of upgrade discount 0 
either way it sucks 0 
secondly hitchcock pretty much perfected the thriller and chase movie 1 
will definitely be back 1 
seriously killer hot chai latte 1 
being a 90s child i truly enjoyed this show and i can proudly say that i enjoyed it big time and even more than the classical wb cartoons 1 
its pretty easy 1 
20th century foxs road house 1948 is not only quite a silly noir but is an implausible unmitigated bore of a movie 0 
i do love sushi but i found kabuki to be overpriced overhip and underservices 0 
the dining space is tiny but elegantly decorated and comfortable 1 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
that was done in the second movie 0 
there was no chemistry between ben affleck and sandra bullock in this film and i couldnt understand why he would consider even leaving his wifetobe for this chick that he supposedly was knocked out by 0 
unfortunately it was not good 0 
its a gloriously fun fast paced and fairly accurate portrayal of the night of a raver 1 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
you need two hands to operate the screenthis software interface is decade old and cannot compete with new software designs 0 
light weight i hardly notice it is there 1 
level 5 spicy was perfect where spice didnt overwhelm the soup 1 
the soundtrack wasnt terrible either 1 
i recommend igo to anyone with different brand cell phonesmp3 players in the family 1 
there was no chemistry between ben affleck and sandra bullock in this film and i couldnt understand why he would consider even leaving his wifetobe for this chick that he supposedly was knocked out by 0 
at first i thought i was grtting a good deal at 744 until i plugged it into my phone v3c razr 0 
it is practically useless and did not add any kind of boost to my reception after i bought it 0 
im not eating here 0 
i was left shattered from the experience of watching this film and i took a good two hours to fully recover 0 
horrible horrible protector 0 
just spicy enough perfect actually 1 
very disappointed and wondered how it could be in the oscar shortlist 0 
nice solid keyboard 1 
they do not last forever but is not overly expensive to replaceeasy to operate and the sound is much better than others i have tried 1 
first time going but i think i will quickly become a regular 1 
this is high adventure at its best 1 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
if you want a sandwich just go to any firehouse 1 
the entire audience applauded at the conclusion of the film 1 
it is rare when a filmmaker takes the time to tell a worthy moral tale with care and love that doesnt fall into the trap of being overly syrupy or over indulgent 1 
warning stay away 0 
in the summer you can dine in a charming outdoor patio so very delightful 1 
their daily specials are always a hit with my group 1 
their regular toasted bread was equally satisfying with the occasional pats of butter mmmm 1 
there was a warm feeling with the service and i felt like their guest for a special treat 1 
then as if i hadnt wasted enough of my life there they poured salt in the wound by drawing out the time it took to bring the check 0 
kind of flops around 0 
their chow mein is so good 1 
much more interesting more action more suspense and less of the unneeded controversy 1 
we ordered the duck rare and it was pink and tender on the inside with a nice char on the outside 1 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
problem is that the ear loops are made of weak material and break easily 0 
i never come again 0 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
very good phone 1 
the most annoying thing about cover girl is the way in which rita hayworth is put up on a pedestal 0 
i thoroughly enjoyed it when christopher eccleston took control of the tardis and the continuation of the series 1 
worst customer service ever 0 
insults profound deuchebaggery and had to go outside for a smoke break while serving just to solidify it 0 
the block was amazing 1 
tasted like dirt 0 
maybe there would be a reasonable explanation for this atrocity 0 
other than that the leather is nice and soft the fit is very tight the cut out for the face is a good shape 1 
it did not work in my cell phone plug i am very up set with the charger 0 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
echo problemvery unsatisfactory 0 
i tried the cape cod ravoli chickenwith cranberrymmmm 1 
awesome selection of beer 1 
this greedy corporation will never see another dime from me 0 
really ugly 0 
it makes very strange ticking noises before it ends the call 0 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
the eargels channel the sound directly into your ear and seem to increase the sound volume and clarity 1 
special mention should be made of the superb music score and sound effects which are an integral element in helping to make this such a memorable and enjoyable cartoon 1 
great pocket pc phone combination 1 
all the characters in this film are tremendously well played 1 
needless to say i wont be going back anytime soon 0 
a cheap and cheerless heist movie with poor characterisation lots of underbite style stoic emoting think chow yun fat in a better tomorrow and some cheesy clichés thrown into an abandoned factory ready for a few poorly executed flying judo rolls a la john woo 0 
really ugly 0 
i wasted my little money with this earpiece 0 
now this is a movie i really dislike 0 
lange had become a great actress 1 
frozen pucks of disgust with some of the worst people behind the register 0 
tasted like dirt 0 
while you dont yet hear mickey speak there are tons of sound effects and music throughout the filmsomething we take for granted now but which was a huge crowd pleaser in 1928 1 
i think that it is a must see older john wayne film 1 
the sets especially designed to work with the camera are amazingstylized beautiful and effective 1 
i am not a filmmaker nor am i a director but i would hide my head in the sand if id spent whatever amount of money and time on this movie 0 
i would have casted her in that role after ready the script 1 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
the food wasnt good 0 
an hour and a half i wish i could bring back 0 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
dont waste your money 0 
all the bread is made inhouse 1 
this movie totally grates on my nerves 0 
they really want to make your experience a good one 1 
its the best headset i have used 1 
it was a waste of my money 0 
does everything it should and more 1 
very disappointing 0 
worthwhile 1 
i got the aluminum case for my new palm vx and it worked really wellit has protected my handheld perfectly so far 1 
the service was terrible food was mediocre 0 
first time there and might just be the last 0 
customer service was terrible 0 
i have two more years left in this contract and i hate this phone 0 
also the area where my unit broke im not too fond of the magnetic strap 0 
great food and great service in a clean and friendly setting 1 
plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job 1 
not recommended 0 
frankly after cotton club and unfaithful it was kind of embarrassing to watch lane and gere in this film because it is bad 0 
he really didnt seem to want to be hosting his voiceovers were monotonous didnt get involved with the guests 0 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
the jamaican mojitos are delicious 1 
jawbone era is awesome too 1 
i dressed up to be treated so rudely 0 
it was a good thing that the tickets only cost five dollars because i would be mad if id have paid 750 to see this crap 0 
the food wasnt good 0 
his losing his marbles so early in the proceedings is totally implausible and unconvincing 0 
the whole experience was underwhelming and i think well just go to ninja sushi next time 0 
hated it 0 
i ordered the lemon raspberry ice cocktail which was also incredible 1 
but the convoluted plot just didnt convince me and much of the film was watched with a weird questioning glance 0 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
keep up the good work amazon 1 
once your food arrives its meh 0 
ill definitely be in soon again 1 
will definitely be back 1 
you cant beat the price on these 1 
the keyboard is a nice compromise between a full qwerty and the basic cell phone number keypad 1 
the plot was the same as pretty much every other cheap horror 0 
i am glad i purchased it 1 
i also decided not to send it back because our waitress looked like she was on the verge of having a heart attack 0 
i had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get some relief 0 
i could care less the interior is just beautiful 1 
any ring toneoverall good phone to buy 1 
very much disappointed with this company 0 
this game rocks 1 
first the bathrooms at this location were dirty seat covers were not replenished just plain yucky 0 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
its reception is very very poor 0 
went for lunch service was slow 0 
you can find better movies at youtube 0 
this movie is terrible 0 
no actress has been worse used that june allison in this movie 0 
they have horrible attitudes towards customers and talk down to each one when customers dont enjoy their food 0 
disappointing 0 
the wind and the lion is well written and superbly acted 1 
you will leave the theater wanting to go out and dance under the stars 1 
paolo sorrentino has written a wonderful story about loneliness and tony has built one of the most unforgettable characters seen in movies in recent years 1 
i do love sushi but i found kabuki to be overpriced overhip and underservices 0 
i had a pretty satifying experience 1 
after 20 minutes wait i got a table 0 
the movie seemed a little slow at first 0 
the whole experience was underwhelming and i think well just go to ninja sushi next time 0 
the story is also both funny and poignant at times 1 
i was able to do voice dialing in the car with no problem 1 
its not hard to make a decent hamburger 0 
good beer drink selection and good food selection 1 
i own a jabra earset and was very happy with it but the sound quality especially outgoing on this is better 1 
these are fabulous 1 
there is nothing privileged about workingeating there 0 
waited and waited and waited 0 
its like a bad two hour tv movie 0 
we made the drive all the way from north scottsdale and i was not one bit disappointed 1 
the food was terrible 0 
i had the mac salad and it was pretty bland so i will not be getting that again 0 
great character actors telly savalas and peter boyle 1 
ive had this for nearly 2 years and it has worked great for me 1 
wont go back 0 
it failed to convey the broad sweep of landscapes that were a great part of the original 0 
it works fine on my motorola 325 cellphone and a lot better than the wornout battery did 1 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
end of days is one of the worst bigbudget action movies ive ever seen 0 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
the movie has almost no action scenes in it and very little comedy 0 
the performances are real and gripping the crocdodile is extremely well done indeed if the black water website is to be believed thats because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous 1 
i do not know if this was emilio estevezs directorial debut but the pacing the interplay and development of the characters as well as some clever camera work surrounding the character estevez plays all suggest a natural eye 1 
the price is reasonable and the service is great 1 
it has kept up very well 1 
comfortable nice range good battery life 1 
overall i like this place a lot 1 
perhaps i caught them on an off night judging by the other reviews but im not inspired to go back 0 
a great film by a great director 1 
i liked the patio and the service was outstanding 1 
as an earlier review noted plug in this charger and nothing happens 0 
i received my orders well within the shipping timeframe everything was in good working order and overall i am very excited to have this source 1 
nice solid keyboard 1 
first of all there are enough racial stereotypes and racial jokes to offend everyone 0 
i dont each much pasta but i love the homemade hand made pastas and thin pizzas here 1 
good show samsung 1 
this is definitely one of the better documentaries i have seen looking at family relationships and marriage 1 
if youre not familiar check it out 1 
the plug did not work very well 0 
a pretty good product 1 
the seasonal fruit was fresh white peach puree 1 
the headset fulfills my requirements so i am happy with my purchase 1 
i bought this to use with my kindle fire and absolutely loved it 1 
the fries were great too 1 
they have horrible attitudes towards customers and talk down to each one when customers dont enjoy their food 0 
i bought this phone as a replacement for my startac and have regretted it since 0 
good beer drink selection and good food selection 1 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
they were goldencrispy and delicious 1 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
the story starts too fast with absolutely no suspense or buildup in the slightest 0 
i live in the neighborhood so i am disappointed i wont be back here because it is a convenient location 0 
it is a joy to use 1 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
product is useless since it does not have enough charging current to charge the 2 cellphones i was planning to use it with 0 
awesome selection of beer 1 
portable and it works 1 
i was seated immediately 1 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
product is useless since it does not have enough charging current to charge the 2 cellphones i was planning to use it with 0 
seafood was limited to boiled shrimp and crab legs but the crab legs definitely did not taste fresh 0 
this blueant supertooth handsfree phone speaker is awesome 1 
the food is good 1 
you truly take this journey through the eyes and soul of a child 1 
today the graphics are crap 0 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
the plot simply rumbles on like a machine desperately depending on the addition of new scenes 0 
the reception has been generally good 1 
the structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema 1 
better than youd expect 1 
the attractive set used throughout most of the film is an eyepleasing gem 1 
there is no plot or storyline 0 
the bose noise cancelling is amazing which is very important for a nyc commuter 1 
never been to hard rock casino before will never ever step forward in it again 0 
very good lunch spot 1 
will not be back 0 
people who like european films and art movies will like this movie 1 
the nokia ca42 usb cable did not work with my phone 0 
babie bop is very cute 1 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
the only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive 1 
your staff spends more time talking to themselves than me 0 
camera color balance is awful 0 
it felt like a very gripping intelligent stage play but without the overly theatrical feeling one actually gets from watching people on a stage which plays on everyones terror of a white lie escalating to monstrous consequences 1 
the nachos are a must have 1 
that being said for a phone the camera is very nice many cool effects to play with and video is decent as well 1 
we wont be going back anytime soon 0 
its extremely slow and takes forever to do anything with it 0 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
the movie lacks visual interest drama expression of feeling and celebration of the very patriotism that underlines the narrative 0 
i cant use this case because the smell is disgusting 0 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
i love lane but ive never seen her in a movie this lousy 0 
im probably one of the few people to ever go to ians and not like it 0 
but other than that the movie seemed to drag and the heroes didnt really work for their freedom 0 
all of the tapas dishes were delicious 1 
this game rocks 1 
exactly what i wanted 1 
the puppets look really cheesy not in a good way like in the puppet master 80s flicks 0 
i would highly recommend this product 1 
i think it was robert ryans best film because he portrayed someone like my father and he was a schizophrenic in real lifemy father although he never murdered anyone but was affected more so during the second world war which made him worse 1 
i cannot make calls at certain places 0 
always a great time at dos gringos 1 
if you are reading this please dont go there 0 
it features an outlandish array of memorable psychotic but lovable nuts 1 
this is the phone to get for 2005 i just bought my s710a and all i can say is wow 1 
friends pasta also bad he barely touched it 0 
dont buy this product 0 
big disappointment with calendar sync 0 
sounds good reasonably priced and effective its that simple 1 
very funny 1 
the presentation of the food was awful 0 
reasonably priced also 1 
bad fit way too big 0 
its pretty surprising that this wonderful film was made in 1949 as hollywood generally had its collective heads in the sand concerning black and white issues at that time 1 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
with the originality and freshness of the first movie now spent this remake had little else to offer 0 
a film not easily forgotten 1 
none of the three sizes they sent with the headset would stay in my ears 0 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
the only thing really worth watching was the scenery and the house because it is beautiful 1 
if good intentions made a film great then this film might be one of the greatest films ever made 1 
also were served hot bread and butter and home made potato chips with bacon bits on topvery original and very good 1 
best ive found so far ive tried 2 other bluetooths and this one has the best quality for both me and the listener as well as ease of using 1 
design flaw 0 
interesting decor 1 
10 out of 10 stars 1 
eew this location needs a complete overhaul 0 
these are the central themes of the film and they are handled ineptly stereotypically and with no depth of imagination 0 
they keep getting better and better this is my third one and ive had numerous palms too 1 
there was so much hype over this phone that i assumed it was the best my mistake 0 
bought mainly for the charger which broke soon after purchasing 0 
yet plantronincs continues to use the same flawed charger design 0 
this was such an awesome movie that i bought it off of ebay 1 
poor quality and service 0 
it is so small and you dont even realize that it is there after a while of getting used to it 1 
nicest chinese restaurant ive been in a while 1 
great food and awesome service 1 
it was probably dirt 0 
you can find better movies at youtube 0 
if you hate earbugs avoid this phone by all means 0 
very good though 1 
the atmosphere is modern and hip while maintaining a touch of coziness 1 
i get absolutely horrible reception in my apartment where with other phones i have not had this problem 0 
id say that would be the hardest decision honestly all of ms dishes taste how they are supposed to taste amazing 1 
who in their right mind is gonna buy this battery 0 
only like 3 or 4 buildings used a couple of locations maybe poor hummh 0 
i mean in a realistic world she would never have gotten into that ballet repertory the whole thing was quite pathetic 0 
gotta love those closeups of slimy drooling teeth 1 
the block was amazing 1 
star trek v the final frontier is the worst in the series 0 
the story line is totally predictable 0 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
this is an outstanding little restaurant with some of the best food i have ever tasted 1 
i would not recommend this place 0 
the place was fairly clean but the food simply wasnt worth it 0 
does not fit 0 
i have two more years left in this contract and i hate this phone 0 
everything on the menu is terrific and we were also thrilled that they made amazing accommodations for our vegetarian daughter 1 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
the film deserves strong kudos for taking this stand for having exceptional acting from its mostly lesserknown cast and for the superintelligent script that doesnt insult the audience or take the easy way out when it comes to white racism 1 
easy to pair with my samsung cell 1 
their daily specials are always a hit with my group 1 
their regular toasted bread was equally satisfying with the occasional pats of butter mmmm 1 
i could barely stomach the meal but didnt complain because it was a business lunch 0 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
the sangria was about half of a glass wine full and was 12 ridiculous 0 
garbo who showed right off the bat that her talents could carry over from the silent era i wanted to see some of her silent work but netflix doesnt seem to be stocking them 1 
i hate those things as much as cheap quality black olives 0 
returned 8 hours later 0 
but whatever it was that cost them so much it didnt translate to quality thats for sure 0 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
nice leather 1 
all in all a great disappointment 0 
setup couldnt have been simpler 1 
i ordered albondigas soup which was just warm and tasted like tomato soup with frozen meatballs 0 
even when the women finally show up there is no sign of improvement the most expected things happen and by the time the film is over you might be far asleep 0 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
the story which was told so eloquently by francis ford coppola 25 years earlier really unfolds gradually and leaves room for the characters to develop 1 
total brunch fail 0 
the food is not tasty at all not to say its real traditional hunan style 0 
the good cinematography also makes her and monica bellucci look very beautiful 1 
a good film by a great director 1 
we had so much to say about the place before we walked in that he expected it to be amazing but was quickly disappointed 0 
i recently tried caballeros and i have been back every week since 1 
i can assure you that you wont be disappointed 1 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
extremely tasty 1 
i do not know if this was emilio estevezs directorial debut but the pacing the interplay and development of the characters as well as some clever camera work surrounding the character estevez plays all suggest a natural eye 1 
it didnt charge for me 0 
speaking of the music it is unbearably predictably and kitchy 0 
this fixes all the problems 1 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
a standout scene 1 
also the phone doesnt seem to accept anything except cbr mp3s preferably ripped by windows media player 0 
it is not good 0 
i seriously cannot believe that the owner has so many unexperienced employees that all are running around like chickens with their heads cut off 0 
do not buy if you want to use the holster 0 
this totally unfunny movie is so over the top and pathetic and unrealistic that throughout the whole 90 minutes of utter torture i probably looked at my watch about 70000 times 0 
but this movie really got to me 1 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
im super pissd 0 
frankly after cotton club and unfaithful it was kind of embarrassing to watch lane and gere in this film because it is bad 0 
it probably would have been better if the director hadnt spent most of the movie showcasing his own art work which really isnt that noteworthy 0 
it plays louder than any other speaker of this size the price is so low that most would think the quality is lacking however its not 1 
i love this device 1 
none of them are engaging or exciting 0 
this one wants to surf on the small wave of space movies in 1998 deep impact and armageddon and this one fails everywhere 0 
top line dont waste your time and money on this one its as bad as it comes 0 
it is easy to turn on and off when you are in the car and the volume controls are quite accessable 1 
save your money ive had this item for 11 months now 0 
both films are terrible but to the credit of the 1986 version it was watchable 0 
the acting is fantastic the stories are seamlessly woven together and the dogs are splendid a must rent view or see 1 
that company is a joke 0 
i mean this in a terrible way 0 
this wonderful experience made this place a muststop whenever we are in town again 1 
what did bother me was the slow service 0 
ive owned this phone for 7 months now and can say that its the best mobile phone ive had 1 
the waitress and manager are so friendly 1 
pretty piece of junk 0 
phone falls out easily 0 
new battery works great in phone 1 
the service here leaves a lot to be desired 0 
every time he opened his mouth you expect to hear you see kids pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show 0 
would not reccommend 0 
we are so glad we found this place 1 
while i managed to bend the leaf spring back in place the metal now has enough stress that it will break on the next drop 0 
terrible phone holder 0 
waste of 13 bucks 0 
everything stinks 0 
bacon is hella salty 1 
avoid this establishment 0 
john garfield ann revere lilli plmer william conrad canada leeand filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screenjames wong howe 1 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
who in their right mind is gonna buy this battery 0 
for the price on amazon it is an excellent product which i would highly recommend 1 
great character actors telly savalas and peter boyle 1 
four stars for the food the guy in the blue shirt for his great vibe still letting us in to eat 1 
i have had tmobile service for 2 or 3 years now and i am pretty happy with it 1 
when i saw it in the theater i thought i was going to be sick 0 
be sure to order dessert even if you need to pack it togo the tiramisu and cannoli are both to die for 1 
del taco is pretty nasty and should be avoided if possible 0 
they could be used as exemplars for any set designer 1 
i have been in more than a few bars in vegas and do not ever recall being charged for tap water 0 
excellent phone 1 
the plot was the same as pretty much every other cheap horror 0 
only like 3 or 4 buildings used a couple of locations maybe poor hummh 0 
beautiful styling though 1 
the problem i have is that they charge 1199 for a sandwich that is no bigger than a subway sub which offers better and more amount of vegetables 0 
i love this phone 1 
unreliable im giving up 0 
having trouble with volume 0 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
worked very well paired with a treo 700w and as a skype headset on my pc using a usb bluetooth transceiver 1 
the food is rich so order accordingly 1 
i really liked that 1 
never again will i be dining at this place 0 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
i received it quickly and it works great 1 
we had so much to say about the place before we walked in that he expected it to be amazing but was quickly disappointed 0 
not only did the software do a great job of this i could also make my own ringtones form my existing cds without an internet connection 1 
2 thumbs up to this seller 1 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
the restaurant atmosphere was exquisite 1 
good prices 1 
definitely worth checking out 1 
excellent bluetooth headset 1 
and generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode 0 
i think this restaurant suffers from not trying hard enough 0 
too bad you have to pay up to a month for the service 0 
used and dirty 0 
dont buy it 0 
poor talk time performance 0 
i liked the patio and the service was outstanding 1 
bland not a liking this place for a number of reasons and i dont want to waste time on bad reviewing ill leave it at that 0 
how can anyone in their right mind ask for anything more from a movie than this 1 
it was attached to a gas station and that is rarely a good sign 0 
i wont be back 0 
the scenes with the ohsomature neighbourgirl are a misplace 0 
but the movie makes a lot of serious mistakes 0 
this was reflected not only in the cast but also in the belowpar script which borrowed much from the earlier classic 0 
best breakfast buffet 1 
this place is not quality sushi it is not a quality restaurant 0 
the bt headset was such a disapoinment 0 
cant say enough good things about this place 1 
for sushi on the strip this is the place to go 1 
good show samsung 1 
mishima is extremely uninteresting 0 
the flat reenactments dont hold your attention because they are emotionally adrift and stagy 0 
thats how id describe this painfully dreary timewaster of a film 0 
the service was a bit lacking 0 
i asked multiple times for the wine list and after some time of being ignored i went to the hostess and got one myself 0 
and i just love the colors 1 
its hard not to fall headoverheels in love with that girl 1 
it even has its sweet moments 1 
the nano stated itmy son was dissapointed 0 
it plays louder than any other speaker of this size the price is so low that most would think the quality is lacking however its not 1 
camera color balance is awful 0 
first the bathrooms at this location were dirty seat covers were not replenished just plain yucky 0 
battery life is also great 1 
and i really did find them funny 1 
he is one of my favourite directors and one of the most talented directors in the history of cinema 1 
ill give this film 10 out of 10 1 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
everything was good and tasty 1 
lets start with all the problemsthe acting especially from the lead professor was very very bad 0 
dont waste your money 0 
i would definitely recommend the jabra bt250v for those who are looking for comfort clarity and a great price 1 
10 out of 10 for both the movie and trilogy 1 
i had absolutely no problem with this headset linking to my 8530 blackberry curve 1 
talk about great customer service of course we will be back 1 
another thing i didnt really like is when a character got punched in the face a gallon of blood would spew forth soon after 0 
i will be back many times soon 1 
needless to say we will never be back here again 0 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
it fits so securely that the ear hook does not even need to be used and the sound is better directed through your ear canal 1 
great choice 1 
i really recommend this faceplates since it looks very nice elegant and cool 1 
there is simply no excuse for something this poorly done 0 
it is very comfortable to wear as well which is probably the most important aspect about using a case 1 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
in addition it feels amp looks as if the phone is all lightweight cheap plastic 0 
shrimp when i unwrapped it i live only 12 a mile from brushfire it was literally ice cold 0 
the sound quality is excellent as well 1 
about ten minutes into this film i started having second thoughts 0 
what on earth is irons doing in this film 0 
a piece of junk that broke after being on my phone for 2 days 0 
i seriously cannot believe that the owner has so many unexperienced employees that all are running around like chickens with their heads cut off 0 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
this movie is terrible 0 
it came free with a dvd player i bought but i still turned the thing off halfway through because i was embarrassed for howell 0 
it felt too light and tinny 0 
waiter was a jerk 0 
the shrimp tender and moist 1 
its an empty hollow shell of a movie 0 
i paid too much 0 
this place is good 1 
the battery life is highly unacceptable 0 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
regrettably the film fails 0 
the movie is terribly boring in places 0 
this is a masterful piece of filmmaking with many themes simmering and occasionally boiling over in this warts and all study of the poets bohemian selfindulgent wartime years that span the aerial bombardments of london and the outward tranquillity of a welsh coastal retreat the borderlines between friendship lust and love dedication to art and experience versus practical concerns jealousy rivalry cowardice and egotism versus heroism and selfsacrifice and more 1 
hes a national treasure 1 
i am sorry i made this purchase 0 
there is no plot or storyline 0 
but its just not funny 0 
exactly what i wanted 1 
pretty piece of junk 0 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
im still infatuated with this phone 1 
it didnt make me scared horrified or make me sympathetic towards the characters it was simply annoying 0 
i hate to disagree with my fellow yelpers but my husband and i were so disappointed with this place 0 
the food is rich so order accordingly 1 
the cg opening sequence in space looked like it could have been created on microsoft slideshow for gods sake 0 
the roast beef sandwich tasted really good 1 
when it opens the battery connection is broken and the device is turned off 0 
waste of money 0 
excellent product 1 
uncomfortable in the ear dont use with lg vx9900 env 0 
only pros large seating area nice bar area great simple drink menu the best brick oven pizza with homemade dough 1 
its a campy sort of film thats a joy to watch 1 
i immediately said i wanted to talk to the manager but i did not want to talk to the guy who was doing shots of fireball behind the bar 0 
i know he was a contract player with little control over his scripts but the acting was as bad as the script 0 
the live music on fridays totally blows 0 
dont waste your time here 0 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
not loud enough and doesnt turn on like it should 0 
all in all i think it was a good investment 1 
voice recognition is tremendous 1 
after 3 months screen just went black all of a sudden 0 
it was forced like everything in this movie 0 
worse theres an incredibly weak subplot thrown in that follows a little band of latterday mansonites as they go after a reporter whos working on a story on the anniversary of the killings 0 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
poor quality and service 0 
cinematography noteworthy including fine views of barcelona and its famed gaudi towers 1 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
hitchcock is a great director 1 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
an hour seriously 0 
his performance as awarded was stunning 1 
waitress was sweet and funny 1 
good value great food great service 1 
keep up the good work amazon 1 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
full of unconvincing cardboard characters it is blandly written by edward chodorov who also produced and is surprisingly directed by jean negulesco from whom one would expect a great deal more 0 
heres where the movie really pied me off 0 
be sure to order dessert even if you need to pack it togo the tiramisu and cannoli are both to die for 1 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
but even the talented carrell cant save this 0 
its reception is very very poor 0 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
there is a totally unnecessary trainroller coaster scene 0 
the secondary plot line is incomprehensible and its relation to the primary plot line is mystifying 0 
if you plan to use this in a car forget about it 0 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
easy to pair with my samsung cell 1 
very disappointed and wondered how it could be in the oscar shortlist 0 
these products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet 0 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
your brain will attempt to shutdown as part of a primal impulse of selfpreservation 0 
this is the kind of money that is wasted properly 1 
we started with the tuna sashimi which was brownish in color and obviously wasnt fresh 0 
the plot was the same as pretty much every other cheap horror 0 
piece of trash 0 
better than youd expect 1 
probably not in a hurry to go back 0 
what makes this story different are the terrific production values faultless photography composition and editing the terrific casting the underappreciated brian keith playing a bully teddy and vivid history 1 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
i had to wait over 30 minutes to get my drink and longer to get 2 arepas 0 
it is a joy to use 1 
if you are looking for a good quality motorola headset keep looking this isnt it 0 
bad purchase 0 
bacon is hella salty 1 
what a waste 0 
this is just a great movie 1 
i give it 2 thumbs down 0 
couldnt figure it out 0 
best tacos in town by far 1 
although i very much liked the look and sound of this place the actual experience was a bit disappointing 0 
basically the service was very bad 0 
then as if i hadnt wasted enough of my life there they poured salt in the wound by drawing out the time it took to bring the check 0 
i know this is not like the other restaurants at all something is very off here 0 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
everything from acting to cinematography was solid 1 
its welldesigned and very sharp the blue is a very nice color 1 
the acting by the whole cast could be put on a scale and balanced perfectly between overacting and underacting 0 
1010 1 
i hate writing bad reviews about films especially those in which i really like the star but this film is so bad i dont believe for one second that anyone could have been proud of it 0 
lordy the khao soi is a dish that is not to be missed for curry lovers 1 
disappointing accessory from a good manufacturer 0 
this was my first and only vegas buffet and it did not disappoint 1 
highly recommend for any one who has a blue tooth phone 1 
i ended up sliding it on the edge of my pants or back pockets instead 1 
waste of money 0 
long whiny and pointless 0 
ill be looking for a new earpiece 0 
the fact is this film is a wonderful heartwarming tale about two people chasing their dreams 1 
bad purchase 0 
his losing his marbles so early in the proceedings is totally implausible and unconvincing 0 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
worked great 1 
the staff is friendly and the joint is always clean 1 
the music in the film is really nice too 1 
and it was way to expensive 0 
i found this place by accident and i could not be happier 1 
kieslowski never ceases to amaze me 1 
the acting sucks the music sucks the script sucks the pacing sucks the special fx suck the directing sucks basically this movie sucks 0 
both do good jobs and are quite amusing 1 
i liked the patio and the service was outstanding 1 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
cant say enough good things about this place 1 
this phone might well be the worst ive ever had in any brand 0 
not good enough for the price 0 
adapter does not provide enough charging current 0 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
i mean in a realistic world she would never have gotten into that ballet repertory the whole thing was quite pathetic 0 
i was shocked because no signs indicate cash only 0 
would not recommend to others 0 
crust is not good 0 
id rather eat airline food seriously 0 
this is a really fantastic thai restaurant which is definitely worth a visit 1 
everything about this product is wrongfirst 0 
item arrived quickly and works great with my metro pcs samsung schr450 slider phone and sony premium sound in ear plugs 1 
its practically perfect in all of them  a true masterpiece in a sea of faux masterpieces 1 
terrible my car will not accept this cassette 0 
ive owned this phone for 7 months now and can say that its the best mobile phone ive had 1 
one thing i hate is the mode set button at the side 0 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
i love their fries and their beans 1 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
reception is terrible and full of static 0 
i love it 1 
i cant wait to go back 1 
1010 1 
it is very comfortable to wear as well which is probably the most important aspect about using a case 1 
also the story and acting were weak 0 
see both films if you can 1 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
very easy to use 1 
all the other cases ive tried normally fall apart after a few months but this one seems to be in for the long haul 1 
this was my first and only vegas buffet and it did not disappoint 1 
but other than that the movie seemed to drag and the heroes didnt really work for their freedom 0 
service is quick and even to go orders are just like we like it 1 
the only good thing was our waiter he was very helpful and kept the bloddy marys coming 1 
and the accents are absolutely abysmal 0 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
best headset ever 1 
very disappointing 0 
this place is good 1 
i also decided not to send it back because our waitress looked like she was on the verge of having a heart attack 0 
penne vodka excellent 1 
the kids are annoying 0 
for that its worth checking out 1 
very disappointing 0 
after one bite i was hooked 1 
superb phone on a great network 1 
im not sure what he was trying to do with this film 0 
i highly recommend this movie for anyone interested in art poetry theater politics or japanese history 1 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
a lot of websites have been rating this a very good phone and so do i 1 
this item is great installed it let it charged up overnite and it has been working good every since with no problems 1 
this company charge me a restocking fee and still not given me my refund back 0 
there was a warm feeling with the service and i felt like their guest for a special treat 1 
what the hell kind of crap is that 0 
it is shameful 0 
the acting helps the writing along very well maybe the idiotsavant sister could have been played better and it is a real joy to watch 1 
however i needed some better instructions 0 
it isnt even an achievement as a sobaditsgood or sobaditsmemorable movie 0 
i saw this movie and i thought this is a stupid movie 0 
excellent performance 1 
my brother in law who works at the mall ate here same day and guess what he was sick all night too 0 
echo problemvery unsatisfactory 0 
i am pairing this with my iphone and i could not be happier with it so far 1 
this item is great installed it let it charged up overnite and it has been working good every since with no problems 1 
the service was great even the manager came and helped with our table 1 
the telephone repair man was really funny and his reactions to the nuts and bitchy boss were truly genuine 1 
good prices 1 
leopard print is wonderfully wild 1 
lewis blacks considerable talent is wasted here too as he is at his most incendiary when he is unrestrained which the pg13 rating certainly wont allow 0 
damn good steak 1 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
this one works and was priced right 1 
lasted one day and then blew up 0 
its a case of so bad it is laughable 0 
i like steiners because its dark and it feels like a bar 1 
i enjoyed it 1 
plus it was wellpaced and suited its relatively short run time 1 
this is a beautiful phone 1 
cinematography noteworthy including fine views of barcelona and its famed gaudi towers 1 
every thing on phone work perfectly she like it 1 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
you get extra minutes so that you can carry out the call and not get cut off 1 
both of the egg rolls were fantastic 1 
i had to go to a store and bought a new nokia phone which is working great 1 
at any rate this film stinks its not funny and fulci should have stayed with giallo and supernatural zombie movies 0 
i checked everywhere and there is no feature for it which is really disappointing 0 
the staff is friendly and the joint is always clean 1 
service is friendly and inviting 1 
top line dont waste your time and money on this one its as bad as it comes 0 
my boyfriend and i came here for the first time on a recent trip to vegas and could not have been more pleased with the quality of food and service 1 
what this film lacks is a convincing script 0 
waitress was sweet and funny 1 
its practically perfect in all of them  a true masterpiece in a sea of faux masterpieces 1 
motorola finally got the voice quality of a bluetooth headset right 1 
the service here is fair at best 0 
it probably would have been better if the director hadnt spent most of the movie showcasing his own art work which really isnt that noteworthy 0 
nice ambiance 1 
the noise shield is incrediable 1 
the entire audience applauded at the conclusion of the film 1 
ample portions and good prices 1 
its one of the movies i need to see whenever it comes on tvnever mind the fact that i already have it memorized 1 
one nice thing was that they added gratuity on the bill since our party was larger than 6 or 8 and they didnt expect more tip than that 1 
a cheap and cheerless heist movie with poor characterisation lots of underbite style stoic emoting think chow yun fat in a better tomorrow and some cheesy clichés thrown into an abandoned factory ready for a few poorly executed flying judo rolls a la john woo 0 
the acting was decidely wooden though no worse than a period universal b movie 0 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
im surprised this is a good quality car charger and theres not much reviews about it 1 
special thanks to dylan t for the recommendation on what to order all yummy for my tummy 1 
could not get strong enough signal 0 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
this place is disgusting 0 
the battery is completely useless to me 0 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
the poor actors 0 
the flat reenactments dont hold your attention because they are emotionally adrift and stagy 0 
magical help 1 
awesome device 1 
their rotating beers on tap is also a highlight of this place 1 
it was a very superficial movie and it gave me the feeling that i was watching play rather than a film 0 
im not eating here 0 
it lasts less than 3o minutes if i actually try to use the phonemy wife has the same phone with the same problem 0 
the cinematography is simply stunning to say the least and the fx are nothing if not stateoftheart 1 
this is a disgrace 0 
i did not expect this to be so good 1 
i would highly recommend this product 1 
i might have gotten a defect but i would not risk buying it again because of the built quality alone 0 
i cant use this case because the smell is disgusting 0 
the script is a big flawed mess 0 
the best place in vegas for breakfast just check out a sat or sun 1 
anne heche was utterly convincing 1 
never heard of any of them except cole who was totally unbelievable in the part 0 
obviously they have a terrible customer service so you get what you pay for 0 
sam shepards portrayal of a gung ho marine was sobering 1 
it definitely was not as good as my s11 1 
the art style has the appearance of crayonpencil drawings and is wonderfully colorful and fanciful 1 
food was good service was good prices were good 1 
poor talk time performance 0 
you get incredibly fresh fish prepared with care 1 
i felt insulted and disrespected how could you talk and judge another human being like that 0 
food arrived quickly 1 
battery lasts only a few hours 0 
generally it just lacked imagination 0 
now this dish was quite flavourful 1 
would not go back 0 
those burgers were amazing 1 
highly unprofessional and rude to a loyal patron 0 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
i wont be back 0 
everything about this movie is stupid 0 
does everything it should and more 1 
she carries the movie well 1 
the price was very good and with the free shipping and all it was a good purchase 1 
also if your phone is dropped this case is not going to save it specially when dropped face down 0 
w810i is just superb 1 
unfortunately inexperience of direction meant that scene after scene passed with little in the way of dramatic tension or conflict 0 
this movie contained an allstar cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i havent seen before 1 
the script is a big flawed mess 0 
their research and development division obviously knows what theyre doing 1 
i saw it as a child on tv back in 1973 when it was the stranger and i loved it 1 
this is definitely one of the better documentaries i have seen looking at family relationships and marriage 1 
disappointed with battery 0 
the film succeeds despite or perhaps because of an obviously meagre budget 1 
its hard not to fall headoverheels in love with that girl 1 
krussel always good 1 
their chow mein is so good 1 
when i placed my treo into the case not only was it not snug but there was a lot of extra room on the sides 0 
works good 1 
wont go back 0 
i was very disappointed in the movie 0 
our server was very nice and even though he looked a little overwhelmed with all of our needs he stayed professional and friendly until the end 1 
the worst phone from samsungcrap this crappy samsung e715 is the worst i have ever seeen 0 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
i would recommend this 1 
no plot whatsoever 0 
good quality 1 
i purcashed this for the car charger and it does not work 0 
this is definitely a cult classic well worth viewing and sharing with others 1 
love the margaritas too 1 
i paid too much 0 
if i take a picture the battery drops a bar and starts beeping letting me know its dieing 0 
excellent product for the price 1 
i great reception all the time 1 
better than new 1 
the scenes with the ohsomature neighbourgirl are a misplace 0 
all the bread is made inhouse 1 
dont make the same mistake i did 0 
very poor service 0 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
after 3 months screen just went black all of a sudden 0 
its a feelgood film and thats how i felt when i came out of the cinema 1 
do not buy if you want to use the holster 0 
i had high hopes for this place since the burgers are cooked over a charcoal grill but unfortunately the taste fell flat way flat 0 
service was fantastic 1 
not easy to watch 0 
exactly what i wanted 1 
we are sending it back 0 
the story which was told so eloquently by francis ford coppola 25 years earlier really unfolds gradually and leaves room for the characters to develop 1 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
i wasnt expecting oscar material but this 0 
great brunch spot 1 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
i purchased this and within 2 days it was no longer working 0 
i want my money back 0 
first off the reception sucks i have never had more than 2 bars ever 0 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
krussel always good 1 
doesnt hold charge 0 
never been to hard rock casino before will never ever step forward in it again 0 
this is a stunning movie 1 
conclusion very filling meals 1 
for readers who have already seen one of miyazakis films he is still in top form and made another worthwhile experience 1 
excellent dualpurpose headset 1 
maybe its just their vegetarian fare but ive been twice and i thought it was average at best 0 
its a feelgood film and thats how i felt when i came out of the cinema 1 
jawbone era is awesome too 1 
hell no will i go back 0 
very very disappointed ordered the 35 big bay plater 0 
one more thing i can tolerate political incorrectness very well im all for artistic freedom and suspension of disbelief but the slavic female character was just too much 0 
that was nice 1 
im probably one of the few people to ever go to ians and not like it 0 
i believe that pitch black was done well 1 
this is definitely one of the better documentaries i have seen looking at family relationships and marriage 1 
the nokia ca42 usb cable did not work with my phone 0 
unfortunately it did not work 0 
this is definitely one of the better documentaries i have seen looking at family relationships and marriage 1 
great headset very impressed h500 1 
go rent it 1 
if you do go see this movie bring a pillow or a girlfriendboyfriend to keep you occupied through out 0 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
first the bathrooms at this location were dirty seat covers were not replenished just plain yucky 0 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
muddy low quality sound and the casing around the wires insert was poorly super glued and slid off 0 
thank you for wasting my money 0 
if there is a wind it is completely useless 0 
just what i wanted 1 
their rotating beers on tap is also a highlight of this place 1 
this place is good 1 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
that was done in the second movie 0 
the acting sucks the music sucks the script sucks the pacing sucks the special fx suck the directing sucks basically this movie sucks 0 
i got home to see the driest damn wings ever 0 
why was this film made 0 
hated it 0 
great phone 1 
at a time when it seems that film animation has been dominated by disneypixars cgi masterpieces it is both refreshing and comforting to know that miyazaki is still relying on traditional handdrawn animation to tell his charming and enchanting stories 1 
the story itself is just predictable and lazy 0 
damn good steak 1 
the reception has been generally good 1 
the warm beer didnt help 0 
bad reception 0 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
but kevin spacey is an excellent verbal tsunami as buddy ackerman  and totally believable because he is a great actor 1 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
my order was not correct 0 
it lasts less than 3o minutes if i actually try to use the phonemy wife has the same phone with the same problem 0 
some highlights great quality nigiri here 1 
i highly recommend this movie for anyone interested in art poetry theater politics or japanese history 1 
they are so easy to love but even more easy to identify with 1 
i bought this to use with my kindle fire and absolutely loved it 1 
great service and food 1 
much more interesting more action more suspense and less of the unneeded controversy 1 
the service here is fair at best 0 
it ranks highly as a great noircrimedrama incredible performances by belmondo and lino ventura 1 
1 long lasting battery you dont have to recharge it as frequentyly as some of the flip phones2 0 
i was very excited to get this headset because i thought it was really cute 1 
beautiful styling though 1 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
in summary this was a largely disappointing dining experience 0 
very comfortable 1 
the salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop which was perfectly cooked 1 
my boyfriend tried the mediterranean chicken salad and fell in love 1 
i love all the features and form factor 1 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
utterly without merit on any level this is akin to torture 0 
the service was outshining i definitely recommend the halibut 1 
horrible phone 0 
i have 23 bars on my cell phone when i am home but you cant not hear anything 0 
the only possible way this movie could be redeemed would be as mst3k fodder 0 
i was so insulted 0 
horrible horrible protector 0 
it does everything the description said it would 1 
only had this a month but its worked flawlessly so far 1 
i even fully charged it before i went to bed and turned off blue tooth and wifi and noticed that it only had 20 left in the morning 0 
1 long lasting battery you dont have to recharge it as frequentyly as some of the flip phones2 0 
and considering the two of us left there very full and happy for about 20 you just cant go wrong 1 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
id rather eat airline food seriously 0 
my only problem is i thought the actor playing the villain was a low rent michael ironside 0 
if only someone involved with it knew how to string together narrative 0 
lame would be the best way to describe it 0 
but it picked up speed and got right to the point 1 
this is a good joint 1 
i know that sounds funny but to me it seemed like sketchy technology that wouldnt work wellwell this one works great 1 
lovely little thriller from hitchcock with lots of nice shenanigans surrounding a murdered spy a kidnapped child a nasty church a foreign plot and some random taxidermists 1 
2 thumbs up to this seller 1 
cooked to perfection and the service was impeccable 1 
its worth driving up from tucson 1 
this company charge me a restocking fee and still not given me my refund back 0 
either way it sucks 0 
hence the whole story lacks a certain energy 0 
walked in and the place smelled like an old grease trap and only 2 others there eating 0 
mishima is extremely uninteresting 0 
disappointing accessory from a good manufacturer 0 
i think not again 0 
the service here leaves a lot to be desired 0 
love it great armband 1 
same problem as others have mentioned 0 
when i placed my treo into the case not only was it not snug but there was a lot of extra room on the sides 0 
never got it 0 
this was utterly confusing at first which caused me to lose a couple of very very important contacts 0 
i know that sounds funny but to me it seemed like sketchy technology that wouldnt work wellwell this one works great 1 
not good enough for the price 0 
these are the central themes of the film and they are handled ineptly stereotypically and with no depth of imagination 0 
the goat taco didnt skimp on the meat and wow what flavor 1 
but if you liked movies like the matrix and better yet their sequels i think youll appreciate the thought provoking mindblowing experience this film will give you 1 
however i needed some better instructions 0 
their frozen margaritas are way too sugary for my taste 0 
the crêpe was delicate and thin and moist 1 
i have to mention this and it is a huge spoiler i loved the ending how all the characters of the three films were the remaining survivors of the ferry disaster with valentine and the young judge together and the old man watching it on her tv solidifying his happiness over the suffering which he dealt with for those many years 1 
a good film by a great director 1 
they have horrible attitudes towards customers and talk down to each one when customers dont enjoy their food 0 
i really recommend this faceplates since it looks very nice elegant and cool 1 
it even has its sweet moments 1 
total letdown i would much rather just go to the camelback flower shop and cartel coffee 0 
it was that year however that reminded us that huston was still at the top of his game as evinced by his faithful adaptation of james joyces acclaimed novella the dead 1 
this film and i use that word loosely is an insult to the moviegoing public 0 
it is a very well acted and done tv movie 1 
i have been to very few places to eat that under no circumstances would i ever return to and this tops the list 0 
plus it was wellpaced and suited its relatively short run time 1 
the characters are interesting and you want to find out more about them the longer the movie goes on and i think people will be surprised by who does and doesnt make it 1 
they were excellent 1 
the flat reenactments dont hold your attention because they are emotionally adrift and stagy 0 
hated it 0 
overall i would recommend this phone over the new walkman 1 
i have to mention this and it is a huge spoiler i loved the ending how all the characters of the three films were the remaining survivors of the ferry disaster with valentine and the young judge together and the old man watching it on her tv solidifying his happiness over the suffering which he dealt with for those many years 1 
it has all the features i want 1 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
in conclusion i will not bother with this movie because a volcano in los angeles is nothing but nonsense 0 
in summary this was a largely disappointing dining experience 0 
is it possible for a movie to get any worse than this 0 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
we recently witnessed her poor quality of management towards other guests as well 0 
treo and tmobile refused to replace it again and forced me to buy another phone without any kind of upgrade discount 0 
this is one of peter watkins most accessible films 1 
you cant go wrong with any of the food here 1 
the film has great actors a master director a significant themeat least a wouldbe significant theme undertone of fifties existential worldweariness aerial scenes that ought to have thrilled both senses and imagination and characters about which one might deeply care 1 
great product and price 1 
verizon tech support walked my through a few procedures none of which worked and i ended up having to do a hard reset wiping out all my data 0 
it has a great camera thats 2mp and the pics are nice and clear with great picture quality 1 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
the voice recognition thru the handset is excellent 1 
the voice recognition thru the handset is excellent 1 
i had a pretty satifying experience 1 
no complaints 1 
doesnt hold charge 0 
i do think tom hanks is a good actor 1 
he is an amazing film artist one of the most important whoever lived 1 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
works as described 1 
it is shameful 0 
the service was meh 0 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
i gave it 5 stars because of the sound quality 1 
thank you for wasting my money 0 
the bipolarity of the ruthless thug one minute a ruthless killer the next minute a luvs diaper commercial is completely unconvincing 0 
my headset works just peachykeen 1 
the guys all had steaks and our steak loving son who has had steak at the best and worst places said it was the best steak hes ever eaten 1 
the pancake was also really good and pretty large at that 1 
will definitely be back 1 
the sets especially designed to work with the camera are amazingstylized beautiful and effective 1 
which has more depth and character than the man underneath it 0 
the place was fairly clean but the food simply wasnt worth it 0 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
it was also the right balance of war and love 1 
seriously killer hot chai latte 1 
i must say i have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again 1 
nice ambiance 1 
i had a seriously solid breakfast here 1 
excellent hands free tool 1 
great earpiece 1 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
you need two hands to operate the screenthis software interface is decade old and cannot compete with new software designs 0 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
i had heard good things about this place but it exceeding every hope i could have dreamed of 1 
very good food great atmosphere1 1 
my drink was never empty and he made some really great menu suggestions 1 
i had about two bites and refused to eat anymore 0 
very windresistant 1 
i found this place by accident and i could not be happier 1 
it kept getting worse and worse so now im officially done 0 
the structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema 1 
i use this product in a motor control center where there is a lot of high voltage humming from the equipment and it works great 1 
waiter was a jerk 0 
it kept getting worse and worse so now im officially done 0 
very disappointed and wondered how it could be in the oscar shortlist 0 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
2 thumbs up to this seller 1 
this place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver 0 
at around 4 pm i bought it at around 8pm i started to watch at around 815pm i fast forwarded the remaining film to see if there was anything left watchable for a human being with a brain but there wasnt 0 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
it is the best charger i have seen on the market yet 1 
you can find better movies at youtube 0 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
those burgers were amazing 1 
i wouldnt see this movie again for free 0 
just dont know why they were so slow 0 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
the writer gorman bechard undoubtedly did his homework because all references are industry and characterage appropriate 1 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
that one didnt work either 0 
we would recommend these to others 1 
reversible plug works great 1 
i know he was a contract player with little control over his scripts but the acting was as bad as the script 0 
sending it back 0 
do not make the same mistake as me 0 
i found a six inch long piece of wire in my salsa 0 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
there are the usual hitchcock logic flaws 0 
couldnt figure it out 0 
food arrived quickly 1 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
the scenes with the ohsomature neighbourgirl are a misplace 0 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
this totally unfunny movie is so over the top and pathetic and unrealistic that throughout the whole 90 minutes of utter torture i probably looked at my watch about 70000 times 0 
i mean this in a terrible way 0 
over rated 0 
this short film certainly pulls no punches 0 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
both of the egg rolls were fantastic 1 
also were served hot bread and butter and home made potato chips with bacon bits on topvery original and very good 1 
the guys all had steaks and our steak loving son who has had steak at the best and worst places said it was the best steak hes ever eaten 1 
a fantastic neighborhood gem 1 
im so sorry but i really cant recommend it to anyone 0 
very good stuff for the price 1 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
horrible phone 0 
of all the dishes the salmon was the best but all were great 1 
the meat was pretty dry i had the sliced brisket and pulled pork 0 
worked very well paired with a treo 700w and as a skype headset on my pc using a usb bluetooth transceiver 1 
its not user friendly 0 
this is a great deal 1 
it is rare when a filmmaker takes the time to tell a worthy moral tale with care and love that doesnt fall into the trap of being overly syrupy or over indulgent 1 
the dialogue is composed of things that make little sense 0 
perfect for someone me who only likes beer ice cold or in this case even colder 1 
we had so much to say about the place before we walked in that he expected it to be amazing but was quickly disappointed 0 
was not happy 0 
w810i is just superb 1 
the plantains were the worst ive ever tasted 0 
what a mistake that was 0 
i hate writing bad reviews about films especially those in which i really like the star but this film is so bad i dont believe for one second that anyone could have been proud of it 0 
logitech bluetooth headset is a 10 1 
fast service 1 
a world better than 95 of the garbage in the theatres today 1 
youll love it 1 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
it will drive you barking mad 0 
went in for happy hour great list of wines 1 
the design is very good4 1 
this product is great it makes working a lot easier i can go to the copier while waiting on hold for something 1 
i was shocked because no signs indicate cash only 0 
worst martini ever 0 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
it was either too cold not enough flavor or just bad 0 
my only complaint is the standard sound volume is a little low even when turned up to 5of 5 0 
im surprised this is a good quality car charger and theres not much reviews about it 1 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
the greek dressing was very creamy and flavorful 1 
its practically perfect in all of them  a true masterpiece in a sea of faux masterpieces 1 
i was not impressed by this product 0 
to be honest with you this is unbelievable nonsense and very foolish 0 
i was not impressed by this product 0 
in other words the content level of this film is enough to easily fill a dozen other films 1 
it dit not work most of the time with my nokia 5320 0 
i also didnt like the on button it felt like it would crack with use 0 
i recently tried caballeros and i have been back every week since 1 
the food was very good 1 
do not make the same mistake as me 0 
the characters were all funny and had the peculiarity of not having a true lead character 1 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
poor quality and service 0 
good value great food great service 1 
special mention should be made of the superb music score and sound effects which are an integral element in helping to make this such a memorable and enjoyable cartoon 1 
yet plantronincs continues to use the same flawed charger design 0 
hell no will i go back 0 
the camera on the phone may be used as a dustpan when indoors id rather be using a disposable then this 0 
all in all im quite satisfied with this purchase 1 
the turkey and roast beef were bland 0 
the acting sucks the music sucks the script sucks the pacing sucks the special fx suck the directing sucks basically this movie sucks 0 
after i pulled up my car i waited for another 15 minutes before being acknowledged 0 
that just screams legit in my booksomethats also pretty rare here in vegas 1 
it works 1 
nevertheless yet another wonderful film from the great masters stable 1 
the majority of the logitech earbud headsets failed 0 
the macarons here are insanely good 1 
i dont think ill be running back to carlys anytime soon for food 0 
exceptionally bad 0 
at no point in the proceedings does it look remotely like america 0 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
if you love death and decay and shakespears lyrics this is the one 1 
waitress was a little slow in service 0 
the bartender was also nice 1 
wont ever go here again 0 
for those that havent seen it dont waste your time 0 
the manager was the worst 0 
this is the first phone ive had that has been so cheaply made 0 
i was deeply impressed with the character he played 1 
i really dont see how anyone could enjoy this movie 0 
after charging overnight these batteries work great 1 
duris has a wholesome appearance and gives a fine performance 1 
we had a group of 70 when we claimed we would only have 40 and they handled us beautifully 1 
plus it was wellpaced and suited its relatively short run time 1 
worked very well paired with a treo 700w and as a skype headset on my pc using a usb bluetooth transceiver 1 
the shipping time was also very quick 1 
i dressed up to be treated so rudely 0 
the dining space is tiny but elegantly decorated and comfortable 1 
i felt insulted and disrespected how could you talk and judge another human being like that 0 
this totally unfunny movie is so over the top and pathetic and unrealistic that throughout the whole 90 minutes of utter torture i probably looked at my watch about 70000 times 0 
i have tried these cables with my computer and my ipod and it works just fine 1 
the shipping time was also very quick 1 
i got the aluminum case for my new palm vx and it worked really wellit has protected my handheld perfectly so far 1 
so dont go there if you are looking for good food 0 
the screen size is big key pad lit well enough and the camera quality is excellent for a camera phone 1 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
there are the usual hitchcock logic flaws 0 
i came over from verizon because cingulair has nicer cell phones the first thing i noticed was the really bad service 0 
great value 1 
i wasnt expecting oscar material but this 0 
the dining space is tiny but elegantly decorated and comfortable 1 
i have had mine for about a year and this christmas i bought some for the rest of the family 1 
it was a bit too sweet not really spicy enough and lacked flavor 0 
the whole experience was underwhelming and i think well just go to ninja sushi next time 0 
its the one movie that never ceases to interest me simply because it keeps me alert as i try to attempt to decipher its meanings 1 
just spicy enough perfect actually 1 
down the drain because of a weak snap 0 
treo and tmobile refused to replace it again and forced me to buy another phone without any kind of upgrade discount 0 
fantastic earphones 1 
portable and it works 1 
they have a plethora of salads and sandwiches and everything ive tried gets my seal of approval 1 
this mostly routine factbased tv drama gets a boost from the fine performance by cole 1 
the menu had so much good stuff on it i could not decide 1 
the burger i got the gold standard a 17 burger and was kind of disappointed 0 
worst hour and a half of my lifeoh my gosh 0 
the food came out at a good pace 1 
all in all an excellent restaurant highlighted by great service a unique menu and a beautiful setting 1 
but other than that the movie seemed to drag and the heroes didnt really work for their freedom 0 
the grilled chicken was so tender and yellow from the saffron seasoning 1 
the seasonal fruit was fresh white peach puree 1 
avoid at all costs 0 
service was fantastic 1 
the structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema 1 
this place is handsdown one of the best places to eat in the phoenix metro area 1 
good case 1 
very good lunch spot 1 
this is a stunning movie 1 
the cocktails are all handmade and delicious 1 
my 5year old nokia 2160 from tracfone holds the charge a lot better than this 0 
this allows the possibility of double booking for the same date and time after the first 0 
you truly take this journey through the eyes and soul of a child 1 
extremely tasty 1 
comfort for our whole family 1 
like the other reviewer said you couldnt pay me to eat at this place again 0 
i wont say any more i dont like spoilers so i dont want to be one but i believe this film is worth your time 1 
it was a bit too sweet not really spicy enough and lacked flavor 0 
it is shameful 0 
this is so embarassing and also my ears hurt if i try to push the ear plug into my ear 0 
the phone was unusable and was not new 0 
in particular the relationship between the bakery assistant and the waitress just didnt work for me at all 0 
for service i give them no stars 0 
first time going but i think i will quickly become a regular 1 
if i take a picture the battery drops a bar and starts beeping letting me know its dieing 0 
with the originality and freshness of the first movie now spent this remake had little else to offer 0 
dont waste your on this one 0 
pretty piece of junk 0 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
appears to actually outperform the original battery from china that came with my v325i 1 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
the acting from all involved and that includes those like shatner and nimoy is bad and washed out and making them seem as old as they look in real life the special effects are tacky like when spock has to rescue kirk on a jet pack when he falls down from a mountain 0 
im not really sure how joeys was voted best hot dog in the valley by readers of phoenix magazine 0 
worked great 1 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
the goat taco didnt skimp on the meat and wow what flavor 1 
i never walked out of a movie faster 0 
the salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop which was perfectly cooked 1 
no complaints 1 
this is a great deal 1 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
my brother in law who works at the mall ate here same day and guess what he was sick all night too 0 
great pocket pc phone combination 1 
a very charming film with wonderful sentiment and heart 1 
he is almost unbearable to watch on screen he has little to no charisma and terrible comedic timing 0 
i have to jiggle the plug to get it to line up right to get decent volume 0 
bad script bad direction and horrible acting make this one plain bad 0 
only had this a month but its worked flawlessly so far 1 
but the convoluted plot just didnt convince me and much of the film was watched with a weird questioning glance 0 
these are certainly very comfortable and functionality is decent 1 
i wish i could return the unit and get back my money 0 
i would have casted her in that role after ready the script 1 
im still trying to get over how bad it was 0 
exactly what i wanted 1 
you will leave the theater wanting to go out and dance under the stars 1 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
i want my money back 0 
i ate there twice on my last visit and especially enjoyed the salmon salad 1 
this is high adventure at its best 1 
this is cool because most cases are just open there allowing the screen to get all scratched up 1 
the lighting is awful 0 
sucked most of the stuff does not work with my phone 0 
its aggravating 0 
the food came out at a good pace 1 
the food is very good for your typical bar food 1 
not only did the software do a great job of this i could also make my own ringtones form my existing cds without an internet connection 1 
think of the film being like a dream 1 
worked very well paired with a treo 700w and as a skype headset on my pc using a usb bluetooth transceiver 1 
i have two more years left in this contract and i hate this phone 0 
lets start with all the problemsthe acting especially from the lead professor was very very bad 0 
an absolute must visit 1 
i know that sounds funny but to me it seemed like sketchy technology that wouldnt work wellwell this one works great 1 
it is well made easy to access the phone and has a handy detachable belt clip 1 
this is an extraordinary film 1 
you wont forget this movie 1 
i would recommend saving room for this 1 
for sushi on the strip this is the place to go 1 
do not purchase this phone 0 
will definitely be back 1 
one nice thing was that they added gratuity on the bill since our party was larger than 6 or 8 and they didnt expect more tip than that 1 
good value works fine power via usb car or wall outlet 1 
exactly what i wanted 1 
excellent product for the price 1 
a great touch 1 
items stated as included from the description are not included 0 
excellent dualpurpose headset 1 
it was a bit too sweet not really spicy enough and lacked flavor 0 
the only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port irda 0 
i wish i could return the unit and get back my money 0 
makes it easier to keep up with my bluetooth when im not wearing it 0 
beware this is not a trashy cult movie this is trash period 0 
portable and it works 1 
as i said abovepretty useless 0 
much less than the jawbone i was going to replace it with 1 
cinematography the film was shot in an interesting way 1 
secondly hitchcock pretty much perfected the thriller and chase movie 1 
this is just a great movie 1 
the dining space is tiny but elegantly decorated and comfortable 1 
im surprised this is a good quality car charger and theres not much reviews about it 1 
horrible 0 
the casting is also horrible cause all you see is a really really bad actors period 0 
elias koteasjack palance play good roles angelina is hot and gets nakedbilly drago appears in this and is cool as usual a cameo by sven ole thorsen helps make this a very enjoyable movie with good acting and a decent budget 1 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
food arrived quickly 1 
as a sushi lover avoid this place by all means 0 
i promise they wont disappoint 1 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
the film is way too long 0 
if you stay in vegas you must get breakfast here at least once 1 
i tried the cape cod ravoli chickenwith cranberrymmmm 1 
each day of the week they have a different deal and its all so delicious 1 
the food is good 1 
it worked very well 1 
the headsets are easy to use and everyone loves them 1 
i checked everywhere and there is no feature for it which is really disappointing 0 
this was utterly confusing at first which caused me to lose a couple of very very important contacts 0 
the 12 mega pixel camera being a part of a phone is reasonably good7 1 
this is just a great movie 1 
they were excellent 1 
i was particularly pleased with the acting ability of dwight schultz 1 
service was very prompt 1 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
worse theres an incredibly weak subplot thrown in that follows a little band of latterday mansonites as they go after a reporter whos working on a story on the anniversary of the killings 0 
my salad had a bland vinegrette on the baby greens and hearts of palm 0 
what on earth is irons doing in this film 0 
fantastic buy and will get again for whatever my next phone is 1 
50 down the drain 0 
cant say enough good things about this place 1 
full of unconvincing cardboard characters it is blandly written by edward chodorov who also produced and is surprisingly directed by jean negulesco from whom one would expect a great deal more 0 
i am so pleased to know such a modern day genius is out there letting is passion for art drive him and taking us as an audience with him 1 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
the characters are interesting even if a bit predictable 1 
this totally unfunny movie is so over the top and pathetic and unrealistic that throughout the whole 90 minutes of utter torture i probably looked at my watch about 70000 times 0 
i would have casted her in that role after ready the script 1 
on the ground right next to our table was a large smeared beensteppedinandtrackedeverywhere pile of green bird poop 0 
it also had a new problem 0 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
first time there and might just be the last 0 
the plot is nonsense that doesnt interest in the slightest way or have any uniqueness to it 0 
not much dialogue not much music the whole film was shot as elaborately and aesthetically like a sculpture 1 
you cant relate with them hell you barely can understand them 0 
cinematography the film was shot in an interesting way 1 
the casting is also horrible cause all you see is a really really bad actors period 0 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
food was below average 0 
sounds good reasonably priced and effective its that simple 1 
the cast was great 1 
the telephone repair man was really funny and his reactions to the nuts and bitchy boss were truly genuine 1 
your staff spends more time talking to themselves than me 0 
so good i am going to have to review this place twice once hereas a tribute to the place and once as a tribute to an event held here last night 1 
the bose noise cancelling is amazing which is very important for a nyc commuter 1 
i have recommended it to friends 1 
i am sorry i made this purchase 0 
do not waste your money here 0 
its like a bad two hour tv movie 0 
the best example of how dumb the writing is when its established that you can turn the zombiestudents back into humans by removing a necklace containing a piece of the meteorite 0 
we had fantastic service and were pleased by the atmosphere 1 
youd have to have the iq of particularly stupid mollusk not to see that one coming 0 
lousy product 0 
i exchanged the sony ericson z500a for this and im pretty happy with that decision 1 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
i liked the patio and the service was outstanding 1 
lot of holes in the plot theres nothing about how he became the emperor nothing about where he spend 20 years between his childhood and mature age 0 
it is simple to use and i like it 1 
best headset ever 1 
its a case of so bad it is laughable 0 
the mic there is a joke and the volume is quite low 0 
food arrived quickly 1 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
very nice and relaxing late night viewing 1 
there is a lot of beautiful places 1 
an excellent new restaurant by an experienced frenchman 1 
the most annoying thing about cover girl is the way in which rita hayworth is put up on a pedestal 0 
artless camerawork endlessly presents us with the ugliest setting imaginable ie 0 
the only good thing was that it fits comfortably on small ears 1 
dont buy this product it fails 0 
i dont think ill be running back to carlys anytime soon for food 0 
the nano stated itmy son was dissapointed 0 
add betty white and jean smart and you have a great cast everyone played their parts really well 1 
a greasy unhealthy meal 0 
the only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive 1 
the soundtrack sucked 0 
ive only had my bluetooth for a few weeks but i really like it 1 
very serious spoilers this movie was a huge disappointment 0 
the football scenes at the end were perplexing 0 
the servers went back and forth several times not even so much as an are you being helped 0 
i felt asleep the first time i watched it so i can recommend it for insomniacs 0 
nothing at all to recommend 0 
a usable keyboard actually turns a pda into a realworld useful machine instead of just a neat gadget 1 
we wont be going back anytime soon 0 
phone now holds charge like it did when it was new 1 
a good film by a great director 1 
they have a really nice atmosphere 1 
the pizza selections are good 1 
the explosion of the gas tanks at the end was just as awful 0 
its like a bad two hour tv movie 0 
do not buy if you want to use the holster 0 
an italian reviewer called this a small great film and thats right 1 
mic doesnt work 0 
very good food great atmosphere1 1 
horrible had to switch 3 times 0 
on three different occasions i asked for well done or medium well and all three times i got the bloodiest piece of meat on my plate 0 
its really easy 1 
this is the place where i first had pho and it was amazing 1 
i think the most wonderful parts literally full of wonder are the excerpts from his works 1 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
so anyone near you will hear part of your conversation 0 
theres barely a boring moment in the film and there are plenty of humorous parts 1 
i dont think you will be disappointed 1 
the story is beyond stupid 0 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
the only very disappointing thing was there was no speakerphone 0 
comfortable in my hand 1 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
the dialogue sucked 0 
it was that loudglad to say that the plantronics 510 maintains a flawless connection to my cell and with no static during normal use 1 
a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it 1 
the folks at otto always make us feel so welcome and special 1 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
the only good thing was our waiter he was very helpful and kept the bloddy marys coming 1 
i go to far too many places and ive never seen any restaurant that serves a 1 egg breakfast especially for 400 0 
i was not happy with this item 0 
the stories were as unbelievable as the actors 0 
and then tragedy struck 0 
this would not even be good as a made for tv flick 0 
bad reception 0 
you could only take 2 videos at a time and the quality was very poor 0 
and if that isnt enough of a mess of a movie for you the picture is also marred with a constant use of studio sets and indoor exteriors 0 
case was more or less an extra that i originally put on but later discarded because it scratched my ear 0 
im still infatuated with this phone 1 
needless to say i wont be going back anytime soon 0 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
unfortunately it did not work 0 
i just wanted to leave 0 
avoid at any and all costs 0 
the lighting is awful 0 
it was also the right balance of war and love 1 
this place is pretty good nice little vibe in the restaurant 1 
mediocre food 0 
worst foodservice ive had in a while 0 
nargile i think you are great 1 
does not fit 0 
a piece of junk that broke after being on my phone for 2 days 0 
they have been around for years and carries the highest quality of antiglare screen protector that i have found to date 1 
i like the fact that it rests lightly against your ear rather than inside 1 
we watched our waiter pay a lot more attention to other tables and ignore us 0 
tonight i had the elk filet specialand it sucked 0 
worst martini ever 0 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
it is an hour and half waste of time following a bunch of very pretty high schoolers whine and cry about life 0 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
the art style has the appearance of crayonpencil drawings and is wonderfully colorful and fanciful 1 
disappointing accessory from a good manufacturer 0 
he really didnt seem to want to be hosting his voiceovers were monotonous didnt get involved with the guests 0 
what did bother me was the slow service 0 
my order was not correct 0 
the staff are great the ambiance is great 1 
i never come again 0 
the service was meh 0 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
i use this product in a motor control center where there is a lot of high voltage humming from the equipment and it works great 1 
we had 7 at our table and the service was pretty fast 1 
everything stinks 0 
add betty white and jean smart and you have a great cast everyone played their parts really well 1 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
this place should honestly be blown up 0 
very displeased 0 
this product had a strong rubberpetroleum smell that was unbearable after a while and caused me to return it 0 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
these products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet 0 
im a big fan of this series mostly due to anne rices style sensitivities and treatments 1 
the shrimp tender and moist 1 
simply beautiful 1 
then our food came out disappointment ensued 0 
i immediately said i wanted to talk to the manager but i did not want to talk to the guy who was doing shots of fireball behind the bar 0 
but when someone strives for greatness and poetry but delivers a muddled and often ridiculous story a bunch of disparate scenes pretentious dialogue then you get the worst kind of a movie that some other reviewer very accurately defined as pretentious crap 0 
but even the talented carrell cant save this 0 
its a gloriously fun fast paced and fairly accurate portrayal of the night of a raver 1 
ive had this bluetoooth headset for some time now and still not comfortable with the way it fits on the ear 0 
its welldesigned and very sharp the blue is a very nice color 1 
its so bad its actually worth seeing just for that reason 0 
the headsets are easy to use and everyone loves them 1 
even in my bmw 3 series which is fairly quiet i have trouble hearing what the other person is saying 0 
a truly truly bad film 0 
the file browser offers all the options that one needshandsfree is great 1 
ive had this bluetoooth headset for some time now and still not comfortable with the way it fits on the ear 0 
friends pasta also bad he barely touched it 0 
i believe that pitch black was done well 1 
characters are onedimensional even the good guys and especially the bad guys 0 
i wont be back 0 
graphics is far from the best part of the game 0 
im happy about this purchase good quality and low price 1 
i do not know if this was emilio estevezs directorial debut but the pacing the interplay and development of the characters as well as some clever camera work surrounding the character estevez plays all suggest a natural eye 1 
i great reception all the time 1 
having trouble with volume 0 
we had a group of 70 when we claimed we would only have 40 and they handled us beautifully 1 
what on earth is irons doing in this film 0 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 
when my mom and i got home she immediately got sick and she only had a few bites of salad 0 
the delivery was on time 1 
coming here is like experiencing an underwhelming relationship where both parties cant wait for the other person to ask to break up 0 
try them in the airport to experience some tasty food and speedy friendly service 1 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
happy so far 1 
it was a very superficial movie and it gave me the feeling that i was watching play rather than a film 0 
after trying many many handsfree gadgets this is the one that finally works well 1 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
my boyfriend and i came here for the first time on a recent trip to vegas and could not have been more pleased with the quality of food and service 1 
well packaged arrived on time and works as intended 1 
it is rare when a filmmaker takes the time to tell a worthy moral tale with care and love that doesnt fall into the trap of being overly syrupy or over indulgent 1 
while you dont yet hear mickey speak there are tons of sound effects and music throughout the filmsomething we take for granted now but which was a huge crowd pleaser in 1928 1 
it looks very nice 1 
i am very impressed with the job that motorola did on the sturdiness of this phone 1 
the bt headset was such a disapoinment 0 
it looses connection to the phone even when it is within a couple feet between the two 0 
im not sure how long we stood there but it was long enough for me to begin to feel awkwardly out of place 0 
yet plantronincs continues to use the same flawed charger design 0 
i really loved the story line and the poler bear was kinda cutebut if anyone has a question about fort steele just ask away 1 
the structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema 1 
maybe there would be a reasonable explanation for this atrocity 0 
it is shameful 0 
this place deserves no stars 0 
even the squibs look awful 0 
plus it was wellpaced and suited its relatively short run time 1 
crash is a depressing little nothing that provokes emotion but teaches you nothing if you already know racism and prejudice are bad things 0 
this was like the final blow 0 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
it does everything the description said it would 1 
what a mistake that was 0 
good prices 1 
the movie is not completely perfect but titta di girolamo will stay with you for a long time after the vision of the movie 1 
all in all id expected a better consumer experience from motorola 0 
walked in and the place smelled like an old grease trap and only 2 others there eating 0 
so for our enjoyment we get to see them run around play games and be dangerous 1 
wont ever go here again 0 
the service was a bit lacking 0 
if it were possible to give them zero stars theyd have it 0 
the fries were not hot and neither was my burger 0 
personally i think it shows that people should learn to find a compromise them self without involving other people into issue 1 
works like a charm it work the same as the one i got with the phone 1 
i give wirefly 1 stari will contact cingularatt and inform them of this practice 0 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
the servers are not pleasant to deal with and they dont always honor pizza hut coupons 0 
sam shepards portrayal of a gung ho marine was sobering 1 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
ive only had my bluetooth for a few weeks but i really like it 1 
the waitress was friendly and happy to accomodate for veganveggie options 1 
unfortunately it will not recharge my iphone 4s despite connecting it from multiple power sources imac external battery wall outlet etc 0 
juano hernandez an exceptional actor who played supporting roles in many films of the era is a proud black man who is accused of murdering a white man in the south 1 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
i live in the neighborhood so i am disappointed i wont be back here because it is a convenient location 0 
five star plus plus 1 
i dont think i will be back for a very long time 0 
not easy to watch 0 
very serious spoilers this movie was a huge disappointment 0 
the lighting is just dark enough to set the mood 1 
the chefs were friendly and did a good job 1 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
great food and great service in a clean and friendly setting 1 
very clear quality sound and you dont have to mess with the sound on your ipod since you have the sound buttons on the headset 1 
i got the aluminum case for my new palm vx and it worked really wellit has protected my handheld perfectly so far 1 
my drink was never empty and he made some really great menu suggestions 1 
my friend loved the salmon tartar 1 
what is even more stupid is that who had thought an idea that there should be a volcano in los angeles 0 
we watched our waiter pay a lot more attention to other tables and ignore us 0 
i had strawberry tea which was good 1 
it was equally awful 0 
bland not a liking this place for a number of reasons and i dont want to waste time on bad reviewing ill leave it at that 0 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
the movie is not completely perfect but titta di girolamo will stay with you for a long time after the vision of the movie 1 
save your money ive had this item for 11 months now 0 
so dont go there if you are looking for good food 0 
shrimp when i unwrapped it i live only 12 a mile from brushfire it was literally ice cold 0 
i used bitpim a free program you can find on the internetto transfer data to the phonethe price of the cable was excellent 1 
do not make the same mistake as me 0 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
very disappointing 0 
the jabra eargels fit my ears very well 1 
the script is bad very bad  it contains both cheesiness and unethical joke that you normally see in rated r or nc17 movie 0 
worst martini ever 0 
works great 1 
i was disgusted because i was pretty sure that was human hair 0 
youll love it 1 
not nearly as good looking as the amazon picture makes it look 0 
the flat reenactments dont hold your attention because they are emotionally adrift and stagy 0 
con spotty service 0 
also the area where my unit broke im not too fond of the magnetic strap 0 
the potatoes were like rubber and you could tell they had been made up ahead of time being kept under a warmer 0 
jawbone era is awesome too 1 
very much disappointed with this company 0 
the film has an ultracheap look to it 0 
it is easy to turn on and off when you are in the car and the volume controls are quite accessable 1 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
i loved it 1 
it is rare when a filmmaker takes the time to tell a worthy moral tale with care and love that doesnt fall into the trap of being overly syrupy or over indulgent 1 
i got home to see the driest damn wings ever 0 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
sweetest phone 1 
if you love death and decay and shakespears lyrics this is the one 1 
camera color balance is awful 0 
the result is a powerhouse achievement made more timely now perhaps because of our cultures disturbing fascination with celebrity and its distorted interpretations of fame 1 
this product had a strong rubberpetroleum smell that was unbearable after a while and caused me to return it 0 
oh this is such a thing of beauty this restaurant 1 
good prices 1 
it failed to convey the broad sweep of landscapes that were a great part of the original 0 
we have gotten a lot of compliments on it 1 
this one is simply a disappointment 0 
gotta love those closeups of slimy drooling teeth 1 
if you are razr owneryou must have this 1 
horrible horrible protector 0 
what a mistake that was 0 
try them in the airport to experience some tasty food and speedy friendly service 1 
over rated 0 
ample portions and good prices 1 
great place to eat reminds me of the little mom and pop shops in the san francisco bay area 1 
a great touch 1 
think of the film being like a dream 1 
does not fit 0 
ive never been treated so bad 0 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
yeah the movie pretty much sucked 0 
its uncomfortable and the sound quality is quite poor compared with the phone razr or with my previous wired headset that plugged into an lg 0 
couldnt figure it out 0 
the potatoes were great and so was the biscuit 1 
110 and only because there is no setting for 010 0 
why are these sad little vegetables so overcooked 0 
why was this film made 0 
works well 1 
awsome device works great 1 
i wasnt really impressed with strip steak 0 
so in a nutshell 1 the restaraunt smells like a combination of a dirty fish market and a sewer 0 
the restaurant atmosphere was exquisite 1 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
doesnt last long 0 
i am going to have to be the first to negatively review this product 0 
bland not a liking this place for a number of reasons and i dont want to waste time on bad reviewing ill leave it at that 0 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
the seller is very understanding and patient i would definitely buy from them again 1 
how can you call yourself a steakhouse if you cant properly cook a steak i dont understand 0 
low quality 0 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
i have yet to run this new battery below two bars and thats three days without charging 1 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
some may say this buffet is pricey but i think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot 1 
great food and awesome service 1 
the nokia ca42 usb cable did not work with my phone 0 
why are these sad little vegetables so overcooked 0 
an excellent new restaurant by an experienced frenchman 1 
easily none other cartoon made me laugh in a tender way before getting into dark sitcoms oriented for teenagers 1 
this is a great place to eat 1 
rating 010 grade z note the show is so bad that even mother of the cast pull her daughter out of the show 0 
the acting is like watching wooden puppets moving around and reading from a book thats how bad it is 0 
nice spicy and tender 1 
not a pleasant voyage of selfdiscovery 0 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
comfortable fit you need your headset to be comfortable for at least an hour at a time if not for an entire day 1 
the staff are great the ambiance is great 1 
filmiing was less expansive 0 
these are the nicest restaurant owners ive ever come across 1 
the seasonal fruit was fresh white peach puree 1 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
better than youd expect 1 
waste your money on this game 1 
better than youd expect 1 
ample portions and good prices 1 
on the ground right next to our table was a large smeared beensteppedinandtrackedeverywhere pile of green bird poop 0 
none of them are engaging or exciting 0 
excellent product 1 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
the explosion of the gas tanks at the end was just as awful 0 
he also came back to check on us regularly excellent service 1 
i dont think you will be disappointed 1 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
and considering the two of us left there very full and happy for about 20 you just cant go wrong 1 
i even dropped this phone into a stream and it was submerged for 15 seconds and it still works great 1 
an italian reviewer called this a small great film and thats right 1 
and the accents are absolutely abysmal 0 
it showed exactly how the government and the scientist argued for humanity and the reasons of the gadget 1 
one nice thing was that they added gratuity on the bill since our party was larger than 6 or 8 and they didnt expect more tip than that 1 
great product fast shipping 1 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
so absolutley fantastic 1 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
it never condescends all the characters have good genuine hearts and believable problems 1 
talk about useless customer service 0 
the scenes are often funny and occasionally touching as the characters evaluate their lives and where they are going 1 
i tried the cape cod ravoli chickenwith cranberrymmmm 1 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
here in the wind and the lion we see a wonderful rendering of americas own imperial age 1 
we ordered some old classics and some new dishes after going there a few times and were sorely disappointed with everything 0 
whatever prompted such a documentary is beyond me 0 
generally it just lacked imagination 0 
youll love how thin it is 1 
the cable looks so thin and flimsy it is scary 0 
the place was fairly clean but the food simply wasnt worth it 0 
call me a nut but i think this is one of the best movies ever 1 
but the convoluted plot just didnt convince me and much of the film was watched with a weird questioning glance 0 
i could barely stomach the meal but didnt complain because it was a business lunch 0 
went in for happy hour great list of wines 1 
im not sure what he was trying to do with this film 0 
service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is vegas and located inside the crystals shopping mall by aria 1 
friends pasta also bad he barely touched it 0 
there are many continuity errors one other user commented on different cars in the garage joes glassesthe one that got to me the most was the fact joes facial hair configuration seemed to change from scene to scene 0 
these are the central themes of the film and they are handled ineptly stereotypically and with no depth of imagination 0 
disappointing 0 
as for the service im a fan because its quick and youre being served by some nice folks 1 
i wear glasses and it fits fine with them 1 
rude inconsiderate management 0 
excellent 1 
its this pandering to the audience that sabotages most of his films 0 
about 30 minutes of footage is wasted to show mediocre elderly actors awkwardly babbling overwrought pseudosatanic gibberish corny enough to make a teen goth blush almost always in olde english and sometimes in latin that may or may not be made up words 0 
voice recognition is tremendous 1 
great choice 1 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
the han nan chicken was also very tasty 1 
will not be back 0 
by far the best cheesecurds we have ever had 1 
very disappointing 0 
i had strawberry tea which was good 1 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
i wasnt expecting oscar material but this 0 
worst hour and a half of my lifeoh my gosh 0 
great brunch spot 1 
buttons are too small 0 
however my girl was complain that some time the phone doesnt wake up like normal phone does 0 
i can take a little bad service but the food sucks 0 
very tough and very short on flavor 0 
i was shocked because no signs indicate cash only 0 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly will return next time im in vegas 1 
service was fantastic 1 
wow what a bad film 0 
he came running after us when he realized my husband had left his sunglasses on the table 1 
so badwellits just bad 0 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
con spotty service 0 
i really dont see how anyone could enjoy this movie 0 
nice solid keyboard 1 
just spicy enough perfect actually 1 
what is even more stupid is that who had thought an idea that there should be a volcano in los angeles 0 
but despite these few flaws this case is of exceptional quality and well worth the additional costs of owning an official oem product 1 
then the film just dropped the ball 0 
worst customer service ever 0 
a piece of junk that broke after being on my phone for 2 days 0 
absolutely great 1 
i have had this phone for over a year now and i will tell you its not that great 0 
they keep getting better and better this is my third one and ive had numerous palms too 1 
excellent product for the price 1 
another thing i didnt really like is when a character got punched in the face a gallon of blood would spew forth soon after 0 
i love the ownerchef his one authentic japanese cool dude 1 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
there is no plot here to keep you going in the first place 0 
the only thing i wasnt too crazy about was their guacamole as i dont like it puréed 0 
how awesome is that 1 
when i received my pita it was huge it did have a lot of meat in it so thumbs up there 1 
would recommend this item 1 
the waitresses are very friendly 1 
would not go back 0 
i was disgusted because i was pretty sure that was human hair 0 
very dissapointing performance 0 
couldnt figure it out 0 
hence the whole story lacks a certain energy 0 
youll love how thin it is 1 
a truly truly bad film 0 
not my thing 0 
terrible phone holder 0 
i love their fries and their beans 1 
i love this phone 1 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
this is a great restaurant at the mandalay bay 1 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
as for the service im a fan because its quick and youre being served by some nice folks 1 
it deserves strong love 1 
i love the ringtones because they are so upbeat 1 
i cant use this case because the smell is disgusting 0 
this is so embarassing and also my ears hurt if i try to push the ear plug into my ear 0 
i know he was a contract player with little control over his scripts but the acting was as bad as the script 0 
this phone works great 1 
the crêpe was delicate and thin and moist 1 
the fried rice was dry as well 0 
very unreliable service from tmobile 0 
their onscreen chemistry critical to the entire film is genuine 1 
i hate those things as much as cheap quality black olives 0 
there is a lot of beautiful places 1 
i love the scream movies and all horror movies and this one ranks way up there 1 
my sister has one also and she loves it 1 
this movie creates its own universe and is fascinating in every way 1 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
the nokia ca42 usb cable did not work with my phone 0 
so anyone near you will hear part of your conversation 0 
the only thing that i think could improve is the sound leaks out from the headset 0 
much less than the jawbone i was going to replace it with 1 
penne vodka excellent 1 
wont work right or atleast for me 0 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
we had a group of 70 when we claimed we would only have 40 and they handled us beautifully 1 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
we had so much to say about the place before we walked in that he expected it to be amazing but was quickly disappointed 0 
what the hell kind of crap is that 0 
loved itfriendly servers great food wonderful and imaginative menu 1 
it was so cool 1 
best tacos in town by far 1 
this movie has a cutting edge to it 1 
the charger worked for about a week and then completely stopped charging my phone 0 
i checked everywhere and there is no feature for it which is really disappointing 0 
does everything it should and more 1 
classywarm atmosphere fun and fresh appetizers succulent steaks baseball steak 1 
do not make the same mistake as me 0 
juano hernandez an exceptional actor who played supporting roles in many films of the era is a proud black man who is accused of murdering a white man in the south 1 
nothing at all to recommend 0 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
no additional ear gels provided and no instructions whatsoever 0 
cinematography noteworthy including fine views of barcelona and its famed gaudi towers 1 
avoid at all costs 0 
love it great armband 1 
ryans bar is definitely one edinburgh establishment i wont be revisiting 0 
i have read others reviews here but i havent had any problem with it 1 
i am also very happy with the price 1 
these were so good we ordered them twice 1 
initially the local sites in the film which was filmed here in buffalo intrigued me 1 
regardless the film fails on most levels 0 
great product fast shipping 1 
this is a great little item 1 
phone falls out easily 0 
fits comfortably came with three sizes of earbud tips 1 
this is a disgrace 0 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
incredible 1 
now this dish was quite flavourful 1 
lasted one day and then blew up 0 
all in all im quite satisfied with this purchase 1 
the interplay between martin and emilio contains the same wonderful chemistry we saw in wall street with martin and charlie 1 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
it is a very well acted and done tv movie 1 
there was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth but it didnt really work into the rest of the plot 0 
server did a great job handling our large rowdy table 1 
we have tried 2 units and they both failed within 2 months pros 0 
disappointed 0 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
the igo chargers and tips are really great 1 
none of it works just dont buy it 0 
there is really nothing for me at postinos hope your experience is better 0 
to my disbelief each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods i have ever tasted 0 
unreliable im giving up 0 
the acting as youd expect from this cast is top notch 1 
delicious and i will absolutely be back 1 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
im using it with an iriver spinn with case and it fits fine 1 
the movie in movie situations in the beginning and through the game that is played with her by the acting coach are fascinating 1 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
design flaw 0 
the earpiece on this is too large or too heavyit keeps falling out of my ear 0 
great food 1 
sound quality on both end is excellent i use headset to call my wife and ask my wife to use headset to call me 2 1 
i wish i could enter negative values admins 0 
not a pleasant voyage of selfdiscovery 0 
the point is the journey a journey that touches every member of the family 1 
judith light is one of my favorite actresses and i think she does a superb job in this film 1 
by far the best cheesecurds we have ever had 1 
good quality 1 
this would not even be good as a made for tv flick 0 
avoid this establishment 0 
the least said about the acting the better 0 
i wouldnt see this movie again for free 0 
the film has an ultracheap look to it 0 
all it took was one drop from about 6 inches above the kitchen counter and it was crackedi am not impressed and i am not laughing 0 
only pros large seating area nice bar area great simple drink menu the best brick oven pizza with homemade dough 1 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
we are so glad we found this place 1 
all in all an excellent restaurant highlighted by great service a unique menu and a beautiful setting 1 
you get what you pay for i guess 0 
the writers were smack on and i think the best actors and actresses were a bonus to the showthese characters were so real 1 
the food wasnt good 0 
only had this a month but its worked flawlessly so far 1 
good value works fine power via usb car or wall outlet 1 
dont waste your money 0 
this place is pretty good nice little vibe in the restaurant 1 
once your food arrives its meh 0 
leopard print is wonderfully wild 1 
avoid at all costs 0 
case was more or less an extra that i originally put on but later discarded because it scratched my ear 0 
no ear loop needed its tiny and the sound is great 1 
a very charming film with wonderful sentiment and heart 1 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
i live in the neighborhood so i am disappointed i wont be back here because it is a convenient location 0 
i mean really how do you get so famous for your fish and chips when its so terrible 0 
the first time i ever came here i had an amazing experience i still tell people how awesome the duck was 1 
unfortunately this is a bad movie that is just plain bad 0 
cinematography the film was shot in an interesting way 1 
waaaaaayyyyyyyyyy over rated is all i am saying 0 
i just dont know how this place managed to served the blandest food i have ever eaten when they are preparing indian cuisine 0 
host staff were for lack of a better word bitches 0 
there is no plot or storyline 0 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
anyways the food was definitely not filling at all and for the price you pay you should expect more 0 
that was done in the second movie 0 
im not sure how long we stood there but it was long enough for me to begin to feel awkwardly out of place 0 
battery is terrible 0 
the least said about the acting the better 0 
fast service 1 
i think this restaurant suffers from not trying hard enough 0 
still i do like this movie for its empowerment of women theres not enough movies out there like this one 1 
the plug did not work very well 0 
we also ordered the spinach and avocado salad the ingredients were sad and the dressing literally had zero taste 0 
i have been in more than a few bars in vegas and do not ever recall being charged for tap water 0 
my fella got the huevos rancheros and they didnt look too appealing 0 
for those that havent seen it dont waste your time 0 
the update procedure is difficult and cumbersome 0 
service is also cute 1 
you have to hold the phone at a particular angle for the other party to hear you clearly 0 
omit watching this 0 
bt50 battery junk 0 
the movie seemed a little slow at first 0 
and the rest of it just sits there being awful with soldiers singing songs about the masculinity they pledge themselves to hairsplitting about purity the admiration of swords etc 0 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
i dressed up to be treated so rudely 0 
the lines the cuts the audio everything is wrong 0 
also the area where my unit broke im not too fond of the magnetic strap 0 
but it wasnt until i watched this film that i realised how great he actually was 1 
then the film just dropped the ball 0 
the cinematography is simply stunning to say the least and the fx are nothing if not stateoftheart 1 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
again no plot at all 0 
you cant go wrong with any of the food here 1 
in a word it is embarrassing 0 
easy to pair with my samsung cell 1 
characters are onedimensional even the good guys and especially the bad guys 0 
nothing short of magnificent photographycinematography in this film 1 
voice recognition is tremendous 1 
i know that sounds funny but to me it seemed like sketchy technology that wouldnt work wellwell this one works great 1 
and generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode 0 
the refried beans that came with my meal were dried out and crusty and the food was bland 0 
what is even more stupid is that who had thought an idea that there should be a volcano in los angeles 0 
the nachos are a must have 1 
the acting is like watching wooden puppets moving around and reading from a book thats how bad it is 0 
echo problemvery unsatisfactory 0 
my husband said she was very rude did not even apologize for the bad food or anything 0 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
the ambiance isnt much better 0 
i could care less the interior is just beautiful 1 
the chicken dishes are ok the beef is like shoe leather 0 
its a piece of crap 0 
i was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar not only because the quality is great but the service is fast and the food impeccable 1 
i give wirefly 1 stari will contact cingularatt and inform them of this practice 0 
the chains which im no fan of beat this place easily 0 
schrader has made a resume full of lousy amateurish films 0 
performed awful muffled tinny incoming sound and severe echo for those on the other end of the call 0 
delicious and i will absolutely be back 1 
its one of the movies i need to see whenever it comes on tvnever mind the fact that i already have it memorized 1 
every time he opened his mouth you expect to hear you see kids pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show 0 
the roast beef sandwich tasted really good 1 
the bt headset was such a disapoinment 0 
im happy about this purchase good quality and low price 1 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
amazon sucks 0 
the live music on fridays totally blows 0 
cant say enough good things about this place 1 
great sound and service 1 
it features an outlandish array of memorable psychotic but lovable nuts 1 
the movie was very interesting from beginning to the end 1 
20th century foxs road house 1948 is not only quite a silly noir but is an implausible unmitigated bore of a movie 0 
it is unusable in a moving car at freeway speed 0 
then scene where they debated whether or not to sack the trumpeter who falsely was accused for the murder is pure horror really stupid 0 
its not hard to make a decent hamburger 0 
worst customer service ever 0 
it was too predictable even for a chick flick 0 
anyway the plot flowed smoothly and the malebonding scenes were a hoot 1 
great product fast shipping 1 
food quality has been horrible 0 
nevertheless yet another wonderful film from the great masters stable 1 
used and dirty 0 
really pleased with this product so far 1 
predictable but not a bad watch 1 
i struggle to find anything bad to say about it 1 
wont ever go here again 0 
he really didnt seem to want to be hosting his voiceovers were monotonous didnt get involved with the guests 0 
would not recommend to others 0 
after 3 months screen just went black all of a sudden 0 
spoilers whatever else can or cant be said about it surface is superbly crafted 1 
i have tried these cables with my computer and my ipod and it works just fine 1 
meredith m was better than all right 1 
the first thing that happened was that the tracking was off 0 
the folks at otto always make us feel so welcome and special 1 
if there is a wind it is completely useless 0 
just does not work 0 
i love the look and feel of samsung flipphones 1 
the characters are fleshed out surprisingly well particularly grimes and blake and all the actors deliver their sharply scripted lines with just the right amount of deadpan tongue in cheek to make the dialogue both hilarious and realistic 1 
the construction of the headsets is poor 0 
all of the main players are mesmerising 1 
the lines the cuts the audio everything is wrong 0 
sucked most of the stuff does not work with my phone 0 
i could not recommend these more 0 
the best place in vegas for breakfast just check out a sat or sun 1 
i saw this film over christmas and what a great film it was 1 
its reception is very very poor 0 
i have had tmobile service for 2 or 3 years now and i am pretty happy with it 1 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
top line dont waste your time and money on this one its as bad as it comes 0 
the keyboard is a nice compromise between a full qwerty and the basic cell phone number keypad 1 
waste of money 0 
i just saw this film and i recommend it 1 
both of the egg rolls were fantastic 1 
i cant see how this movie can be an inspiration to anyone to come out or overcome fear and rejection 0 
i loved it it was really scary 1 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
you share general loewenhielms exquisite joy in his partaking of the cailles en sarcophage even though you are just watching a movie but you do wish for just a small sample to savor 1 
five star plus plus 1 
a great film by a great director 1 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
its pretty surprising that this wonderful film was made in 1949 as hollywood generally had its collective heads in the sand concerning black and white issues at that time 1 
its worth driving up from tucson 1 
linksys should have some way to exchange a bad phone for a refurb unit or something 0 
the film is way too long 0 
it crackles with an unpredictable youthful energy but honestly i found it hard to follow and concentrate on it meanders so badly 0 
couldnt figure it out 0 
seriously its not worth wasting your or your kids time on 0 
there is a totally unnecessary trainroller coaster scene 0 
this place is way too overpriced for mediocre food 0 
works great 1 
my rating just 3 out of 10 0 
great character actors telly savalas and peter boyle 1 
made very sturdy 1 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
all in all i can assure you ill be back 1 
this is a good joint 1 
i love this phone 1 
the movie is not completely perfect but titta di girolamo will stay with you for a long time after the vision of the movie 1 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
im a big fan of this series mostly due to anne rices style sensitivities and treatments 1 
i am sorry i made this purchase 0 
avoid this film at all costs 0 
food was delicious 1 
of course the footage from the 70s was grainy but that only enhanced the film 1 
thus far have only visited twice and the food was absolutely delicious each time 1 
this phone is slim and light and the display is beautiful 1 
it is so small and you dont even realize that it is there after a while of getting used to it 1 
i am also very happy with the price 1 
now this is a movie i really dislike 0 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
what should have been a hilarious yummy christmas eve dinner to remember was the biggest fail of the entire trip for us 0 
so i had to take the battery out of the phone put it all back together and then restart it 0 
i always order from the vegetarian menu during dinner which has a wide array of options to choose from 1 
to my disbelief each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods i have ever tasted 0 
comfort for our whole family 1 
this short film certainly pulls no punches 0 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
att is not clear sound is very distorted and you have to yell when you talk 0 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
this allows the possibility of double booking for the same date and time after the first 0 
its a sad movie but very good 1 
what a waste of time 0 
easily none other cartoon made me laugh in a tender way before getting into dark sitcoms oriented for teenagers 1 
for that its worth checking out 1 
the characters were all funny and had the peculiarity of not having a true lead character 1 
for people who are first timers in film making i think they did an excellent job 1 
this blueant supertooth handsfree phone speaker is awesome 1 
i got to enjoy the seafood salad with a fabulous vinegrette 1 
i consider this theft 0 
del taco is pretty nasty and should be avoided if possible 0 
the food is good 1 
but this movie really got to me 1 
i especially love the long battery life 1 
i am sorry i made this purchase 0 
great price too 1 
then i had to continue pairing it periodically since it somehow kept dropping 0 
the casting is also horrible cause all you see is a really really bad actors period 0 
everything is appalling 0 
very displeased 0 
the sweet potato tots were good but the onion rings were perfection or as close as i have had 1 
but i thought his acting was skilled 1 
phone now holds charge like it did when it was new 1 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
the phone was unusable and was not new 0 
it is not good 0 
sooooo good 1 
were jerks on the phone 0 
unfortunately it will not recharge my iphone 4s despite connecting it from multiple power sources imac external battery wall outlet etc 0 
the nokia ca42 usb cable did not work with my phone 0 
otherwise dont even waste your time on this 0 
the only thing that i think could improve is the sound leaks out from the headset 0 
battery lasts only a few hours 0 
very windresistant 1 
i would recommend saving room for this 1 
i want to first say our server was great and we had perfect service 1 
i could not recommend these more 0 
would not recommend to others 0 
great character actors telly savalas and peter boyle 1 
you get extra minutes so that you can carry out the call and not get cut off 1 
so far it has worked like a charm 1 
the poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying 0 
five star plus plus 1 
what possesed me to get this junk i have no idea 0 
youll love how thin it is 1 
rude inconsiderate management 0 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
overall a great experience 1 
the camera really likes her in this movie 1 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
by the time the film ended i not only disliked it i despised it 0 
arrived quickly and much less expensive than others being sold 1 
a greasy unhealthy meal 0 
i love the scream movies and all horror movies and this one ranks way up there 1 
i dont think there are any redeeming qualities in this remake 0 
please dont waste your money 0 
at any rate this film stinks its not funny and fulci should have stayed with giallo and supernatural zombie movies 0 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
none of the new ones have ever quite worked properly 0 
it deserves strong love 1 
only like 3 or 4 buildings used a couple of locations maybe poor hummh 0 
and the beans and rice were mediocre at best 0 
an hour and a half i wish i could bring back 0 
dont waste your time here 0 
the sweet potato tots were good but the onion rings were perfection or as close as i have had 1 
this movie contained an allstar cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i havent seen before 1 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
i am far from a sushi connoisseur but i can definitely tell the difference between good food and bad food and this was certainly bad food 0 
the staff are also very friendly and efficient 1 
i could not recommend these more 0 
will not be back 0 
dont waste your on this one 0 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
my rating just 3 out of 10 0 
theres barely a boring moment in the film and there are plenty of humorous parts 1 
duris has a wholesome appearance and gives a fine performance 1 
its not hard to make a decent hamburger 0 
very very sad 0 
on the up side their cafe serves really good food 1 
i hate to disagree with my fellow yelpers but my husband and i were so disappointed with this place 0 
in summary this was a largely disappointing dining experience 0 
at a time when it seems that film animation has been dominated by disneypixars cgi masterpieces it is both refreshing and comforting to know that miyazaki is still relying on traditional handdrawn animation to tell his charming and enchanting stories 1 
stay away from the q 0 
i purchased this and within 2 days it was no longer working 0 
this is a really fantastic thai restaurant which is definitely worth a visit 1 
i dont know what the big deal is about this place but i wont be back yaall 0 
highly unprofessional and rude to a loyal patron 0 
both do good jobs and are quite amusing 1 
i sat riveted to the tv screen 1 
disappointed with battery 0 
price is good too 1 
hands down my favorite italian restaurant 1 
i consider this theft 0 
but when someone strives for greatness and poetry but delivers a muddled and often ridiculous story a bunch of disparate scenes pretentious dialogue then you get the worst kind of a movie that some other reviewer very accurately defined as pretentious crap 0 
as for the service im a fan because its quick and youre being served by some nice folks 1 
you wont regret it 1 
the acting is fantastic the stories are seamlessly woven together and the dogs are splendid a must rent view or see 1 
also the phone doesnt seem to accept anything except cbr mp3s preferably ripped by windows media player 0 
to be honest with you this is unbelievable nonsense and very foolish 0 
it didnt work people can not hear me when i talk 0 
after one bite i was hooked 1 
im glad i found this product on amazon it is hard to find it wasnt high priced 1 
after the first charge kept going dead after 12 minutes 0 
very very disappointed ordered the 35 big bay plater 0 
oh and i forgot to also mention the weird color effect it has on your phone 0 
wont ever go here again 0 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
this is probably the most irritating show i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
the structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema 1 
its a fresh subtle and rather sublime effect 1 
the screen size is big key pad lit well enough and the camera quality is excellent for a camera phone 1 
this movie contained an allstar cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i havent seen before 1 
its reception is very very poor 0 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
it probably would have been better if the director hadnt spent most of the movie showcasing his own art work which really isnt that noteworthy 0 
definitely worth seeing its the sort of thought provoking film that forces you to question your own threshold of loneliness 1 
the scenes with the ohsomature neighbourgirl are a misplace 0 
utter crap sound quality is terrible 0 
does not fit 0 
great earpiece 1 
this greedy corporation will never see another dime from me 0 
poor product 0 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
i just saw this film and i recommend it 1 
this phone might well be the worst ive ever had in any brand 0 
the best phone in market 1 
i wouldnt see this movie again for free 0 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
the pancake was also really good and pretty large at that 1 
i am so pleased to know such a modern day genius is out there letting is passion for art drive him and taking us as an audience with him 1 
probably not in a hurry to go back 0 
the movie showed a lot of florida at its best made it look very appealing 1 
the food came out at a good pace 1 
it fits so securely that the ear hook does not even need to be used and the sound is better directed through your ear canal 1 
uncomfortable in the ear dont use with lg vx9900 env 0 
this place was such a nice surprise 1 
probably not in a hurry to go back 0 
great pork sandwich 1 
very good though 1 
tied to charger for conversations lasting more than 45 minutesmajor problems 0 
sam shepards portrayal of a gung ho marine was sobering 1 
the chips and sals a here is amazing 1 
i love all the features and form factor 1 
the explosion of the gas tanks at the end was just as awful 0 
i give wirefly 1 stari will contact cingularatt and inform them of this practice 0 
this phone is slim and light and the display is beautiful 1 
omelets are to die for 1 
of all the dishes the salmon was the best but all were great 1 
these are the nicest restaurant owners ive ever come across 1 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
this movie does an excellent job of revealing the complexity of the task and the incredible challenges facing south africa 1 
the price was very good and with the free shipping and all it was a good purchase 1 
there was so much hype over this phone that i assumed it was the best my mistake 0 
the sweet potato tots were good but the onion rings were perfection or as close as i have had 1 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
also if your phone is dropped this case is not going to save it specially when dropped face down 0 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
warning stay away 0 
doesnt work 0 
it doesnt work in europe or asia 0 
echo problemvery unsatisfactory 0 
almost all of the songs in cover girl are oldfashioned and not very tuneful 0 
loved the casting of jimmy buffet as the science teacher 1 
works great 1 
over rated 0 
there is no real plot 0 
what a piece of junk i lose more calls on this phone 0 
its practically perfect in all of them  a true masterpiece in a sea of faux masterpieces 1 
better than expected 1 
the cashier was friendly and even brought the food out to me 1 
first the bathrooms at this location were dirty seat covers were not replenished just plain yucky 0 
very serious spoilers this movie was a huge disappointment 0 
needless to say i wont be going back anytime soon 0 
always a great time at dos gringos 1 
talk about useless customer service 0 
an absolute must visit 1 
highly recommended for all ages although the younger set will probably not appreciate some of the more subtle references they will certainly appreciate one galley scene in particular 1 
we got sitting fairly fast but ended up waiting 40 minutes just to place our order another 30 minutes before the food arrived 0 
this is an extraordinary film 1 
i gave it 5 stars then and im giving it 5 stars now 1 
great product for the price 1 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
what did bother me was the slow service 0 
i think this restaurant suffers from not trying hard enough 0 
there is a brilliant twist ending 1 
similarly the delivery man did not say a word of apology when our food was 45 minutes late 0 
there is no real plot 0 
this was utterly confusing at first which caused me to lose a couple of very very important contacts 0 
great food 1 
ps the only scene in the movie that was cool is when the central character finds her room blown up 1 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
my boyfriend tried the mediterranean chicken salad and fell in love 1 
the only thing i wasnt too crazy about was their guacamole as i dont like it puréed 0 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
other than that the leather is nice and soft the fit is very tight the cut out for the face is a good shape 1 
the new characters werent all that memorable and i found myself forgetting who was who 0 
at a time when it seems that film animation has been dominated by disneypixars cgi masterpieces it is both refreshing and comforting to know that miyazaki is still relying on traditional handdrawn animation to tell his charming and enchanting stories 1 
it is simple to use and i like it 1 
lordy the khao soi is a dish that is not to be missed for curry lovers 1 
it is very comfortable to wear as well which is probably the most important aspect about using a case 1 
when i placed my treo into the case not only was it not snug but there was a lot of extra room on the sides 0 
once you get inside youll be impressed with the place 1 
i still maintain that monkeys shouldnt make headphones we just obviously dont share enough dna to copy the design over to humans 0 
really pleased with this product so far 1 
waitress was good though 1 
i dont have very many words to say about this place but it does everything pretty well 1 
great price too 1 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
i recommend igo to anyone with different brand cell phonesmp3 players in the family 1 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
needless to say we will never be back here again 0 
save your money ive had this item for 11 months now 0 
this is definitely one of the better documentaries i have seen looking at family relationships and marriage 1 
light weight i hardly notice it is there 1 
the screen does get smudged easily because it touches your ear and face 0 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
none of them are engaging or exciting 0 
i enjoyed reading this book to my children when they were little 1 
avoid this film at all costs 0 
we would recommend these to others 1 
i went to bachi burger on a friends recommendation and was not disappointed 1 
i had the chicken pho and it tasted very bland 0 
the music in the film is really nice too 1 
excellent hands free tool 1 
but then they came back cold 0 
other than that the leather is nice and soft the fit is very tight the cut out for the face is a good shape 1 
the reception is excellent 1 
love this phone 1 
this is simply the best bluetooth headset for sound quality 1 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
bela lugosi was totally extraneous intoning odd lines 0 
also the fries are without a doubt the worst fries ive ever had 0 
couldnt use the unit with sunglasses not good in texas 0 
i started this review with two stars but im editing it to give it only one 0 
however my girl was complain that some time the phone doesnt wake up like normal phone does 0 
extremely tasty 1 
the story starts too fast with absolutely no suspense or buildup in the slightest 0 
i exchanged the sony ericson z500a for this and im pretty happy with that decision 1 
i love this place 1 
nevertheless yet another wonderful film from the great masters stable 1 
i have recommended it to friends 1 
we had 7 at our table and the service was pretty fast 1 
due to this happening on every call i was forced to stop using this headset 0 
after arguing with verizon regarding the dropped calls we returned the phones after two days 0 
im not really sure how joeys was voted best hot dog in the valley by readers of phoenix magazine 0 
awesome device 1 
putting the race card aside lets look at the major flaw in the film they destroy latifas character 0 
however my girl was complain that some time the phone doesnt wake up like normal phone does 0 
this movie is bad 0 
have been going since 2007 and every meal has been awesome 1 
really good product 1 
its fits like a glove and is strong secure and durable 1 
dont buy this product 0 
i hate to disagree with my fellow yelpers but my husband and i were so disappointed with this place 0 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
they dropped more than the ball 0 
im glad the film didnt go for the most obvious choice as a lesser film certainly would have 1 
when i saw it in the theater i thought i was going to be sick 0 
the waitress was friendly and happy to accomodate for veganveggie options 1 
i have to mention this and it is a huge spoiler i loved the ending how all the characters of the three films were the remaining survivors of the ferry disaster with valentine and the young judge together and the old man watching it on her tv solidifying his happiness over the suffering which he dealt with for those many years 1 
cant get the software to work with my computer 0 
if you look for authentic thai food go else where 0 
the acting by the whole cast could be put on a scale and balanced perfectly between overacting and underacting 0 
the dialogue is composed of things that make little sense 0 
crostini that came with the salad was stale 0 
the food is not tasty at all not to say its real traditional hunan style 0 
there are many continuity errors one other user commented on different cars in the garage joes glassesthe one that got to me the most was the fact joes facial hair configuration seemed to change from scene to scene 0 
after trying many many handsfree gadgets this is the one that finally works well 1 
the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach 0 
the ambiance isnt much better 0 
it felt like a very gripping intelligent stage play but without the overly theatrical feeling one actually gets from watching people on a stage which plays on everyones terror of a white lie escalating to monstrous consequences 1 
this place is handsdown one of the best places to eat in the phoenix metro area 1 
my order was not correct 0 
reasonably priced also 1 
the writer gorman bechard undoubtedly did his homework because all references are industry and characterage appropriate 1 
but in terms of the writing its very fresh and bold 1 
nothing special 0 
nice headset priced right 1 
will not be back 0 
i use this product in a motor control center where there is a lot of high voltage humming from the equipment and it works great 1 
all in all im quite satisfied with this purchase 1 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
the bt headset was such a disapoinment 0 
i especially love the long battery life 1 
you get incredibly fresh fish prepared with care 1 
to sum the film up breeders is a terrible cheaply made horror movie that should be avoided like the ebola virus 0 
disappointed 0 
an interesting premise and billy drago is always good as a dangerous nutbag side note id love to see drago stephen mchattie and lance hendrikson in a flick together talk about raging cheekbones 1 
as for the service i thought it was good 1 
the food is not tasty at all not to say its real traditional hunan style 0 
dont do it 0 
i didnt know pulled pork could be soooo delicious 1 
the potato chip order was sad i could probably count how many chips were in that box and it was probably around 12 0 
it does everything the description said it would 1 
i have always used corded headsets and the freedom from the wireless is very helpful 1 
thanks again to amazon for having the things i need for a good price 1 
started watching this but didnt believe in any of the characters 0 
a very very very slowmoving aimless movie about a distressed drifting young man 0 
if only someone involved with it knew how to string together narrative 0 
i really loved the story line and the poler bear was kinda cutebut if anyone has a question about fort steele just ask away 1 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
he really didnt seem to want to be hosting his voiceovers were monotonous didnt get involved with the guests 0 
the chefs were friendly and did a good job 1 
beautiful styling though 1 
i have had mine for about a year and this christmas i bought some for the rest of the family 1 
the voice recognition thru the handset is excellent 1 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
however the keypads are so tinny that i sometimes reach the wrong buttons 0 
good beer drink selection and good food selection 1 
my experience was terrible this was my fourth bluetooth headset and while it was much more comfortable than my last jabra which i hated 0 
the reception has been generally good 1 
this movie was kind of long in length but i enjoyed every minute of it 1 
try them in the airport to experience some tasty food and speedy friendly service 1 
the waitresses are very friendly 1 
the food is good 1 
my only complaint is the standard sound volume is a little low even when turned up to 5of 5 0 
great headset very impressed h500 1 
phone falls out easily 0 
service is also cute 1 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
the writer gorman bechard undoubtedly did his homework because all references are industry and characterage appropriate 1 
even if you love bad movies do not watch this movie 0 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
owners are really great people 1 
none of the three sizes they sent with the headset would stay in my ears 0 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
i could eat their bruschetta all day it is devine 1 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
think it over when you plan to own this onethis sure is the last moto phone for me 0 
i think i was one of the people who found this another one of roths pearls 1 
great pork sandwich 1 
this is such a fun and funny movie 1 
mishima is extremely uninteresting 0 
my experience was terrible this was my fourth bluetooth headset and while it was much more comfortable than my last jabra which i hated 0 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
the characters are interesting and you want to find out more about them the longer the movie goes on and i think people will be surprised by who does and doesnt make it 1 
and generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode 0 
the warm beer didnt help 0 
furthermore you cant even find hours of operation on the website 0 
if you plan to use this in a car forget about it 0 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
lifetime does not air it enough so if anyone knows what store sells it let me know because this is a musthave 1 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
ill be looking for a new earpiece 0 
the movie is full of wonderful dancing hence the title 1 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
highly recommended for all ages although the younger set will probably not appreciate some of the more subtle references they will certainly appreciate one galley scene in particular 1 
worst thai ever 0 
see both films if you can 1 
i was not happy with this item 0 
if youre not familiar check it out 1 
omg the food was delicioso 1 
avoid at all cost 0 
the refried beans that came with my meal were dried out and crusty and the food was bland 0 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
it felt like a very gripping intelligent stage play but without the overly theatrical feeling one actually gets from watching people on a stage which plays on everyones terror of a white lie escalating to monstrous consequences 1 
service was fantastic 1 
it isnt even an achievement as a sobaditsgood or sobaditsmemorable movie 0 
they work about 2 weeks then break 0 
in conclusion i will not bother with this movie because a volcano in los angeles is nothing but nonsense 0 
great price too 1 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
all things considered a job very well done 1 
plus its only 8 bucks 1 
definitely will come back here again 1 
oh this is such a thing of beauty this restaurant 1 
if you stay in vegas you must get breakfast here at least once 1 
today the graphics are crap 0 
by this time our side of the restaurant was almost empty so there was no excuse 0 
our server was very nice and even though he looked a little overwhelmed with all of our needs he stayed professional and friendly until the end 1 
at least think to refill my water before i struggle to wave you over for 10 minutes 0 
lifetime does not air it enough so if anyone knows what store sells it let me know because this is a musthave 1 
my first visit to hiro was a delight 1 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
disappointing 0 
i bought this phone as a replacement for my startac and have regretted it since 0 
oh this is such a thing of beauty this restaurant 1 
im glad i found this product on amazon it is hard to find it wasnt high priced 1 
the ear buds only play music in one ear 0 
the stories were as unbelievable as the actors 0 
i couldnt think of a better way to end the film but a smile on my face great way to wrap up an amazing film and trilogy 1 
loved itfriendly servers great food wonderful and imaginative menu 1 
spoilers whatever else can or cant be said about it surface is superbly crafted 1 
we loved the place 1 
does not fit 0 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job 1 
although i very much liked the look and sound of this place the actual experience was a bit disappointing 0 
my boyfriend tried the mediterranean chicken salad and fell in love 1 
if you love death and decay and shakespears lyrics this is the one 1 
it dit not work most of the time with my nokia 5320 0 
it came free with a dvd player i bought but i still turned the thing off halfway through because i was embarrassed for howell 0 
everything was fresh and delicious 1 
the bt headset was such a disapoinment 0 
he owns the film just as spacek owned coal miners daughter and quaid owned great balls of fire 1 
waitress was good though 1 
the cast is always entertaining as usual 1 
best breakfast buffet 1 
i want my money back 0 
talk about great customer service of course we will be back 1 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
not to mention the combination of pears almonds and bacon is a big winner 1 
you get incredibly fresh fish prepared with care 1 
now this is a movie i really dislike 0 
we wont be going back anytime soon 0 
you never know if you pushed it hard enough or the right number of times for the function you want or not 0 
i loved it it was really scary 1 
i know this is not like the other restaurants at all something is very off here 0 
in the summer you can dine in a charming outdoor patio so very delightful 1 
best ive found so far ive tried 2 other bluetooths and this one has the best quality for both me and the listener as well as ease of using 1 
its quite simply the highest most superlative form of cinema imaginable 1 
but then they came back cold 0 
fits comfortably came with three sizes of earbud tips 1 
a film not easily forgotten 1 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
the earpiece on this is too large or too heavyit keeps falling out of my ear 0 
great product fast shipping 1 
i got home to see the driest damn wings ever 0 
the mic there is a joke and the volume is quite low 0 
dont buy this product it fails 0 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
im not impressed with the concept or the food 0 
the shrimp tender and moist 1 
the shrimp tender and moist 1 
my only problem is i thought the actor playing the villain was a low rent michael ironside 0 
i highly recommend this movie for anyone interested in art poetry theater politics or japanese history 1 
there is a totally unnecessary trainroller coaster scene 0 
they keep getting better and better this is my third one and ive had numerous palms too 1 
even if you love bad movies do not watch this movie 0 
this is definitely a cult classic well worth viewing and sharing with others 1 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
i found a six inch long piece of wire in my salsa 0 
but it wasnt until i watched this film that i realised how great he actually was 1 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
shes poised and amazing 1 
i really recommend this faceplates since it looks very nice elegant and cool 1 
i dont recommend unless your car breaks down in front of it and you are starving 0 
i am also very happy with the price 1 
total brunch fail 0 
phenomenal food service and ambiance 1 
they have been around for years and carries the highest quality of antiglare screen protector that i have found to date 1 
what happened next was prettyoff putting 0 
the ambience is wonderful and there is music playing 1 
battery life is real good 1 
strike 2 who wants to be rushed 0 
finally after three or four times the spring of the latch broke and i could not use it any longer on the visor 0 
damian is so talented and versatile in so many ways of writing and portraying different characters on screen 1 
disappointing accessory from a good manufacturer 0 
it was probably dirt 0 
i saw this movie and i thought this is a stupid movie 0 
you wont forget this movie 1 
love this headset 1 
razr battery good buy 1 
the characters are interesting and you want to find out more about them the longer the movie goes on and i think people will be surprised by who does and doesnt make it 1 
couldnt use the unit with sunglasses not good in texas 0 
the chicken dishes are ok the beef is like shoe leather 0 
i was left shattered from the experience of watching this film and i took a good two hours to fully recover 0 
love this phone 1 
if there was ever a movie that needed wordofmouth to promote this is it 1 
this place has it 1 
we got sitting fairly fast but ended up waiting 40 minutes just to place our order another 30 minutes before the food arrived 0 
this movie creates its own universe and is fascinating in every way 1 
i wear glasses and it fits fine with them 1 
a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it 1 
the atmosphere is modern and hip while maintaining a touch of coziness 1 
very clear quality sound and you dont have to mess with the sound on your ipod since you have the sound buttons on the headset 1 
a great film by a great director 1 
mobile phone tools are a must have 1 
waited and waited and waited 0 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
it didnt work people can not hear me when i talk 0 
at any rate this film stinks its not funny and fulci should have stayed with giallo and supernatural zombie movies 0 
the story itself is just predictable and lazy 0
