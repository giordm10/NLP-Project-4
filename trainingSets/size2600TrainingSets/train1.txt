it was so cool 1 
the only thing i wasnt too crazy about was their guacamole as i dont like it puréed 0 
beware this is not a trashy cult movie this is trash period 0 
i find wasting food to be despicable but this just wasnt food 0 
the only place good for this film is in the garbage 0 
good value works fine power via usb car or wall outlet 1 
still i do like this movie for its empowerment of women theres not enough movies out there like this one 1 
bt50 battery junk 0 
the acting sucks the music sucks the script sucks the pacing sucks the special fx suck the directing sucks basically this movie sucks 0 
i only hear garbage for audio 0 
it is a really good show to watch 1 
i must say i have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again 1 
i ordered the voodoo pasta and it was the first time id had really excellent pasta since going gluten free several years ago 1 
buyerbe very careful 0 
i even dropped this phone into a stream and it was submerged for 15 seconds and it still works great 1 
the plantains were the worst ive ever tasted 0 
tied to charger for conversations lasting more than 45 minutesmajor problems 0 
we were promptly greeted and seated 1 
the speaker is of low quality so as making the ring tones sound very cheap 0 
bluetooth range is good a few days ago i left my phone in the trunk got a call and carried the conversation without a hitch 1 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
it came free with a dvd player i bought but i still turned the thing off halfway through because i was embarrassed for howell 0 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
as many people complained i found this headsets microphone was very weak 0 
last time buying from you 0 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
service is quick and even to go orders are just like we like it 1 
if there were zero stars i would give it zero stars 0 
conclusion i loved it 1 
however bt headsets are currently not good for real time games like firstperson shooters since the audio delay messes me up 0 
ive bought 5 wired headphones that sound better than these 0 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
well just if you keep thinking how bad it is 0 
its also great to see that renowned silent screenwriter frances marion hasnt missed a step going from silent to sound 1 
being a 90s child i truly enjoyed this show and i can proudly say that i enjoyed it big time and even more than the classical wb cartoons 1 
you cant go wrong with any of the food here 1 
as a sushi lover avoid this place by all means 0 
i have 23 bars on my cell phone when i am home but you cant not hear anything 0 
its just painful 0 
i use this product in a motor control center where there is a lot of high voltage humming from the equipment and it works great 1 
i would have casted her in that role after ready the script 1 
this phone is slim and light and the display is beautiful 1 
i think i was one of the people who found this another one of roths pearls 1 
the seller is very understanding and patient i would definitely buy from them again 1 
headset works great was packaged nicely to avoid any damage 1 
what possesed me to get this junk i have no idea 0 
anyway the plot flowed smoothly and the malebonding scenes were a hoot 1 
the memories are murky but i can only say that i enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show 1 
i am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this 1 
i even dropped this phone into a stream and it was submerged for 15 seconds and it still works great 1 
my mother and brother had to do thiswhen i saw robert ryan portraying this type of man it was a very good imitation of this type of individual and i was impressed 1 
it clicks into place in a way that makes you wonder how long that mechanism would last 0 
frankly after cotton club and unfaithful it was kind of embarrassing to watch lane and gere in this film because it is bad 0 
i felt asleep the first time i watched it so i can recommend it for insomniacs 0 
otherwise easy to install and use clear sound 1 
very disappointed and wondered how it could be in the oscar shortlist 0 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
great case and price 1 
and his subtle connections between the three films are awesome 1 
worst service to boot but that is the least of their worries 0 
the best place to go for a tasty bowl of pho 1 
product was excellent and works better than the verizon one and boy was it cheaper 1 
love this headset 1 
clear skype calls long battery life long range 1 
the only good thing was our waiter he was very helpful and kept the bloddy marys coming 1 
which are small and not worth the price 0 
but kevin spacey is an excellent verbal tsunami as buddy ackerman  and totally believable because he is a great actor 1 
i was particularly pleased with the acting ability of dwight schultz 1 
oh and i forgot to also mention the weird color effect it has on your phone 0 
shrimp when i unwrapped it i live only 12 a mile from brushfire it was literally ice cold 0 
i do think tom hanks is a good actor 1 
frozen pucks of disgust with some of the worst people behind the register 0 
it kept getting worse and worse so now im officially done 0 
my rating just 3 out of 10 0 
first of all it doesnt wear well 0 
thank you for such great service 1 
there is really nothing for me at postinos hope your experience is better 0 
this is a disgrace 0 
and it was way to expensive 0 
considering the relations off screen between taylor and stanwyck it was surprising how little chemistry there was on screen between the two of them 0 
it was a drive to get there 0 
do not buy if you want to use the holster 0 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
third the cheese on my friends burger was cold 0 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
for that price i can think of a few place i would have much rather gone 0 
the descriptions said yum yum sauce and another said eel sauce yet another said spicy mayowell none of the rolls had sauces on them 0 
horrible had to switch 3 times 0 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
love it great armband 1 
conclusion very filling meals 1 
i was mortified 0 
excellent product for the price 1 
this is a great little item 1 
this totally unfunny movie is so over the top and pathetic and unrealistic that throughout the whole 90 minutes of utter torture i probably looked at my watch about 70000 times 0 
headset works great was packaged nicely to avoid any damage 1 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
black water is a thriller that manages to completely transcend its limitations its an indie flick by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience 1 
they have been around for years and carries the highest quality of antiglare screen protector that i have found to date 1 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
you cant relate with them hell you barely can understand them 0 
the acting sucks the music sucks the script sucks the pacing sucks the special fx suck the directing sucks basically this movie sucks 0 
dont waste your money 0 
but this movie is not funny considering the ridiculousness of it 0 
it has kept up very well 1 
feelings thoughtsgabriels discomfort during the danceall these intangibles leap to life and come within the viewers grasp in hustons portrayal 1 
wow very spicy but delicious 1 
and i just love the colors 1 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
still i do like this movie for its empowerment of women theres not enough movies out there like this one 1 
i also didnt like the on button it felt like it would crack with use 0 
yes its that bad 0 
the casting is also horrible cause all you see is a really really bad actors period 0 
i heart this place 1 
the structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema 1 
now imagine that every single one of those decisions was made wrong 0 
i sat riveted to the tv screen 1 
this movie now joins revenge of the boogeyman and zombiez as part of the hellish trinity of horror films 0 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
what did bother me was the slow service 0 
the lighting is awful 0 
as many people complained i found this headsets microphone was very weak 0 
i wasnt expecting oscar material but this 0 
its just adorable seeing mickey playing turkey in the straw in a highly imaginative if occasionally cruel way 1 
i wont be back 0 
its kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly its embarrassing how childlike the company is 0 
the earpiece on this is too large or too heavyit keeps falling out of my ear 0 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
i paid the bill but did not tip because i felt the server did a terrible job 0 
another note about this phones appearance is that it really looks rather bland especially in the all black model 0 
we would recommend these to others 1 
i have to jiggle the plug to get it to line up right to get decent volume 0 
overall a great experience 1 
about 30 minutes of footage is wasted to show mediocre elderly actors awkwardly babbling overwrought pseudosatanic gibberish corny enough to make a teen goth blush almost always in olde english and sometimes in latin that may or may not be made up words 0 
as i said abovepretty useless 0 
a very very very slowmoving aimless movie about a distressed drifting young man 0 
i do love sushi but i found kabuki to be overpriced overhip and underservices 0 
itll be a regular stop on my trips to phoenix 1 
he deserves 5 stars 1 
these are fabulous 1 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
a good film by a great director 1 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
really pleased with this product so far 1 
so in a nutshell 1 the restaraunt smells like a combination of a dirty fish market and a sewer 0 
lucy bell is so much higher than this crap and for her to sink this low is quite depressing 0 
everyone is treated equally special 1 
the battery is completely useless to me 0 
it is an hour and half waste of time following a bunch of very pretty high schoolers whine and cry about life 0 
any grandmother can make a roasted chicken better than this one 0 
there was no chemistry between ben affleck and sandra bullock in this film and i couldnt understand why he would consider even leaving his wifetobe for this chick that he supposedly was knocked out by 0 
good works fine 1 
waitress was good though 1 
constantine gives everything the right intensity and seems to have a good understanding of the underlying psychological motivations 1 
this was my first time and i cant wait until the next 1 
it does everything the description said it would 1 
also notable is john baileys fine crisp beautifully colored cinematography and the great production design costumes by eiko ishioka who went on to do the memorable costumes for coppolas dracula for which she received a well deserved oscar 1 
but now i was completely grossed out 0 
i am very impressed with this headset from plantronics 1 
this was my first time and i cant wait until the next 1 
last time buying from you 0 
i love the scream movies and all horror movies and this one ranks way up there 1 
this movie now joins revenge of the boogeyman and zombiez as part of the hellish trinity of horror films 0 
i was very disappointed 0 
couldnt ask for a more satisfying meal 1 
the last 15 minutes of movie are also not bad as well 1 
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1 
the story unfolds in 18th century jutland and the use of period music played on period instruments is just one more fine touch 1 
however the keypads are so tinny that i sometimes reach the wrong buttons 0 
predictable but not a bad watch 1 
also were served hot bread and butter and home made potato chips with bacon bits on topvery original and very good 1 
needless to say we will never be back here again 0 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
we sat another ten minutes and finally gave up and left 0 
aside from its terrible lead this film has loads of other debits 0 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
mic doesnt work 0 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
the results well are a shame 0 
i gave it 5 stars then and im giving it 5 stars now 1 
it defeats the purpose of a bluetooth headset 0 
kids pizza is always a hit too with lots of great side dish options for the kiddos 1 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
shes poised and amazing 1 
plus its only 8 bucks 1 
waitress was good though 1 
does everything it should and more 1 
instead we got a bore fest about a whiny spoiled brat babysitting 0 
what did bother me was the slow service 0 
if only someone involved with it knew how to string together narrative 0 
at first i thought i was grtting a good deal at 744 until i plugged it into my phone v3c razr 0 
the sound is clear and the people i talk to on it are amazed at the quality too 1 
i gave it 5 stars because of the sound quality 1 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
i loved their mussels cooked in this wine reduction the duck was tender and their potato dishes were delicious 1 
battery is holding up well 1 
you can even take self portraits with the outside exterior display very cool 1 
worst customer service 0 
makes it easier to keep up with my bluetooth when im not wearing it 0 
the best place in vegas for breakfast just check out a sat or sun 1 
however paul schrader has indeed made a film about mishima that is both superb complex 1 
i asked multiple times for the wine list and after some time of being ignored i went to the hostess and got one myself 0 
its a fresh subtle and rather sublime effect 1 
thank you for such great service 1 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
i could not recommend these more 0 
it was so funny 1 
10 out of 10 stars 1 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
but the duet between the astronaut and his doctor at the beginning of the movie is a perfect exchange if one considers that this movie was made well into the cold war and the astronauts biggest fear is that he has crashed in the ussr 1 
left very frustrated 0 
jawbone era is awesome too 1 
i started this review with two stars but im editing it to give it only one 0 
spend your money and time some place else 0 
i found a six inch long piece of wire in my salsa 0 
very clear quality sound and you dont have to mess with the sound on your ipod since you have the sound buttons on the headset 1 
blue ant is easy to use 1 
i had ordered a motorola data cable got a very well finished and working product 1 
the phone gets extremely hot 0 
i ordered the lemon raspberry ice cocktail which was also incredible 1 
bad script bad direction and horrible acting make this one plain bad 0 
i dont have very many words to say about this place but it does everything pretty well 1 
this is probably the most irritating show i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
there is no real plot 0 
someone shouldve invented this sooner 1 
great phone 1 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
the only thing that i think could improve is the sound leaks out from the headset 0 
the design is very good4 1 
weve tried to like this place but after 10 times i think were done with them 0 
doesnt last long 0 
meredith m was better than all right 1 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
while i managed to bend the leaf spring back in place the metal now has enough stress that it will break on the next drop 0 
disappointing accessory from a good manufacturer 0 
it rocked my world and is certainly a must see for anyone with no social or physical outlets 1 
it was either too cold not enough flavor or just bad 0 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
this second appearance of mickey mouse following the silent plane crazy earlier that year is probably his most famous filmmostly because it was so groundbreaking 1 
which is precisely why i am giving it such a bad review 0 
its a fresh subtle and rather sublime effect 1 
but now i was completely grossed out 0 
clear skype calls long battery life long range 1 
the story which was told so eloquently by francis ford coppola 25 years earlier really unfolds gradually and leaves room for the characters to develop 1 
food was good service was good prices were good 1 
the worst sappiest dialogue i could go on and on 0 
this place has it 1 
do not purchase this phone 0 
i wasnt expecting oscar material but this 0 
dont buy it 0 
ordered burger rare came in well done 0 
it presents a idyllic yet serious portrayal of the ups and downs of the characters lives 1 
being a 90s child i truly enjoyed this show and i can proudly say that i enjoyed it big time and even more than the classical wb cartoons 1 
best breakfast buffet 1 
bad day or not i have a very low tolerance for rude customer service people it is your job to be nice and polite wash dishes otherwise 0 
the waitress was friendly and happy to accomodate for veganveggie options 1 
conclusion i loved it 1 
it is very comfortable to wear as well which is probably the most important aspect about using a case 1 
secondly hitchcock pretty much perfected the thriller and chase movie 1 
dont buy it 0 
the seasonal fruit was fresh white peach puree 1 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
then our food came out disappointment ensued 0 
its like a bad two hour tv movie 0 
same problem as others have mentioned 0 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
on the ground right next to our table was a large smeared beensteppedinandtrackedeverywhere pile of green bird poop 0 
doesnt hold charge 0 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
works as described 1 
i want my money back 0 
that said our mouths and bellies were still quite pleased 1 
simple lightweight and great fit 1 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
i struggle to find anything bad to say about it 1 
great time family dinner on a sunday night 1 
all in all an excellent restaurant highlighted by great service a unique menu and a beautiful setting 1 
setup went very smoothly 1 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
i checked out this place a couple years ago and was not impressed 0 
its also great to see that renowned silent screenwriter frances marion hasnt missed a step going from silent to sound 1 
i was amazed at the quick arrival of the two original lg cell phone batteries and and at a fraction of the price 1 
this place is handsdown one of the best places to eat in the phoenix metro area 1 
i love lane but ive never seen her in a movie this lousy 0 
there is a brilliant twist ending 1 
con spotty service 0 
the block was amazing 1 
i wear it everyday and it holds up very well 1 
after i pulled up my car i waited for another 15 minutes before being acknowledged 0 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
worthless product 0 
but now i was completely grossed out 0 
woa talk about awful 0 
the sides are delish mixed mushrooms yukon gold puree white corn beateous 1 
the turkey and roast beef were bland 0 
anyways the food was definitely not filling at all and for the price you pay you should expect more 0 
i will never forget it now 1 
left very frustrated 0 
i like armand assante my cable companys summary sounded interesting so i watched it twice already and probably will again 1 
this is definitely a cult classic well worth viewing and sharing with others 1 
greatno problems at all 1 
ive had this bluetoooth headset for some time now and still not comfortable with the way it fits on the ear 0 
i can say that the desserts were yummy 1 
if you see it you should probably just leave it on the shelf 0 
the success of the film depends on the casting of sydney greenstreet as the alexander yardley character 1 
jamie foxx absolutely is ray charles 1 
great product and price 1 
unreliable im giving up 0 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
the movie seemed a little slow at first 0 
sound quality on both end is excellent i use headset to call my wife and ask my wife to use headset to call me 2 1 
drinks took close to 30 minutes to come out at one point 0 
do not waste your time 0 
none of the new ones have ever quite worked properly 0 
it has everything i need and i couldnt ask for more 1 
its so bad its actually worth seeing just for that reason 0 
if you simply want a small flip phone look elsewhere as the extra bells whistles are mediocre 0 
i am glad i purchased it 1 
i must say i have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again 1 
wow what a bad film 0 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
now we were chosen to be tortured with this disgusting piece of blatant american propaganda 0 
the best example of how dumb the writing is when its established that you can turn the zombiestudents back into humans by removing a necklace containing a piece of the meteorite 0 
this is my new fav vegas buffet spot 1 
i heart this place 1 
but whatever it was that cost them so much it didnt translate to quality thats for sure 0 
the ngage is still lacking in earbuds 0 
i will be back many times soon 1 
we walked away stuffed and happy about our first vegas buffet experience 1 
this was such an awesome movie that i bought it off of ebay 1 
this is a great phone 1 
call me a nut but i think this is one of the best movies ever 1 
the only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port irda 0 
i highly recommend this case 1 
if youre not familiar check it out 1 
i am a fan of his this movie sucked really bad 0 
any grandmother can make a roasted chicken better than this one 0 
camera color balance is awful 0 
basically the service was very bad 0 
this film offers many delights and surprises 1 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
better than expected 1 
the characters are interesting and you want to find out more about them the longer the movie goes on and i think people will be surprised by who does and doesnt make it 1 
the burger is good beef cooked just right 1 
but now i was completely grossed out 0 
service is perfect and the family atmosphere is nice to see 1 
today the graphics are crap 0 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
on the negative its insipid enough to cause regret for another 2 hours of life wasted in front of the screen 0 
what possesed me to get this junk i have no idea 0 
both do good jobs and are quite amusing 1 
disappointing experience 0 
this is a disgrace 0 
nonlinear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well 1 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
i found a six inch long piece of wire in my salsa 0 
the movie was very interesting from beginning to the end 1 
they could be used as exemplars for any set designer 1 
omg the food was delicioso 1 
will not be back 0 
lasted one day and then blew up 0 
there was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters 0 
i wasnt expecting oscar material but this 0 
after 3 months screen just went black all of a sudden 0 
what a great double cheeseburger 1 
the inside is really quite nice and very clean 1 
the waitress was friendly and happy to accomodate for veganveggie options 1 
it holds a charge for a long time is reasonably comfortable under longwearing conditions and the quality of sound is tremendous 1 
i had heard good things about this place but it exceeding every hope i could have dreamed of 1 
i also decided not to send it back because our waitress looked like she was on the verge of having a heart attack 0 
i immediately said i wanted to talk to the manager but i did not want to talk to the guy who was doing shots of fireball behind the bar 0 
it came free with a dvd player i bought but i still turned the thing off halfway through because i was embarrassed for howell 0 
it was horrendous 0 
good value great food great service 1 
highly recommended 1 
the battery runs down quickly 0 
delicious and i will absolutely be back 1 
i even dropped this phone into a stream and it was submerged for 15 seconds and it still works great 1 
phone falls out easily 0 
their steaks are 100 recommended 1 
absolutel junk 0 
worst ever 0 
i would recommend purchasing the jabra jx10 series 2 which works flawlessly with my moto q go figure 1 
the burger i got the gold standard a 17 burger and was kind of disappointed 0 
but it wasnt anything at all just one big yawn 0 
it is easy to turn on and off when you are in the car and the volume controls are quite accessable 1 
i do love sushi but i found kabuki to be overpriced overhip and underservices 0 
and there wasnt a single sour note struck actingwise either some surprisingly solid casting here 1 
the food is not tasty at all not to say its real traditional hunan style 0 
definitely a turn off for me i doubt ill be back unless someone else is buying 0 
his performance is simply genius 1 
the cinematographyif it can be called thatsucked 0 
the food amazing 1 
this is probably one of the least effective and utterly unoriginal films i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
the awful dialogue and hopeless overacting by everyone who gets shot top off a real waste of space and time 0 
i couldnt think of a better way to end the film but a smile on my face great way to wrap up an amazing film and trilogy 1 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
the cg opening sequence in space looked like it could have been created on microsoft slideshow for gods sake 0 
very good stuff for the price 1 
im translating movies for a living and this is the first movie in my 5year working experience that i found offensive to my intelligence 0 
disappointed 0 
we sat another ten minutes and finally gave up and left 0 
they have great dinners 1 
the awful dialogue and hopeless overacting by everyone who gets shot top off a real waste of space and time 0 
the noise shield is incrediable 1 
delicious 1 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
the sweet potato fries were very good and seasoned well 1 
after trying many many handsfree gadgets this is the one that finally works well 1 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
aside from its terrible lead this film has loads of other debits 0 
all in all ha long bay was a bit of a flop 0 
yet plantronincs continues to use the same flawed charger design 0 
unfortunately it did not work 0 
1 long lasting battery you dont have to recharge it as frequentyly as some of the flip phones2 0 
works great 1 
nargile i think you are great 1 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
do not buy do not buyit sucks 0 
and it was way to expensive 0 
this is the phone to get for 2005 i just bought my s710a and all i can say is wow 1 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
i did not bother contacting the company for few dollar product but i learned the lesson that i should not have bought this form online anyway 0 
frozen pucks of disgust with some of the worst people behind the register 0 
great movie 1 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
everything was fresh and delicious 1 
the poor actors 0 
also if your phone is dropped this case is not going to save it specially when dropped face down 0 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
there is so much good food in vegas that i feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to rice and company 0 
the performances are not improved by improvisation because the actors now have twice as much to worry about not only whether theyre delivering the line well but whether the line itself is any good 0 
everything was fresh and delicious 1 
the acting is terrible and the writing is worse 0 
the decor is nice and the piano music soundtrack is pleasant 1 
this gets a 1 out of 10 simply because theres nothing lower 0 
doesnt work at all i bougth it for my l7c and its not working 0 
it holds a charge for a long time is reasonably comfortable under longwearing conditions and the quality of sound is tremendous 1 
the handsfree part works fine but then the car tries to download the address book and the treo rebootsoverall i still rate this device high 1 
my rating just 3 out of 10 0 
the plot well i said id let that one go 0 
im very disappointed with my decision 0 
wow what a bad film 0 
ive missed numerous calls because of this reason 0 
i love lane but ive never seen her in a movie this lousy 0 
worked great 1 
i saw mirrormask last night and it was an unsatisfactory experience 0 
as i said abovepretty useless 0 
the only thing i did like was the prime rib and dessert section 1 
i give it 2 thumbs down 0 
will never ever go back and have told many people what had happened 0 
this really is how vegas fine dining used to be right down to the menus handed to the ladies that have no prices listed 1 
this is an outstanding little restaurant with some of the best food i have ever tasted 1 
nothing short of magnificent photographycinematography in this film 1 
the ripped banana was not only ripped but petrified and tasteless 0 
that being said for a phone the camera is very nice many cool effects to play with and video is decent as well 1 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
the server was very negligent of our needs and made us feel very unwelcome i would not suggest this place 0 
i had a seriously solid breakfast here 1 
the charger arrived within the promised timeframe but it did not work 0 
we had 7 at our table and the service was pretty fast 1 
using all earpieces left or right this thing will not stay on my ear 0 
the place was fairly clean but the food simply wasnt worth it 0 
in addition it feels amp looks as if the phone is all lightweight cheap plastic 0 
i could not recommend these more 0 
her lines seem to have been written by a fifteen year old though they are trying oh so so hard to sound like how a fifteen year old would really um you know well talk 0 
i asked multiple times for the wine list and after some time of being ignored i went to the hostess and got one myself 0 
on the negative its insipid enough to cause regret for another 2 hours of life wasted in front of the screen 0 
the dining space is tiny but elegantly decorated and comfortable 1 
very disappointed in accessoryone 0 
i wear it everyday and it holds up very well 1 
i got home to see the driest damn wings ever 0 
if you have not seen this movie i definitely recommend it 1 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
everything about this film is simply incredible 1 
what a mistake 0 
not even good for camp value 0 
this is infuriating 0 
food was delicious 1 
good value works fine power via usb car or wall outlet 1 
the loudspeaker option is great the bumpers with the lights is very appealing 0 
very disappointing 0 
this is a good joint 1 
the cast of veteran actors are more than just a nostalgia trip 1 
if it was to turn my good day feeling into a night of disturbing memories than i guess he succeeded 0 
appears to actually outperform the original battery from china that came with my v325i 1 
those phones are working just fine now 1 
a good quality bargain i bought this after i bought a cheapy from big lots that sounded awful and people on the other end couldnt hear me 1 
the movie lacks visual interest drama expression of feeling and celebration of the very patriotism that underlines the narrative 0 
the price is reasonable and the service is great 1 
i am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this 1 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
good value works fine power via usb car or wall outlet 1 
not much dialogue not much music the whole film was shot as elaborately and aesthetically like a sculpture 1 
best of luck to the rude and noncustomer service focused new management 0 
not recommended 0 
i never walked out of a movie faster 0 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
worst customer service 0 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
the jabra eargels fit my ears very well 1 
overall i rate this movie a 10 out of a 110 scale 1 
but whatever it was that cost them so much it didnt translate to quality thats for sure 0 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
each track commands sentiment actually contributing to the scenes and characters 1 
the potatoes were like rubber and you could tell they had been made up ahead of time being kept under a warmer 0 
what is even more stupid is that who had thought an idea that there should be a volcano in los angeles 0 
then the film just dropped the ball 0 
i recently had problems where i could not stay connected for more than 10 minutes before being disconnected 0 
i hope this place sticks around 1 
for the price on amazon it is an excellent product which i would highly recommend 1 
terrible product and waste of money 0 
the salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop which was perfectly cooked 1 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
this item is fantastic and works perfectly 1 
works well 1 
the food was delicious our bartender was attentive and personable and we got a great deal 1 
if you want healthy authentic or ethic food try this place 1 
all in all a great disappointment 0 
so they performed 1 
maybe there would be a reasonable explanation for this atrocity 0 
up there with the best of melville 1 
what a waste of money and time 0 
the phone is sturdy and waterproof 1 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
if you have not seen this movie i definitely recommend it 1 
buyerbe very careful 0 
i asked multiple times for the wine list and after some time of being ignored i went to the hostess and got one myself 0 
its just lame 0 
crust is not good 0 
constantine gives everything the right intensity and seems to have a good understanding of the underlying psychological motivations 1 
a piece of junk that broke after being on my phone for 2 days 0 
does not work for listening to music with the cingular 8125 0 
a standout scene 1 
the menu is always changing food quality is going down service is extremely slow 0 
low quality 0 
the sweet potato tots were good but the onion rings were perfection or as close as i have had 1 
great pocket pc phone combination 1 
now we were chosen to be tortured with this disgusting piece of blatant american propaganda 0 
none of it works just dont buy it 0 
low quality 0 
20th century foxs road house 1948 is not only quite a silly noir but is an implausible unmitigated bore of a movie 0 
the veggitarian platter is out of this world 1 
one of the worst shows of all time 0 
the film is way too long 0 
the story itself is just predictable and lazy 0 
the acting is terrible and the writing is worse 0 
my fella got the huevos rancheros and they didnt look too appealing 0 
my sister has one also and she loves it 1 
this game rocks 1 
it is easy to turn on and off when you are in the car and the volume controls are quite accessable 1 
it looked like a wonderful story 1 
light weight i hardly notice it is there 1 
juano hernandez an exceptional actor who played supporting roles in many films of the era is a proud black man who is accused of murdering a white man in the south 1 
weve have gotten a much better service from the pizza place next door than the services we received from this restaurant 0 
highly unrecommended 0 
i loved it it was really scary 1 
used and dirty 0 
we sat another ten minutes and finally gave up and left 0 
their chow mein is so good 1 
otherwise dont even waste your time on this 0 
i have had mine for about a year and this christmas i bought some for the rest of the family 1 
this film offers many delights and surprises 1 
service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is vegas and located inside the crystals shopping mall by aria 1 
only had this a month but its worked flawlessly so far 1 
this film and i use that word loosely is an insult to the moviegoing public 0 
then as if i hadnt wasted enough of my life there they poured salt in the wound by drawing out the time it took to bring the check 0 
you cant beat the price on these 1 
its an empty hollow shell of a movie 0 
awesome service and food 1 
nice design and quality 1 
the food wasnt good 0 
the dialogue is composed of things that make little sense 0 
the real disappointment was our waiter 0 
the steak and the shrimp are in my opinion the best entrees at gc 1 
great phone 1 
the malta settings are as dry and as barren as the dialogue 0 
definitely not worth the 3 i paid 0 
this early film from future goremeister lucio fulci is a very good addition to the giallo subgenre 1 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
i ordered the lemon raspberry ice cocktail which was also incredible 1 
totally believable 1 
it is not good 0 
i ordered this for sony ericsson w810i but i think it only worked once thats when i first used it 0 
it looses connection to the phone even when it is within a couple feet between the two 0 
best fish ive ever had in my life 1 
amazon sucks 0 
sprint charges for this service 0 
worst service to boot but that is the least of their worries 0 
food is way overpriced and portions are fucking small 0 
on the ground right next to our table was a large smeared beensteppedinandtrackedeverywhere pile of green bird poop 0 
itll be a regular stop on my trips to phoenix 1 
the memories are murky but i can only say that i enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show 1 
as many people complained i found this headsets microphone was very weak 0 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
but then they came back cold 0 
i promise they wont disappoint 1 
this scene is very strong and unpleasant 0 
i know that sounds funny but to me it seemed like sketchy technology that wouldnt work wellwell this one works great 1 
light weight i hardly notice it is there 1 
in addition to having one of the most lovely songs ever written french cancan also boasts one of the cutest leading ladies ever to grace the screen 1 
the directing seems too pretentious 0 
what a piece of junk i lose more calls on this phone 0 
for a product that costs as much as this one does i expect it to work far better and with greater ease than this thing does 0 
the story line is totally predictable 0 
i gave it a 10 1 
product was excellent and works better than the verizon one and boy was it cheaper 1 
this was my first and only vegas buffet and it did not disappoint 1 
i will come back here every time im in vegas 1 
we have gotten a lot of compliments on it 1 
wonderful lil tapas and the ambience made me feel all warm and fuzzy inside 1 
definitely worth seeing its the sort of thought provoking film that forces you to question your own threshold of loneliness 1 
then a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use 0 
i had ordered a motorola data cable got a very well finished and working product 1 
its been my choice headset for yearsgreat sound good volume good noise cancellation 1 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
here in the wind and the lion we see a wonderful rendering of americas own imperial age 1 
it was attached to a gas station and that is rarely a good sign 0 
spoilers whatever else can or cant be said about it surface is superbly crafted 1 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
if that bug never showed up i would have given a 4 for sure but on the other side of the wall where this bug was climbing was the kitchen 0 
but then they came back cold 0 
shrimp when i unwrapped it i live only 12 a mile from brushfire it was literally ice cold 0 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
this movie is a good and humorous comment on life in 2006 1 
poor product 0 
i love this bluetooth 1 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
good transmit audio 1 
i was particularly pleased with the acting ability of dwight schultz 1 
the scripting of the subtle comedy is unmatched by any movie in recent years 1 
the memories are murky but i can only say that i enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show 1 
not much flavor to them and very poorly constructed 0 
the battery runs down quickly 0 
the salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop which was perfectly cooked 1 
what a waste of time 0 
dee snider just plain sucks 0 
this was one of the worst films i have ever seen 0 
id rather eat airline food seriously 0 
i like steiners because its dark and it feels like a bar 1 
great steak great sides great wine amazing desserts 1 
really really good rice all the time 1 
and it was boring 0 
it was delicious 1 
we wont be returning 0 
they refuse to refund or replace 0 
works great 1 
it is zillion times away from reality 0 
too politically correct 0 
plus it was wellpaced and suited its relatively short run time 1 
avoid at all cost 0 
i wear glasses and it fits fine with them 1 
unfortunately cover girl is an example of how hollywood used to exploit women for financial gain 0 
these are the central themes of the film and they are handled ineptly stereotypically and with no depth of imagination 0 
a good time 1 
having to humour him just to get by and get through the day was so apt 1 
the transfers are very good 1 
secondly hitchcock pretty much perfected the thriller and chase movie 1 
the sides are delish mixed mushrooms yukon gold puree white corn beateous 1 
i work in the hospitality industry in paradise valley and have refrained from recommending cibo any longer 0 
pretty cool i would say 1 
it plays louder than any other speaker of this size the price is so low that most would think the quality is lacking however its not 1 
reception is terrible and full of static 0 
service was very prompt 1 
this product is great it makes working a lot easier i can go to the copier while waiting on hold for something 1 
it is super charged up for use as a small hybrid palmtopcameracellphone and excels in those roles 1 
ive had no trouble accessing the internet downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions 1 
if you do go see this movie bring a pillow or a girlfriendboyfriend to keep you occupied through out 0 
great hands free device 1 
to be honest with you this is unbelievable nonsense and very foolish 0 
i love my 350 headset my jabra350 bluetooth headset is great the reception is very good and the ear piece is a comfortable fit 1 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
i really liked that 1 
for those that havent seen it dont waste your time 0 
on three different occasions i asked for well done or medium well and all three times i got the bloodiest piece of meat on my plate 0 
also great directing and photography 1 
i dont think ill be running back to carlys anytime soon for food 0 
omg the food was delicioso 1 
i hate to disagree with my fellow yelpers but my husband and i were so disappointed with this place 0 
gets a signal when other verizon phones wont 1 
i was very excited to get this headset because i thought it was really cute 1 
both rickman and stowe play their roles to the hilt in this tale of a childrens book writer who maybe has written a subversive tract 1 
its a fresh subtle and rather sublime effect 1 
i guess i should have known that this place would suck because it is inside of the excalibur but i didnt use my common sense 0 
what a waste of time 0 
interesting decor 1 
my phone doesnt slide around my car now and the grip prevents my phone from slipping out of my hand 1 
the best part about nurse betty is its unpredictability 1 
now the burgers arent as good the pizza which used to be amazing is doughy and flavorless 0 
im terribly disappointed that this film would receive so many awards and accolades especially when there are far more deserving works of film out there 0 
of all the dishes the salmon was the best but all were great 1 
the cast is always entertaining as usual 1 
attempting artiness with black white and clever camera angles the movie disappointed became even more ridiculous as the acting was poor and the plot and lines almost nonexistent 0 
kids pizza is always a hit too with lots of great side dish options for the kiddos 1 
seafood was limited to boiled shrimp and crab legs but the crab legs definitely did not taste fresh 0 
the only thing that i think could improve is the sound leaks out from the headset 0 
very bad experience 0 
down the drain because of a weak snap 0 
bacon is hella salty 1 
also if your phone is dropped this case is not going to save it specially when dropped face down 0 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
special mention should be made of the superb music score and sound effects which are an integral element in helping to make this such a memorable and enjoyable cartoon 1 
the entire audience applauded at the conclusion of the film 1 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
i really recommend this faceplates since it looks very nice elegant and cool 1 
he really didnt seem to want to be hosting his voiceovers were monotonous didnt get involved with the guests 0 
the performances are not improved by improvisation because the actors now have twice as much to worry about not only whether theyre delivering the line well but whether the line itself is any good 0 
the attempts at humor were pitiful and story is so awful it dosent bear thinking about which basically involves a vulcan stealing the enterprise to find god seriously i just didnt care about any of this film and oh not to mention uhura does a belly dance to distract male guards 0 
love this phone 1 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
food quality has been horrible 0 
the food amazing 1 
this was a different cut than the piece the other day but still wonderful and tender s well as well flavored 1 
highly unrecommended 0 
all in all i give this one a resounding 9 out of 10 1 
cant say enough good things about this place 1 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
poor quality 0 
makes it easier to keep up with my bluetooth when im not wearing it 0 
i am also very happy with the price 1 
her lines seem to have been written by a fifteen year old though they are trying oh so so hard to sound like how a fifteen year old would really um you know well talk 0 
i own a jabra earset and was very happy with it but the sound quality especially outgoing on this is better 1 
i did not expect this to be so good 1 
our server was super nice and checked on us many times 1 
the atmosphere was great with a lovely duo of violinists playing songs we requested 1 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
the script is bad very bad  it contains both cheesiness and unethical joke that you normally see in rated r or nc17 movie 0 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
i think that it is a must see older john wayne film 1 
i love it 1 
totally believable 1 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
this blueant supertooth handsfree phone speaker is awesome 1 
the fries were great too 1 
the plot is nonsense that doesnt interest in the slightest way or have any uniqueness to it 0 
omelets are to die for 1 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
duris has a wholesome appearance and gives a fine performance 1 
about 30 minutes of footage is wasted to show mediocre elderly actors awkwardly babbling overwrought pseudosatanic gibberish corny enough to make a teen goth blush almost always in olde english and sometimes in latin that may or may not be made up words 0 
i dont think ill be running back to carlys anytime soon for food 0 
lightweight and works well 1 
but the duet between the astronaut and his doctor at the beginning of the movie is a perfect exchange if one considers that this movie was made well into the cold war and the astronauts biggest fear is that he has crashed in the ussr 1 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
the attempts at humor were pitiful and story is so awful it dosent bear thinking about which basically involves a vulcan stealing the enterprise to find god seriously i just didnt care about any of this film and oh not to mention uhura does a belly dance to distract male guards 0 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
the battery is completely useless to me 0 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
this is actually a very smart movie 1 
at no point in the proceedings does it look remotely like america 0 
this is a great product sure beats using your fingers 1 
we have gotten a lot of compliments on it 1 
ryans bar is definitely one edinburgh establishment i wont be revisiting 0 
the worst phone from samsungcrap this crappy samsung e715 is the worst i have ever seeen 0 
it presents a idyllic yet serious portrayal of the ups and downs of the characters lives 1 
damian is so talented and versatile in so many ways of writing and portraying different characters on screen 1 
what a great double cheeseburger 1 
the phone is sturdy and waterproof 1 
good case excellent value 1 
they work about 2 weeks then break 0 
everything about it is just bad 0 
the ngage is still lacking in earbuds 0 
the use of slowmotion needlessly repeats itself throughout the movie but is well backed up by bad acting and bad is a kind word here no continuity scenes that are thrown in for no reason whatsoever vehicles that looked like they were made from a corn flakes box and a directorial style that bordered on stupidity 0 
unfortunately any virtue in this films production work was lost on a regrettable script 0 
they could be used as exemplars for any set designer 1 
the vanilla ice cream was creamy and smooth while the profiterole choux pastry was fresh enough 1 
like the other reviewer said you couldnt pay me to eat at this place again 0 
john garfield ann revere lilli plmer william conrad canada leeand filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screenjames wong howe 1 
and his subtle connections between the three films are awesome 1 
the shipping time was also very quick 1 
it was attached to a gas station and that is rarely a good sign 0 
same evening him and i are both drastically sick 0 
greatno problems at all 1 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
youd have to have the iq of particularly stupid mollusk not to see that one coming 0 
no actress has been worse used that june allison in this movie 0 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
an extensive menu provides lots of options for breakfast 1 
there is a totally unnecessary trainroller coaster scene 0 
all in all a great disappointment 0 
the writer gorman bechard undoubtedly did his homework because all references are industry and characterage appropriate 1 
i have only had it for a few weeks but so far so good 1 
this is my new fav vegas buffet spot 1 
it is shameful 0 
as a sushi lover avoid this place by all means 0 
nice case feels good in your hands 1 
the food is not tasty at all not to say its real traditional hunan style 0 
i wouldnt see this movie again for free 0 
this fixes all the problems 1 
and the rest of it just sits there being awful with soldiers singing songs about the masculinity they pledge themselves to hairsplitting about purity the admiration of swords etc 0 
none of the new ones have ever quite worked properly 0 
one more thing i can tolerate political incorrectness very well im all for artistic freedom and suspension of disbelief but the slavic female character was just too much 0 
the design is very good4 1 
soyo technology sucks 0 
we wont be going back 0 
we ordered some old classics and some new dishes after going there a few times and were sorely disappointed with everything 0 
excellent hands free tool 1 
damn good steak 1 
their frozen margaritas are way too sugary for my taste 0 
you never know if you pushed it hard enough or the right number of times for the function you want or not 0 
worst customer service 0 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
i can think of no other film where something vitally important occurs every other minute 1 
so just beware 0 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
after i pulled up my car i waited for another 15 minutes before being acknowledged 0 
this was like the final blow 0 
we also ordered the spinach and avocado salad the ingredients were sad and the dressing literally had zero taste 0 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
at first glance it is a lovely bakery cafe nice ambiance clean friendly staff 1 
the meat was pretty dry i had the sliced brisket and pulled pork 0 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
still i do like this movie for its empowerment of women theres not enough movies out there like this one 1 
worst customer service 0 
the food was barely lukewarm so it must have been sitting waiting for the server to bring it out to us 0 
definitely a bargain 1 
at least think to refill my water before i struggle to wave you over for 10 minutes 0 
everything on the menu is terrific and we were also thrilled that they made amazing accommodations for our vegetarian daughter 1 
hackneyed writing certainly but made even worse by the bad directing 0 
it isnt even an achievement as a sobaditsgood or sobaditsmemorable movie 0 
this is a great deal 1 
these are the nicest restaurant owners ive ever come across 1 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
have been going since 2007 and every meal has been awesome 1 
but this movie is not funny considering the ridiculousness of it 0 
im surprised this is a good quality car charger and theres not much reviews about it 1 
i wasted my little money with this earpiece 0 
a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it 1 
i love the ringtones because they are so upbeat 1 
great pocket pc phone combination 1 
poor quality 0 
1 hour 54 minutes of sheer tedium melodrama and horrible acting a mess of a script and a sinking feeling of good lord what were they thinking 0 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
youll love how thin it is 1 
i didnt want the clip going over the top of my ear causing discomfort 0 
i had a seriously solid breakfast here 1 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
it didnt work people can not hear me when i talk 0 
setup couldnt have been simpler 1 
better than expected 1 
at around 4 pm i bought it at around 8pm i started to watch at around 815pm i fast forwarded the remaining film to see if there was anything left watchable for a human being with a brain but there wasnt 0 
the chicken i got was definitely reheated and was only ok the wedges were cold and soggy 0 
overall a great experience 1 
never got it 0 
i connected my wifes bluetoothmotorola hs850 to my phone and it worked like a charm whether the phone was in my pocket or the case 1 
wont ever go here again 0 
it even has its sweet moments 1 
the films dialogue is natural real to life 1 
as for the service i thought it was good 1 
even worse than ticker 0 
if you havent gone here go now 1 
ive missed numerous calls because of this reason 0 
the transfers are very good 1 
not good when wearing a hat or sunglasses 0 
the macarons here are insanely good 1 
awesome service and food 1 
it dit not work most of the time with my nokia 5320 0 
we were promptly greeted and seated 1 
yes i am simplifying things here for the sake of brevity for this really is at the core of the problems with this film it has too much going on without any real fulfilling explanation 0 
the staff are great the ambiance is great 1 
rude inconsiderate management 0 
what a waste of time 0 
cumbersome design 0 
piece of trash 0 
my mother and brother had to do thiswhen i saw robert ryan portraying this type of man it was a very good imitation of this type of individual and i was impressed 1 
she carries the movie well 1 
then theres the plot holes 0 
is pretty funny 1 
ive had better not only from dedicated boba tea spots but even from jenni pho 0 
everything from acting to cinematography was solid 1 
whatever the producer was going for he missed entirely 0 
this is an outstanding little restaurant with some of the best food i have ever tasted 1 
i have had tmobile service for 2 or 3 years now and i am pretty happy with it 1 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
there were too many close ups 0 
cant store anything but phone numbers to sim 0 
it fits so securely that the ear hook does not even need to be used and the sound is better directed through your ear canal 1 
bacon is hella salty 1 
he is one of my favourite directors and one of the most talented directors in the history of cinema 1 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
however i needed some better instructions 0 
first of all there are enough racial stereotypes and racial jokes to offend everyone 0 
it just blew 0 
the service was a little slow considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace 0 
for people who are first timers in film making i think they did an excellent job 1 
the menu had so much good stuff on it i could not decide 1 
the worst was the salmon sashimi 0 
my boyfriend and i sat at the bar and had a completely delightful experience 1 
its like a bad two hour tv movie 0 
so there is no way for me to plug it in here in the us unless i go by a converter 0 
avoid at any and all costs 0 
i struggle to find anything bad to say about it 1 
great case and price 1 
battery life is real good 1 
the ambiance isnt much better 0 
the food is rich so order accordingly 1 
the success of the film depends on the casting of sydney greenstreet as the alexander yardley character 1 
i have been very happy with the 510 and have had no complaints from any one regarding my sound quality on their end 1 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
aside from its terrible lead this film has loads of other debits 0 
unreliable im giving up 0 
this place is great 1 
this film highlights the fundamental flaws of the legal process that its not about discovering guilt or innocence but rather is about who presents better in court 1 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
great earpiece 1 
i love the scream movies and all horror movies and this one ranks way up there 1 
ample portions and good prices 1 
the characters are interesting even if a bit predictable 1 
its this pandering to the audience that sabotages most of his films 0 
the staff is friendly and the joint is always clean 1 
its practically perfect in all of them  a true masterpiece in a sea of faux masterpieces 1 
iam very pleased with my purchase 1 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
this movie is excellentangel is beautiful and scamp is adorablehis little yelps when hes scaredand the funniest parts are whenscamp is caught under the curtain and when angel and scamp are singing ive never had this feeling beforei totally recommend this movieits coming out on special edition on june 20the cover has scamp on a garbage can and angel underneath the lid 1 
another note about this phones appearance is that it really looks rather bland especially in the all black model 0 
the telephone repair man was really funny and his reactions to the nuts and bitchy boss were truly genuine 1 
if you simply want a small flip phone look elsewhere as the extra bells whistles are mediocre 0 
soyo technology sucks 0 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
i dont think ive ever gone to a movie and disliked it as much 0 
it didnt charge for me 0 
the atmosphere was great with a lovely duo of violinists playing songs we requested 1 
but kevin spacey is an excellent verbal tsunami as buddy ackerman  and totally believable because he is a great actor 1 
they work about 2 weeks then break 0 
too bad cause i know its family owned i really wanted to like this place 0 
this is a witty and delightful adaptation of the dr seuss book brilliantly animated by upas finest and thoroughly deserving of its academy award 1 
this was like the final blow 0 
omg i felt like i had never eaten thai food until this dish 1 
the greek dressing was very creamy and flavorful 1 
i took back my money and got outta there 0 
my wife had the lobster bisque soup which was lukewarm 0 
the characters were all funny and had the peculiarity of not having a true lead character 1 
very satisifed with that 1 
nothing at all to recommend 0 
this is a disgrace 0 
we ordered some old classics and some new dishes after going there a few times and were sorely disappointed with everything 0 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
all the characters in this film are tremendously well played 1 
very comfortable 1 
my wife had the lobster bisque soup which was lukewarm 0 
the chips and salsa were really good the salsa was very fresh 1 
by far the best cheesecurds we have ever had 1 
thanks good a movie like this was done and released 1 
this place lacked style 0 
kind of flops around 0 
regardless the film fails on most levels 0 
first of all there are enough racial stereotypes and racial jokes to offend everyone 0 
a piece of junk that broke after being on my phone for 2 days 0 
point your finger at any item on the menu order it and you wont be disappointed 1 
i left with a stomach ache and felt sick the rest of the day 0 
clear crisp sound 1 
why was this film made 0 
id love to go back 1 
when i placed my treo into the case not only was it not snug but there was a lot of extra room on the sides 0 
they are so easy to love but even more easy to identify with 1 
this product had a strong rubberpetroleum smell that was unbearable after a while and caused me to return it 0 
waaaaaayyyyyyyyyy over rated is all i am saying 0 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
very very fun chef 1 
being a 90s child i truly enjoyed this show and i can proudly say that i enjoyed it big time and even more than the classical wb cartoons 1 
this movie was kind of long in length but i enjoyed every minute of it 1 
extremely tasty 1 
im using it with an iriver spinn with case and it fits fine 1 
i had the chicken pho and it tasted very bland 0 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
it does everything the description said it would 1 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
that being said for a phone the camera is very nice many cool effects to play with and video is decent as well 1 
good product good seller 1 
this is one of peter watkins most accessible films 1 
the only thing i did like was the prime rib and dessert section 1 
the goat taco didnt skimp on the meat and wow what flavor 1 
by far the best cheesecurds we have ever had 1 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
maybe there would be a reasonable explanation for this atrocity 0 
the food was great as always compliments to the chef 1 
everything about it is just bad 0 
you cant relate with them hell you barely can understand them 0 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
but despite these few flaws this case is of exceptional quality and well worth the additional costs of owning an official oem product 1 
if you are looking for a good quality motorola headset keep looking this isnt it 0 
the film has an ultracheap look to it 0 
this is the place where i first had pho and it was amazing 1 
also the fries are without a doubt the worst fries ive ever had 0 
i was not impressed by this product 0 
i great reception all the time 1 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
happy so far 1 
he is an amazing film artist one of the most important whoever lived 1 
the burger i got the gold standard a 17 burger and was kind of disappointed 0 
it is an excellent drama an excellent thriller and an excellent film 1 
a bit predictable 0 
now i know that i made a wise decision 1 
also difficult to put onid recommend avoiding this product 0 
friends pasta also bad he barely touched it 0 
a cheap and cheerless heist movie with poor characterisation lots of underbite style stoic emoting think chow yun fat in a better tomorrow and some cheesy clichés thrown into an abandoned factory ready for a few poorly executed flying judo rolls a la john woo 0 
i never come again 0 
returned 8 hours later 0 
to summarize the food was incredible nay transcendant but nothing brings me joy quite like the memory of the pneumatic condiment dispenser 1 
not tasty and the texture was just nasty 0 
my brother in law who works at the mall ate here same day and guess what he was sick all night too 0 
i rate this movie 910 1 
we have gotten a lot of compliments on it 1 
seriously flavorful delights folks 1 
great atmosphere friendly and fast service 1 
worthwhile 1 
for the price on amazon it is an excellent product which i would highly recommend 1 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
then i exchanged for the same phone even that had the same problem 0 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
its fits like a glove and is strong secure and durable 1 
do not buy if you want to use the holster 0 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
i sat riveted to the tv screen 1 
this hole in the wall has great mexican street tacos and friendly staff 1 
star trek v the final frontier is the worst in the series 0 
too politically correct 0 
i really like this product over the motorola because it is allot clearer on the ear piece and the mic 1 
ps the only scene in the movie that was cool is when the central character finds her room blown up 1 
after two i felt disgusting 0 
my husband said she was very rude did not even apologize for the bad food or anything 0 
portable and it works 1 
service is quick and friendly 1 
i exchanged the sony ericson z500a for this and im pretty happy with that decision 1 
i got home to see the driest damn wings ever 0 
now we were chosen to be tortured with this disgusting piece of blatant american propaganda 0 
i could not recommend these more 0 
it was pretty gross 0 
service is also cute 1 
superb phone on a great network 1 
the potato chip order was sad i could probably count how many chips were in that box and it was probably around 12 0 
the movie lacks visual interest drama expression of feeling and celebration of the very patriotism that underlines the narrative 0 
ive had this for nearly 2 years and it has worked great for me 1 
not even a hello we will be right with you 0 
it is unusable in a moving car at freeway speed 0 
bacon is hella salty 1 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
gave up trying to eat any of the crust teeth still sore 0 
worked perfectly 1 
nobody identifies with these characters because theyre all cardboard cutouts and stereotypes or predictably reversestereotypes 0 
anne heche was utterly convincing 1 
waste of money 0 
after 20 minutes wait i got a table 0 
i wasnt the least bit interested 0 
as for the service im a fan because its quick and youre being served by some nice folks 1 
a disappointment 0 
during several different 2 minute calls i experienced 5 drops and it was in an area that had 5 bars 0 
it crackles with an unpredictable youthful energy but honestly i found it hard to follow and concentrate on it meanders so badly 0 
i love the ringtones because they are so upbeat 1 
pretty piece of junk 0 
the sweet potato tots were good but the onion rings were perfection or as close as i have had 1 
i cannot make calls at certain places 0 
poor construction 0 
this place is handsdown one of the best places to eat in the phoenix metro area 1 
it didnt charge for me 0 
def coming back to bowl next time 1 
this is actually a very smart movie 1 
the food was excellent and service was very good 1 
not what i wanted 0 
its too bad the food is so damn generic 0 
i was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar not only because the quality is great but the service is fast and the food impeccable 1 
what a disappointment 0 
all i have to say is the food was amazing 1 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
never again will i be dining at this place 0 
the phone gets extremely hot 0 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
everything was good and tasty 1 
the management is rude 0 
i am very happy 1 
we asked for the bill to leave without eating and they didnt bring that either 0 
summary the witticisms werent witty 0 
even in my bmw 3 series which is fairly quiet i have trouble hearing what the other person is saying 0 
good audio quality 1 
i am also very happy with the price 1 
the owners really really need to quit being soooooo cheap let them wrap my freaking sandwich in two papers not one 0 
much more interesting more action more suspense and less of the unneeded controversy 1 
battery chargelife is quite long 1 
sauce was tasteless 0 
the design is very good4 1 
ive only had my bluetooth for a few weeks but i really like it 1 
the least said about the acting the better 0 
the acting was decidely wooden though no worse than a period universal b movie 0 
comfortable fit you need your headset to be comfortable for at least an hour at a time if not for an entire day 1 
works great 1 
much less than the jawbone i was going to replace it with 1 
i keep watching it over and over 1 
what a big waste of time 0 
i agree with jessica this movie is pretty bad 0 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
its also great to see that renowned silent screenwriter frances marion hasnt missed a step going from silent to sound 1 
now the pizza itself was good the peanut sauce was very tasty 1 
its one of the movies i need to see whenever it comes on tvnever mind the fact that i already have it memorized 1 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
i am going to have to be the first to negatively review this product 0 
the characters are interesting and you really care for them 1 
this is hands down the best phone ive ever had 1 
i could barely stomach the meal but didnt complain because it was a business lunch 0 
i couldnt think of a better way to end the film but a smile on my face great way to wrap up an amazing film and trilogy 1 
buyerbe very careful 0 
dont waste your money 0 
very serious spoilers this movie was a huge disappointment 0 
if you havent choked in your own vomit by the end by all the cheap drama and worthless dialogue youve must have bored yourself to death with this waste of time 0 
took an hour to get our food only 4 tables in restaurant my food was luke warm our sever was running around like he was totally overwhelmed 0 
i own a jabra earset and was very happy with it but the sound quality especially outgoing on this is better 1 
the acting by the whole cast could be put on a scale and balanced perfectly between overacting and underacting 0 
but if you liked movies like the matrix and better yet their sequels i think youll appreciate the thought provoking mindblowing experience this film will give you 1 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
it was horrendous 0 
the cashier was friendly and even brought the food out to me 1 
that being said for a phone the camera is very nice many cool effects to play with and video is decent as well 1 
there are massive levels massive unlockable characters its just a massive game 1 
great hands free device 1 
i wouldnt see this movie again for free 0 
the servers are not pleasant to deal with and they dont always honor pizza hut coupons 0 
at first i thought i was grtting a good deal at 744 until i plugged it into my phone v3c razr 0 
after the disappointing dinner we went elsewhere for dessert 0 
how can you call yourself a steakhouse if you cant properly cook a steak i dont understand 0 
this was such an awesome movie that i bought it off of ebay 1 
i have 23 bars on my cell phone when i am home but you cant not hear anything 0 
works for me 1 
do not buy do not buyit sucks 0 
the food was barely lukewarm so it must have been sitting waiting for the server to bring it out to us 0 
its a sad movie but very good 1 
but in any case the best part is you can download these pictures to your laptop using ir or even send pictures from your laptop to the phone 1 
service was exceptional and food was a good as all the reviews 1 
howeverthe riingtones are not the best and neither are the games 0 
great steak great sides great wine amazing desserts 1 
magical help 1 
i would highly recommend this 1 
but this movie really got to me 1 
very disappointing 0 
lousy product 0 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
no additional ear gels provided and no instructions whatsoever 0 
we are so glad we found this place 1 
i get absolutely horrible reception in my apartment where with other phones i have not had this problem 0 
cinematography the film was shot in an interesting way 1 
my boyfriend and i came here for the first time on a recent trip to vegas and could not have been more pleased with the quality of food and service 1 
they could serve it with just the vinaigrette and it may make for a better overall dish but it was still very good 1 
updatewent back for a second time and it was still just as amazing 1 
10 out of 10 stars 1 
it really is impressive that the place hasnt closed down 0 
much better than the other ayce sushi place i went to in vegas 1 
bad characters bad story and bad acting 0 
total brunch fail 0 
not even a hello we will be right with you 0 
they have great dinners 1 
doesnt hold charge 0 
the bathrooms are clean and the place itself is well decorated 1 
overall i rate this movie a 10 out of a 110 scale 1 
no ear loop needed its tiny and the sound is great 1 
i love that they put their food in nice plastic containers as opposed to cramming it in little paper takeout boxes 1 
as for the killer dont expect anything original or even remotely frightening 0 
food was average at best 0 
a good quality bargain i bought this after i bought a cheapy from big lots that sounded awful and people on the other end couldnt hear me 1 
jamie foxx absolutely is ray charles 1 
couldnt figure it out 0 
first the bathrooms at this location were dirty seat covers were not replenished just plain yucky 0 
one of the best mexican movies ever and one of the less understood even by mexican themselves no matter how identified the should have felt with it 1 
dont waste your money and time 0 
i love being able to use one headset for both by landline and cell 1 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
i have always used corded headsets and the freedom from the wireless is very helpful 1 
eew this location needs a complete overhaul 0 
prosgood camera very nice pictures also has cool styles like black and white and more 1 
but when i check voice mail at night the keypad backlight turns off a few seconds into the first message and then im lost 0 
lightweight and works well 1 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
i wont be back 0 
cute quaint simple honest 1 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
this phone works great 1 
also were served hot bread and butter and home made potato chips with bacon bits on topvery original and very good 1 
it was a pale color instead of nice and char and has no flavor 0 
seriously killer hot chai latte 1 
it wasnt busy at all and now we know why 0 
im still infatuated with this phone 1 
i saw this movie and i thought this is a stupid movie 0 
trying to make a call on these is an exercise in frustration 0 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
the aerial scenes were welldone 1 
these were so good we ordered them twice 1 
very cheap plastic creaks like an old wooden floor 0 
great food and awesome service 1 
this is an extraordinary film 1 
the screen does get smudged easily because it touches your ear and face 0 
those burgers were amazing 1 
yes i am simplifying things here for the sake of brevity for this really is at the core of the problems with this film it has too much going on without any real fulfilling explanation 0 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
avoid at all costs 0 
it wasnt busy at all and now we know why 0 
terrible phone holder 0 
i received my headset in good time and was happy with it 1 
freezes frequently4 0 
the sangria was about half of a glass wine full and was 12 ridiculous 0 
i find this inexcusable and so will probably be returning this phone and perhaps changing carriers 0 
this place is not quality sushi it is not a quality restaurant 0 
but this movie really got to me 1 
i think it was robert ryans best film because he portrayed someone like my father and he was a schizophrenic in real lifemy father although he never murdered anyone but was affected more so during the second world war which made him worse 1 
very disappointed and wondered how it could be in the oscar shortlist 0 
fits comfortably came with three sizes of earbud tips 1 
i searched the internet and found this one to be the best value 1 
it is an insane game 1 
some may say this buffet is pricey but i think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot 1 
dont waste your time here 0 
service was exceptional and food was a good as all the reviews 1 
it was a riot to see hugo weaving play a sexobsessed gay real estate salesman who uses his clients houses for his trysts with the flaming darren tom hollander 1 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
horrible 0 
ive seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie 0 
its worth driving up from tucson 1 
it wasnt busy either also the building was freezing cold 0 
they work about 2 weeks then break 0 
also its slim enough to fit into my alarm clock docking station without removing the case 1 
garbo who showed right off the bat that her talents could carry over from the silent era i wanted to see some of her silent work but netflix doesnt seem to be stocking them 1 
awesome service and food 1 
the block was amazing 1 
this is high adventure at its best 1 
but when someone strives for greatness and poetry but delivers a muddled and often ridiculous story a bunch of disparate scenes pretentious dialogue then you get the worst kind of a movie that some other reviewer very accurately defined as pretentious crap 0 
very disappointing 0 
never got it 0 
well never go again 0 
what a disappointment 0 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
i am also very happy with the price 1 
that one didnt work either 0 
try them in the airport to experience some tasty food and speedy friendly service 1 
in a word it is embarrassing 0 
horrible horrible protector 0 
they have a really nice atmosphere 1 
about ten minutes into this film i started having second thoughts 0 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
i left the theater with a lilt in my step joy in my heart and hope for the human race 1 
this item is fantastic and works perfectly 1 
the selection was probably the worst ive seen in vegasthere was none 0 
the burger i got the gold standard a 17 burger and was kind of disappointed 0 
over rated 0 
i was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar not only because the quality is great but the service is fast and the food impeccable 1 
this film tries to be a serious and sophisticated thrillerhorror flick and it fails miserably 0 
this one wants to surf on the small wave of space movies in 1998 deep impact and armageddon and this one fails everywhere 0 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
waitress was sweet and funny 1 
this place was such a nice surprise 1 
we watched our waiter pay a lot more attention to other tables and ignore us 0 
both rickman and stowe play their roles to the hilt in this tale of a childrens book writer who maybe has written a subversive tract 1 
i am very happy 1 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
the movie is not completely perfect but titta di girolamo will stay with you for a long time after the vision of the movie 1 
black water is a thriller that manages to completely transcend its limitations its an indie flick by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience 1 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
simple lightweight and great fit 1 
cant store anything but phone numbers to sim 0 
i dont think ill be running back to carlys anytime soon for food 0 
an awesome new look for fall 2000 1 
i keep watching it over and over 1 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
when i opened the sandwich i was impressed but not in a good way 0 
not only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic but it also managed to give away the entire movie and im not exaggerating every moment every plot point every joke is told in the trailer 0 
will not be back 0 
food was delicious 1 
really bad 0 
you wont regret it 1 
now the burgers arent as good the pizza which used to be amazing is doughy and flavorless 0 
steamboat willie is an amazingly important film to our cinema history 1 
of course the footage from the 70s was grainy but that only enhanced the film 1 
any grandmother can make a roasted chicken better than this one 0 
i didnt realize how wonderful the short really is until the last two scenes 1 
also difficult to put onid recommend avoiding this product 0 
after 20 minutes wait i got a table 0 
i love this place 1 
the phone gets extremely hot 0 
i had high hopes for this place since the burgers are cooked over a charcoal grill but unfortunately the taste fell flat way flat 0 
before i go in to why i gave a 1 star rating please know that this was my third time eating at bachi burger before writing a review 0 
weve have gotten a much better service from the pizza place next door than the services we received from this restaurant 0 
dont waste your time here 0 
i highly recommend this device to everyone 1 
with the originality and freshness of the first movie now spent this remake had little else to offer 0 
great service and food 1 
i was amazed at the quick arrival of the two original lg cell phone batteries and and at a fraction of the price 1 
horrible horrible protector 0 
the handsfree part works fine but then the car tries to download the address book and the treo rebootsoverall i still rate this device high 1 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
i recently had problems where i could not stay connected for more than 10 minutes before being disconnected 0 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
we were promptly greeted and seated 1 
id like to return it 0 
it finds my cell phone right away when i enter the car 1 
there were too many close ups 0 
i was left shattered from the experience of watching this film and i took a good two hours to fully recover 0 
however i needed some better instructions 0 
the film gives meaning to the phrase never in the history of human conflict has so much been owed by so many to so few 1 
worse theres an incredibly weak subplot thrown in that follows a little band of latterday mansonites as they go after a reporter whos working on a story on the anniversary of the killings 0 
instead we got a bore fest about a whiny spoiled brat babysitting 0 
the inside is really quite nice and very clean 1 
third the cheese on my friends burger was cold 0 
he owns the film just as spacek owned coal miners daughter and quaid owned great balls of fire 1 
none of it works just dont buy it 0 
furthermore you cant even find hours of operation on the website 0 
everything was good and tasty 1 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
there is a totally unnecessary trainroller coaster scene 0 
what the hell kind of crap is that 0 
and if that isnt enough of a mess of a movie for you the picture is also marred with a constant use of studio sets and indoor exteriors 0 
very good stuff for the price 1 
maybe if they werent cold they would have been somewhat edible 0 
with the originality and freshness of the first movie now spent this remake had little else to offer 0 
there is no plot or storyline 0 
dont make the same mistake that i did and please dont buy this phone 0 
i advise everyone do not be fooled 0 
this is a great place to eat 1 
also difficult to put onid recommend avoiding this product 0 
this totally unfunny movie is so over the top and pathetic and unrealistic that throughout the whole 90 minutes of utter torture i probably looked at my watch about 70000 times 0 
other than that the leather is nice and soft the fit is very tight the cut out for the face is a good shape 1 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
his losing his marbles so early in the proceedings is totally implausible and unconvincing 0 
would not reccommend 0 
excellent performance 1 
enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film 1 
very easy to use 1 
i received my orders well within the shipping timeframe everything was in good working order and overall i am very excited to have this source 1 
in a word it is embarrassing 0 
the bipolarity of the ruthless thug one minute a ruthless killer the next minute a luvs diaper commercial is completely unconvincing 0 
its a piece of crap 0 
its really easy 1 
we loved the biscuits 1 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
i checked everywhere and there is no feature for it which is really disappointing 0 
the service was extremely slow 0 
terrible product and waste of money 0 
i really do recommend this place you can go wrong with this donut place 1 
see both films if you can 1 
the characters are fleshed out surprisingly well particularly grimes and blake and all the actors deliver their sharply scripted lines with just the right amount of deadpan tongue in cheek to make the dialogue both hilarious and realistic 1 
good case excellent value 1 
poor quality and service 0 
excellent short film 1 
they keep getting better and better this is my third one and ive had numerous palms too 1 
i have always used corded headsets and the freedom from the wireless is very helpful 1 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
i knew when i saw the film that more great things were to come from this gifted actor 1 
i dont each much pasta but i love the homemade hand made pastas and thin pizzas here 1 
i have been very happy with the 510 and have had no complaints from any one regarding my sound quality on their end 1 
no additional ear gels provided and no instructions whatsoever 0 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
we had a group of 70 when we claimed we would only have 40 and they handled us beautifully 1 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
id love to go back 1 
i could not stand to even watch it for very long for fear of losing iq 0 
im so happy to be here 1 
probably not in a hurry to go back 0 
not tasty and the texture was just nasty 0 
voice recognition is tremendous 1 
i will not return 0 
after 20 minutes wait i got a table 0 
the story is also both funny and poignant at times 1 
dont buy this product 0 
i must say i have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again 1 
but despite these few flaws this case is of exceptional quality and well worth the additional costs of owning an official oem product 1 
otherwise dont even waste your time on this 0 
the phone loads super 1 
but kevin spacey is an excellent verbal tsunami as buddy ackerman  and totally believable because he is a great actor 1 
this movie is a good and humorous comment on life in 2006 1 
this is a good joint 1 
everything was fresh and delicious 1 
my sanyo has survived dozens of drops on blacktop without ill effect 1 
of course the footage from the 70s was grainy but that only enhanced the film 1 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
problem is that the ear loops are made of weak material and break easily 0 
for a product that costs as much as this one does i expect it to work far better and with greater ease than this thing does 0 
design flaw 0 
the calls drop the phone comes on and off at will the screen goes black and the worst of all it stops ringing intermittently 0 
lightweight and works well 1 
avoid this one if you can 0 
interesting decor 1 
i didnt realize how wonderful the short really is until the last two scenes 1 
i am sorry i made this purchase 0 
this blueant supertooth handsfree phone speaker is awesome 1 
i dont think there are any redeeming qualities in this remake 0 
not even a hello we will be right with you 0 
there is so much good food in vegas that i feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to rice and company 0 
wow what a bad film 0 
unfortunately inexperience of direction meant that scene after scene passed with little in the way of dramatic tension or conflict 0 
i highly recommend this modest priced cellular phone 1 
the story line is totally predictable 0 
the result is a powerhouse achievement made more timely now perhaps because of our cultures disturbing fascination with celebrity and its distorted interpretations of fame 1 
stay away from this store be careful 0 
works well 1 
on the negative its insipid enough to cause regret for another 2 hours of life wasted in front of the screen 0 
everything about it is fine and reasonable for the price ie 1 
they were goldencrispy and delicious 1 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
things happen characters personalities change plot twists occur for no real reason other than that script calls for it 0 
everything was good and tasty 1 
good product incredible value 1 
im really disappointed all i have now is a charger that doesnt work 0 
my 810 score is mostly for the plot 1 
youll love how thin it is 1 
do not purchase this phone 0 
people who like european films and art movies will like this movie 1 
service is also cute 1 
not good for the money 0 
not good for the money 0 
great pocket pc phone combination 1 
in a word it is embarrassing 0 
the point is the journey a journey that touches every member of the family 1 
seafood was limited to boiled shrimp and crab legs but the crab legs definitely did not taste fresh 0 
woa talk about awful 0 
the script is a big flawed mess 0 
a world better than 95 of the garbage in the theatres today 1 
plus it was wellpaced and suited its relatively short run time 1 
good food good service 1 
the best phone in market 1 
we wont be going back 0 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
it was equally awful 0 
howeverthe riingtones are not the best and neither are the games 0 
in other words the content level of this film is enough to easily fill a dozen other films 1 
there was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters 0 
i saw this film over christmas and what a great film it was 1 
appetite instantly gone 0 
barney is definitely super de duper 1 
this movie has a cutting edge to it 1 
the characters are interesting and you really care for them 1 
seriously its not worth wasting your or your kids time on 0 
could not get strong enough signal 0 
best of all is the rotating feature very helpful 1 
the only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive 1 
you share general loewenhielms exquisite joy in his partaking of the cailles en sarcophage even though you are just watching a movie but you do wish for just a small sample to savor 1 
the only very disappointing thing was there was no speakerphone 0 
theres really nothing bad i can say about this headset 0 
portable and it works 1 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
it makes very strange ticking noises before it ends the call 0 
there was a warm feeling with the service and i felt like their guest for a special treat 1 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
after 20 minutes wait i got a table 0 
not good for the money 0 
i had a seriously solid breakfast here 1 
shes poised and amazing 1 
go and see it 1 
worked perfectly 1 
i exchanged the sony ericson z500a for this and im pretty happy with that decision 1 
the loudspeaker option is great the bumpers with the lights is very appealing 0 
at no point in the proceedings does it look remotely like america 0 
very good stuff for the price 1 
pretty good beer selection too 1 
i struggle to find anything bad to say about it 1 
kris kristoffersen is good in this movie and really makes a difference 1 
my 5year old nokia 2160 from tracfone holds the charge a lot better than this 0 
it is shameful 0 
i dont think it would hold it too securly on your belt 0 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
owners are really great people 1 
about ten minutes into this film i started having second thoughts 0 
they were excellent 1 
if you have several dozen or several hundred contacts then imagine the fun of sending each of them one by one 0 
i was not happy with this item 0 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
our server was very nice and even though he looked a little overwhelmed with all of our needs he stayed professional and friendly until the end 1 
there is so much good food in vegas that i feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to rice and company 0 
it even has its sweet moments 1 
the only thing really worth watching was the scenery and the house because it is beautiful 1 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
nothing at all to recommend 0 
ps the only scene in the movie that was cool is when the central character finds her room blown up 1 
director paul matthews who also wrotedirected the weak 1995 monster movie grim clearly doesnt know how to pace his films 0 
i waited and waited 0 
john wayne did an incredible job for being so young in the movie industry 1 
on the up side their cafe serves really good food 1 
the only thing i did like was the prime rib and dessert section 1 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
ryans bar is definitely one edinburgh establishment i wont be revisiting 0 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
great charger 1 
now we were chosen to be tortured with this disgusting piece of blatant american propaganda 0 
we watched our waiter pay a lot more attention to other tables and ignore us 0 
highly recommended 1 
the jalapeno bacon is soooo good 1 
my experience was terrible this was my fourth bluetooth headset and while it was much more comfortable than my last jabra which i hated 0 
end of days is one of the worst bigbudget action movies ive ever seen 0 
tried to go here for lunch and it was a madhouse 0 
would not recommend to others 0 
the only thing really worth watching was the scenery and the house because it is beautiful 1 
his losing his marbles so early in the proceedings is totally implausible and unconvincing 0 
does not work for listening to music with the cingular 8125 0 
i would have given no star if i was able 0 
the portion was huge 1 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
the characters are interesting even if a bit predictable 1 
an extensive menu provides lots of options for breakfast 1 
im surprised this is a good quality car charger and theres not much reviews about it 1 
both of them were truly unbelievably good and i am so glad we went back 1 
it finds my cell phone right away when i enter the car 1 
its a gloriously fun fast paced and fairly accurate portrayal of the night of a raver 1 
this place is way too overpriced for mediocre food 0 
bad reception 0 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
i checked everywhere and there is no feature for it which is really disappointing 0 
i ordered albondigas soup which was just warm and tasted like tomato soup with frozen meatballs 0 
warning do not buy 0 
after one bite i was hooked 1 
regrettably the film fails 0 
the scallop dish is quite appalling for value as well 0 
director paul matthews who also wrotedirected the weak 1995 monster movie grim clearly doesnt know how to pace his films 0 
i bought this battery with a coupon from amazon and im very happy with my purchase 1 
i ordered albondigas soup which was just warm and tasted like tomato soup with frozen meatballs 0 
after i pulled up my car i waited for another 15 minutes before being acknowledged 0 
everything was fresh and delicious 1 
all in all ha long bay was a bit of a flop 0 
we also ordered the spinach and avocado salad the ingredients were sad and the dressing literally had zero taste 0 
trying to make a call on these is an exercise in frustration 0 
the cast was great 1 
i love that they put their food in nice plastic containers as opposed to cramming it in little paper takeout boxes 1 
5 stars for the brick oven bread app 1 
very good food great atmosphere1 1 
good show samsung 1 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
no im going to eat the potato that i found some strangers hair in it 0 
and then tragedy struck 0 
i love this cable it allows me to connect any miniusb device to my pc 1 
only had this a month but its worked flawlessly so far 1 
this pair of headphones is the worst that i have ever had soundwise 0 
has been working great 1 
the instructions didnt explain that a microphone jack could be used 0 
host staff were for lack of a better word bitches 0 
i love this phone it is very handy and has a lot of features 1 
the volume switch rocketed out of the unit to a destination unknown 0 
the croutons also taste homemade which is an extra plus 1 
i got the car charger and not even after a week the charger was brokeni went to plug it in and it started smoking 0 
will be back again 1 
john wayne did an incredible job for being so young in the movie industry 1 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
does not fit 0 
this gets a 1 out of 10 simply because theres nothing lower 0 
i heart this place 1 
mic doesnt work 0 
dont waste your time here 0 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
dont waste your time here 0 
hackneyed writing certainly but made even worse by the bad directing 0 
item does not match picture 0 
if you check the directors filmography on this site you will see why this film didnt have a chance 0 
overall i am psyched to have a phone which has all my appointments and contacts in and gets great reception 1 
i did not bother contacting the company for few dollar product but i learned the lesson that i should not have bought this form online anyway 0 
well just if you keep thinking how bad it is 0 
i love this thing 1 
everything about it is just bad 0 
youll love it 1 
the sound quality for the device is unacceptableunless you are in a really quiet area you almost hear nothing 0 
50 down the drain 0 
saw the movie today and thought it was a good effort good messages for kids 1 
steve martin delivers a really funny performance of a middleaged upper class uptight white guy 1 
the seller is very understanding and patient i would definitely buy from them again 1 
theres also enough hypocrisy in this film to make me vomit 0 
customer service was terrible 0 
otherwise easy to install and use clear sound 1 
if you have not seen this movie i definitely recommend it 1 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
the only thing i did like was the prime rib and dessert section 1 
this is an outstanding little restaurant with some of the best food i have ever tasted 1 
nice design and quality 1 
it never condescends all the characters have good genuine hearts and believable problems 1 
very disappointing 0 
the shipping time was also very quick 1 
service sucks 0 
unreliable im giving up 0 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
every thing on phone work perfectly she like it 1 
definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly will return next time im in vegas 1 
i also decided not to send it back because our waitress looked like she was on the verge of having a heart attack 0 
and sometimes it was so embarrassing that i had to look away 0 
favorite place in town for shawarrrrrrma 1 
a good time 1 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
the warm beer didnt help 0 
im very disappointed with my decision 0 
great it was new packaged nice works good no problems and it came in less time then i expected 1 
dont make the same mistake that i did and please dont buy this phone 0 
it quit working after id used it for about 18 months so i just purchased another one because this is the best headset ive ever owned 1 
disappointing experience 0 
not good for the money 0 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
its a feelgood film and thats how i felt when i came out of the cinema 1 
the only thing i did like was the prime rib and dessert section 1 
and the rest of it just sits there being awful with soldiers singing songs about the masculinity they pledge themselves to hairsplitting about purity the admiration of swords etc 0 
lordy the khao soi is a dish that is not to be missed for curry lovers 1 
but i dont like it 0 
i struggle to find anything bad to say about it 1 
i love it 1 
only had this a month but its worked flawlessly so far 1 
good servicecheck 1 
i promise they wont disappoint 1 
the eargels channel the sound directly into your ear and seem to increase the sound volume and clarity 1 
all this movie does is make you sick watching all these slackers make excuses for their stupid actions for 90 minutes 0 
so in a nutshell 1 the restaraunt smells like a combination of a dirty fish market and a sewer 0 
as i said abovepretty useless 0 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
pretty cool i would say 1 
cheap but hey it works was pleasantly suprised given the low cost of this item 1 
dont waste your money 0 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
hot dishes are not hot cold dishes are close to room tempi watched staff prepare food with bare hands no gloveseverything is deep fried in oil 0 
a happy wonderful feel good ending 1 
greatno problems at all 1 
dont buy this product 0 
im a big fan of this series mostly due to anne rices style sensitivities and treatments 1 
for readers who have already seen one of miyazakis films he is still in top form and made another worthwhile experience 1 
the food was terrible 0 
comfortable in my hand 1 
i got home to see the driest damn wings ever 0 
wow very spicy but delicious 1 
the last 15 minutes of movie are also not bad as well 1 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
very slow at seating even with reservation 0 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
itll be a regular stop on my trips to phoenix 1 
this is a great place to eat 1 
in fact im going to round up to 4 stars just because she was so awesome 1 
a usable keyboard actually turns a pda into a realworld useful machine instead of just a neat gadget 1 
i gave it a 10 1 
very convenient since we were staying at the mgm 1 
dont buy it 0 
why are these sad little vegetables so overcooked 0 
simple lightweight and great fit 1 
so in a nutshell 1 the restaraunt smells like a combination of a dirty fish market and a sewer 0 
the budget was evidently very limited 0 
the atmosphere was great with a lovely duo of violinists playing songs we requested 1 
i cannot believe that the actors agreed to do this film 0 
the attractive set used throughout most of the film is an eyepleasing gem 1 
having to humour him just to get by and get through the day was so apt 1 
muddy low quality sound and the casing around the wires insert was poorly super glued and slid off 0 
i liked this movie way too much 1 
battery is terrible 0 
its reception is very very poor 0 
we wont be returning 0 
they could serve it with just the vinaigrette and it may make for a better overall dish but it was still very good 1 
the nokia ca42 usb cable did not work with my phone 0 
in short dont bother with this movie 0 
the best place to go for a tasty bowl of pho 1 
even if you love bad movies do not watch this movie 0 
the sound quality is excellent as well 1 
what on earth is irons doing in this film 0 
the plot such as it is is so derivative and predictable that the ending is like a mercy killing 0 
this film tries to be a serious and sophisticated thrillerhorror flick and it fails miserably 0 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
i kept looking at the time and it had soon become 35 minutes yet still no food 0 
all the pretty pictures in the world cannot make up for a piece of work that is flawed at the core 0 
this game rocks 1 
audio quality is poor very poor 0 
steamboat willie is an amazingly important film to our cinema history 1 
classywarm atmosphere fun and fresh appetizers succulent steaks baseball steak 1 
but even the talented carrell cant save this 0 
reception is terrible and full of static 0 
if this premise sound stupid thats because it is 0 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
itll be a regular stop on my trips to phoenix 1 
the use of slowmotion needlessly repeats itself throughout the movie but is well backed up by bad acting and bad is a kind word here no continuity scenes that are thrown in for no reason whatsoever vehicles that looked like they were made from a corn flakes box and a directorial style that bordered on stupidity 0 
ive had better not only from dedicated boba tea spots but even from jenni pho 0 
the telephone repair man was really funny and his reactions to the nuts and bitchy boss were truly genuine 1 
when i saw it in the theater i thought i was going to be sick 0 
all in all ha long bay was a bit of a flop 0 
my boyfriend and i came here for the first time on a recent trip to vegas and could not have been more pleased with the quality of food and service 1 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
the charger arrived within the promised timeframe but it did not work 0 
these were so good we ordered them twice 1 
that company is a joke 0 
blue ant is easy to use 1 
so in a nutshell 1 the restaraunt smells like a combination of a dirty fish market and a sewer 0 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
very displeased 0 
avoid this one if you can 0 
it quit working after id used it for about 18 months so i just purchased another one because this is the best headset ive ever owned 1 
these products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet 0 
the characters were all funny and had the peculiarity of not having a true lead character 1 
the performances are real and gripping the crocdodile is extremely well done indeed if the black water website is to be believed thats because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous 1 
one of the best mexican movies ever and one of the less understood even by mexican themselves no matter how identified the should have felt with it 1 
great for ipods too 1 
hence the whole story lacks a certain energy 0 
this case seems well made 1 
schrader has made a resume full of lousy amateurish films 0 
it was equally awful 0 
very good lunch spot 1 
every thing on phone work perfectly she like it 1 
if it was to turn my good day feeling into a night of disturbing memories than i guess he succeeded 0 
it deserves strong love 1 
everything about this movie is stupid 0 
very convenient since we were staying at the mgm 1 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
great bluetooth 1 
very disappointed 0 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
he deserves 5 stars 1 
special thanks to dylan t for the recommendation on what to order all yummy for my tummy 1 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
actually the graphics were good at the time 1 
very well made and fits my surefire gx2 perfectly 1 
im super pissd 0 
simply beautiful 1 
nice docking station for home or work 1 
not too screamy not to masculine but just right 1 
obviously they have a terrible customer service so you get what you pay for 0 
you get extra minutes so that you can carry out the call and not get cut off 1 
in the span of an hour i had two people exclaim whoa is that the new phone on tv 1 
excellent 1 
even the squibs look awful 0 
the best place in vegas for breakfast just check out a sat or sun 1 
their menu is diverse and reasonably priced 1 
we loved the biscuits 1 
ordered a double cheeseburger got a single patty that was falling apart picture uploaded yeah still sucks 0 
i always order from the vegetarian menu during dinner which has a wide array of options to choose from 1 
i mean really how do you get so famous for your fish and chips when its so terrible 0 
great choice 1 
their research and development division obviously knows what theyre doing 1 
at around 4 pm i bought it at around 8pm i started to watch at around 815pm i fast forwarded the remaining film to see if there was anything left watchable for a human being with a brain but there wasnt 0 
i purcashed this for the car charger and it does not work 0 
we ordered some old classics and some new dishes after going there a few times and were sorely disappointed with everything 0 
this place is way too overpriced for mediocre food 0 
generous portions and great taste 1 
this place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver 0 
i use this product in a motor control center where there is a lot of high voltage humming from the equipment and it works great 1 
i have had problems wit hit dropping signal and more 0 
i got the car charger and not even after a week the charger was brokeni went to plug it in and it started smoking 0 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
if you have several dozen or several hundred contacts then imagine the fun of sending each of them one by one 0 
simple lightweight and great fit 1 
defective crap 0 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
fantastic food 1 
everything was perfect the night we were in 1 
rude inconsiderate management 0 
the movie is littered with overt racial slurs towards the black cast members and in return the whites are depicted as morons and boobs 0 
there was a warm feeling with the service and i felt like their guest for a special treat 1 
also great directing and photography 1 
ive had better not only from dedicated boba tea spots but even from jenni pho 0 
disappointing 0 
i gave it 5 stars then and im giving it 5 stars now 1 
punishment park is a brilliant piece of cinema 1 
it quit working after id used it for about 18 months so i just purchased another one because this is the best headset ive ever owned 1 
the phone is sturdy and waterproof 1 
the range is very decent ive been able to roam around my house with the phone in the living room with no receptionsound quality issues 1 
the bipolarity of the ruthless thug one minute a ruthless killer the next minute a luvs diaper commercial is completely unconvincing 0 
despite how hard i rate businesses its actually rare for me to give a 1 star 0 
the selection was probably the worst ive seen in vegasthere was none 0 
but kevin spacey is an excellent verbal tsunami as buddy ackerman  and totally believable because he is a great actor 1 
but in terms of the writing its very fresh and bold 1 
the food was terrible 0 
its really easy 1 
full of unconvincing cardboard characters it is blandly written by edward chodorov who also produced and is surprisingly directed by jean negulesco from whom one would expect a great deal more 0 
the place was fairly clean but the food simply wasnt worth it 0 
i have had this phone for over a year now and i will tell you its not that great 0 
the only thing i did like was the prime rib and dessert section 1 
its a fresh subtle and rather sublime effect 1 
the refried beans that came with my meal were dried out and crusty and the food was bland 0 
their daily specials are always a hit with my group 1 
it has everything i need and i couldnt ask for more 1 
appetite instantly gone 0 
stopped by during the late may bank holiday off rick steve recommendation and loved it 1 
not impressed 0 
on the negative its insipid enough to cause regret for another 2 hours of life wasted in front of the screen 0 
very slow at seating even with reservation 0 
how can you call yourself a steakhouse if you cant properly cook a steak i dont understand 0 
dont waste your money 0 
this is a great restaurant at the mandalay bay 1 
furthermore you cant even find hours of operation on the website 0 
very disappointed 0 
the burger is good beef cooked just right 1 
i was shocked because no signs indicate cash only 0 
my sanyo has survived dozens of drops on blacktop without ill effect 1 
waiter was a jerk 0 
the jamaican mojitos are delicious 1 
ive had this bluetoooth headset for some time now and still not comfortable with the way it fits on the ear 0 
lousy product 0 
i am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this 1 
will not be back 0 
disappointing experience 0 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
there is nothing authentic about this place 0 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
which is precisely why i am giving it such a bad review 0 
what this film lacks is a convincing script 0 
this convention never worked well in the past and certainly doesnt work here 0 
the point is the journey a journey that touches every member of the family 1 
i can take a little bad service but the food sucks 0 
the cashier had no care what so ever on what i had to say it still ended up being wayyy overpriced 0 
nargile i think you are great 1 
they have horrible attitudes towards customers and talk down to each one when customers dont enjoy their food 0 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
ive never been treated so bad 0 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
the plot well i said id let that one go 0 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
this place lacked style 0 
the macarons here are insanely good 1 
tried to go here for lunch and it was a madhouse 0 
his losing his marbles so early in the proceedings is totally implausible and unconvincing 0 
earbud piece breaks easily 0 
terrible management 0 
after the disappointing dinner we went elsewhere for dessert 0 
never again will i be dining at this place 0 
as many people complained i found this headsets microphone was very weak 0 
it was so bad i had lost the heart to finish it 0 
my rating just 3 out of 10 0 
there is nothing authentic about this place 0 
the opening sequence of this gem is a classic and the cat n mouse games that follow are a delight to watch 1 
not too screamy not to masculine but just right 1 
the phone takes forever to charge like 2 to 5 hours literally 0 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
today was my first taste of a buldogis gourmet hot dog and i have to tell you it was more than i ever thought possible 1 
the fries were not hot and neither was my burger 0 
waaaaaayyyyyyyyyy over rated is all i am saying 0 
not sure who was more lost the flat characters or the audience nearly half of whom walked out 0 
the feel of the dining room was more college cooking course than high class dining and the service was slow at best 0 
it crackles with an unpredictable youthful energy but honestly i found it hard to follow and concentrate on it meanders so badly 0 
the story line is totally predictable 0 
this is a great place to eat 1 
the service was poor and thats being nice 0 
i have yet to run this new battery below two bars and thats three days without charging 1 
it is not good 0 
i immediately said i wanted to talk to the manager but i did not want to talk to the guy who was doing shots of fireball behind the bar 0 
the food wasnt good 0 
the chains which im no fan of beat this place easily 0 
if you have not seen this movie i definitely recommend it 1 
i found this place by accident and i could not be happier 1 
howeverthe riingtones are not the best and neither are the games 0 
i will never go back to this place and will never ever recommended this place to anyone 0 
the descriptions said yum yum sauce and another said eel sauce yet another said spicy mayowell none of the rolls had sauces on them 0 
if only someone involved with it knew how to string together narrative 0 
we waited an hour for what was a breakfast i could have done 100 times better at home 0 
trying to make a call on these is an exercise in frustration 0 
this place is pretty good nice little vibe in the restaurant 1 
i didnt want the clip going over the top of my ear causing discomfort 0 
i love being able to use one headset for both by landline and cell 1 
this place is pretty good nice little vibe in the restaurant 1 
it is an excellent drama an excellent thriller and an excellent film 1 
this is one of peter watkins most accessible films 1 
what a waste 0 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
it kept getting worse and worse so now im officially done 0 
also its slim enough to fit into my alarm clock docking station without removing the case 1 
the plot doesnt hang together at all and the acting is absolutely appalling 0 
all in all a great disappointment 0 
i checked everywhere and there is no feature for it which is really disappointing 0 
eew this location needs a complete overhaul 0 
this movie is a good and humorous comment on life in 2006 1 
very well made and fits my surefire gx2 perfectly 1 
im trying to return it for a refund 0 
we recently witnessed her poor quality of management towards other guests as well 0 
from what my dinner companions told meeverything was very fresh with nice texture and taste 1 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
they have a really nice atmosphere 1 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
i dont understand how this garbage got on the shelves of the movie store its not even a real movie 0 
it worked very well 1 
how can anyone in their right mind ask for anything more from a movie than this 1 
dont waste your money 0 
the food is not tasty at all not to say its real traditional hunan style 0 
this place is disgusting 0 
overall i rate this movie a 10 out of a 110 scale 1 
this allows the possibility of double booking for the same date and time after the first 0 
the speaker is of low quality so as making the ring tones sound very cheap 0 
often the dialogue doesnt really follow from one line to another or fit the surroundings 0 
dont go here 0 
for readers who have already seen one of miyazakis films he is still in top form and made another worthwhile experience 1 
what a waste 0 
oh the charger seems to work fine 1 
i definitly recommend 1 
not worth it 0 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
i own a jabra earset and was very happy with it but the sound quality especially outgoing on this is better 1 
its a fresh subtle and rather sublime effect 1 
best tater tots in the southwest 1 
works great when my cat attacked the phone he scratched the protective strip instead of destroying the screen 1 
this is an unbelievable bargain 1 
feelings thoughtsgabriels discomfort during the danceall these intangibles leap to life and come within the viewers grasp in hustons portrayal 1 
a piece of junk that broke after being on my phone for 2 days 0 
do not buy for d807wrongly advertised for d807 0 
best of all is the rotating feature very helpful 1 
although i very much liked the look and sound of this place the actual experience was a bit disappointing 0 
also if your phone is dropped this case is not going to save it specially when dropped face down 0 
great pocket pc phone combination 1 
what a waste 0 
everything was perfect the night we were in 1 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
a greasy unhealthy meal 0 
the jamaican mojitos are delicious 1 
we would recommend these to others 1 
in summary this was a largely disappointing dining experience 0 
our server was super nice and checked on us many times 1 
then our food came out disappointment ensued 0 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
has been working great 1 
if you look for authentic thai food go else where 0 
the awful dialogue and hopeless overacting by everyone who gets shot top off a real waste of space and time 0 
some great music and terrific scenery 1 
when it opens the battery connection is broken and the device is turned off 0 
product is useless since it does not have enough charging current to charge the 2 cellphones i was planning to use it with 0 
host staff were for lack of a better word bitches 0 
this frog phone charm is adorable and very eye catching 1 
a good commentary of todays love and undoubtedly a film worth seeing 1 
i might have gotten a defect but i would not risk buying it again because of the built quality alone 0 
actually the graphics were good at the time 1 
this film tries to be a serious and sophisticated thrillerhorror flick and it fails miserably 0 
its been my choice headset for yearsgreat sound good volume good noise cancellation 1 
its too bad that everyone else involved didnt share crowes level of dedication to quality for if they did wed have a far better film on our hands than this subpar mess 0 
then i had to continue pairing it periodically since it somehow kept dropping 0 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
they never brought a salad we asked for 0 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
i ordered the voodoo pasta and it was the first time id had really excellent pasta since going gluten free several years ago 1 
its really easy 1 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
as for the killer dont expect anything original or even remotely frightening 0 
its the best headset i have used 1 
he is one of my favourite directors and one of the most talented directors in the history of cinema 1 
dont make the same mistake i did 0 
a usable keyboard actually turns a pda into a realworld useful machine instead of just a neat gadget 1 
howeverthe riingtones are not the best and neither are the games 0 
sucked most of the stuff does not work with my phone 0 
also notable is john baileys fine crisp beautifully colored cinematography and the great production design costumes by eiko ishioka who went on to do the memorable costumes for coppolas dracula for which she received a well deserved oscar 1 
perhaps my phone is defective but people cannot hear me when i use this 0 
nice docking station for home or work 1 
do not waste your time 0 
awful 0 
best headset ever 1 
this is so embarassing and also my ears hurt if i try to push the ear plug into my ear 0 
this item is great installed it let it charged up overnite and it has been working good every since with no problems 1 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
the cast is always entertaining as usual 1 
will never ever go back and have told many people what had happened 0 
this phone works great 1 
the only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive 1 
i had a seriously solid breakfast here 1 
we wont be going back anytime soon 0 
i live in the neighborhood so i am disappointed i wont be back here because it is a convenient location 0 
they will customize your order any way youd like my usual is eggplant with green bean stir fry love it 1 
yes this film does require a rather significant amount of puzzlesolving but the pieces fit together to create a beautiful picture 1 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
dont waste your money 0 
john garfield ann revere lilli plmer william conrad canada leeand filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screenjames wong howe 1 
still i do like this movie for its empowerment of women theres not enough movies out there like this one 1 
the characters are interesting even if a bit predictable 1 
works good 1 
i had a pretty satifying experience 1 
the movie is littered with overt racial slurs towards the black cast members and in return the whites are depicted as morons and boobs 0 
i was so insulted 0 
this place is handsdown one of the best places to eat in the phoenix metro area 1 
friends pasta also bad he barely touched it 0 
the servers are not pleasant to deal with and they dont always honor pizza hut coupons 0 
love it great armband 1 
weve have gotten a much better service from the pizza place next door than the services we received from this restaurant 0 
just dont know why they were so slow 0 
the film has an ultracheap look to it 0 
a standout scene 1 
if you want a real scare rent this one 1 
what makes this story different are the terrific production values faultless photography composition and editing the terrific casting the underappreciated brian keith playing a bully teddy and vivid history 1 
but what really made it unwatchable was the direction 0 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
aside from its terrible lead this film has loads of other debits 0 
the story line is totally predictable 0 
good product good seller 1 
the price is reasonable and the service is great 1 
nice spicy and tender 1 
worst customer service ever 0 
the refried beans that came with my meal were dried out and crusty and the food was bland 0 
regrettably the film fails 0 
and those baby owls were adorable 1 
im so sorry but i really cant recommend it to anyone 0 
the steaks are all well trimmed and also perfectly cooked 1 
ample portions and good prices 1 
but other than that the movie seemed to drag and the heroes didnt really work for their freedom 0 
overall i am psyched to have a phone which has all my appointments and contacts in and gets great reception 1 
cinematography the film was shot in an interesting way 1 
there are the usual hitchcock logic flaws 0 
service is friendly and inviting 1 
but kevin spacey is an excellent verbal tsunami as buddy ackerman  and totally believable because he is a great actor 1 
the vegetables are so fresh and the sauce feels like authentic thai 1 
comfort for our whole family 1 
when a song could explain the emotions of the subjects better such as when jay adams unfortunate life was a subject of talk the song old man by neil young was played which evokes many emotions 1 
considering the relations off screen between taylor and stanwyck it was surprising how little chemistry there was on screen between the two of them 0 
i own 2 of these cases and would order another 1 
the loudspeaker option is great the bumpers with the lights is very appealing 0 
i own a jabra earset and was very happy with it but the sound quality especially outgoing on this is better 1 
i thoroughly enjoyed it when christopher eccleston took control of the tardis and the continuation of the series 1 
this movie suffered because of the writing it needed more suspense 0 
the shower area is outside so you can only rinse not take a full shower unless you dont mind being nude for everyone to see 0 
worked perfectly 1 
the first time i ever came here i had an amazing experience i still tell people how awesome the duck was 1 
piece of trash 0 
iam very pleased with my purchase 1 
she carries the movie well 1 
treo and tmobile refused to replace it again and forced me to buy another phone without any kind of upgrade discount 0 
however i recently watched the whole thing again on dvd and i was completely struck by how extremely stupid the storyline was how it contained holes inconsistencies and frankly a whole lot of crap and how horrid the dancing was 0 
i recently had problems where i could not stay connected for more than 10 minutes before being disconnected 0 
fantastic service here 1 
nicest chinese restaurant ive been in a while 1 
hes a national treasure 1 
its fits like a glove and is strong secure and durable 1 
i believe that pitch black was done well 1 
great atmosphere friendly and fast service 1 
after charging overnight these batteries work great 1 
easily none other cartoon made me laugh in a tender way before getting into dark sitcoms oriented for teenagers 1 
great phone 1 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
my rating just 3 out of 10 0 
im using it with an iriver spinn with case and it fits fine 1 
i only hear garbage for audio 0 
very disappointed in accessoryone 0 
on three different occasions i asked for well done or medium well and all three times i got the bloodiest piece of meat on my plate 0 
do not waste your money here 0 
classywarm atmosphere fun and fresh appetizers succulent steaks baseball steak 1 
nothing new there 0 
the telephone repair man was really funny and his reactions to the nuts and bitchy boss were truly genuine 1 
i particularly remember my senses being assaulted by strident cords of music that would blare out with very little warning and even less meaning 0 
cute quaint simple honest 1 
the awful dialogue and hopeless overacting by everyone who gets shot top off a real waste of space and time 0 
the tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu 0 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
what did bother me was the slow service 0 
in my house i was getting dropped coverage upstairs and no coverage in my basement 0 
i bought two of them and neither will charge 0 
very convenient since we were staying at the mgm 1 
the noise shield is incrediable 1 
service was exceptional and food was a good as all the reviews 1 
the feel of the dining room was more college cooking course than high class dining and the service was slow at best 0 
it was not good 0 
paolo sorrentino has written a wonderful story about loneliness and tony has built one of the most unforgettable characters seen in movies in recent years 1 
the headsets are easy to use and everyone loves them 1 
i cannot make calls at certain places 0 
im so happy to be here 1 
barney is definitely super de duper 1 
hard to judge whether these sides were good because we were grossed out by the melted styrofoam and didnt want to eat it for fear of getting sick 0 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
there was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth but it didnt really work into the rest of the plot 0 
the use of slowmotion needlessly repeats itself throughout the movie but is well backed up by bad acting and bad is a kind word here no continuity scenes that are thrown in for no reason whatsoever vehicles that looked like they were made from a corn flakes box and a directorial style that bordered on stupidity 0 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
by the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant i was bored and didnt care what happened next and so i switched off 0 
i was very excited to get this headset because i thought it was really cute 1 
they work about 2 weeks then break 0 
this is so embarassing and also my ears hurt if i try to push the ear plug into my ear 0 
this is actually a very smart movie 1 
all in all im quite satisfied with this purchase 1 
also were served hot bread and butter and home made potato chips with bacon bits on topvery original and very good 1 
it is a really good show to watch 1 
everything was good and tasty 1 
cooked to perfection and the service was impeccable 1 
the malta settings are as dry and as barren as the dialogue 0 
i liked it 1 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
i believe every one should see this movie as i think few people outside of south africa understand its past and what is being attempted in the truth and reconciliation process 1 
definitely a turn off for me i doubt ill be back unless someone else is buying 0 
also notable is john baileys fine crisp beautifully colored cinematography and the great production design costumes by eiko ishioka who went on to do the memorable costumes for coppolas dracula for which she received a well deserved oscar 1 
this really is how vegas fine dining used to be right down to the menus handed to the ladies that have no prices listed 1 
its like a bad two hour tv movie 0 
plus its only 8 bucks 1 
not even good for camp value 0 
saw the movie today and thought it was a good effort good messages for kids 1 
it doesnt work in europe or asia 0 
the acting is fantastic the stories are seamlessly woven together and the dogs are splendid a must rent view or see 1 
the range is very decent ive been able to roam around my house with the phone in the living room with no receptionsound quality issues 1 
this place is overpriced not consistent with their boba and it really is overpriced 0 
dont waste your on this one 0 
the point is the journey a journey that touches every member of the family 1 
these are fabulous 1 
also if your phone is dropped this case is not going to save it specially when dropped face down 0 
iam very pleased with my purchase 1 
i wish i could enter negative values admins 0 
i did not have any problem with this item and would order it again if needed 1 
perhaps i caught them on an off night judging by the other reviews but im not inspired to go back 0 
the lead man is charismafree 0 
exactly what i wanted 1 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
the reception is excellent 1 
this scene is very strong and unpleasant 0 
my boyfriend and i sat at the bar and had a completely delightful experience 1 
their daily specials are always a hit with my group 1 
service is friendly and inviting 1 
reaching for the bottom row is uncomfortable and the send and end keys are not where i expect them to be3 0 
im still infatuated with this phone 1 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
we have gotten a lot of compliments on it 1 
ill even say it again  this is torture 0 
it has everything i need and i couldnt ask for more 1 
you learn a lot about the real inside emotions of people in this movie and a lot about the movie business itself 1 
but if you liked movies like the matrix and better yet their sequels i think youll appreciate the thought provoking mindblowing experience this film will give you 1 
doesnt hold charge 0 
i was disgusted because i was pretty sure that was human hair 0 
no ear loop needed its tiny and the sound is great 1 
the headset fulfills my requirements so i am happy with my purchase 1 
audio quality is poor very poor 0 
you learn a lot about the real inside emotions of people in this movie and a lot about the movie business itself 1 
you need two hands to operate the screenthis software interface is decade old and cannot compete with new software designs 0 
im so happy to be here 1 
it was just not a fun experience 1 
omelets are to die for 1 
i have read others reviews here but i havent had any problem with it 1 
the instructions didnt explain that a microphone jack could be used 0 
product is useless since it does not have enough charging current to charge the 2 cellphones i was planning to use it with 0 
20th century foxs road house 1948 is not only quite a silly noir but is an implausible unmitigated bore of a movie 0 
it is the best charger i have seen on the market yet 1 
the price is reasonable and the service is great 1 
the acting was bad 0 
i will come back here every time im in vegas 1 
i highly recommend this case 1 
this movie was kind of long in length but i enjoyed every minute of it 1 
what a great double cheeseburger 1 
if that bug never showed up i would have given a 4 for sure but on the other side of the wall where this bug was climbing was the kitchen 0 
wont ever go here again 0 
i liked this movie way too much 1 
i have tried these cables with my computer and my ipod and it works just fine 1 
brilliant 1 
they have horrible attitudes towards customers and talk down to each one when customers dont enjoy their food 0 
it doesnt work in europe or asia 0 
great phone 1 
absolutely great 1 
i would highly recommend this 1 
i probably would not go here again 0 
good product good seller 1 
very bad performance plays angela bennett a computer expert who is at home all the time 0 
overall i like there food and the service 1 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
the acting helps the writing along very well maybe the idiotsavant sister could have been played better and it is a real joy to watch 1 
all of the main players are mesmerising 1 
i received my orders well within the shipping timeframe everything was in good working order and overall i am very excited to have this source 1 
this is a masterful piece of filmmaking with many themes simmering and occasionally boiling over in this warts and all study of the poets bohemian selfindulgent wartime years that span the aerial bombardments of london and the outward tranquillity of a welsh coastal retreat the borderlines between friendship lust and love dedication to art and experience versus practical concerns jealousy rivalry cowardice and egotism versus heroism and selfsacrifice and more 1 
and the accents are absolutely abysmal 0 
this is essentially a communications tool that does not communicate 0 
the owner used to work at nobu so this place is really similar for half the price 1 
lousy product 0 
we waited for forty five minutes in vain 0 
lets start with all the problemsthe acting especially from the lead professor was very very bad 0 
this game rocks 1 
what should have been a hilarious yummy christmas eve dinner to remember was the biggest fail of the entire trip for us 0 
we sat another ten minutes and finally gave up and left 0 
it was way over fried 0 
the cashew cream sauce was bland and the vegetables were undercooked 0 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
furthermore you cant even find hours of operation on the website 0 
the goat taco didnt skimp on the meat and wow what flavor 1 
any grandmother can make a roasted chicken better than this one 0 
i like design and look of jabra behing the ear headsets and 5020 is pretty comfortible to wear 24 hours a day without pain in the ear 1 
this is a very average phone with bad battery life that operates on a weak network 0 
omit watching this 0 
drinks took close to 30 minutes to come out at one point 0 
the handsfree part works fine but then the car tries to download the address book and the treo rebootsoverall i still rate this device high 1 
makes it easier to keep up with my bluetooth when im not wearing it 0 
this blueant supertooth handsfree phone speaker is awesome 1 
the earpiece on this is too large or too heavyit keeps falling out of my ear 0 
last night was my second time dining here and i was so happy i decided to go back 1 
the acting as youd expect from this cast is top notch 1 
the menu had so much good stuff on it i could not decide 1 
the accompanied software is almost brilliant 1 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
disappointing 0 
the service was not up to par either 0 
i really like this product over the motorola because it is allot clearer on the ear piece and the mic 1 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
who in their right mind is gonna buy this battery 0 
i gave it a 10 1 
works as described 1 
we walked away stuffed and happy about our first vegas buffet experience 1 
a lot of websites have been rating this a very good phone and so do i 1 
this movie is greatespecially if you enjoy visual arts 1 
then the film just dropped the ball 0 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
go and see it 1 
ive missed numerous calls because of this reason 0 
i really like this product over the motorola because it is allot clearer on the ear piece and the mic 1 
however after about a year the fliptop started to get loose and wobbly and eventually my screen went black and i couldnt receive and place calls 0 
110 and only because there is no setting for 010 0 
i had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get some relief 0 
really pleased with this product so far 1 
im in az all the time and now have my new spot 1 
it looks very nice 1 
i bought this phone as a replacement for my startac and have regretted it since 0 
doesnt last long 0 
i ordered the voodoo pasta and it was the first time id had really excellent pasta since going gluten free several years ago 1 
bad reception 0 
what a waste of money and time 0 
it worked very well 1 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
i hate to disagree with my fellow yelpers but my husband and i were so disappointed with this place 0 
i even dropped this phone into a stream and it was submerged for 15 seconds and it still works great 1 
im big fan of rpg games too but this movie its a disgrace to any selfrespecting rpger there is 0 
i was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar not only because the quality is great but the service is fast and the food impeccable 1 
love this phone 1 
the food was great as always compliments to the chef 1 
i found this place by accident and i could not be happier 1 
everything captain howdy says is either laughable or just plain stupid 0 
so there is no way for me to plug it in here in the us unless i go by a converter 0 
im using it with an iriver spinn with case and it fits fine 1 
those burgers were amazing 1 
the movie was so boring that i sometimes found myself occupied peaking in the paper instead of watching never happened during a columbo movie before 0 
this is truly an art movieit actually has a lot of art in it 1 
the memories are murky but i can only say that i enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show 1 
this is was due to the fact that it took 20 minutes to be acknowledged then another 35 minutes to get our foodand they kept forgetting things 0 
it was awesome 1 
i was particularly pleased with the acting ability of dwight schultz 1 
it dit not work most of the time with my nokia 5320 0 
this place was such a nice surprise 1 
i was left shattered from the experience of watching this film and i took a good two hours to fully recover 0 
items stated as included from the description are not included 0 
all in all its an insult to ones intelligence and a huge waste of money 0 
i cannot believe that the actors agreed to do this film 0 
this is hands down the best phone ive ever had 1 
on the negative its insipid enough to cause regret for another 2 hours of life wasted in front of the screen 0 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
for a product that costs as much as this one does i expect it to work far better and with greater ease than this thing does 0 
excellent sound battery life and inconspicuous to boot 1 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
low quality 0 
a cheap and cheerless heist movie with poor characterisation lots of underbite style stoic emoting think chow yun fat in a better tomorrow and some cheesy clichés thrown into an abandoned factory ready for a few poorly executed flying judo rolls a la john woo 0 
its a great item 1 
i would have casted her in that role after ready the script 1 
2 thumbs up to this seller 1 
both rickman and stowe play their roles to the hilt in this tale of a childrens book writer who maybe has written a subversive tract 1 
by the time the film ended i not only disliked it i despised it 0 
people who like european films and art movies will like this movie 1 
actually the graphics were good at the time 1 
the story is lame not interesting and never really explains the sinister origins of the puppets 0 
bad purchase 0 
buyerbe very careful 0 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
the plug did not work very well 0 
not good for the money 0 
this is one of the best movies out there that shows such strong sibling bond for each other 1 
go rent it 1 
the battery is working well as a replacement for the original that came with the phone over 2 years ago 1 
its reception is very very poor 0 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
itll be a regular stop on my trips to phoenix 1 
after my phone got to be about a year old its been slowly breaking despite much care on my part 0 
really bad 0 
not to mention the combination of pears almonds and bacon is a big winner 1 
the worst one of the series 0 
waiter was a jerk 0 
excellent short film 1 
this movie is a good and humorous comment on life in 2006 1 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
the design is very odd as the ear clip is not very comfortable at all 0 
the decor is nice and the piano music soundtrack is pleasant 1 
this device is great in several situations1 1 
this is actually a very smart movie 1 
i would recommend purchasing the jabra jx10 series 2 which works flawlessly with my moto q go figure 1 
this movie is a good and humorous comment on life in 2006 1 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
this is was due to the fact that it took 20 minutes to be acknowledged then another 35 minutes to get our foodand they kept forgetting things 0 
feelings thoughtsgabriels discomfort during the danceall these intangibles leap to life and come within the viewers grasp in hustons portrayal 1 
echo problemvery unsatisfactory 0 
service is perfect and the family atmosphere is nice to see 1 
clear skype calls long battery life long range 1 
it plays louder than any other speaker of this size the price is so low that most would think the quality is lacking however its not 1 
shes poised and amazing 1 
the plug did not work very well 0 
awesome device 1 
it failed to convey the broad sweep of landscapes that were a great part of the original 0 
love the margaritas too 1 
dont buy this product 0 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
this phone is pretty sturdy and ive never had any large problems with it 1 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
the only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port irda 0 
did not like at all 0 
dessert panna cotta was amazing 1 
the movie seemed a little slow at first 0 
superb phone on a great network 1 
no im going to eat the potato that i found some strangers hair in it 0 
plus its only 8 bucks 1 
the food was outstanding and the prices were very reasonable 1 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
makes it easier to keep up with my bluetooth when im not wearing it 0 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
also were served hot bread and butter and home made potato chips with bacon bits on topvery original and very good 1 
it is an excellent drama an excellent thriller and an excellent film 1 
this case seems well made 1 
excellent cast story line performances 1 
we will not be coming back 0 
great earpiece 1 
disappointed 0 
it was just not a fun experience 1 
poor voice clarity 0 
couldnt use the unit with sunglasses not good in texas 0 
now imagine that every single one of those decisions was made wrong 0 
john garfield ann revere lilli plmer william conrad canada leeand filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screenjames wong howe 1 
i love the scream movies and all horror movies and this one ranks way up there 1 
trying to make a call on these is an exercise in frustration 0 
nice ambiance 1 
recommend with confidence 1 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
very convenient since we were staying at the mgm 1 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
worthless product 0 
i was shocked because no signs indicate cash only 0 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
the menu is always changing food quality is going down service is extremely slow 0 
the block was amazing 1 
works as described 1 
it really is impressive that the place hasnt closed down 0 
i let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this bad idea we both hated it 0 
i was hoping for more 0 
i wasnt really impressed with strip steak 0 
my brother in law who works at the mall ate here same day and guess what he was sick all night too 0 
and finally after all that we get to an ending that wouldve been great had it been handled by competent people and not jerry falwell 0 
this movie creates its own universe and is fascinating in every way 1 
this is a masterful piece of filmmaking with many themes simmering and occasionally boiling over in this warts and all study of the poets bohemian selfindulgent wartime years that span the aerial bombardments of london and the outward tranquillity of a welsh coastal retreat the borderlines between friendship lust and love dedication to art and experience versus practical concerns jealousy rivalry cowardice and egotism versus heroism and selfsacrifice and more 1 
a good commentary of todays love and undoubtedly a film worth seeing 1 
i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
if you check the directors filmography on this site you will see why this film didnt have a chance 0 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
another thing i didnt really like is when a character got punched in the face a gallon of blood would spew forth soon after 0 
he is one of my favourite directors and one of the most talented directors in the history of cinema 1 
it was a very superficial movie and it gave me the feeling that i was watching play rather than a film 0 
the turkey and roast beef were bland 0 
so far so good 1 
both of them were truly unbelievably good and i am so glad we went back 1 
even worse than ticker 0 
aside from its terrible lead this film has loads of other debits 0 
motorola finally got the voice quality of a bluetooth headset right 1 
even in my bmw 3 series which is fairly quiet i have trouble hearing what the other person is saying 0 
youll love it 1 
this place is awesome if you want something light and healthy during the summer 1 
the sangria was about half of a glass wine full and was 12 ridiculous 0 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
the acting is terrible and the writing is worse 0 
its one of the movies i need to see whenever it comes on tvnever mind the fact that i already have it memorized 1 
i searched the internet and found this one to be the best value 1 
the goat taco didnt skimp on the meat and wow what flavor 1 
what a disappointment 0 
poor quality and service 0 
this movie was kind of long in length but i enjoyed every minute of it 1 
ordered burger rare came in well done 0 
the kids are annoying 0 
poor quality 0 
not a good bargain 0 
who in their right mind is gonna buy this battery 0 
terrible service 0 
the chicken dishes are ok the beef is like shoe leather 0 
definitely worth checking out 1 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
it is perfect for a sitdown family meal or get together with a few friends 1 
not much flavor to them and very poorly constructed 0 
we asked for the bill to leave without eating and they didnt bring that either 0 
the chicken i got was definitely reheated and was only ok the wedges were cold and soggy 0 
but in terms of the writing its very fresh and bold 1 
i especially love the long battery life 1 
the sangria was about half of a glass wine full and was 12 ridiculous 0 
it was quite comfortable in the ear 1 
it was not good 0 
sauce was tasteless 0 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
the story is lame not interesting and never really explains the sinister origins of the puppets 0 
i really liked that 1 
it is unusable in a moving car at freeway speed 0 
the warmth it generates is in contrast to its austere backdrop 1 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
the acting as youd expect from this cast is top notch 1 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
i would recommend this 1 
to summarize the food was incredible nay transcendant but nothing brings me joy quite like the memory of the pneumatic condiment dispenser 1 
all i can do is whine on the internet so here it goesthe more i use the thing the less i like it 0 
i have purchased these for both family and friends and all enjoy their clarity and ease of use 1 
why are these sad little vegetables so overcooked 0 
the story starts too fast with absolutely no suspense or buildup in the slightest 0 
tonight i had the elk filet specialand it sucked 0 
voice recognition is tremendous 1 
will order from them again 1 
hot dishes are not hot cold dishes are close to room tempi watched staff prepare food with bare hands no gloveseverything is deep fried in oil 0 
at least think to refill my water before i struggle to wave you over for 10 minutes 0 
enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film 1 
hard to judge whether these sides were good because we were grossed out by the melted styrofoam and didnt want to eat it for fear of getting sick 0 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
his costars dont fare much better with people like morgan freeman jonah hill and ed helms just wasted 0 
see it 1 
if you love authentic mexican food and want a whole bunch of interesting yet delicious meats to choose from you need to try this place 1 
but despite these few flaws this case is of exceptional quality and well worth the additional costs of owning an official oem product 1 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
worst customer service ever 0 
its welldesigned and very sharp the blue is a very nice color 1 
i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
the design might be ergonomic in theory but i could not stand having these in my ear 0 
everything about it is fine and reasonable for the price ie 1 
i love this place 1 
does not work 0 
at a time when it seems that film animation has been dominated by disneypixars cgi masterpieces it is both refreshing and comforting to know that miyazaki is still relying on traditional handdrawn animation to tell his charming and enchanting stories 1 
service was very prompt 1 
i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
it isnt even an achievement as a sobaditsgood or sobaditsmemorable movie 0 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
unfortunately it did not work 0 
furthermore you cant even find hours of operation on the website 0 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
just what i wanted 1 
great pocket pc phone combination 1 
during several different 2 minute calls i experienced 5 drops and it was in an area that had 5 bars 0 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
they work about 2 weeks then break 0 
the charger arrived within the promised timeframe but it did not work 0 
comfortable fit you need your headset to be comfortable for at least an hour at a time if not for an entire day 1 
love this place hits the spot when i want something healthy but not lacking in quantity or flavor 1 
everything about it is fine and reasonable for the price ie 1 
do not purchase this phone 0 
i have been to very few places to eat that under no circumstances would i ever return to and this tops the list 0 
its just adorable seeing mickey playing turkey in the straw in a highly imaginative if occasionally cruel way 1 
so far so good 1 
save your money ive had this item for 11 months now 0 
the food was terrible 0 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
they have a really nice atmosphere 1 
car charger as well as ac charger are included to make sure you never run out of juicehighy recommended 1 
the characters are fleshed out surprisingly well particularly grimes and blake and all the actors deliver their sharply scripted lines with just the right amount of deadpan tongue in cheek to make the dialogue both hilarious and realistic 1 
this is some seriously good pizza and im an expertconnisseur on the topic 1 
i would avoid this place if you are staying in the mirage 0 
worst thai ever 0 
freezes frequently4 0 
by far the best cheesecurds we have ever had 1 
id rather eat airline food seriously 0 
first time there and might just be the last 0 
the fact is this film is a wonderful heartwarming tale about two people chasing their dreams 1 
i came back today since they relocated and still not impressed 0 
every thing on phone work perfectly she like it 1 
couldnt figure it out 0 
we walked away stuffed and happy about our first vegas buffet experience 1 
earbud piece breaks easily 0 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
its too bad the food is so damn generic 0 
furthermore you cant even find hours of operation on the website 0 
furthermore you cant even find hours of operation on the website 0 
battery has no life 0 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
i love this place 1 
this place lacked style 0 
never going back 0 
easily none other cartoon made me laugh in a tender way before getting into dark sitcoms oriented for teenagers 1 
i hate to disagree with my fellow yelpers but my husband and i were so disappointed with this place 0 
so dont go there if you are looking for good food 0 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
the writers were smack on and i think the best actors and actresses were a bonus to the showthese characters were so real 1 
and i really did find them funny 1 
a standout scene 1 
i felt asleep the first time i watched it so i can recommend it for insomniacs 0 
the selection of food was not the best 0 
some applause should be given to the prelude however 1 
nothing special 0 
it defeats the purpose of a bluetooth headset 0 
for readers who have already seen one of miyazakis films he is still in top form and made another worthwhile experience 1 
do not waste your money here 0 
it is rare when a filmmaker takes the time to tell a worthy moral tale with care and love that doesnt fall into the trap of being overly syrupy or over indulgent 1 
seafood was limited to boiled shrimp and crab legs but the crab legs definitely did not taste fresh 0 
the mic there is a joke and the volume is quite low 0 
youd have to have the iq of particularly stupid mollusk not to see that one coming 0 
the descriptions said yum yum sauce and another said eel sauce yet another said spicy mayowell none of the rolls had sauces on them 0 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
almost everyone involved must be return to school acting is utterly predictable and bad script is pile of garbage all round 0 
as an earlier review noted plug in this charger and nothing happens 0 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
now i know that i made a wise decision 1 
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 
my boyfriend and i came here for the first time on a recent trip to vegas and could not have been more pleased with the quality of food and service 1 
to my disbelief each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods i have ever tasted 0 
my experience was terrible this was my fourth bluetooth headset and while it was much more comfortable than my last jabra which i hated 0 
sounds good reasonably priced and effective its that simple 1 
this is a good joint 1 
the cashier was friendly and even brought the food out to me 1 
in other words the content level of this film is enough to easily fill a dozen other films 1 
the greek dressing was very creamy and flavorful 1 
the management is rude 0 
i totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is 1 
great charger 1 
pretty cool i would say 1 
this item is great installed it let it charged up overnite and it has been working good every since with no problems 1 
the servers went back and forth several times not even so much as an are you being helped 0 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
it works 1 
the fact is this film is a wonderful heartwarming tale about two people chasing their dreams 1 
how can you call yourself a steakhouse if you cant properly cook a steak i dont understand 0 
the film deserves strong kudos for taking this stand for having exceptional acting from its mostly lesserknown cast and for the superintelligent script that doesnt insult the audience or take the easy way out when it comes to white racism 1 
it plays louder than any other speaker of this size the price is so low that most would think the quality is lacking however its not 1 
on three different occasions i asked for well done or medium well and all three times i got the bloodiest piece of meat on my plate 0 
it kept getting worse and worse so now im officially done 0 
i could barely stomach the meal but didnt complain because it was a business lunch 0 
nobody identifies with these characters because theyre all cardboard cutouts and stereotypes or predictably reversestereotypes 0 
it has been a winner for us 1 
first of all there are enough racial stereotypes and racial jokes to offend everyone 0 
at least think to refill my water before i struggle to wave you over for 10 minutes 0 
i received my orders well within the shipping timeframe everything was in good working order and overall i am very excited to have this source 1 
which is precisely why i am giving it such a bad review 0 
go rent it 1 
i really do recommend this place you can go wrong with this donut place 1 
i didnt know pulled pork could be soooo delicious 1 
the microphone also works well but according to people i have called it applifies everything 1 
service is quick and friendly 1 
this is one of the worst sandra bullock movie since speed 2 but not quite that bad 0 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
being a 90s child i truly enjoyed this show and i can proudly say that i enjoyed it big time and even more than the classical wb cartoons 1 
im so sorry but i really cant recommend it to anyone 0 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
this review is long overdue since i consider a tale of two sisters to be the single greatest film ever made 1 
this film tries to be a serious and sophisticated thrillerhorror flick and it fails miserably 0 
add betty white and jean smart and you have a great cast everyone played their parts really well 1 
the characters were all funny and had the peculiarity of not having a true lead character 1 
it doesnt work in europe or asia 0 
this item is fantastic and works perfectly 1 
just what i wanted 1 
punishment park is a brilliant piece of cinema 1 
the worst one of the series 0 
i definitly recommend 1 
in fact its hard to remember that the part of ray charles is being acted and not played by the man himself 1 
they do not care about the consumer one bit 0 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
first of all there are enough racial stereotypes and racial jokes to offend everyone 0 
i dont recommend unless your car breaks down in front of it and you are starving 0 
all the bread is made inhouse 1 
i cant tell you how disappointed i was 0 
the pancake was also really good and pretty large at that 1 
the goat taco didnt skimp on the meat and wow what flavor 1 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
the stories were as unbelievable as the actors 0 
horrible 0 
its a fresh subtle and rather sublime effect 1 
this convention never worked well in the past and certainly doesnt work here 0 
this is a simple little phone to use but the breakage is unacceptible 0 
worst customer service 0 
i love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it 1 
disappointing accessory from a good manufacturer 0 
but i dont like it 0 
fantastic service here 1 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
i cannot believe that the actors agreed to do this film 0 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
i went to bachi burger on a friends recommendation and was not disappointed 1 
i cant tell you how disappointed i was 0 
this is hands down the best phone ive ever had 1 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
call me a nut but i think this is one of the best movies ever 1 
worst hour and a half of my lifeoh my gosh 0 
the speaker is of low quality so as making the ring tones sound very cheap 0 
yes i am simplifying things here for the sake of brevity for this really is at the core of the problems with this film it has too much going on without any real fulfilling explanation 0 
there is a brilliant twist ending 1 
i highly recommend this case 1 
the place was fairly clean but the food simply wasnt worth it 0 
the hockey scenes are terrible defensemen playing like theyre 5 years old goalies diving at shots that are 10 feet wide of the net etc 0 
service is quick and even to go orders are just like we like it 1 
favorite place in town for shawarrrrrrma 1 
the macarons here are insanely good 1 
product was excellent and works better than the verizon one and boy was it cheaper 1 
very easy to use 1 
i found a six inch long piece of wire in my salsa 0 
i have been very happy with the 510 and have had no complaints from any one regarding my sound quality on their end 1 
so flavorful and has just the perfect amount of heat 1 
its welldesigned and very sharp the blue is a very nice color 1 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
dee snider just plain sucks 0 
restaurant is always full but never a wait 1 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
this is simply the best bluetooth headset for sound quality 1 
a good commentary of todays love and undoubtedly a film worth seeing 1 
i believe that pitch black was done well 1 
my mother and brother had to do thiswhen i saw robert ryan portraying this type of man it was a very good imitation of this type of individual and i was impressed 1 
ill put this gem up against any movie in terms of screenplay cinematography acting postproduction editing directing or any other aspect of filmmaking 1 
my sanyo has survived dozens of drops on blacktop without ill effect 1 
i knew when i saw the film that more great things were to come from this gifted actor 1 
ive had no trouble accessing the internet downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions 1 
first time there and might just be the last 0 
audio quality is poor very poor 0 
i was sitting in my vehicle with the cradle on my belt and the headset lost signal 0 
the songs were the best and the muppets were so hilarious 1 
but in terms of the writing its very fresh and bold 1 
worst customer service ever 0 
truly awful 0 
everything is appalling 0 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
it was a drive to get there 0 
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0 
not good by any stretch of the imagination 0 
my husband said she was very rude did not even apologize for the bad food or anything 0 
avoid avoid avoid 0 
it showed exactly how the government and the scientist argued for humanity and the reasons of the gadget 1
