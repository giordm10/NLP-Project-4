almost everyone involved must be return to school acting is utterly predictable and bad script is pile of garbage all round 0 
if you stay in vegas you must get breakfast here at least once 1 
very friendly staff 1 
you cant go wrong with any of the food here 1 
very disappointing 0 
i hate movies like that 0 
this pair of headphones is the worst that i have ever had soundwise 0 
this is one of peter watkins most accessible films 1 
worst customer service 0 
sound quality on both end is excellent i use headset to call my wife and ask my wife to use headset to call me 2 1 
a film not easily forgotten 1 
i am far from a sushi connoisseur but i can definitely tell the difference between good food and bad food and this was certainly bad food 0 
the color is even prettier than i thought it would be and the graphics are incredibly sharp 1 
hitchcock is a great director 1 
wed definitely go back here again 1 
it was a riot to see hugo weaving play a sexobsessed gay real estate salesman who uses his clients houses for his trysts with the flaming darren tom hollander 1 
excellent starter wireless headset 0 
when im on this side of town this will definitely be a spot ill hit up again 1 
it kept getting worse and worse so now im officially done 0 
it is very comfortable to wear as well which is probably the most important aspect about using a case 1 
jabra ear gels r the best 1 
service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is vegas and located inside the crystals shopping mall by aria 1 
they could serve it with just the vinaigrette and it may make for a better overall dish but it was still very good 1 
i felt asleep the first time i watched it so i can recommend it for insomniacs 0 
very disappointed 0 
what the hell kind of crap is that 0 
fantastic food 1 
what this film lacks is a convincing script 0 
i dont think you will be disappointed 1 
i really dont see how anyone could enjoy this movie 0 
essentially you can forget microsofts tech support 0 
the results well are a shame 0 
couldnt figure it out 0 
the ri style calamari was a joke 0 
yes i am simplifying things here for the sake of brevity for this really is at the core of the problems with this film it has too much going on without any real fulfilling explanation 0 
we wont be returning 0 
both actors truly understand and become their particular character delivering a convincing sincere performance 1 
but even the talented carrell cant save this 0 
so absolutley fantastic 1 
so good i am going to have to review this place twice once hereas a tribute to the place and once as a tribute to an event held here last night 1 
summary the witticisms werent witty 0 
product is useless since it does not have enough charging current to charge the 2 cellphones i was planning to use it with 0 
i could care less the interior is just beautiful 1 
i dont think ive ever gone to a movie and disliked it as much 0 
the new characters werent all that memorable and i found myself forgetting who was who 0 
muddy low quality sound and the casing around the wires insert was poorly super glued and slid off 0 
i can assure you that you wont be disappointed 1 
i love this place 1 
very disappointing 0 
i give wirefly 1 stari will contact cingularatt and inform them of this practice 0 
it kept getting worse and worse so now im officially done 0 
its the best headset i have used 1 
i live in the neighborhood so i am disappointed i wont be back here because it is a convenient location 0 
i cant believe theres even a sequel to this 0 
when i saw it in the theater i thought i was going to be sick 0 
this was reflected not only in the cast but also in the belowpar script which borrowed much from the earlier classic 0 
what did bother me was the slow service 0 
easy to use 1 
also notable is john baileys fine crisp beautifully colored cinematography and the great production design costumes by eiko ishioka who went on to do the memorable costumes for coppolas dracula for which she received a well deserved oscar 1 
i guess maybe we went on an off night but it was disgraceful 0 
your brain will attempt to shutdown as part of a primal impulse of selfpreservation 0 
my husband and i ate lunch here and were very disappointed with the food and service 0 
so badwellits just bad 0 
its too bad that everyone else involved didnt share crowes level of dedication to quality for if they did wed have a far better film on our hands than this subpar mess 0 
it just blew 0 
i like the fact that it rests lightly against your ear rather than inside 1 
the worst sappiest dialogue i could go on and on 0 
service was fantastic 1 
then our food came out disappointment ensued 0 
yet i enjoy watching it 1 
the story line is just awful 0 
but when someone strives for greatness and poetry but delivers a muddled and often ridiculous story a bunch of disparate scenes pretentious dialogue then you get the worst kind of a movie that some other reviewer very accurately defined as pretentious crap 0 
it deserves strong love 1 
hated it 0 
you wont forget this movie 1 
recommend with confidence 1 
i could not understand what kind of idiot would produce this mess in the first place not to mention several season 0 
this is a bad film with bad writing and good actorsan ugly cartoon crafted by paul haggis for people who cant handle anything but the bold strokes in storytellinga picture painted with crayons 0 
it worked very well 1 
ordered burger rare came in well done 0 
in a word it is embarrassing 0 
the color is even prettier than i thought it would be and the graphics are incredibly sharp 1 
lightweight and works well 1 
the cast was great 1 
the chefs were friendly and did a good job 1 
also notable is john baileys fine crisp beautifully colored cinematography and the great production design costumes by eiko ishioka who went on to do the memorable costumes for coppolas dracula for which she received a well deserved oscar 1 
it quit working after id used it for about 18 months so i just purchased another one because this is the best headset ive ever owned 1 
it is not good 0 
i hate those things as much as cheap quality black olives 0 
its a fresh subtle and rather sublime effect 1 
brilliance indeed 1 
i love their fries and their beans 1 
the story is beyond stupid 0 
the food was delicious our bartender was attentive and personable and we got a great deal 1 
this greedy corporation will never see another dime from me 0 
this place deserves one star and 90 has to do with the food 0 
this was my first and only vegas buffet and it did not disappoint 1 
it looks very nice 1 
perfect for someone me who only likes beer ice cold or in this case even colder 1 
the fried rice was dry as well 0 
ill give this film 10 out of 10 1 
too bad you have to pay up to a month for the service 0 
this was my first and only vegas buffet and it did not disappoint 1 
after trying many many handsfree gadgets this is the one that finally works well 1 
almost everyone involved must be return to school acting is utterly predictable and bad script is pile of garbage all round 0 
and service was super friendly 1 
just what i wanted 1 
nice quality build unlike some cheap s out there 1 
i can barely ever hear on it and am constantly saying what 0 
the acting was decidely wooden though no worse than a period universal b movie 0 
the bartender was also nice 1 
try them in the airport to experience some tasty food and speedy friendly service 1 
its reception is very very poor 0 
i would advise to not purchase this item it never worked very well 0 
i rather enjoyed it 1 
that company is a joke 0 
were jerks on the phone 0 
overall a delight 1 
the sets especially designed to work with the camera are amazingstylized beautiful and effective 1 
all of the main players are mesmerising 1 
i have to jiggle the plug to get it to line up right to get decent volume 0 
but in terms of the writing its very fresh and bold 1 
my sanyo has survived dozens of drops on blacktop without ill effect 1 
the story line is just awful 0 
service was exceptional and food was a good as all the reviews 1 
my 810 score is mostly for the plot 1 
this was my first time and i cant wait until the next 1 
no shifting no bubbling no peeling not even a scratch nothingi couldnt be more happier with my new one for the droid 1 
its a feelgood film and thats how i felt when i came out of the cinema 1 
still its quite interesting and entertaining to follow 1 
im not eating here 0 
the budget was evidently very limited 0 
i tried the cape cod ravoli chickenwith cranberrymmmm 1 
fits comfortably came with three sizes of earbud tips 1 
this film and i use that word loosely is an insult to the moviegoing public 0 
there still are good actors around 1 
on the up side their cafe serves really good food 1 
the sergeant pepper beef sandwich with auju sauce is an excellent sandwich as well 1 
i exchanged the sony ericson z500a for this and im pretty happy with that decision 1 
heres where the movie really pied me off 0 
but the service was beyond bad 0 
also great directing and photography 1 
after all the rave reviews i couldnt wait to eat herewhat a disappointment 0 
the sound is clear and the people i talk to on it are amazed at the quality too 1 
really pleased with this product so far 1 
that being said for a phone the camera is very nice many cool effects to play with and video is decent as well 1 
some applause should be given to the prelude however 1 
i had a seriously solid breakfast here 1 
does not work 0 
the telephone repair man was really funny and his reactions to the nuts and bitchy boss were truly genuine 1 
highly unprofessional and rude to a loyal patron 0 
this is so embarassing and also my ears hurt if i try to push the ear plug into my ear 0 
the soundtrack sucked 0 
it is an excellent drama an excellent thriller and an excellent film 1 
magical help 1 
how stupid is that 0 
the explosion of the gas tanks at the end was just as awful 0 
rating 010 grade z note the show is so bad that even mother of the cast pull her daughter out of the show 0 
i was deeply impressed with the character he played 1 
once your food arrives its meh 0 
ill give this film 10 out of 10 1 
reaching for the bottom row is uncomfortable and the send and end keys are not where i expect them to be3 0 
i agree with jessica this movie is pretty bad 0 
these are certainly very comfortable and functionality is decent 1 
will never ever go back 0 
this is truly an art movieit actually has a lot of art in it 1 
their chow mein is so good 1 
all the pretty pictures in the world cannot make up for a piece of work that is flawed at the core 0 
my rating just 3 out of 10 0 
the script is was there a script 0 
comfortable in my hand 1 
the food is good 1 
there is no plot here to keep you going in the first place 0 
there is no real plot 0 
sorry i will not be getting food from here anytime soon 0 
camera color balance is awful 0 
finally after three or four times the spring of the latch broke and i could not use it any longer on the visor 0 
the phone crashed completely and now i have to get it replaced 0 
the results well are a shame 0 
both rickman and stowe play their roles to the hilt in this tale of a childrens book writer who maybe has written a subversive tract 1 
i like design and look of jabra behing the ear headsets and 5020 is pretty comfortible to wear 24 hours a day without pain in the ear 1 
the instruction manual is lacking 0 
this one wants to surf on the small wave of space movies in 1998 deep impact and armageddon and this one fails everywhere 0 
cant store anything but phone numbers to sim 0 
although i very much liked the look and sound of this place the actual experience was a bit disappointing 0 
im not impressed with the concept or the food 0 
very bad experience 0 
now this dish was quite flavourful 1 
the service was poor and thats being nice 0 
do not buy if you want to use the holster 0 
pretty good beer selection too 1 
just reading on the specs alone makes you say wow 1 
the worst piece of crap ever along with the verizon customer service 0 
this is was due to the fact that it took 20 minutes to be acknowledged then another 35 minutes to get our foodand they kept forgetting things 0 
the performances are not improved by improvisation because the actors now have twice as much to worry about not only whether theyre delivering the line well but whether the line itself is any good 0 
best breakfast buffet 1 
do not buy do not buyit sucks 0 
and there wasnt a single sour note struck actingwise either some surprisingly solid casting here 1 
i kept looking at the time and it had soon become 35 minutes yet still no food 0 
very good food great atmosphere1 1 
magical help 1 
the secondary plot line is incomprehensible and its relation to the primary plot line is mystifying 0 
this is some seriously good pizza and im an expertconnisseur on the topic 1 
i swung in to give them a try but was deeply disappointed 0 
the movie was very interesting from beginning to the end 1 
but the duet between the astronaut and his doctor at the beginning of the movie is a perfect exchange if one considers that this movie was made well into the cold war and the astronauts biggest fear is that he has crashed in the ussr 1 
you need at least 3 mins to get to your phone book from the time you first turn on the phonebattery life is short 0 
we arent ones to make a scene at restaurants but i just dont get itdefinitely lost the love after this one 0 
2 thumbs up 1 
is pretty funny 1 
sending it back 0 
i would recommend saving room for this 1 
great food and great service in a clean and friendly setting 1 
these were so good we ordered them twice 1 
it wasnt busy either also the building was freezing cold 0 
this is a great restaurant at the mandalay bay 1 
the manager was the worst 0 
horrible had to switch 3 times 0 
i love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it 1 
it was way over fried 0 
it is light easy to use and has very clear reception and transmission 1 
to my disbelief each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods i have ever tasted 0 
the jamaican mojitos are delicious 1 
waitress was a little slow in service 0 
i am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this 1 
all in all ha long bay was a bit of a flop 0 
it was a huge awkward 15lb piece of cow that was 34ths gristle and fat 0 
im trying to return it for a refund 0 
all i can do is whine on the internet so here it goesthe more i use the thing the less i like it 0 
what on earth is irons doing in this film 0 
i recently tried caballeros and i have been back every week since 1 
also were served hot bread and butter and home made potato chips with bacon bits on topvery original and very good 1 
i guess it was supposed to be clever twist then shed some light on the situation but it was just stupid 0 
aailiyah was pretty good as akasha in places compelling her first entrance and mini dance scene 1 
appetite instantly gone 0 
probably not in a hurry to go back 0 
their onscreen chemistry critical to the entire film is genuine 1 
but even the talented carrell cant save this 0 
food was really boring 0 
it works fine on my motorola 325 cellphone and a lot better than the wornout battery did 1 
it was pretty gross 0 
graphics is far from the best part of the game 0 
that just screams legit in my booksomethats also pretty rare here in vegas 1 
the kids are annoying 0 
full of unconvincing cardboard characters it is blandly written by edward chodorov who also produced and is surprisingly directed by jean negulesco from whom one would expect a great deal more 0 
also notable is john baileys fine crisp beautifully colored cinematography and the great production design costumes by eiko ishioka who went on to do the memorable costumes for coppolas dracula for which she received a well deserved oscar 1 
could not get strong enough signal 0 
i still maintain that monkeys shouldnt make headphones we just obviously dont share enough dna to copy the design over to humans 0 
the cow tongue and cheek tacos are amazing 1 
service is also cute 1 
the film is well paced understated and one of the best courtroom documentaries ive seen 1 
would not recommend to others 0 
we waited for thirty minutes to be seated although there were 8 vacant tables and we were the only folks waiting 0 
nobody identifies with these characters because theyre all cardboard cutouts and stereotypes or predictably reversestereotypes 0 
ordered an appetizer and took 40 minutes and then the pizza another 10 minutes 0 
now imagine that every single one of those decisions was made wrong 0 
updatewent back for a second time and it was still just as amazing 1 
item does not match picture 0 
the film succeeds despite or perhaps because of an obviously meagre budget 1 
lousy product 0 
after 3 months screen just went black all of a sudden 0 
i wont be back 0 
my husband and i ate lunch here and were very disappointed with the food and service 0 
waitress was a little slow in service 0 
the delivery was on time 1 
sending it back 0 
too bad cause i know its family owned i really wanted to like this place 0 
we are so glad we found this place 1 
the movie is not completely perfect but titta di girolamo will stay with you for a long time after the vision of the movie 1 
this is a very average phone with bad battery life that operates on a weak network 0 
the bathrooms are clean and the place itself is well decorated 1 
the bottowm lineanother worthless cheap gimmick from sprint 0 
trumbull on i love lucy 1 
i love being able to use one headset for both by landline and cell 1 
i came back today since they relocated and still not impressed 0 
if you want a real scare rent this one 1 
the decor is nice and the piano music soundtrack is pleasant 1 
the ngage is still lacking in earbuds 0 
how awful she is 0 
i got it because it was so small and adorable 1 
these are fabulous 1 
cant say enough good things about this place 1 
this is a good joint 1 
the script is bad very bad  it contains both cheesiness and unethical joke that you normally see in rated r or nc17 movie 0 
almost everyone involved must be return to school acting is utterly predictable and bad script is pile of garbage all round 0 
none of them are engaging or exciting 0 
earbud piece breaks easily 0 
but its just not funny 0 
i asked multiple times for the wine list and after some time of being ignored i went to the hostess and got one myself 0 
then the film just dropped the ball 0 
so bad 0 
plus it was wellpaced and suited its relatively short run time 1 
the headsets are easy to use and everyone loves them 1 
it is so small and you dont even realize that it is there after a while of getting used to it 1 
dont waste your money 0 
the foreigner is not worth one second of your time 0 
cinematography the film was shot in an interesting way 1 
im happy about this purchase good quality and low price 1 
he really didnt seem to want to be hosting his voiceovers were monotonous didnt get involved with the guests 0 
the story which was told so eloquently by francis ford coppola 25 years earlier really unfolds gradually and leaves room for the characters to develop 1 
everything stinks 0 
the potato chip order was sad i could probably count how many chips were in that box and it was probably around 12 0 
i was very disappointed in the movie 0 
good show samsung 1 
the plot was the same as pretty much every other cheap horror 0 
lot of holes in the plot theres nothing about how he became the emperor nothing about where he spend 20 years between his childhood and mature age 0 
if this premise sound stupid thats because it is 0 
there are many continuity errors one other user commented on different cars in the garage joes glassesthe one that got to me the most was the fact joes facial hair configuration seemed to change from scene to scene 0 
the plastic breaks really easy on this clip 0 
all in all its an insult to ones intelligence and a huge waste of money 0 
cant store anything but phone numbers to sim 0 
the buttons for on and off are bad 0 
its a little geeky but i think thats its sex on toast and it rocks and oozes sex right down to its battery embedded sleek stylish leather case 1 
i felt as though her going to ireland did absolutely nothing whatsoever 0 
this movie creates its own universe and is fascinating in every way 1 
these were so good we ordered them twice 1 
i know this is not like the other restaurants at all something is very off here 0 
its just adorable seeing mickey playing turkey in the straw in a highly imaginative if occasionally cruel way 1 
it was just not a fun experience 1 
i hate those things as much as cheap quality black olives 0 
im so happy to be here 1 
i checked out this place a couple years ago and was not impressed 0 
from here on the widmark character turns unintentionally comical 0 
i am very impressed with this headset from plantronics 1 
the bottowm lineanother worthless cheap gimmick from sprint 0 
all the bread is made inhouse 1 
the story line is just awful 0 
very poor service 0 
the cable looks so thin and flimsy it is scary 0 
the food came out at a good pace 1 
the food was barely lukewarm so it must have been sitting waiting for the server to bring it out to us 0 
sprint charges for this service 0 
so i am here to warn youdo not rent this movie it is the dumbest thing you have never seen 0 
i believe every one should see this movie as i think few people outside of south africa understand its past and what is being attempted in the truth and reconciliation process 1 
great service and food 1 
the flair bartenders are absolutely amazing 1 
i go to far too many places and ive never seen any restaurant that serves a 1 egg breakfast especially for 400 0 
none of the three sizes they sent with the headset would stay in my ears 0 
overall i like there food and the service 1 
dont buy this product 0 
still its quite interesting and entertaining to follow 1 
to summarize the food was incredible nay transcendant but nothing brings me joy quite like the memory of the pneumatic condiment dispenser 1 
i advise everyone do not be fooled 0 
horrible dont waste your time and money 0 
fantastic buy and will get again for whatever my next phone is 1 
not sure who was more lost the flat characters or the audience nearly half of whom walked out 0 
good protection and does not make phone too bulky 1 
black water is a thriller that manages to completely transcend its limitations its an indie flick by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience 1 
too politically correct 0 
it doesnt make you look cool 0 
i received my headset in good time and was happy with it 1 
it also had a new problem 0 
sounds good reasonably priced and effective its that simple 1 
a happy wonderful feel good ending 1 
looks great and is strong 1 
when i received my pita it was huge it did have a lot of meat in it so thumbs up there 1 
this item worked great but it broke after 6 months of use 0 
it was so bad i had lost the heart to finish it 0 
the ri style calamari was a joke 0 
my boyfriend and i sat at the bar and had a completely delightful experience 1 
omg the food was delicioso 1 
i rather enjoyed it 1 
big disappointment with calendar sync 0 
the bartender was also nice 1 
its a piece of crap 0 
the black eyed peas and sweet potatoes unreal 1 
none of it works just dont buy it 0 
furthermore you cant even find hours of operation on the website 0 
overall i would recommend this phone over the new walkman 1 
juano hernandez an exceptional actor who played supporting roles in many films of the era is a proud black man who is accused of murdering a white man in the south 1 
service is also cute 1 
lately they have been extremely nice and helpful on the phone 1 
i rate this movie 910 1 
not as good as i had hoped 0 
this is the first phone ive had that has been so cheaply made 0 
oh and i forgot to also mention the weird color effect it has on your phone 0 
excellent product for the price 1 
the staff are also very friendly and efficient 1 
tied to charger for conversations lasting more than 45 minutesmajor problems 0 
this place is way too overpriced for mediocre food 0 
disapointing results 0 
nice design and quality 1 
id rather eat airline food seriously 0 
the tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu 0 
it probably would have been better if the director hadnt spent most of the movie showcasing his own art work which really isnt that noteworthy 0 
i find wasting food to be despicable but this just wasnt food 0 
this is a great phone 1 
nine out of ten for a truly lovely film 1 
judith light is one of my favorite actresses and i think she does a superb job in this film 1 
im still trying to get over how bad it was 0 
all the bread is made inhouse 1 
the calls drop the phone comes on and off at will the screen goes black and the worst of all it stops ringing intermittently 0 
a cheap and cheerless heist movie with poor characterisation lots of underbite style stoic emoting think chow yun fat in a better tomorrow and some cheesy clichés thrown into an abandoned factory ready for a few poorly executed flying judo rolls a la john woo 0 
no actress has been worse used that june allison in this movie 0 
the film is way too long 0 
110 and only because there is no setting for 010 0 
it is easy to turn on and off when you are in the car and the volume controls are quite accessable 1 
i might have gotten a defect but i would not risk buying it again because of the built quality alone 0 
i especially liked the noncliche choices with the parents in other movies i could predict the dialog verbatim but the writing in this movie made better selections 1 
this item is fantastic and works perfectly 1 
very slow at seating even with reservation 0 
i cant see how this movie can be an inspiration to anyone to come out or overcome fear and rejection 0 
they have a plethora of salads and sandwiches and everything ive tried gets my seal of approval 1 
and the rest of it just sits there being awful with soldiers singing songs about the masculinity they pledge themselves to hairsplitting about purity the admiration of swords etc 0 
great pork sandwich 1 
disappointment i hate anything that goes in my ear 0 
i could care less the interior is just beautiful 1 
for sushi on the strip this is the place to go 1 
its like a really sexy party in your mouth where youre outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party 1 
its pure brilliance 1 
it was absolutely amazing 1 
the reception has been generally good 1 
however the ear pads come off easily and after only one week i lost one 0 
i like armand assante my cable companys summary sounded interesting so i watched it twice already and probably will again 1 
this place is not quality sushi it is not a quality restaurant 0 
very nice and relaxing late night viewing 1 
battery life is also great 1 
he also came back to check on us regularly excellent service 1 
waaaaaayyyyyyyyyy over rated is all i am saying 0 
steamboat willie is an amazingly important film to our cinema history 1 
they work about 2 weeks then break 0 
my fiancé and i came in the middle of the day and we were greeted and seated right away 1 
unfortunately this is a bad movie that is just plain bad 0 
that was done in the second movie 0 
we will not be coming back 0 
the best part about nurse betty is its unpredictability 1 
bad day or not i have a very low tolerance for rude customer service people it is your job to be nice and polite wash dishes otherwise 0 
ive only had my bluetooth for a few weeks but i really like it 1 
great case and price 1 
food was really good and i got full petty fast 1 
much better than the other ayce sushi place i went to in vegas 1 
the pizza tasted old super chewy in not a good way 0 
the food is good 1 
lovely little thriller from hitchcock with lots of nice shenanigans surrounding a murdered spy a kidnapped child a nasty church a foreign plot and some random taxidermists 1 
light weight i hardly notice it is there 1 
the black eyed peas and sweet potatoes unreal 1 
the acting is fantastic the stories are seamlessly woven together and the dogs are splendid a must rent view or see 1 
it just blew 0 
lange had become a great actress 1 
love this place hits the spot when i want something healthy but not lacking in quantity or flavor 1 
so in a nutshell 1 the restaraunt smells like a combination of a dirty fish market and a sewer 0 
i highly recommend these and encourage people to give them a try 1 
the design is very good4 1 
we loved the place 1 
so anyone near you will hear part of your conversation 0 
the nano stated itmy son was dissapointed 0 
lordy the khao soi is a dish that is not to be missed for curry lovers 1 
host staff were for lack of a better word bitches 0 
just whatever you do avoid groove as its the antithesis of all that is good about human traffic 0 
however after about a year the fliptop started to get loose and wobbly and eventually my screen went black and i couldnt receive and place calls 0 
problem is that the ear loops are made of weak material and break easily 0 
it does everything the description said it would 1 
i started this review with two stars but im editing it to give it only one 0 
now you know why i gave it a 10 1 
i am going to have to be the first to negatively review this product 0 
the steak was amazingrge fillet relleno was the best seafood plate i have ever had 1 
from what my dinner companions told meeverything was very fresh with nice texture and taste 1 
i will never forget it now 1 
i have to use the smallest earpieces provided but it stays on pretty well 1 
good food good service 1 
what a waste 0 
in the span of an hour i had two people exclaim whoa is that the new phone on tv 1 
it was absolutely amazing 1 
nine out of ten for a truly lovely film 1 
i wish i could enter negative values admins 0 
on the ground right next to our table was a large smeared beensteppedinandtrackedeverywhere pile of green bird poop 0 
its pretty surprising that this wonderful film was made in 1949 as hollywood generally had its collective heads in the sand concerning black and white issues at that time 1 
this is actually a very smart movie 1 
i even fully charged it before i went to bed and turned off blue tooth and wifi and noticed that it only had 20 left in the morning 0 
im using it with an iriver spinn with case and it fits fine 1 
very comfortable 1 
we thought youd have to venture further away to get good sushi but this place really hit the spot that night 1 
its a mediocre miserable hollow laughable and predictable piece of garbage 0 
the cashier was friendly and even brought the food out to me 1 
cute quaint simple honest 1 
the movie is not completely perfect but titta di girolamo will stay with you for a long time after the vision of the movie 1 
they could be used as exemplars for any set designer 1 
now imagine that every single one of those decisions was made wrong 0 
i give wirefly 1 stari will contact cingularatt and inform them of this practice 0 
enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film 1 
trumbull on i love lucy 1 
great choice 1 
perfect for someone me who only likes beer ice cold or in this case even colder 1 
the worst piece of crap ever along with the verizon customer service 0 
a good time 1 
i wear glasses and it fits fine with them 1 
waaaaaayyyyyyyyyy over rated is all i am saying 0 
that company is a joke 0 
i liked this movie way too much 1 
food was so gooodd 1 
it was awesome 1 
love this phone 1 
its pure brilliance 1 
the cashier had no care what so ever on what i had to say it still ended up being wayyy overpriced 0 
to summarize the food was incredible nay transcendant but nothing brings me joy quite like the memory of the pneumatic condiment dispenser 1 
so for our enjoyment we get to see them run around play games and be dangerous 1 
the keyboard is a nice compromise between a full qwerty and the basic cell phone number keypad 1 
exceptionally bad 0 
the plantains were the worst ive ever tasted 0 
it only recognizes the phone as its storage device 0 
never been to hard rock casino before will never ever step forward in it again 0 
wonderful lil tapas and the ambience made me feel all warm and fuzzy inside 1 
by far the best cheesecurds we have ever had 1 
the battery is unreliable as well as the service use antena 0 
however bt headsets are currently not good for real time games like firstperson shooters since the audio delay messes me up 0 
this is a great product sure beats using your fingers 1 
i put the latest os on it v115g and it now likes to slow to a crawl and lock up every once in a while 0 
for a self proclaimed coffee cafe i was wildly disappointed 0 
you cant beat that 1 
it was a very superficial movie and it gave me the feeling that i was watching play rather than a film 0 
call me a nut but i think this is one of the best movies ever 1 
overall i like this place a lot 1 
loved the casting of jimmy buffet as the science teacher 1 
if you do go see this movie bring a pillow or a girlfriendboyfriend to keep you occupied through out 0 
loved the casting of jimmy buffet as the science teacher 1 
the staff is always super friendly and helpful which is especially cool when you bring two small boys and a baby 1 
the block was amazing 1 
could not get strong enough signal 0 
i vomited in the bathroom mid lunch 0 
also its slim enough to fit into my alarm clock docking station without removing the case 1 
ive never been more insulted or felt disrespected 0 
seriously its not worth wasting your or your kids time on 0 
the servers are not pleasant to deal with and they dont always honor pizza hut coupons 0 
i was very pleased to see that i could replace my well travled swivel holster for my blackberry flip 1 
on a positive note our server was very attentive and provided great service 1 
enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film 1 
however after finally watching this film i realized that not only had i had a closed mind to the brilliance it depicts i also found myself watching it over and over again 1 
i couldnt think of a better way to end the film but a smile on my face great way to wrap up an amazing film and trilogy 1 
if it were possible to give them zero stars theyd have it 0 
tried to go here for lunch and it was a madhouse 0 
good works fine 1 
ill be looking for a new earpiece 0 
in a word it is embarrassing 0 
the characters are interesting and you really care for them 1 
i wasnt really impressed with strip steak 0 
i have been in more than a few bars in vegas and do not ever recall being charged for tap water 0 
very well made and fits my surefire gx2 perfectly 1 
went for lunch service was slow 0 
nine out of ten for a truly lovely film 1 
lasted one day and then blew up 0 
we wont be returning 0 
updatewent back for a second time and it was still just as amazing 1 
the film deserves strong kudos for taking this stand for having exceptional acting from its mostly lesserknown cast and for the superintelligent script that doesnt insult the audience or take the easy way out when it comes to white racism 1 
it feels poorly constructed the menus are difficult to navigate and the buttons are so recessed that it is difficult to push them 0 
just whatever you do avoid groove as its the antithesis of all that is good about human traffic 0 
i own 2 of these cases and would order another 1 
dont miss it 1 
an instant classic with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits 1 
dont waste your time 0 
this film highlights the fundamental flaws of the legal process that its not about discovering guilt or innocence but rather is about who presents better in court 1 
okay i like to consider myself a fair critic so ill give credit where credits duethe creature effects were actually pretty cool 1 
sound quality on both end is excellent i use headset to call my wife and ask my wife to use headset to call me 2 1 
there is nothing authentic about this place 0 
we had fantastic service and were pleased by the atmosphere 1 
w810i is just superb 1 
not good by any stretch of the imagination 0 
and generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode 0 
their chow mein is so good 1 
he came running after us when he realized my husband had left his sunglasses on the table 1 
its this pandering to the audience that sabotages most of his films 0 
chinese forgeries abound 0 
i love this thing 1 
the reception is excellent 1 
in a word it is embarrassing 0 
now this dish was quite flavourful 1 
muddy low quality sound and the casing around the wires insert was poorly super glued and slid off 0 
sooooo good 1 
after the disappointing dinner we went elsewhere for dessert 0 
this place deserves one star and 90 has to do with the food 0 
every time he opened his mouth you expect to hear you see kids pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show 0 
the foreigner is not worth one second of your time 0 
it definitely was not as good as my s11 1 
john garfield ann revere lilli plmer william conrad canada leeand filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screenjames wong howe 1 
ive owned this phone for 7 months now and can say that its the best mobile phone ive had 1 
the construction of the headsets is poor 0 
i had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get some relief 0 
this movie has a cutting edge to it 1 
this is a disgrace 0 
is it possible for a movie to get any worse than this 0 
best of luck to the rude and noncustomer service focused new management 0 
overall a delight 1 
couldnt use the unit with sunglasses not good in texas 0 
okay i like to consider myself a fair critic so ill give credit where credits duethe creature effects were actually pretty cool 1 
kind of hard to mess up a steak but they did 0 
nice solid keyboard 1 
i was not happy with this item 0 
our server was very nice and even though he looked a little overwhelmed with all of our needs he stayed professional and friendly until the end 1 
my fella got the huevos rancheros and they didnt look too appealing 0 
i dont think it would hold it too securly on your belt 0 
im glad the film didnt go for the most obvious choice as a lesser film certainly would have 1 
same evening him and i are both drastically sick 0 
so far it has worked like a charm 1 
the pan cakes everyone are raving about taste like a sugary disaster tailored to the palate of a six year old 0 
special thanks to dylan t for the recommendation on what to order all yummy for my tummy 1 
the chips that came out were dripping with grease and mostly not edible 0 
i got the car charger and not even after a week the charger was brokeni went to plug it in and it started smoking 0 
the greek dressing was very creamy and flavorful 1 
piece of trash 0 
as a courtroom drama its compelling as an indictment on the american justice system its frightening 1 
my husband and i ate lunch here and were very disappointed with the food and service 0 
waiter was a jerk 0 
logitech bluetooth headset is a 10 1 
the characters are interesting even if a bit predictable 1 
comfortable fit you need your headset to be comfortable for at least an hour at a time if not for an entire day 1 
this item worked great but it broke after 6 months of use 0 
however i needed some better instructions 0 
i would avoid this place if you are staying in the mirage 0 
you need at least 3 mins to get to your phone book from the time you first turn on the phonebattery life is short 0 
they have a plethora of salads and sandwiches and everything ive tried gets my seal of approval 1 
jawbone era is awesome too 1 
after a year the battery went completely dead on my headset 0 
it lasts less than 3o minutes if i actually try to use the phonemy wife has the same phone with the same problem 0 
att is not clear sound is very distorted and you have to yell when you talk 0 
the ending is so so perfect youll shed a tear 1 
razr battery good buy 1 
the reception has been generally good 1 
there is a brilliant twist ending 1 
i never walked out of a movie faster 0 
i am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this 1 
dont miss it 1 
the characters are interesting and you want to find out more about them the longer the movie goes on and i think people will be surprised by who does and doesnt make it 1 
putting the race card aside lets look at the major flaw in the film they destroy latifas character 0 
my sashimi was poor quality being soggy and tasteless 0 
wont go back 0 
this is such a fun and funny movie 1 
this is a bad film with bad writing and good actorsan ugly cartoon crafted by paul haggis for people who cant handle anything but the bold strokes in storytellinga picture painted with crayons 0 
they were excellent 1 
this is an unbelievable bargain 1 
this place is pretty good nice little vibe in the restaurant 1 
so absolutley fantastic 1 
it didnt make me scared horrified or make me sympathetic towards the characters it was simply annoying 0 
judith light is one of my favorite actresses and i think she does a superb job in this film 1 
i ordered the lemon raspberry ice cocktail which was also incredible 1 
works as described 1 
dont buy it 0 
went for lunch service was slow 0 
save your money ive had this item for 11 months now 0 
i love lane but ive never seen her in a movie this lousy 0 
we received a white colored battery that goes dead after a couple hoursthe original used to last a week but still lasts longer than thereplacement 0 
comfortable fit you need your headset to be comfortable for at least an hour at a time if not for an entire day 1 
the only very disappointing thing was there was no speakerphone 0 
this one wants to surf on the small wave of space movies in 1998 deep impact and armageddon and this one fails everywhere 0 
sooooo good 1 
hes a national treasure 1 
but even the talented carrell cant save this 0 
classywarm atmosphere fun and fresh appetizers succulent steaks baseball steak 1 
this was a different cut than the piece the other day but still wonderful and tender s well as well flavored 1 
we had so much to say about the place before we walked in that he expected it to be amazing but was quickly disappointed 0 
the descriptions said yum yum sauce and another said eel sauce yet another said spicy mayowell none of the rolls had sauces on them 0 
best of all is the rotating feature very helpful 1 
sam shepards portrayal of a gung ho marine was sobering 1 
i rate this movie 910 1 
the pancake was also really good and pretty large at that 1 
conclusion very filling meals 1 
however after finally watching this film i realized that not only had i had a closed mind to the brilliance it depicts i also found myself watching it over and over again 1 
its so bad its actually worth seeing just for that reason 0 
looks great and is strong 1 
food was great and so was the serivce 1 
the waitress was friendly and happy to accomodate for veganveggie options 1 
10 out of 10 stars 1 
the waitress and manager are so friendly 1 
otherwise dont even waste your time on this 0 
krussel always good 1 
i particularly remember my senses being assaulted by strident cords of music that would blare out with very little warning and even less meaning 0 
highly recommend for any one who has a blue tooth phone 1 
i dont understand how this garbage got on the shelves of the movie store its not even a real movie 0 
i love this phone 1 
this allows the possibility of double booking for the same date and time after the first 0 
what a waste of time 0 
waste your money on this game 1 
i think this restaurant suffers from not trying hard enough 0 
once your food arrives its meh 0 
mishima is extremely uninteresting 0 
this film tries to be a serious and sophisticated thrillerhorror flick and it fails miserably 0 
this item is great installed it let it charged up overnite and it has been working good every since with no problems 1 
the script is a big flawed mess 0 
food quality has been horrible 0 
frankly after cotton club and unfaithful it was kind of embarrassing to watch lane and gere in this film because it is bad 0 
each day of the week they have a different deal and its all so delicious 1 
essentially you can forget microsofts tech support 0 
very unreliable service from tmobile 0 
pretty piece of junk 0 
i have had mine for about a year and this christmas i bought some for the rest of the family 1 
plug was the wrong size 0 
instead we got a bore fest about a whiny spoiled brat babysitting 0 
for the price this was a great deal 1 
the food is rich so order accordingly 1 
after trying many many handsfree gadgets this is the one that finally works well 1 
we got the food and apparently they have never heard of salt and the batter on the fish was chewy 0 
i knew when i saw the film that more great things were to come from this gifted actor 1 
the films sole bright spot was jonah hill who will look almost unrecognizable to fans of the recent superbad due to the amount of weight he lost in the interim 1 
a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it 1 
we had a group of 70 when we claimed we would only have 40 and they handled us beautifully 1 
well packaged arrived on time and works as intended 1 
5 stars for the brick oven bread app 1 
hackneyed writing certainly but made even worse by the bad directing 0 
not worth it 0 
the concert sequences just sucked 0 
no one at the table thought the food was above average or worth the wait that we had for it 0 
we also ordered the spinach and avocado salad the ingredients were sad and the dressing literally had zero taste 0 
both of them were truly unbelievably good and i am so glad we went back 1 
cumbersome design 0 
after all the rave reviews i couldnt wait to eat herewhat a disappointment 0 
terrible service 0 
punishment park is a brilliant piece of cinema 1 
the buttons for on and off are bad 0 
on the good side the staff was genuinely pleasant and enthusiastic a real treat 1 
the characters are interesting and you want to find out more about them the longer the movie goes on and i think people will be surprised by who does and doesnt make it 1 
unfortunately inexperience of direction meant that scene after scene passed with little in the way of dramatic tension or conflict 0 
both of the egg rolls were fantastic 1 
it felt too light and tinny 0 
my sanyo has survived dozens of drops on blacktop without ill effect 1 
great earpiece 1 
the waitress and manager are so friendly 1 
i only hear garbage for audio 0 
utter crap sound quality is terrible 0 
everything captain howdy says is either laughable or just plain stupid 0 
voice quality signal strength dropped calls 0 
but when someone strives for greatness and poetry but delivers a muddled and often ridiculous story a bunch of disparate scenes pretentious dialogue then you get the worst kind of a movie that some other reviewer very accurately defined as pretentious crap 0 
im still trying to get over how bad it was 0 
loved itfriendly servers great food wonderful and imaginative menu 1 
i went to bachi burger on a friends recommendation and was not disappointed 1 
i dont think you will be disappointed 1 
what this film lacks is a convincing script 0 
im terribly disappointed that this film would receive so many awards and accolades especially when there are far more deserving works of film out there 0 
back to good bbq lighter fare reasonable pricing and tell the public they are back to the old ways 1 
sam shepards portrayal of a gung ho marine was sobering 1 
very windresistant 1 
after arguing with verizon regarding the dropped calls we returned the phones after two days 0 
good food good service 1 
the structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema 1 
this place is pretty good nice little vibe in the restaurant 1 
a happy wonderful feel good ending 1 
portable and it works 1 
if you simply want a small flip phone look elsewhere as the extra bells whistles are mediocre 0 
i advise everyone do not be fooled 0 
the construction of the headsets is poor 0 
there was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth but it didnt really work into the rest of the plot 0 
this item is great installed it let it charged up overnite and it has been working good every since with no problems 1 
at no point in the proceedings does it look remotely like america 0 
the telephone repair man was really funny and his reactions to the nuts and bitchy boss were truly genuine 1 
yeah the movie pretty much sucked 0 
even when the women finally show up there is no sign of improvement the most expected things happen and by the time the film is over you might be far asleep 0 
the film gives meaning to the phrase never in the history of human conflict has so much been owed by so many to so few 1 
you also cannot take pictures with it in the case because the lense is covered 0 
this second appearance of mickey mouse following the silent plane crazy earlier that year is probably his most famous filmmostly because it was so groundbreaking 1 
similarly the delivery man did not say a word of apology when our food was 45 minutes late 0 
i found this place by accident and i could not be happier 1 
the burger i got the gold standard a 17 burger and was kind of disappointed 0 
i purcashed this for the car charger and it does not work 0 
if you want a sandwich just go to any firehouse 1 
a good commentary of todays love and undoubtedly a film worth seeing 1 
mediocre food 0 
being a 90s child i truly enjoyed this show and i can proudly say that i enjoyed it big time and even more than the classical wb cartoons 1 
poor product 0 
clear skype calls long battery life long range 1 
the death row scenes were entirely unmoving 0 
now you know why i gave it a 10 1 
my mother and brother had to do thiswhen i saw robert ryan portraying this type of man it was a very good imitation of this type of individual and i was impressed 1 
it was delicious 1 
for the price on amazon it is an excellent product which i would highly recommend 1 
this is an excellent tool especially when paired with your phones autoanswer 1 
great pork sandwich 1 
it is so small and you dont even realize that it is there after a while of getting used to it 1 
it is light has plenty of battery capacity and is very confortable to wear for somewhat extended periods of time 1 
i thought errol flynn was brilliant as custer and has since become my favourite actor 1 
great food and awesome service 1 
now the burgers arent as good the pizza which used to be amazing is doughy and flavorless 0 
crust is not good 0 
defective crap 0 
at first glance it is a lovely bakery cafe nice ambiance clean friendly staff 1 
third the cheese on my friends burger was cold 0 
exactly what i wanted 1 
very true to shakespear and a must for all shakespear fans 1 
definitely a turn off for me i doubt ill be back unless someone else is buying 0 
these are certainly very comfortable and functionality is decent 1 
the poor actors 0 
it isnt even an achievement as a sobaditsgood or sobaditsmemorable movie 0 
the movie was so boring that i sometimes found myself occupied peaking in the paper instead of watching never happened during a columbo movie before 0 
he surely doesnt know how to make a coherent action movie from the screenwriter of air force one who was only obliged to write the script just for a big sum of money 0 
earbud piece breaks easily 0 
i would have given no star if i was able 0 
the kids are annoying 0 
very comfortable 1 
i love my 350 headset my jabra350 bluetooth headset is great the reception is very good and the ear piece is a comfortable fit 1 
cute quaint simple honest 1 
after charging overnight these batteries work great 1 
amazon sucks 0 
we had fantastic service and were pleased by the atmosphere 1 
jabra ear gels r the best 1 
i recently tried caballeros and i have been back every week since 1 
went in for happy hour great list of wines 1 
i hate movies like that 0 
if it was to turn my good day feeling into a night of disturbing memories than i guess he succeeded 0 
it was a pale color instead of nice and char and has no flavor 0 
it is a joy to use 1 
simple lightweight and great fit 1 
best of luck to the rude and noncustomer service focused new management 0 
i must say i have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again 1 
i took back my money and got outta there 0 
the chicken wings contained the driest chicken meat i have ever eaten 0 
on the good side the staff was genuinely pleasant and enthusiastic a real treat 1 
delete this film from your mind 0 
i love lane but ive never seen her in a movie this lousy 0 
i dont know what kind it is but they have the best iced tea 1 
the descriptions said yum yum sauce and another said eel sauce yet another said spicy mayowell none of the rolls had sauces on them 0 
great case and price 1 
waaaaaayyyyyyyyyy over rated is all i am saying 0 
also makes it easier to hold on to 1 
there was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters 0 
the pleather case doesnt fit 0 
here in the wind and the lion we see a wonderful rendering of americas own imperial age 1 
this was utterly confusing at first which caused me to lose a couple of very very important contacts 0 
the movie had you on the edge of your seat and made you somewhat afraid to go to your car at the end of the night 1 
my phone doesnt slide around my car now and the grip prevents my phone from slipping out of my hand 1 
one more thing i can tolerate political incorrectness very well im all for artistic freedom and suspension of disbelief but the slavic female character was just too much 0 
in fact i liked it better than interview with a vampire and i liked this lestat stuart townsend better than cruises attempt 1 
best of luck to the rude and noncustomer service focused new management 0 
its not what it says it is 0 
but the convoluted plot just didnt convince me and much of the film was watched with a weird questioning glance 0 
i am going to have to be the first to negatively review this product 0 
now this is a movie i really dislike 0 
great food and service huge portions and they give a military discount 1 
seriously its not worth wasting your or your kids time on 0 
its a gloriously fun fast paced and fairly accurate portrayal of the night of a raver 1 
loved itfriendly servers great food wonderful and imaginative menu 1 
she carries the movie well 1 
i saw this movie and i thought this is a stupid movie 0 
this place is amazing 1 
the selection of food was not the best 0 
another thing i didnt really like is when a character got punched in the face a gallon of blood would spew forth soon after 0 
some may say this buffet is pricey but i think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot 1 
poor construction 0 
if you stay in vegas you must get breakfast here at least once 1 
having to humour him just to get by and get through the day was so apt 1 
furthermore you cant even find hours of operation on the website 0 
i checked out this place a couple years ago and was not impressed 0 
the acting is beyond abysmal 0 
what a great double cheeseburger 1 
great steak great sides great wine amazing desserts 1 
the lighting is just dark enough to set the mood 1 
that was funny 1 
echo problemvery unsatisfactory 0 
happy so far 1 
not a pleasant voyage of selfdiscovery 0 
the servers went back and forth several times not even so much as an are you being helped 0 
first time going but i think i will quickly become a regular 1 
his performance is simply genius 1 
this is simply the best bluetooth headset for sound quality 1 
buyerbe very careful 0 
one of my favorite purchases ever 1 
the food is good 1 
this is hands down the best phone ive ever had 1 
on three different occasions i asked for well done or medium well and all three times i got the bloodiest piece of meat on my plate 0 
not what i wanted 0 
the fact is this film is a wonderful heartwarming tale about two people chasing their dreams 1 
battery is terrible 0 
and the sound quality is great 1 
then as if i hadnt wasted enough of my life there they poured salt in the wound by drawing out the time it took to bring the check 0 
it never condescends all the characters have good genuine hearts and believable problems 1 
i received my orders well within the shipping timeframe everything was in good working order and overall i am very excited to have this source 1 
he is almost unbearable to watch on screen he has little to no charisma and terrible comedic timing 0 
and the red curry had so much bamboo shoots and wasnt very tasty to me 0 
but the service was beyond bad 0 
i as well wouldve given godfathers zero stars if possible 0 
it is practically useless and did not add any kind of boost to my reception after i bought it 0 
no additional ear gels provided and no instructions whatsoever 0 
i really wanted the plantronics 510 to be the right one but it has too many issues for methe good 0 
the food is good 1 
the pancake was also really good and pretty large at that 1 
if you look for authentic thai food go else where 0 
easily none other cartoon made me laugh in a tender way before getting into dark sitcoms oriented for teenagers 1 
the result is a powerhouse achievement made more timely now perhaps because of our cultures disturbing fascination with celebrity and its distorted interpretations of fame 1 
so i had to take the battery out of the phone put it all back together and then restart it 0 
and the rest of it just sits there being awful with soldiers singing songs about the masculinity they pledge themselves to hairsplitting about purity the admiration of swords etc 0 
schrader has made a resume full of lousy amateurish films 0 
the scallop dish is quite appalling for value as well 0 
it wasnt busy either also the building was freezing cold 0 
works like a charm it work the same as the one i got with the phone 1 
there was a warm feeling with the service and i felt like their guest for a special treat 1 
wow loved this place 1 
the service here leaves a lot to be desired 0 
i use this product in a motor control center where there is a lot of high voltage humming from the equipment and it works great 1 
the inside is really quite nice and very clean 1 
i will come back here every time im in vegas 1 
for those that havent seen it dont waste your time 0 
i tried talking real loud but shouting on the telephone gets old and i was still told it wasnt great 0 
it wasnt busy either also the building was freezing cold 0 
it is not good 0 
im not sure how long we stood there but it was long enough for me to begin to feel awkwardly out of place 0 
attempting artiness with black white and clever camera angles the movie disappointed became even more ridiculous as the acting was poor and the plot and lines almost nonexistent 0 
seafood was limited to boiled shrimp and crab legs but the crab legs definitely did not taste fresh 0 
i hate movies like that 0 
i have only had it for a few weeks but so far so good 1 
first off the reception sucks i have never had more than 2 bars ever 0 
i have 23 bars on my cell phone when i am home but you cant not hear anything 0 
product was excellent and works better than the verizon one and boy was it cheaper 1 
best of all is the rotating feature very helpful 1 
you wont forget this movie 1 
from what my dinner companions told meeverything was very fresh with nice texture and taste 1 
worked perfectly 1 
dont waste your money 0 
a great touch 1 
imdb ratings only go as low 1 for awful its time to get some negative numbers in there for cases such as these 0 
i really hope the team behind this movie makes more movies and that they will continue to do so in their own some kinda weird style 1 
waste of money 0 
each track commands sentiment actually contributing to the scenes and characters 1 
the desserts were a bit strange 0 
i just cant explain this movie more than romanticcharminghilariousand adorablethe junkyard scenes are funnyall the junkyard dogs have something specialtoo funny i laughedkids will love itbuy it when it comes outit has new features 1 
i found this move beautiful enjoyable and uplifting 1 
this place is not quality sushi it is not a quality restaurant 0 
some applause should be given to the prelude however 1 
i dont know what the big deal is about this place but i wont be back yaall 0 
really pleased with this product so far 1 
i went to bachi burger on a friends recommendation and was not disappointed 1 
i have read others reviews here but i havent had any problem with it 1 
her role was played well 1 
ill put this gem up against any movie in terms of screenplay cinematography acting postproduction editing directing or any other aspect of filmmaking 1 
the characters are fleshed out surprisingly well particularly grimes and blake and all the actors deliver their sharply scripted lines with just the right amount of deadpan tongue in cheek to make the dialogue both hilarious and realistic 1 
still its quite interesting and entertaining to follow 1 
its a gloriously fun fast paced and fairly accurate portrayal of the night of a raver 1 
a very very very slowmoving aimless movie about a distressed drifting young man 0 
the desserts were a bit strange 0 
at first i thought i was grtting a good deal at 744 until i plugged it into my phone v3c razr 0 
if only someone involved with it knew how to string together narrative 0 
having to humour him just to get by and get through the day was so apt 1 
the descriptions said yum yum sauce and another said eel sauce yet another said spicy mayowell none of the rolls had sauces on them 0 
i felt as though her going to ireland did absolutely nothing whatsoever 0 
ryans bar is definitely one edinburgh establishment i wont be revisiting 0 
no shifting no bubbling no peeling not even a scratch nothingi couldnt be more happier with my new one for the droid 1 
the construction of the headsets is poor 0 
i wasted my little money with this earpiece 0 
excellent performance 1 
it has all the features i want 1 
the staff is friendly and the joint is always clean 1 
it looked like a wonderful story 1 
i cant wait to go back 1 
cumbersome design 0 
the structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema 1 
he surely doesnt know how to make a coherent action movie from the screenwriter of air force one who was only obliged to write the script just for a big sum of money 0 
i came over from verizon because cingulair has nicer cell phones the first thing i noticed was the really bad service 0 
im returning them 0 
so i bought about 10 of these and saved alot of money 1 
i bought this battery with a coupon from amazon and im very happy with my purchase 1 
this place is good 1 
this is the kind of money that is wasted properly 1 
food arrived quickly 1 
this is one of the better buffets that i have been to 1 
the desserts were a bit strange 0 
conclusion very filling meals 1 
this is an excellent film 1 
ive owned this phone for 7 months now and can say that its the best mobile phone ive had 1 
i bought this phone as a replacement for my startac and have regretted it since 0 
i was sitting in my vehicle with the cradle on my belt and the headset lost signal 0 
we have tried 2 units and they both failed within 2 months pros 0 
my fella got the huevos rancheros and they didnt look too appealing 0 
would not recommend to others 0 
even worse than ticker 0 
if youre not familiar check it out 1 
good protection and does not make phone too bulky 1 
if you see it you should probably just leave it on the shelf 0 
all i have to say is the food was amazing 1 
itll be a regular stop on my trips to phoenix 1 
brilliance indeed 1 
overall i wasnt very impressed with noca 0 
i guess it was supposed to be clever twist then shed some light on the situation but it was just stupid 0 
all in all an excellent restaurant highlighted by great service a unique menu and a beautiful setting 1 
the delivery was on time 1 
theres barely a boring moment in the film and there are plenty of humorous parts 1 
the voice recognition thru the handset is excellent 1 
they have been around for years and carries the highest quality of antiglare screen protector that i have found to date 1 
but this movie is definitely a below average rent 0 
the worst was the salmon sashimi 0 
but the premise of the film was so ridiculous that the president of the us 0 
in the span of an hour i had two people exclaim whoa is that the new phone on tv 1 
went in for happy hour great list of wines 1 
how can anyone in their right mind ask for anything more from a movie than this 1 
this may be the only bad film he ever made 0 
very disappointing 0 
the owners really really need to quit being soooooo cheap let them wrap my freaking sandwich in two papers not one 0 
ray charles is legendary 1 
i ended up sliding it on the edge of my pants or back pockets instead 1 
when achille and philippa beautifully sing a duet from don giovanni that perfectly describes their situation in the movie you appreciate the subtle layers of this excellent film 1 
im very disappointed with my decision 0 
great software for motorolas 1 
setup went very smoothly 1 
highly recommended a 1 
overall the film is interesting and thoughtprovoking 1 
the attention given to every character and complex psychological portrayals detailing loyalty treachery love and hope are tremendous 1 
wont work right or atleast for me 0 
del taco is pretty nasty and should be avoided if possible 0 
you cant relate with them hell you barely can understand them 0 
it is wonderful and inspiring to watch and i hope that it gets released again on to video or dvd 1 
once you get inside youll be impressed with the place 1 
spend your money elsewhere 0 
why are these sad little vegetables so overcooked 0 
i love this thing 1 
the movie had you on the edge of your seat and made you somewhat afraid to go to your car at the end of the night 1 
i wear it everyday and it holds up very well 1 
i especially love the long battery life 1 
in a word it is embarrassing 0 
the movie in movie situations in the beginning and through the game that is played with her by the acting coach are fascinating 1 
the waitress and manager are so friendly 1 
i advise everyone do not be fooled 0 
this is a good battery and it got here really fast 1 
it is worth the drive 1 
this pair of headphones is the worst that i have ever had soundwise 0 
we arent ones to make a scene at restaurants but i just dont get itdefinitely lost the love after this one 0 
all in all id expected a better consumer experience from motorola 0 
the problem i have is that they charge 1199 for a sandwich that is no bigger than a subway sub which offers better and more amount of vegetables 0 
this place is good 1 
but this movie is definitely a below average rent 0 
for that its worth checking out 1 
i love my 350 headset my jabra350 bluetooth headset is great the reception is very good and the ear piece is a comfortable fit 1 
special mention should be made of the superb music score and sound effects which are an integral element in helping to make this such a memorable and enjoyable cartoon 1 
i had to wait over 30 minutes to get my drink and longer to get 2 arepas 0 
oh this is such a thing of beauty this restaurant 1 
the plot simply rumbles on like a machine desperately depending on the addition of new scenes 0 
the cashew cream sauce was bland and the vegetables were undercooked 0 
overall the film is interesting and thoughtprovoking 1 
eclectic selection 1 
delicious and i will absolutely be back 1 
the best place to go for a tasty bowl of pho 1 
doesnt hold charge 0 
food was good service was good prices were good 1 
wont go back 0 
to call this movie a drama is ridiculous 0 
sucked most of the stuff does not work with my phone 0 
restaurant is always full but never a wait 1 
sprint charges for this service 0 
ive never been treated so bad 0 
service is perfect and the family atmosphere is nice to see 1 
i have read others reviews here but i havent had any problem with it 1 
the potatoes were like rubber and you could tell they had been made up ahead of time being kept under a warmer 0 
however after finally watching this film i realized that not only had i had a closed mind to the brilliance it depicts i also found myself watching it over and over again 1 
i vomited in the bathroom mid lunch 0 
despite the pans of reviewers i liked this movie 1 
very comfortable 1 
i do think tom hanks is a good actor 1 
i was so insulted 0 
it was also the right balance of war and love 1 
internet is excrutiatingly slow 0 
whatever prompted such a documentary is beyond me 0 
worst thai ever 0 
it was a drive to get there 0 
soyo technology sucks 0 
very good food great atmosphere1 1 
it also had a new problem 0 
if you do go see this movie bring a pillow or a girlfriendboyfriend to keep you occupied through out 0 
its so bad its actually worth seeing just for that reason 0 
i really enjoyed eating here 1 
in fact i liked it better than interview with a vampire and i liked this lestat stuart townsend better than cruises attempt 1 
im surprised this is a good quality car charger and theres not much reviews about it 1 
new battery works great in phone 1 
very disappointed and wondered how it could be in the oscar shortlist 0 
and the beans and rice were mediocre at best 0 
lucy bell is so much higher than this crap and for her to sink this low is quite depressing 0 
i can barely ever hear on it and am constantly saying what 0 
i was mortified 0 
you could drive a semi truck into these holes 0 
i have had this phone for over a year now and i will tell you its not that great 0 
nice case feels good in your hands 1 
as always the evening was wonderful and the food delicious 1 
the success of the film depends on the casting of sydney greenstreet as the alexander yardley character 1 
ambience is perfect 1 
i connected my wifes bluetoothmotorola hs850 to my phone and it worked like a charm whether the phone was in my pocket or the case 1 
i really like this product over the motorola because it is allot clearer on the ear piece and the mic 1 
but in terms of the writing its very fresh and bold 1 
a lot of websites have been rating this a very good phone and so do i 1 
i cannot make calls at certain places 0 
overall i am psyched to have a phone which has all my appointments and contacts in and gets great reception 1 
but it wasnt anything at all just one big yawn 0 
im glad the film didnt go for the most obvious choice as a lesser film certainly would have 1 
why are these sad little vegetables so overcooked 0 
i wish i could return the unit and get back my money 0 
it was a long time that i didnt see a so charismatic actor on screen 1 
bt50 battery junk 0 
im glad the film didnt go for the most obvious choice as a lesser film certainly would have 1 
maybe there would be a reasonable explanation for this atrocity 0 
but in any case the best part is you can download these pictures to your laptop using ir or even send pictures from your laptop to the phone 1 
the worst one of the series 0 
the screen size is big key pad lit well enough and the camera quality is excellent for a camera phone 1 
then as if i hadnt wasted enough of my life there they poured salt in the wound by drawing out the time it took to bring the check 0 
definitely a turn off for me i doubt ill be back unless someone else is buying 0 
the chips and salsa were really good the salsa was very fresh 1 
i hate writing bad reviews about films especially those in which i really like the star but this film is so bad i dont believe for one second that anyone could have been proud of it 0 
fantastic buy and will get again for whatever my next phone is 1 
the staff are great the ambiance is great 1 
chinese forgeries abound 0 
an awesome new look for fall 2000 1 
horrible phone 0 
gave up trying to eat any of the crust teeth still sore 0 
i really dont see how anyone could enjoy this movie 0 
this is a disgrace 0 
in fact im going to round up to 4 stars just because she was so awesome 1 
the dialogue sucked 0 
in particular the relationship between the bakery assistant and the waitress just didnt work for me at all 0 
add betty white and jean smart and you have a great cast everyone played their parts really well 1 
very serious spoilers this movie was a huge disappointment 0 
it is just the sort of pap that is screened in the afternoon to punish the unemployed for not having jobs 0 
see it 1 
generally it just lacked imagination 0 
worked very well paired with a treo 700w and as a skype headset on my pc using a usb bluetooth transceiver 1 
much more interesting more action more suspense and less of the unneeded controversy 1 
there are many continuity errors one other user commented on different cars in the garage joes glassesthe one that got to me the most was the fact joes facial hair configuration seemed to change from scene to scene 0 
the camera although rated at an impressive 13 megapixels renders images that fall well below expectations of such a relatively high resolution 0 
amazon sucks 0 
a great film by a great director 1 
give this one a look 1 
i got to enjoy the seafood salad with a fabulous vinegrette 1 
it always cuts out and makes a beep beep beep sound then says signal failed 0 
the cow tongue and cheek tacos are amazing 1 
so i had to take the battery out of the phone put it all back together and then restart it 0 
also the fries are without a doubt the worst fries ive ever had 0 
it was clear that she had the range and ability to pull off this part 1 
i love their fries and their beans 1 
i bought two of them and neither will charge 0 
it was quite comfortable in the ear 1 
were jerks on the phone 0 
the results well are a shame 0 
then i exchanged for the same phone even that had the same problem 0 
you could drive a semi truck into these holes 0 
the selection of food was not the best 0 
id like to return it 0 
however i needed some better instructions 0 
the food was very good 1 
which is precisely why i am giving it such a bad review 0 
the reception has been generally good 1 
product was excellent and works better than the verizon one and boy was it cheaper 1 
good protection and does not make phone too bulky 1 
all of the main players are mesmerising 1 
i really enjoyed eating here 1 
juano hernandez an exceptional actor who played supporting roles in many films of the era is a proud black man who is accused of murdering a white man in the south 1 
i got the car charger and not even after a week the charger was brokeni went to plug it in and it started smoking 0 
my sister has one also and she loves it 1 
this movie is possibly one of the most creative works of horror ever 1 
the owners really really need to quit being soooooo cheap let them wrap my freaking sandwich in two papers not one 0 
crust is not good 0 
its aggravating 0 
then a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use 0 
problem is that the ear loops are made of weak material and break easily 0 
i love this bluetooth 1 
thats how id describe this painfully dreary timewaster of a film 0 
the guys all had steaks and our steak loving son who has had steak at the best and worst places said it was the best steak hes ever eaten 1 
its a little geeky but i think thats its sex on toast and it rocks and oozes sex right down to its battery embedded sleek stylish leather case 1 
seriously its not worth wasting your or your kids time on 0 
if it was to turn my good day feeling into a night of disturbing memories than i guess he succeeded 0 
nothing at all to recommend 0 
see it with your kids if you have a chanceit will open up some amazing dialog about how far race relations have come in the last 50 years 1 
krussel always good 1 
the cast was great 1 
what a great double cheeseburger 1 
i would not recommend this place 0 
the spaghetti is nothing special whatsoever 0 
youll love it 1 
the bt headset was such a disapoinment 0 
its so stupid to have to keep buying new chargers car chargers cradles headphones and car kits every time a new phone comes out 0 
i knew when i saw the film that more great things were to come from this gifted actor 1 
its this pandering to the audience that sabotages most of his films 0 
worked perfectly 1 
not to mention the combination of pears almonds and bacon is a big winner 1 
he is almost unbearable to watch on screen he has little to no charisma and terrible comedic timing 0 
not good by any stretch of the imagination 0 
that just screams legit in my booksomethats also pretty rare here in vegas 1 
im still infatuated with this phone 1 
their rotating beers on tap is also a highlight of this place 1 
im terribly disappointed that this film would receive so many awards and accolades especially when there are far more deserving works of film out there 0 
im still infatuated with this phone 1 
this is the phone to get for 2005 i just bought my s710a and all i can say is wow 1 
it even has its sweet moments 1 
the phone loads super 1 
painful on the ear 0 
it failed to convey the broad sweep of landscapes that were a great part of the original 0 
did not like at all 0 
i will never forget it now 1 
bland and flavorless is a good way of describing the barely tepid meat 0 
service was fantastic 1 
this film tries to be a serious and sophisticated thrillerhorror flick and it fails miserably 0 
i guess i should have known that this place would suck because it is inside of the excalibur but i didnt use my common sense 0 
i waited and waited 0 
1010 1 
i had strawberry tea which was good 1 
the chips and sals a here is amazing 1 
however this didnt make up for the fact that overall this was a tremendously boring movie 0 
what a piece of junk i lose more calls on this phone 0 
the acting is beyond abysmal 0 
good service very clean and inexpensive to boot 1 
it was that loudglad to say that the plantronics 510 maintains a flawless connection to my cell and with no static during normal use 1 
the classic maine lobster roll was fantastic 1 
very very sad 0 
the burger i got the gold standard a 17 burger and was kind of disappointed 0 
do not buy if you want to use the holster 0 
ive had this for nearly 2 years and it has worked great for me 1 
my first visit to hiro was a delight 1 
this is a very average phone with bad battery life that operates on a weak network 0 
the meat was pretty dry i had the sliced brisket and pulled pork 0 
the pancake was also really good and pretty large at that 1 
very good lunch spot 1 
its too bad the food is so damn generic 0 
i promise they wont disappoint 1 
essentially you can forget microsofts tech support 0 
filmiing was less expansive 0 
a film not easily forgotten 1 
the guys all had steaks and our steak loving son who has had steak at the best and worst places said it was the best steak hes ever eaten 1 
what i really like there is the crepe station 1 
the bose noise cancelling is amazing which is very important for a nyc commuter 1 
i could not stand to even watch it for very long for fear of losing iq 0 
nice leather 1 
the burger i got the gold standard a 17 burger and was kind of disappointed 0 
predictable but not a bad watch 1 
everything about it is just bad 0 
they are so easy to love but even more easy to identify with 1 
the movie is not completely perfect but titta di girolamo will stay with you for a long time after the vision of the movie 1 
the nokia ca42 usb cable did not work with my phone 0 
awsome device works great 1 
definitely worth checking out 1 
john wayne did an incredible job for being so young in the movie industry 1 
definitely not worth the 3 i paid 0 
as an earlier review noted plug in this charger and nothing happens 0 
id advise anyone to go and see it 1 
i checked out this place a couple years ago and was not impressed 0 
i highly recommend this modest priced cellular phone 1 
the management is rude 0 
not worth it 0 
tasted like dirt 0 
it was a pale color instead of nice and char and has no flavor 0 
both of the egg rolls were fantastic 1 
excellent sound quality 1 
the chefs were friendly and did a good job 1 
it fits so securely that the ear hook does not even need to be used and the sound is better directed through your ear canal 1 
the wind and the lion is well written and superbly acted 1 
works as described 1 
any grandmother can make a roasted chicken better than this one 0 
i kept catching the cable on the seat and i had to pull the phone out to turn it on an off 0 
fans of the genre will be in heaven 1 
also great directing and photography 1 
to be honest with you this is unbelievable nonsense and very foolish 0 
the majority of the logitech earbud headsets failed 0 
like the other reviewer said you couldnt pay me to eat at this place again 0 
went in for happy hour great list of wines 1 
disappointing accessory from a good manufacturer 0 
i had strawberry tea which was good 1 
ive had this bluetoooth headset for some time now and still not comfortable with the way it fits on the ear 0 
its just adorable seeing mickey playing turkey in the straw in a highly imaginative if occasionally cruel way 1 
everything about this product is wrongfirst 0 
the servers are not pleasant to deal with and they dont always honor pizza hut coupons 0 
oh yeah and the storyline was pathetic too 0 
hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in 0 
the malta settings are as dry and as barren as the dialogue 0 
there is nothing privileged about workingeating there 0 
i have seen many movies starring jaclyn smith but my god this was one of her best though it came out 12 years ago 1 
im really disappointed all i have now is a charger that doesnt work 0 
the construction of the headsets is poor 0 
i still maintain that monkeys shouldnt make headphones we just obviously dont share enough dna to copy the design over to humans 0 
when it opens the battery connection is broken and the device is turned off 0 
its a feelgood film and thats how i felt when i came out of the cinema 1 
for those that havent seen it dont waste your time 0 
not much flavor to them and very poorly constructed 0 
the phone gets extremely hot 0 
an instant classic with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits 1 
i love the scream movies and all horror movies and this one ranks way up there 1 
service is quick and friendly 1 
as a courtroom drama its compelling as an indictment on the american justice system its frightening 1 
i hate movies like that 0 
the budget was evidently very limited 0 
so flavorful and has just the perfect amount of heat 1 
i found the product to be easy to set up and use 1 
doesnt work at all i bougth it for my l7c and its not working 0 
all the bread is made inhouse 1 
highly recommended 1 
what is even more stupid is that who had thought an idea that there should be a volcano in los angeles 0 
we were promptly greeted and seated 1 
you need at least 3 mins to get to your phone book from the time you first turn on the phonebattery life is short 0 
my brother in law who works at the mall ate here same day and guess what he was sick all night too 0 
i would definitely recommend the jabra bt250v for those who are looking for comfort clarity and a great price 1 
headset works great was packaged nicely to avoid any damage 1 
the worst one of the series 0 
id like to return it 0 
so badwellits just bad 0 
i found this place by accident and i could not be happier 1 
the characters are interesting and you want to find out more about them the longer the movie goes on and i think people will be surprised by who does and doesnt make it 1 
lordy the khao soi is a dish that is not to be missed for curry lovers 1 
this item is great installed it let it charged up overnite and it has been working good every since with no problems 1 
an hour seriously 0 
nargile i think you are great 1 
probably not in a hurry to go back 0 
just spicy enough perfect actually 1 
couldnt use the unit with sunglasses not good in texas 0 
anyway the plot flowed smoothly and the malebonding scenes were a hoot 1 
service is quick and friendly 1 
still i do like this movie for its empowerment of women theres not enough movies out there like this one 1 
it has northern humour and positive about the community it represents 1 
easily none other cartoon made me laugh in a tender way before getting into dark sitcoms oriented for teenagers 1 
in an interesting part of town this place is amazing 1 
i waited and waited 0 
i was not impressed by this product 0 
rip off over charge shipping 0 
good product good seller 1 
there was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth but it didnt really work into the rest of the plot 0 
i did not expect this to be so good 1 
best of luck to the rude and noncustomer service focused new management 0 
did not like at all 0 
worth every penny 1 
camera color balance is awful 0 
jawbone era is awesome too 1 
tonight i had the elk filet specialand it sucked 0 
it was a long time that i didnt see a so charismatic actor on screen 1 
kris kristoffersen is good in this movie and really makes a difference 1 
excellent dualpurpose headset 1 
lets start with all the problemsthe acting especially from the lead professor was very very bad 0 
thats how id describe this painfully dreary timewaster of a film 0 
it shouldnt take 30 min for pancakes and eggs 0 
nothing at all to recommend 0 
not only did the software do a great job of this i could also make my own ringtones form my existing cds without an internet connection 1 
20th century foxs road house 1948 is not only quite a silly noir but is an implausible unmitigated bore of a movie 0 
food is way overpriced and portions are fucking small 0 
i wont be back 0 
50 down the drain 0 
i have had this phone for over a year now and i will tell you its not that great 0 
for that its worth checking out 1 
the chicken dishes are ok the beef is like shoe leather 0 
best tater tots in the southwest 1 
good product good seller 1 
the movie has almost no action scenes in it and very little comedy 0 
i was particularly pleased with the acting ability of dwight schultz 1 
it fits my ear well and is comfortable on 1 
everything captain howdy says is either laughable or just plain stupid 0 
best headset ever 1 
i promise they wont disappoint 1 
the warmth it generates is in contrast to its austere backdrop 1 
this device is great in several situations1 1 
in particular the relationship between the bakery assistant and the waitress just didnt work for me at all 0 
to call this movie a drama is ridiculous 0 
i give it 2 thumbs down 0 
i got it because it was so small and adorable 1 
the scenery that the two daughters paint and photograph are beautiful 1 
go rent it 1 
i particularly remember my senses being assaulted by strident cords of music that would blare out with very little warning and even less meaning 0 
the acting was bad 0 
i find this inexcusable and so will probably be returning this phone and perhaps changing carriers 0 
i guess maybe we went on an off night but it was disgraceful 0 
the sergeant pepper beef sandwich with auju sauce is an excellent sandwich as well 1 
this movie creates its own universe and is fascinating in every way 1 
the cast is always entertaining as usual 1 
his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic 1 
it is perfect for a sitdown family meal or get together with a few friends 1 
the lines the cuts the audio everything is wrong 0 
service is friendly and inviting 1 
i probably would not go here again 0 
im still trying to get over how bad it was 0 
if there was ever an indication of a writer and a directors ability to meld two highly volatile temperaments into a seamless union of creativity then this is it 1 
do not waste your time 0 
artless camerawork endlessly presents us with the ugliest setting imaginable ie 0 
i cant believe theres even a sequel to this 0 
still its quite interesting and entertaining to follow 1 
very dissapointing performance 0 
just dont know why they were so slow 0 
rating 010 grade z note the show is so bad that even mother of the cast pull her daughter out of the show 0 
excellent performance 1 
i cant tell you how disappointed i was 0 
it was quite comfortable in the ear 1 
a cheap and cheerless heist movie with poor characterisation lots of underbite style stoic emoting think chow yun fat in a better tomorrow and some cheesy clichés thrown into an abandoned factory ready for a few poorly executed flying judo rolls a la john woo 0 
and his subtle connections between the three films are awesome 1 
echo problemvery unsatisfactory 0 
the speaker is of low quality so as making the ring tones sound very cheap 0 
i didnt know pulled pork could be soooo delicious 1 
the volume switch rocketed out of the unit to a destination unknown 0 
i used bitpim a free program you can find on the internetto transfer data to the phonethe price of the cable was excellent 1 
its very slow 0 
the movie is full of wonderful dancing hence the title 1 
to sum the film up breeders is a terrible cheaply made horror movie that should be avoided like the ebola virus 0 
i love the pho and the spring rolls oh so yummy you have to try 1 
lasted one day and then blew up 0 
really bad 0 
my phone doesnt slide around my car now and the grip prevents my phone from slipping out of my hand 1 
talk about great customer service of course we will be back 1 
the battery runs down quickly 0 
however i recently watched the whole thing again on dvd and i was completely struck by how extremely stupid the storyline was how it contained holes inconsistencies and frankly a whole lot of crap and how horrid the dancing was 0 
but the duet between the astronaut and his doctor at the beginning of the movie is a perfect exchange if one considers that this movie was made well into the cold war and the astronauts biggest fear is that he has crashed in the ussr 1 
ambience is perfect 1 
the voice recognition thru the handset is excellent 1 
works great 1 
do not buy for d807wrongly advertised for d807 0 
saw the movie today and thought it was a good effort good messages for kids 1 
so good i am going to have to review this place twice once hereas a tribute to the place and once as a tribute to an event held here last night 1 
there still are good actors around 1 
even allowing for poor production values for the time 1971 and the format some kind of miniseries this is baaaaaad 0 
the black eyed peas and sweet potatoes unreal 1 
light weight i hardly notice it is there 1 
a fly was in my apple juice a fly 0 
buyerbe very careful 0 
tied to charger for conversations lasting more than 45 minutesmajor problems 0 
an amazing finale to possibly the best trilogy of all time 1 
problem is that the ear loops are made of weak material and break easily 0 
good service very clean and inexpensive to boot 1 
still its quite interesting and entertaining to follow 1 
that said our mouths and bellies were still quite pleased 1 
i loved it it was really scary 1 
this place lacked style 0 
due to this happening on every call i was forced to stop using this headset 0 
there is so much good food in vegas that i feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to rice and company 0 
the first time i ever came here i had an amazing experience i still tell people how awesome the duck was 1 
hayao miyazakis latest and eighth film for studio ghibili gake no ue no ponyo ponyo on the cliff by the sea is a wonderfully fun and imaginative look at childhood 1 
worked great 1 
i love the camera its really pretty good quality 1 
lame would be the best way to describe it 0 
the sergeant pepper beef sandwich with auju sauce is an excellent sandwich as well 1 
worst customer service 0 
the dining space is tiny but elegantly decorated and comfortable 1 
a good quality bargain i bought this after i bought a cheapy from big lots that sounded awful and people on the other end couldnt hear me 1 
i would avoid this place if you are staying in the mirage 0 
the chicken wings contained the driest chicken meat i have ever eaten 0 
the scenes with the ohsomature neighbourgirl are a misplace 0 
the igo chargers and tips are really great 1 
big disappointment with calendar sync 0 
waited 2 hours never got either of our pizzas as many other around us who came in later did 0 
obviously they have a terrible customer service so you get what you pay for 0 
ive had better not only from dedicated boba tea spots but even from jenni pho 0 
it was clear that she had the range and ability to pull off this part 1 
you can even take self portraits with the outside exterior display very cool 1 
paolo sorrentino has written a wonderful story about loneliness and tony has built one of the most unforgettable characters seen in movies in recent years 1 
it has a great camera thats 2mp and the pics are nice and clear with great picture quality 1 
im a big fan of this series mostly due to anne rices style sensitivities and treatments 1 
its a mediocre miserable hollow laughable and predictable piece of garbage 0 
initially the local sites in the film which was filmed here in buffalo intrigued me 1 
summary the witticisms werent witty 0 
i dont know what the big deal is about this place but i wont be back yaall 0 
as always the evening was wonderful and the food delicious 1 
the pizza tasted old super chewy in not a good way 0 
and sometimes it was so embarrassing that i had to look away 0 
john wayne did an incredible job for being so young in the movie industry 1 
i will come back here every time im in vegas 1 
i loved it 1 
great time family dinner on a sunday night 1 
the plot is nonsense that doesnt interest in the slightest way or have any uniqueness to it 0 
sweetest phone 1 
but in any case the best part is you can download these pictures to your laptop using ir or even send pictures from your laptop to the phone 1 
i find this inexcusable and so will probably be returning this phone and perhaps changing carriers 0 
much better than the other ayce sushi place i went to in vegas 1 
but the actingeven that of such professionals as drago and debbie rochonwas terrible the directing worse perhaps contributory to the former the dialog chimplike and the camera work barely tolerable 0 
im glad the film didnt go for the most obvious choice as a lesser film certainly would have 1 
it works fine on my motorola 325 cellphone and a lot better than the wornout battery did 1 
awesome device 1 
very well made and fits my surefire gx2 perfectly 1 
regrettably the film fails 0 
if you have not seen this movie i definitely recommend it 1 
very very disappointed ordered the 35 big bay plater 0 
very serious spoilers this movie was a huge disappointment 0 
i love this bluetooth 1 
but what really made it unwatchable was the direction 0 
it sure does beat the nachos at the movies but i would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant 0 
this greedy corporation will never see another dime from me 0 
there arent death scenes like in previous movies and the fx are terrible 0 
so i had to take the battery out of the phone put it all back together and then restart it 0 
good service very clean and inexpensive to boot 1 
and i really did find them funny 1 
one of the most disappointing aspects is the lack of notable gore 0 
i can think of no other film where something vitally important occurs every other minute 1 
it didnt work people can not hear me when i talk 0 
i totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is 1 
i struggle to find anything bad to say about it 1 
generally it just lacked imagination 0 
good value works fine power via usb car or wall outlet 1 
instead we got a bore fest about a whiny spoiled brat babysitting 0 
definitely worth checking out 1 
but it picked up speed and got right to the point 1 
went in for happy hour great list of wines 1 
loved the casting of jimmy buffet as the science teacher 1 
oh yeah and the storyline was pathetic too 0 
not easy to watch 0 
it really is impressive that the place hasnt closed down 0 
in fact i liked it better than interview with a vampire and i liked this lestat stuart townsend better than cruises attempt 1 
very very disappointed ordered the 35 big bay plater 0 
the attention given to every character and complex psychological portrayals detailing loyalty treachery love and hope are tremendous 1 
it does everything the description said it would 1 
the best part about nurse betty is its unpredictability 1 
they could be used as exemplars for any set designer 1 
it fits so securely that the ear hook does not even need to be used and the sound is better directed through your ear canal 1 
all in all an excellent restaurant highlighted by great service a unique menu and a beautiful setting 1 
if you want a real scare rent this one 1 
1010 1 
i asked multiple times for the wine list and after some time of being ignored i went to the hostess and got one myself 0 
the best electronics of the available fm transmitters 1 
best of luck to the rude and noncustomer service focused new management 0 
we have gotten a lot of compliments on it 1 
spend your money elsewhere 0 
everything was gross 0 
kind of hard to mess up a steak but they did 0 
still waiting im sure this item would work well if i ever recieve it 0 
ps the only scene in the movie that was cool is when the central character finds her room blown up 1 
it is simple to use and i like it 1 
this was reflected not only in the cast but also in the belowpar script which borrowed much from the earlier classic 0 
the pizza tasted old super chewy in not a good way 0 
nice blanket of moz over top but i feel like this was done to cover up the subpar food 1 
my sanyo has survived dozens of drops on blacktop without ill effect 1 
imdb ratings only go as low 1 for awful its time to get some negative numbers in there for cases such as these 0 
the only thing i did like was the prime rib and dessert section 1 
i cant tell you how disappointed i was 0 
will never ever go back and have told many people what had happened 0 
worked very well paired with a treo 700w and as a skype headset on my pc using a usb bluetooth transceiver 1 
i have eaten here multiple times and each time the food was delicious 1 
jamie foxx absolutely is ray charles 1 
the battery is working well as a replacement for the original that came with the phone over 2 years ago 1 
the ear buds only play music in one ear 0 
the turkey and roast beef were bland 0 
i gave it 5 stars then and im giving it 5 stars now 1 
these products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet 0 
delete this film from your mind 0 
elias koteasjack palance play good roles angelina is hot and gets nakedbilly drago appears in this and is cool as usual a cameo by sven ole thorsen helps make this a very enjoyable movie with good acting and a decent budget 1 
if you are razr owneryou must have this 1 
the camera on the phone may be used as a dustpan when indoors id rather be using a disposable then this 0 
2 times very bad customer service 0 
when i saw it in the theater i thought i was going to be sick 0 
alexander nevsky is a great film 1 
no complaints 1 
was not happy 0 
i checked everywhere and there is no feature for it which is really disappointing 0 
it doesnt make you look cool 0 
this is such a fun and funny movie 1 
simply beautiful 1 
so there is no way for me to plug it in here in the us unless i go by a converter 0 
better than expected 1 
poor reliability 0 
we were promptly greeted and seated 1 
the story is beyond stupid 0 
this product is clearly not ready for prime time i dont care how cool it looks if you cant tell a call is coming in its worthless 0 
this is one of peter watkins most accessible films 1 
we definately enjoyed ourselves 1 
i cant see how this movie can be an inspiration to anyone to come out or overcome fear and rejection 0 
i give it 2 thumbs down 0 
not worth it 0 
very very fun chef 1 
i find this inexcusable and so will probably be returning this phone and perhaps changing carriers 0 
i promise they wont disappoint 1 
voice quality signal strength dropped calls 0 
i never come again 0 
its one of the most boring horror movies from the 90s mainly because it starts slow and centers in a boring atmosphere 0 
i got the aluminum case for my new palm vx and it worked really wellit has protected my handheld perfectly so far 1 
i dont understand how this garbage got on the shelves of the movie store its not even a real movie 0 
the sound quality is good and functionality is awesome 1 
its just painful 0 
the service was meh 0 
the dining space is tiny but elegantly decorated and comfortable 1 
aailiyah was pretty good as akasha in places compelling her first entrance and mini dance scene 1 
the worst one of the series 0 
i could not stand to even watch it for very long for fear of losing iq 0 
this is truly an art movieit actually has a lot of art in it 1 
the flat reenactments dont hold your attention because they are emotionally adrift and stagy 0 
the steaks are all well trimmed and also perfectly cooked 1 
i struggle to find anything bad to say about it 1 
spend your money elsewhere 0 
its a total package 1 
it was a great phone 1 
we had a group of 70 when we claimed we would only have 40 and they handled us beautifully 1 
is pretty funny 1 
the flair bartenders are absolutely amazing 1 
price is good too 1 
very poor service 0 
very comfortable 1 
plug was the wrong size 0 
its hard not to fall headoverheels in love with that girl 1 
the script is was there a script 0 
i am so pleased to know such a modern day genius is out there letting is passion for art drive him and taking us as an audience with him 1 
this film has no redeeming features 0 
highly recommended for all ages although the younger set will probably not appreciate some of the more subtle references they will certainly appreciate one galley scene in particular 1 
after one bite i was hooked 1 
i would recommend purchasing the jabra jx10 series 2 which works flawlessly with my moto q go figure 1 
now the burgers arent as good the pizza which used to be amazing is doughy and flavorless 0 
i was so insulted 0 
im glad i found this product on amazon it is hard to find it wasnt high priced 1 
the only thing really worth watching was the scenery and the house because it is beautiful 1 
this allows the possibility of double booking for the same date and time after the first 0 
seriously killer hot chai latte 1 
no shifting no bubbling no peeling not even a scratch nothingi couldnt be more happier with my new one for the droid 1 
when my order arrived one of the gyros was missing 0 
simple lightweight and great fit 1 
this blueant supertooth handsfree phone speaker is awesome 1 
items stated as included from the description are not included 0 
this if the first movie ive given a 10 to in years 1 
i wont spoil it but the ending in pretty amazing 1 
i go to far too many places and ive never seen any restaurant that serves a 1 egg breakfast especially for 400 0 
i believe that this place is a great stop for those with a huge belly and hankering for sushi 1 
in an interesting part of town this place is amazing 1 
the yellowtail carpaccio was melt in your mouth fresh 1 
total letdown i would much rather just go to the camelback flower shop and cartel coffee 0 
this product is great it makes working a lot easier i can go to the copier while waiting on hold for something 1 
i had ordered a motorola data cable got a very well finished and working product 1 
hes a national treasure 1 
i was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar not only because the quality is great but the service is fast and the food impeccable 1 
i was sitting in my vehicle with the cradle on my belt and the headset lost signal 0 
the performances are not improved by improvisation because the actors now have twice as much to worry about not only whether theyre delivering the line well but whether the line itself is any good 0 
this device is great in several situations1 1 
i am far from a sushi connoisseur but i can definitely tell the difference between good food and bad food and this was certainly bad food 0 
i thought errol flynn was brilliant as custer and has since become my favourite actor 1 
w810i is just superb 1 
i am very impressed with this headset from plantronics 1 
im not sure how long we stood there but it was long enough for me to begin to feel awkwardly out of place 0 
food was good service was good prices were good 1 
at first glance it is a lovely bakery cafe nice ambiance clean friendly staff 1 
it finds my cell phone right away when i enter the car 1 
terrible phone holder 0 
now this is a movie i really dislike 0 
hes a national treasure 1 
the fries were great too 1 
i will continue to come here on ladies night andddd date night highly recommend this place to anyone who is in the area 1 
if it were possible to give them zero stars theyd have it 0 
the speaker is of low quality so as making the ring tones sound very cheap 0 
the fries were great too 1 
there is a lot of beautiful places 1 
there is simply no excuse for something this poorly done 0 
it dit not work most of the time with my nokia 5320 0 
case was more or less an extra that i originally put on but later discarded because it scratched my ear 0 
the potatoes were like rubber and you could tell they had been made up ahead of time being kept under a warmer 0 
very prompt service 1 
i have only had it for a few weeks but so far so good 1 
they keep getting better and better this is my third one and ive had numerous palms too 1 
his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic 1 
as a sushi lover avoid this place by all means 0 
it has everything i need and i couldnt ask for more 1 
the presentation of the food was awful 0 
we loved the place 1 
it wasnt busy either also the building was freezing cold 0 
for service i give them no stars 0 
very serious spoilers this movie was a huge disappointment 0 
you share general loewenhielms exquisite joy in his partaking of the cailles en sarcophage even though you are just watching a movie but you do wish for just a small sample to savor 1 
big disappointment with calendar sync 0 
and his subtle connections between the three films are awesome 1 
phone falls out easily 0 
perhaps i caught them on an off night judging by the other reviews but im not inspired to go back 0 
all in all i think it was a good investment 1 
nothing at all to recommend 0 
the only thing i wasnt too crazy about was their guacamole as i dont like it puréed 0 
avoid at any and all costs 0 
easy to use 1 
now you know why i gave it a 10 1 
i purchased this and within 2 days it was no longer working 0 
it is the best charger i have seen on the market yet 1 
if you love death and decay and shakespears lyrics this is the one 1 
this film highlights the fundamental flaws of the legal process that its not about discovering guilt or innocence but rather is about who presents better in court 1 
definitely worth checking out 1 
there was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth but it didnt really work into the rest of the plot 0 
i was particularly pleased with the acting ability of dwight schultz 1 
i like design and look of jabra behing the ear headsets and 5020 is pretty comfortible to wear 24 hours a day without pain in the ear 1 
it was so cool 1 
the noise shield is incrediable 1 
if you stay in vegas you must get breakfast here at least once 1 
she carries the movie well 1 
they do not care about the consumer one bit 0 
what makes this story different are the terrific production values faultless photography composition and editing the terrific casting the underappreciated brian keith playing a bully teddy and vivid history 1 
it was that year however that reminded us that huston was still at the top of his game as evinced by his faithful adaptation of james joyces acclaimed novella the dead 1 
otherwise easy to install and use clear sound 1 
dont waste your money 0 
this product is clearly not ready for prime time i dont care how cool it looks if you cant tell a call is coming in its worthless 0 
love this product 1 
the price is reasonable and the service is great 1 
i thought errol flynn was brilliant as custer and has since become my favourite actor 1 
took an hour to get our food only 4 tables in restaurant my food was luke warm our sever was running around like he was totally overwhelmed 0 
the bipolarity of the ruthless thug one minute a ruthless killer the next minute a luvs diaper commercial is completely unconvincing 0 
exceptionally bad 0 
this fixes all the problems 1 
the yellowtail carpaccio was melt in your mouth fresh 1 
ill be looking for a new earpiece 0 
awesome service and food 1 
that movie was bad 0 
spend your money and time some place else 0 
the worst phone ive ever had only had it for a few months 0 
how can you call yourself a steakhouse if you cant properly cook a steak i dont understand 0 
no complaints 1 
the battery is completely useless to me 0 
we got sitting fairly fast but ended up waiting 40 minutes just to place our order another 30 minutes before the food arrived 0 
hes a national treasure 1 
i highly recommend these and encourage people to give them a try 1 
things that went wrong they burned the saganaki 0 
1010 1 
great value 1 
not only did the software do a great job of this i could also make my own ringtones form my existing cds without an internet connection 1 
that movie was bad 0 
the feel of the dining room was more college cooking course than high class dining and the service was slow at best 0 
it was so boring 0 
50 down the drain 0 
dont waste your time 0 
the film is way too long 0 
i am so tired of clichés that is just lazy writing and here they come in thick and fast 0 
totally believable 1 
then i watched it again two sundays ago march 20th 2005 and i began to really enjoy it and this time i taped the entire thing 1 
it wasnt busy at all and now we know why 0 
kind of hard to mess up a steak but they did 0 
to my disbelief each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods i have ever tasted 0 
i keep watching it over and over 1 
i hope this place sticks around 1 
it did not work in my cell phone plug i am very up set with the charger 0 
the buttons for on and off are bad 0 
very very disappointed ordered the 35 big bay plater 0 
this if the first movie ive given a 10 to in years 1 
this is one of the better buffets that i have been to 1 
disappointing 0 
best headset ever 1 
the best example of how dumb the writing is when its established that you can turn the zombiestudents back into humans by removing a necklace containing a piece of the meteorite 0 
much better than the other ayce sushi place i went to in vegas 1 
if you dont find it too bad as again the unit comes with one earpad onlyi would not recommend this to anyone 0 
sooooo good 1 
its like a bad two hour tv movie 0 
did not like at all 0 
the stories were as unbelievable as the actors 0 
it is wonderful and inspiring to watch and i hope that it gets released again on to video or dvd 1 
this phone is slim and light and the display is beautiful 1 
if the food isnt bad enough for you then enjoy dealing with the worlds worstannoying drunk people 0 
check it out 1 
it kept getting worse and worse so now im officially done 0 
linked to my phone without effort 1 
the food wasnt good 0 
cute quaint simple honest 1 
the soundtrack wasnt terrible either 1 
the sound quality for the device is unacceptableunless you are in a really quiet area you almost hear nothing 0 
the jalapeno bacon is soooo good 1 
this totally unfunny movie is so over the top and pathetic and unrealistic that throughout the whole 90 minutes of utter torture i probably looked at my watch about 70000 times 0 
you learn a lot about the real inside emotions of people in this movie and a lot about the movie business itself 1 
i live in the neighborhood so i am disappointed i wont be back here because it is a convenient location 0 
all it took was one drop from about 6 inches above the kitchen counter and it was crackedi am not impressed and i am not laughing 0 
the acting from all involved and that includes those like shatner and nimoy is bad and washed out and making them seem as old as they look in real life the special effects are tacky like when spock has to rescue kirk on a jet pack when he falls down from a mountain 0 
i keep watching it over and over 1 
my gyro was basically lettuce only 0 
works great 1 
not as good as i had hoped 0 
i enjoyed it 1 
personally i think it shows that people should learn to find a compromise them self without involving other people into issue 1 
this movie now joins revenge of the boogeyman and zombiez as part of the hellish trinity of horror films 0 
this company charge me a restocking fee and still not given me my refund back 0 
definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly will return next time im in vegas 1 
the real disappointment was our waiter 0 
ive only had my bluetooth for a few weeks but i really like it 1 
food arrived quickly 1 
i did not have any problem with this item and would order it again if needed 1 
appears to actually outperform the original battery from china that came with my v325i 1 
cinematography noteworthy including fine views of barcelona and its famed gaudi towers 1 
lame would be the best way to describe it 0 
ill give this film 10 out of 10 1 
the only possible way this movie could be redeemed would be as mst3k fodder 0 
i as well wouldve given godfathers zero stars if possible 0 
people couldnt hear me talk and i had to pull out the earphone and talk on the phone 0 
everything about it is just bad 0 
this movie is terrible 0 
classywarm atmosphere fun and fresh appetizers succulent steaks baseball steak 1 
the success of the film depends on the casting of sydney greenstreet as the alexander yardley character 1 
it was also the right balance of war and love 1 
walked in and the place smelled like an old grease trap and only 2 others there eating 0 
often the dialogue doesnt really follow from one line to another or fit the surroundings 0 
the acting is beyond abysmal 0 
he came running after us when he realized my husband had left his sunglasses on the table 1 
too bad cause i know its family owned i really wanted to like this place 0 
this is my new fav vegas buffet spot 1 
leopard print is wonderfully wild 1 
you learn a lot about the real inside emotions of people in this movie and a lot about the movie business itself 1 
light weight i hardly notice it is there 1 
i want to first say our server was great and we had perfect service 1 
although i very much liked the look and sound of this place the actual experience was a bit disappointing 0 
lastly the mozzarella sticks they were the best thing we ordered 1 
but i definitely would not eat here again 0 
there was a warm feeling with the service and i felt like their guest for a special treat 1 
i believe every one should see this movie as i think few people outside of south africa understand its past and what is being attempted in the truth and reconciliation process 1 
this phone is very fast with sending any kind of messages and web browsing is significantly faster than previous phones i have used 1 
i went on motorolas website and followed all directions but could not get it to pair again 0 
food was great and so was the serivce 1 
gets a signal when other verizon phones wont 1 
i contacted the company and they told me that although the unit was still under warranty if i couldnt produce my receipt i was out of luck 0 
the dialogue is composed of things that make little sense 0 
it was forced like everything in this movie 0 
this place is not quality sushi it is not a quality restaurant 0 
the nano stated itmy son was dissapointed 0 
highly unrecommended 0 
setup went very smoothly 1 
poor reliability 0 
best tacos in town by far 1 
there are the usual hitchcock logic flaws 0 
the shower area is outside so you can only rinse not take a full shower unless you dont mind being nude for everyone to see 0 
i only hear garbage for audio 0 
seriously flavorful delights folks 1 
i can say that the desserts were yummy 1 
the only thing i wasnt too crazy about was their guacamole as i dont like it puréed 0 
however bt headsets are currently not good for real time games like firstperson shooters since the audio delay messes me up 0 
disappointing 0 
this place is way too overpriced for mediocre food 0 
i must say i have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again 1 
both actors truly understand and become their particular character delivering a convincing sincere performance 1 
worst service to boot but that is the least of their worries 0 
terrible phone holder 0 
i also didnt like the on button it felt like it would crack with use 0 
the loudspeaker option is great the bumpers with the lights is very appealing 0 
what a waste 0 
uncomfortable in the ear dont use with lg vx9900 env 0 
this movie does an excellent job of revealing the complexity of the task and the incredible challenges facing south africa 1 
highly recommend for any one who has a blue tooth phone 1 
very dissapointing performance 0 
again lame 0 
then theres the plot holes 0 
oh the charger seems to work fine 1 
wasted two hours 0 
that company is a joke 0 
very friendly staff 1 
i dont have very many words to say about this place but it does everything pretty well 1 
why was this film made 0 
also notable is john baileys fine crisp beautifully colored cinematography and the great production design costumes by eiko ishioka who went on to do the memorable costumes for coppolas dracula for which she received a well deserved oscar 1 
the kids are annoying 0 
too bad cause i know its family owned i really wanted to like this place 0 
the movie seemed a little slow at first 0 
excellent product for the price 1 
i do love sushi but i found kabuki to be overpriced overhip and underservices 0 
this was my first time and i cant wait until the next 1 
one of my favorite purchases ever 1 
howeverthe riingtones are not the best and neither are the games 0 
however this didnt make up for the fact that overall this was a tremendously boring movie 0 
the refried beans that came with my meal were dried out and crusty and the food was bland 0 
it probably would have been better if the director hadnt spent most of the movie showcasing his own art work which really isnt that noteworthy 0 
i enjoyed reading this book to my children when they were little 1 
if you are reading this please dont go there 0 
this is a witty and delightful adaptation of the dr seuss book brilliantly animated by upas finest and thoroughly deserving of its academy award 1 
bad purchase 0 
i have had this phone for over a year now and i will tell you its not that great 0 
the yellowtail carpaccio was melt in your mouth fresh 1 
i love the camera its really pretty good quality 1 
muddy low quality sound and the casing around the wires insert was poorly super glued and slid off 0 
i love the look and feel of samsung flipphones 1 
this is the place where i first had pho and it was amazing 1 
im not eating here 0 
the film gives meaning to the phrase never in the history of human conflict has so much been owed by so many to so few 1 
server did a great job handling our large rowdy table 1 
this was my first and only vegas buffet and it did not disappoint 1 
best ive found so far ive tried 2 other bluetooths and this one has the best quality for both me and the listener as well as ease of using 1 
dont bother coming here 0 
i have two more years left in this contract and i hate this phone 0 
20th century foxs road house 1948 is not only quite a silly noir but is an implausible unmitigated bore of a movie 0 
plus it was wellpaced and suited its relatively short run time 1 
but even the talented carrell cant save this 0 
food was really boring 0 
everything was fresh and delicious 1 
i cant tell you how disappointed i was 0 
i dont think ill be running back to carlys anytime soon for food 0 
i ordered albondigas soup which was just warm and tasted like tomato soup with frozen meatballs 0 
the movie lacks visual interest drama expression of feeling and celebration of the very patriotism that underlines the narrative 0 
my phone doesnt slide around my car now and the grip prevents my phone from slipping out of my hand 1 
say bye bye to your tip lady 0 
some great music and terrific scenery 1 
i didnt want the clip going over the top of my ear causing discomfort 0 
both actors truly understand and become their particular character delivering a convincing sincere performance 1 
better than youd expect 1 
this is a really fantastic thai restaurant which is definitely worth a visit 1 
the awful dialogue and hopeless overacting by everyone who gets shot top off a real waste of space and time 0 
do not purchase this phone 0 
everything about this product is wrongfirst 0 
i saw this film over christmas and what a great film it was 1 
in addition it feels amp looks as if the phone is all lightweight cheap plastic 0 
the potato chip order was sad i could probably count how many chips were in that box and it was probably around 12 0 
i rather enjoyed it 1 
the very idea of it was lame take a minor character from a mediocre pg13 film and make a complete nonsequel while changing its tone to a pgrated family movie 0 
truly awful 0 
however the ear pads come off easily and after only one week i lost one 0 
the cocktails are all handmade and delicious 1 
the steak and the shrimp are in my opinion the best entrees at gc 1 
highly recommended a 1 
not loud enough and doesnt turn on like it should 0 
i just dont know how this place managed to served the blandest food i have ever eaten when they are preparing indian cuisine 0 
his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic 1 
this place lacked style 0 
not a good item it worked for a while then started having problems in my auto reverse tape player 0 
keep up the good work amazon 1 
i have always used corded headsets and the freedom from the wireless is very helpful 1 
this phone tries very hard to do everything but fails at its very ability to be a phone 0 
i didnt realize how wonderful the short really is until the last two scenes 1 
the awful dialogue and hopeless overacting by everyone who gets shot top off a real waste of space and time 0 
good prices 1 
of course the footage from the 70s was grainy but that only enhanced the film 1 
it probably would have been better if the director hadnt spent most of the movie showcasing his own art work which really isnt that noteworthy 0 
anyway the plot flowed smoothly and the malebonding scenes were a hoot 1 
also makes it easier to hold on to 1

it kept getting worse and worse so now im officially done 0 
the buffet at bellagio was far from what i anticipated 0 
i advise everyone do not be fooled 0 
it looses connection to the phone even when it is within a couple feet between the two 0 
i have seen many movies starring jaclyn smith but my god this was one of her best though it came out 12 years ago 1 
if you want healthy authentic or ethic food try this place 1 
appetite instantly gone 0 
sweetest phone 1 
well packaged arrived on time and works as intended 1 
this short film certainly pulls no punches 0 
bad purchase 0 
works great 1 
the opening sequence of this gem is a classic and the cat n mouse games that follow are a delight to watch 1 
you need at least 3 mins to get to your phone book from the time you first turn on the phonebattery life is short 0 
bad quality 0 
the success of the film depends on the casting of sydney greenstreet as the alexander yardley character 1 
terrible product and waste of money 0 
the feel of the dining room was more college cooking course than high class dining and the service was slow at best 0 
i think this restaurant suffers from not trying hard enough 0 
everything from acting to cinematography was solid 1 
it was awesome 1 
strike 2 who wants to be rushed 0 
this movie is excellentangel is beautiful and scamp is adorablehis little yelps when hes scaredand the funniest parts are whenscamp is caught under the curtain and when angel and scamp are singing ive never had this feeling beforei totally recommend this movieits coming out on special edition on june 20the cover has scamp on a garbage can and angel underneath the lid 1 
there is no real plot 0 
this movie creates its own universe and is fascinating in every way 1 
i might have gotten a defect but i would not risk buying it again because of the built quality alone 0 
the dialogue sucked 0 
bland not a liking this place for a number of reasons and i dont want to waste time on bad reviewing ill leave it at that 0 
a pretty good product 1 
so i am here to warn youdo not rent this movie it is the dumbest thing you have never seen 0 
i will never forget it now 1 
the classic maine lobster roll was fantastic 1 
this place is good 1 
all things considered a job very well done 1 
great product 1 
arrived quickly and much less expensive than others being sold 1 
im not really sure how joeys was voted best hot dog in the valley by readers of phoenix magazine 0 
think it over when you plan to own this onethis sure is the last moto phone for me 0 
the restaurant is very clean and has a family restaurant feel to it 1 
funny clever hip just like prays previous film hype 1 
awesome service and food 1 
after watching this film i wanted to learn more about the works of this artist 1 
one more thing i can tolerate political incorrectness very well im all for artistic freedom and suspension of disbelief but the slavic female character was just too much 0 
horrible horrible protector 0 
it was pretty gross 0 
love this phone 1 
weve tried to like this place but after 10 times i think were done with them 0 
the structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema 1 
2 thumbs up to this seller 1 
its been my choice headset for yearsgreat sound good volume good noise cancellation 1 
nine out of ten for a truly lovely film 1 
by the time the film ended i not only disliked it i despised it 0 
youll love how thin it is 1 
very bad experience 0 
worst foodservice ive had in a while 0 
it isnt even an achievement as a sobaditsgood or sobaditsmemorable movie 0 
we had so much to say about the place before we walked in that he expected it to be amazing but was quickly disappointed 0 
sooooo good 1 
what a disappointment 0 
the film deserves strong kudos for taking this stand for having exceptional acting from its mostly lesserknown cast and for the superintelligent script that doesnt insult the audience or take the easy way out when it comes to white racism 1 
the real disappointment was our waiter 0 
on the negative its insipid enough to cause regret for another 2 hours of life wasted in front of the screen 0 
i used bitpim a free program you can find on the internetto transfer data to the phonethe price of the cable was excellent 1 
star trek v the final frontier is the worst in the series 0 
the problem was the script 0 
this phone works great 1 
so good i am going to have to review this place twice once hereas a tribute to the place and once as a tribute to an event held here last night 1 
this place receives stars for their appetizers 1 
lightweight and works well 1 
best tater tots in the southwest 1 
i love this thing 1 
this place lacked style 0 
the descriptions said yum yum sauce and another said eel sauce yet another said spicy mayowell none of the rolls had sauces on them 0 
this greedy corporation will never see another dime from me 0 
it was not good 0 
the only consistent thread holding the series together were the amazing performances of leni parker and anita laselva as the two taelons in quiet idealogical conflict 0 
i could eat their bruschetta all day it is devine 1 
i felt insulted and disrespected how could you talk and judge another human being like that 0 
then theres the plot holes 0 
what a mistake 0 
the puppets look really cheesy not in a good way like in the puppet master 80s flicks 0 
cute quaint simple honest 1 
i guess i should have known that this place would suck because it is inside of the excalibur but i didnt use my common sense 0 
at around 4 pm i bought it at around 8pm i started to watch at around 815pm i fast forwarded the remaining film to see if there was anything left watchable for a human being with a brain but there wasnt 0 
the movie had you on the edge of your seat and made you somewhat afraid to go to your car at the end of the night 1 
also were served hot bread and butter and home made potato chips with bacon bits on topvery original and very good 1 
when i saw it in the theater i thought i was going to be sick 0 
it is light has plenty of battery capacity and is very confortable to wear for somewhat extended periods of time 1 
one of my favorite purchases ever 1 
this item is fantastic and works perfectly 1 
the basic premise is wasted since it is sidelined by the inexplicable focus on the documentary crew 0 
the pleather case doesnt fit 0 
all in all id expected a better consumer experience from motorola 0 
tom wilkinson broke my heart at the end and everyone elses judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike 1 
the soundtrack sucked 0 
thanks again to amazon for having the things i need for a good price 1 
four stars for the food the guy in the blue shirt for his great vibe still letting us in to eat 1 
the worst piece of crap ever along with the verizon customer service 0 
this case seems well made 1 
lifetime does not air it enough so if anyone knows what store sells it let me know because this is a musthave 1 
the mic is great 1 
that was funny 1 
nothing special 0 
everything was fresh and delicious 1 
great audio 1 
maybe if they werent cold they would have been somewhat edible 0 
horrible phone 0 
nice leather 1 
even when the women finally show up there is no sign of improvement the most expected things happen and by the time the film is over you might be far asleep 0 
when i received my pita it was huge it did have a lot of meat in it so thumbs up there 1 
i didnt realize how wonderful the short really is until the last two scenes 1 
i would recommend saving room for this 1 
we wont be going back anytime soon 0 
i like the fact that it rests lightly against your ear rather than inside 1 
which are small and not worth the price 0 
lasted one day and then blew up 0 
worst foodservice ive had in a while 0 
unfortunately it will not recharge my iphone 4s despite connecting it from multiple power sources imac external battery wall outlet etc 0 
worst ever 0 
insults profound deuchebaggery and had to go outside for a smoke break while serving just to solidify it 0 
waste your money on this game 1 
the service was poor and thats being nice 0 
if good intentions made a film great then this film might be one of the greatest films ever made 1 
disappointment i hate anything that goes in my ear 0 
the whole experience was underwhelming and i think well just go to ninja sushi next time 0 
i really wanted the plantronics 510 to be the right one but it has too many issues for methe good 0 
dont make the same mistake that i did and please dont buy this phone 0 
ive dropped my phone more times than i can say even on concrete and my phone is still great knock on wood 1 
the phone loads super 1 
this place receives stars for their appetizers 1 
you need two hands to operate the screenthis software interface is decade old and cannot compete with new software designs 0 
at any rate this film stinks its not funny and fulci should have stayed with giallo and supernatural zombie movies 0 
this is a chilly unremarkable movie about an author livingworking in a chilly abstruse culture 0 
works like a charm it work the same as the one i got with the phone 1 
the phone gets extremely hot 0 
awesome selection of beer 1 
one of my favorite purchases ever 1 
ill give this film 10 out of 10 1 
what a disappointment 0 
the script is a big flawed mess 0 
it has northern humour and positive about the community it represents 1 
this is cool because most cases are just open there allowing the screen to get all scratched up 1 
still waiting im sure this item would work well if i ever recieve it 0 
gave up trying to eat any of the crust teeth still sore 0 
i love the pho and the spring rolls oh so yummy you have to try 1 
linked to my phone without effort 1 
i am not a filmmaker nor am i a director but i would hide my head in the sand if id spent whatever amount of money and time on this movie 0 
maybe if they werent cold they would have been somewhat edible 0 
the only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port irda 0 
i like the fact that it rests lightly against your ear rather than inside 1 
one more thing i can tolerate political incorrectness very well im all for artistic freedom and suspension of disbelief but the slavic female character was just too much 0 
utter crap sound quality is terrible 0 
the incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film 1 
i highly recommend this movie for anyone interested in art poetry theater politics or japanese history 1 
the instruction manual is lacking 0 
this product had a strong rubberpetroleum smell that was unbearable after a while and caused me to return it 0 
this movie now joins revenge of the boogeyman and zombiez as part of the hellish trinity of horror films 0 
great hands free device 1 
worst customer service 0 
what a waste 0 
always a great time at dos gringos 1 
perhaps i caught them on an off night judging by the other reviews but im not inspired to go back 0 
could not get strong enough signal 0 
this was reflected not only in the cast but also in the belowpar script which borrowed much from the earlier classic 0 
that company is a joke 0 
i recommend this for everyone who loves film movies anythinga work of art 1 
it features an outlandish array of memorable psychotic but lovable nuts 1 
i love this phone 1 
i was deeply impressed with the character he played 1 
he was extremely rude and really there are so many other restaurants i would love to dine at during a weekend in vegas 0 
i also decided not to send it back because our waitress looked like she was on the verge of having a heart attack 0 
the jerky camera movements were also annoying 0 
totally different with loads of understatement and black comedy this is a film few get to see but those who do will remember it 1 
the only thing that i think could improve is the sound leaks out from the headset 0 
service was very prompt 1 
these products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet 0 
the nano stated itmy son was dissapointed 0 
pretty piece of junk 0 
ill even say it again  this is torture 0 
took an hour to get our food only 4 tables in restaurant my food was luke warm our sever was running around like he was totally overwhelmed 0 
everything about this movie is stupid 0 
very very disappointed ordered the 35 big bay plater 0 
its one of the movies i need to see whenever it comes on tvnever mind the fact that i already have it memorized 1 
i bought this to use with my kindle fire and absolutely loved it 1 
defective crap 0 
i would avoid this place if you are staying in the mirage 0 
they have been around for years and carries the highest quality of antiglare screen protector that i have found to date 1 
third the cheese on my friends burger was cold 0 
i immediately said i wanted to talk to the manager but i did not want to talk to the guy who was doing shots of fireball behind the bar 0 
excellent hands free tool 1 
in fact this stinker smells like a directtovideo release 0 
you share general loewenhielms exquisite joy in his partaking of the cailles en sarcophage even though you are just watching a movie but you do wish for just a small sample to savor 1 
an awesome new look for fall 2000 1 
penne vodka excellent 1 
a usable keyboard actually turns a pda into a realworld useful machine instead of just a neat gadget 1 
i would not recommend this place 0 
the characters are interesting even if a bit predictable 1 
i got to enjoy the seafood salad with a fabulous vinegrette 1 
the problem i have is that they charge 1199 for a sandwich that is no bigger than a subway sub which offers better and more amount of vegetables 0 
all the actors give a wonderful performance especially jennifer rubin as jamie harris who changes from the nervous starlet in the beginning through the strange events she is part of to the cool star 1 
a piece of cinematic garbage captured on celluloid 0 
during several different 2 minute calls i experienced 5 drops and it was in an area that had 5 bars 0 
it never condescends all the characters have good genuine hearts and believable problems 1 
but the premise of the film was so ridiculous that the president of the us 0 
i would advise to not purchase this item it never worked very well 0 
but it is great i would really recommend it 1 
macbeth jason connery moved me to tears with his final monolog out brief candle outhe gave the sphere of moral decay and dark forces a human face which makes it the more interesting 1 
food was average at best 0 
not even a hello we will be right with you 0 
i saw it as a child on tv back in 1973 when it was the stranger and i loved it 1 
lame would be the best way to describe it 0 
this item worked great but it broke after 6 months of use 0 
its uncomfortable and the sound quality is quite poor compared with the phone razr or with my previous wired headset that plugged into an lg 0 
my drink was never empty and he made some really great menu suggestions 1 
not much flavor to them and very poorly constructed 0 
they have a really nice atmosphere 1 
i have never had such bland food which surprised me considering the article we read focused so much on their spices and flavor 0 
the headset fulfills my requirements so i am happy with my purchase 1 
the warm beer didnt help 0 
not easy to watch 0 
great phone 1 
overall a great experience 1 
here in the wind and the lion we see a wonderful rendering of americas own imperial age 1 
babie bop is very cute 1 
and if that isnt enough of a mess of a movie for you the picture is also marred with a constant use of studio sets and indoor exteriors 0 
i was shocked because no signs indicate cash only 0 
if there is a wind it is completely useless 0 
very tough and very short on flavor 0 
warning stay away 0 
it was either too cold not enough flavor or just bad 0 
do not buy do not buyit sucks 0 
the scenes with the ohsomature neighbourgirl are a misplace 0 
i have always used corded headsets and the freedom from the wireless is very helpful 1 
hayao miyazakis latest and eighth film for studio ghibili gake no ue no ponyo ponyo on the cliff by the sea is a wonderfully fun and imaginative look at childhood 1 
if she had not rolled the eyes we may have stayed not sure if we will go back and try it again 0 
this phone is very fast with sending any kind of messages and web browsing is significantly faster than previous phones i have used 1 
there is no plot here to keep you going in the first place 0 
everything from acting to cinematography was solid 1 
the worst phone from samsungcrap this crappy samsung e715 is the worst i have ever seeen 0 
bluetooth does not work phone locks up screens just flash up and now it just makes calls randomly while in my pocket locked 0 
but i definitely would not eat here again 0 
my boyfriend and i came here for the first time on a recent trip to vegas and could not have been more pleased with the quality of food and service 1 
i totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is 1 
what did bother me was the slow service 0 
i was mortified 0 
if there is a wind it is completely useless 0 
really awful 0 
happy so far 1 
plug was the wrong size 0 
useless phone simply deaf 0 
the movie lacks visual interest drama expression of feeling and celebration of the very patriotism that underlines the narrative 0 
you wont regret it 1 
i struggle to find anything bad to say about it 1 
people couldnt hear me talk and i had to pull out the earphone and talk on the phone 0 
very serious spoilers this movie was a huge disappointment 0 
dont waste your on this one 0 
this pda rocks 1 
but if you liked movies like the matrix and better yet their sequels i think youll appreciate the thought provoking mindblowing experience this film will give you 1 
i have two more years left in this contract and i hate this phone 0 
exactly what i wanted 1 
i had high hopes for this place since the burgers are cooked over a charcoal grill but unfortunately the taste fell flat way flat 0 
doesnt last long 0 
this particular model would not work with my motorola q smartphone 0 
the staff is always super friendly and helpful which is especially cool when you bring two small boys and a baby 1 
this battery is an excellent bargain 1 
i received my orders well within the shipping timeframe everything was in good working order and overall i am very excited to have this source 1 
the live music on fridays totally blows 0 
this place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver 0 
this is my new fav vegas buffet spot 1 
so bad 0 
i hate writing bad reviews about films especially those in which i really like the star but this film is so bad i dont believe for one second that anyone could have been proud of it 0 
the plot is nonsense that doesnt interest in the slightest way or have any uniqueness to it 0 
utter crap sound quality is terrible 0 
buttons are too small 0 
works great when my cat attacked the phone he scratched the protective strip instead of destroying the screen 1 
both the hot sour the egg flower soups were absolutely 5 stars 1 
the script is a big flawed mess 0 
o my gosh the best phone i have ever had 1 
the folks at otto always make us feel so welcome and special 1 
worst foodservice ive had in a while 0 
if you have not seen this movie i definitely recommend it 1 
everything stinks 0 
w810i is just superb 1 
i felt as though her going to ireland did absolutely nothing whatsoever 0 
how can you call yourself a steakhouse if you cant properly cook a steak i dont understand 0 
ill be looking for a new earpiece 0 
the seasonal fruit was fresh white peach puree 1 
this phone might well be the worst ive ever had in any brand 0 
i love lane but ive never seen her in a movie this lousy 0 
thanks again to amazon for having the things i need for a good price 1 
this is such a fun and funny movie 1 
i am very impressed with the job that motorola did on the sturdiness of this phone 1 
a drive thru means you do not want to wait around for half an hour for your food but somehow when we end up going here they make us wait and wait 0 
when achille and philippa beautifully sing a duet from don giovanni that perfectly describes their situation in the movie you appreciate the subtle layers of this excellent film 1 
the voice recognition thru the handset is excellent 1 
disappointed 0 
the worst sappiest dialogue i could go on and on 0 
that was done in the second movie 0 
i found the product to be easy to set up and use 1 
none of it works just dont buy it 0 
it was packed 0 
good product good seller 1 
its the best headset i have used 1 
i waited and waited 0 
dont buy it 0 
i would definitely recommend the jabra bt250v for those who are looking for comfort clarity and a great price 1 
i saw this film over christmas and what a great film it was 1 
im in az all the time and now have my new spot 1 
it was awesome 1 
mobile phone tools are a must have 1 
defective crap 0 
its a shame to see good actors like thomerson and james make a living in a mess like this 0 
a piece of junk that broke after being on my phone for 2 days 0 
oh and i forgot to also mention the weird color effect it has on your phone 0 
id like to return it 0 
the soundtrack wasnt terrible either 1 
this is my new fav vegas buffet spot 1 
the classic maine lobster roll was fantastic 1 
there is so much good food in vegas that i feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to rice and company 0 
we thought youd have to venture further away to get good sushi but this place really hit the spot that night 1 
50 down the drain 0 
still its quite interesting and entertaining to follow 1 
the live music on fridays totally blows 0 
i saw this movie and i thought this is a stupid movie 0 
the menu had so much good stuff on it i could not decide 1 
the best part about nurse betty is its unpredictability 1 
finally after three or four times the spring of the latch broke and i could not use it any longer on the visor 0 
this item is great installed it let it charged up overnite and it has been working good every since with no problems 1 
i dont like this nokia either 0 
there was a warm feeling with the service and i felt like their guest for a special treat 1 
lame would be the best way to describe it 0 
truly awful 0 
when im on this side of town this will definitely be a spot ill hit up again 1 
in my house i was getting dropped coverage upstairs and no coverage in my basement 0 
the performances are real and gripping the crocdodile is extremely well done indeed if the black water website is to be believed thats because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous 1 
when achille and philippa beautifully sing a duet from don giovanni that perfectly describes their situation in the movie you appreciate the subtle layers of this excellent film 1 
has been working great 1 
after i pulled up my car i waited for another 15 minutes before being acknowledged 0 
but the service was beyond bad 0 
its hard not to fall headoverheels in love with that girl 1 
dessert panna cotta was amazing 1 
great price too 1 
an interesting premise and billy drago is always good as a dangerous nutbag side note id love to see drago stephen mchattie and lance hendrikson in a flick together talk about raging cheekbones 1 
the phone was unusable and was not new 0 
best tater tots in the southwest 1 
i vomited in the bathroom mid lunch 0 
but i thought his acting was skilled 1 
i checked out this place a couple years ago and was not impressed 0 
from what my dinner companions told meeverything was very fresh with nice texture and taste 1 
this is a good joint 1 
the first time i ever came here i had an amazing experience i still tell people how awesome the duck was 1 
i felt asleep the first time i watched it so i can recommend it for insomniacs 0 
if there was ever an indication of a writer and a directors ability to meld two highly volatile temperaments into a seamless union of creativity then this is it 1 
the movie showed a lot of florida at its best made it look very appealing 1 
how this piece of trash was ever released is beyond me the acting the story the characters the supposedly special effects etcits all wrong 0 
best fish ive ever had in my life 1 
wed definitely go back here again 1 
this is the first phone ive had that has been so cheaply made 0 
this was a poor remake of my best friends wedding 0 
the entire audience applauded at the conclusion of the film 1 
you learn a lot about the real inside emotions of people in this movie and a lot about the movie business itself 1 
in a word it is embarrassing 0 
the 12 mega pixel camera being a part of a phone is reasonably good7 1 
very disappointing 0 
the restaurant is very clean and has a family restaurant feel to it 1 
it holds a charge for a long time is reasonably comfortable under longwearing conditions and the quality of sound is tremendous 1 
kind of hard to mess up a steak but they did 0 
garbo who showed right off the bat that her talents could carry over from the silent era i wanted to see some of her silent work but netflix doesnt seem to be stocking them 1 
there were several moments in the movie that just didnt need to be there and were excruciatingly slow moving 0 
fantastic buy and will get again for whatever my next phone is 1 
im trying to return it for a refund 0 
it does everything the description said it would 1 
the scenes with the ohsomature neighbourgirl are a misplace 0 
the phone was unusable and was not new 0 
motorola finally got the voice quality of a bluetooth headset right 1 
in summary this was a largely disappointing dining experience 0 
i would recommend purchasing the jabra jx10 series 2 which works flawlessly with my moto q go figure 1 
tom wilkinson broke my heart at the end and everyone elses judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike 1 
i am very impressed with this headset from plantronics 1 
love this phone 1 
i had heard good things about this place but it exceeding every hope i could have dreamed of 1 
small sleek impressive looking practical setup with ample storage in place 1 
i might have gotten a defect but i would not risk buying it again because of the built quality alone 0 
comfortable nice range good battery life 1 
has been working great 1 
i had heard good things about this place but it exceeding every hope i could have dreamed of 1 
your brain will attempt to shutdown as part of a primal impulse of selfpreservation 0 
the inside is really quite nice and very clean 1 
mobile phone tools are a must have 1 
my mother and brother had to do thiswhen i saw robert ryan portraying this type of man it was a very good imitation of this type of individual and i was impressed 1 
it is well made easy to access the phone and has a handy detachable belt clip 1 
awesome service and food 1 
i think i was one of the people who found this another one of roths pearls 1 
then i exchanged for the same phone even that had the same problem 0 
i found this move beautiful enjoyable and uplifting 1 
very convenient since we were staying at the mgm 1 
the desserts were a bit strange 0 
it was pretty gross 0 
by far the best cheesecurds we have ever had 1 
about 30 minutes of footage is wasted to show mediocre elderly actors awkwardly babbling overwrought pseudosatanic gibberish corny enough to make a teen goth blush almost always in olde english and sometimes in latin that may or may not be made up words 0 
con spotty service 0 
it never condescends all the characters have good genuine hearts and believable problems 1 
i really do recommend this place you can go wrong with this donut place 1 
this is by far the worst purchase ive made on amazon 0 
great case and price 1 
ive bought 5 wired headphones that sound better than these 0 
though the wind and the lion is told largely through the eyes of the son every member of the family can identify with one of the characters whether it be sean connerys noble brigand candace bergens feisty heroine john hustons wily john hay or steve kanalys spiffy radiant ruthless cando lieutenant roosevelts big stick 1 
it has kept up very well 1 
its like a bad two hour tv movie 0 
they have horrible attitudes towards customers and talk down to each one when customers dont enjoy their food 0 
it was either too cold not enough flavor or just bad 0 
jawbone era is awesome too 1 
the acting as youd expect from this cast is top notch 1 
the vegetables are so fresh and the sauce feels like authentic thai 1 
great hands free device 1 
good item low price 1 
however my girl was complain that some time the phone doesnt wake up like normal phone does 0 
not good by any stretch of the imagination 0 
love this phone 1 
well packaged arrived on time and works as intended 1 
waste of money 0 
some may say this buffet is pricey but i think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot 1 
lot of holes in the plot theres nothing about how he became the emperor nothing about where he spend 20 years between his childhood and mature age 0 
awsome device works great 1 
the scenery that the two daughters paint and photograph are beautiful 1 
star trek v the final frontier is the worst in the series 0 
the cable looks so thin and flimsy it is scary 0 
the lines the cuts the audio everything is wrong 0 
good works fine 1 
you get extra minutes so that you can carry out the call and not get cut off 1 
unfortunately it was not good 0 
dont waste your time 0 
plug was the wrong size 0 
we wont be going back anytime soon 0 
great food 1 
the volume switch rocketed out of the unit to a destination unknown 0 
it was a great phone 1 
you get incredibly fresh fish prepared with care 1 
this particular model would not work with my motorola q smartphone 0 
i guess it was supposed to be clever twist then shed some light on the situation but it was just stupid 0 
but storm trooper is not even bad enough to make it to the list of wonderfully terrible movies 0 
stay away from this store be careful 0 
the problem i have is that they charge 1199 for a sandwich that is no bigger than a subway sub which offers better and more amount of vegetables 0 
you never know if you pushed it hard enough or the right number of times for the function you want or not 0 
this if the first movie ive given a 10 to in years 1 
he came running after us when he realized my husband had left his sunglasses on the table 1 
disappointed 0 
another thing i didnt really like is when a character got punched in the face a gallon of blood would spew forth soon after 0 
bad script bad direction and horrible acting make this one plain bad 0 
in fact this stinker smells like a directtovideo release 0 
i will never forget it now 1 
this place was such a nice surprise 1 
at any rate this film stinks its not funny and fulci should have stayed with giallo and supernatural zombie movies 0 
the pizza selections are good 1 
we thought youd have to venture further away to get good sushi but this place really hit the spot that night 1 
needless to say we will never be back here again 0 
then scene where they debated whether or not to sack the trumpeter who falsely was accused for the murder is pure horror really stupid 0 
in summary this was a largely disappointing dining experience 0 
i was bored throughout the whole damn thing 0 
first of all there are enough racial stereotypes and racial jokes to offend everyone 0 
we asked for the bill to leave without eating and they didnt bring that either 0 
just reading on the specs alone makes you say wow 1 
the plot is nonsense that doesnt interest in the slightest way or have any uniqueness to it 0 
i dont know what kind it is but they have the best iced tea 1 
today the graphics are crap 0 
this place is overpriced not consistent with their boba and it really is overpriced 0 
bad choice 0 
the cinematographyif it can be called thatsucked 0 
this is one of the best italian thrillers of the early 70s 1 
just as good as when i had it more than a year ago 1 
the attempts at humor were pitiful and story is so awful it dosent bear thinking about which basically involves a vulcan stealing the enterprise to find god seriously i just didnt care about any of this film and oh not to mention uhura does a belly dance to distract male guards 0 
raw and sublimely moving 1 
end of days is one of the worst bigbudget action movies ive ever seen 0 
i liked it 1 
this was such an awesome movie that i bought it off of ebay 1 
great pocket pc phone combination 1 
great software for motorolas 1 
tasted like dirt 0 
the script is was there a script 0 
but it does get better reception and clarity than any phone ive had before 1 
even if you love bad movies do not watch this movie 0 
good value great food great service 1 
anyway the plot flowed smoothly and the malebonding scenes were a hoot 1 
you cant beat that 1 
the price was very good and with the free shipping and all it was a good purchase 1 
nobody identifies with these characters because theyre all cardboard cutouts and stereotypes or predictably reversestereotypes 0 
if youre not familiar check it out 1 
the ambience is wonderful and there is music playing 1 
new battery works great in phone 1 
plus its only 8 bucks 1 
it crackles with an unpredictable youthful energy but honestly i found it hard to follow and concentrate on it meanders so badly 0 
all in all id expected a better consumer experience from motorola 0 
dont waste your time watching this rubbish nonresearched film 0 
these are fabulous 1 
well just if you keep thinking how bad it is 0 
duris has a wholesome appearance and gives a fine performance 1 
it lasts less than 3o minutes if i actually try to use the phonemy wife has the same phone with the same problem 0 
bt50 battery junk 0 
o my gosh the best phone i have ever had 1 
point your finger at any item on the menu order it and you wont be disappointed 1 
for 40 bucks a head i really expect better food 0 
at no point in the proceedings does it look remotely like america 0 
if you want a real scare rent this one 1 
im so sorry but i really cant recommend it to anyone 0 
unless youre just out to visually collect all extant films of austens work you can skip this one 0 
the poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying 0 
the structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema 1 
great place to relax and have an awesome burger and beer 1 
easy to use 1 
cute quaint simple honest 1 
this place is overpriced not consistent with their boba and it really is overpriced 0 
this phone works great 1 
yet plantronincs continues to use the same flawed charger design 0 
never heard of any of them except cole who was totally unbelievable in the part 0 
the death row scenes were entirely unmoving 0 
i never come again 0 
each day of the week they have a different deal and its all so delicious 1 
service is quick and friendly 1 
this is a great place to eat 1 
ps the only scene in the movie that was cool is when the central character finds her room blown up 1 
trumbull on i love lucy 1 
excellent service 1 
the food is good 1 
we are so glad we found this place 1 
and there wasnt a single sour note struck actingwise either some surprisingly solid casting here 1 
food was good service was good prices were good 1 
it is light has plenty of battery capacity and is very confortable to wear for somewhat extended periods of time 1 
if good intentions made a film great then this film might be one of the greatest films ever made 1 
attempting artiness with black white and clever camera angles the movie disappointed became even more ridiculous as the acting was poor and the plot and lines almost nonexistent 0 
from here on the widmark character turns unintentionally comical 0 
would not reccommend 0 
i was very excited to get this headset because i thought it was really cute 1 
it was not good 0 
wont go back 0 
this particular model would not work with my motorola q smartphone 0 
i got this phone on reccomendation from a relative and im glad i did 1 
1010 1 
great place to eat reminds me of the little mom and pop shops in the san francisco bay area 1 
i left with a stomach ache and felt sick the rest of the day 0 
first off the reception sucks i have never had more than 2 bars ever 0 
the folks at otto always make us feel so welcome and special 1 
whatever the producer was going for he missed entirely 0 
the only good thing was our waiter he was very helpful and kept the bloddy marys coming 1 
tied to charger for conversations lasting more than 45 minutesmajor problems 0 
then scene where they debated whether or not to sack the trumpeter who falsely was accused for the murder is pure horror really stupid 0 
here in the wind and the lion we see a wonderful rendering of americas own imperial age 1 
some highlights great quality nigiri here 1 
how can that bethe audio quality is poor 0 
very dissapointing performance 0 
all in all i think it was a good investment 1 
after one bite i was hooked 1 
the only thing worse than taylors acting was stanwycks singing 0 
the delivery was on time 1 
crostini that came with the salad was stale 0 
regardless the film fails on most levels 0 
also the area where my unit broke im not too fond of the magnetic strap 0 
this is a bad film with bad writing and good actorsan ugly cartoon crafted by paul haggis for people who cant handle anything but the bold strokes in storytellinga picture painted with crayons 0 
i was sitting in my vehicle with the cradle on my belt and the headset lost signal 0 
there is so much good food in vegas that i feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to rice and company 0 
worst customer service ever 0 
i love the ownerchef his one authentic japanese cool dude 1 
dont buy it 0 
i dont think ive ever gone to a movie and disliked it as much 0 
very well made and fits my surefire gx2 perfectly 1 
design flaw 0 
i enjoyed reading this book to my children when they were little 1 
just what i wanted 1 
join the club and get awesome offers via email 1 
nothing special 0 
it only recognizes the phone as its storage device 0 
i love this place 1 
regrettably the film fails 0 
brilliance indeed 1 
if you havent choked in your own vomit by the end by all the cheap drama and worthless dialogue youve must have bored yourself to death with this waste of time 0 
not a weekly haunt but definitely a place to come back to every once in a while 1 
that was funny 1 
the food is very good for your typical bar food 1 
it is a really good show to watch 1 
i did not bother contacting the company for few dollar product but i learned the lesson that i should not have bought this form online anyway 0 
very unreliable service from tmobile 0 
he is one of my favourite directors and one of the most talented directors in the history of cinema 1 
the movie is littered with overt racial slurs towards the black cast members and in return the whites are depicted as morons and boobs 0 
ive had this for nearly 2 years and it has worked great for me 1 
elias koteasjack palance play good roles angelina is hot and gets nakedbilly drago appears in this and is cool as usual a cameo by sven ole thorsen helps make this a very enjoyable movie with good acting and a decent budget 1 
of all the dishes the salmon was the best but all were great 1 
but the service was beyond bad 0 
customer service was terrible 0 
in a word it is embarrassing 0 
the acting was bad the dialogs were extremely shallow and insincere 0 
as always the evening was wonderful and the food delicious 1 
stopped by during the late may bank holiday off rick steve recommendation and loved it 1 
i vomited in the bathroom mid lunch 0 
stopped by during the late may bank holiday off rick steve recommendation and loved it 1 
i ended up sliding it on the edge of my pants or back pockets instead 1 
i like armand assante my cable companys summary sounded interesting so i watched it twice already and probably will again 1 
i liked it 1 
this is one of peter watkins most accessible films 1 
there arent death scenes like in previous movies and the fx are terrible 0 
dont waste your time here 0 
the cinematography is simply stunning to say the least and the fx are nothing if not stateoftheart 1 
this place is not quality sushi it is not a quality restaurant 0 
no shifting no bubbling no peeling not even a scratch nothingi couldnt be more happier with my new one for the droid 1 
id love to go back 1 
the sound quality is good and functionality is awesome 1 
if you dont find it too bad as again the unit comes with one earpad onlyi would not recommend this to anyone 0 
i was left shattered from the experience of watching this film and i took a good two hours to fully recover 0 
i go to far too many places and ive never seen any restaurant that serves a 1 egg breakfast especially for 400 0 
bluetooth range is good a few days ago i left my phone in the trunk got a call and carried the conversation without a hitch 1 
shes poised and amazing 1 
hayao miyazakis latest and eighth film for studio ghibili gake no ue no ponyo ponyo on the cliff by the sea is a wonderfully fun and imaginative look at childhood 1 
loved the casting of jimmy buffet as the science teacher 1 
camera color balance is awful 0 
the story is lame not interesting and never really explains the sinister origins of the puppets 0 
everything was gross 0 
not easy to watch 0 
the mic there is a joke and the volume is quite low 0 
the acting was decidely wooden though no worse than a period universal b movie 0 
the worst one of the series 0 
utterly without merit on any level this is akin to torture 0 
fans of the genre will be in heaven 1 
excellent service 1 
really pleased with this product so far 1 
we recently witnessed her poor quality of management towards other guests as well 0 
all in all im quite satisfied with this purchase 1 
her lines seem to have been written by a fifteen year old though they are trying oh so so hard to sound like how a fifteen year old would really um you know well talk 0 
service was good and the company was better 1 
disappointed 0 
still its quite interesting and entertaining to follow 1 
disappointment i hate anything that goes in my ear 0 
the camera on the phone may be used as a dustpan when indoors id rather be using a disposable then this 0 
there is a lot of beautiful places 1 
im not sure what he was trying to do with this film 0 
it is not good 0 
now you know why i gave it a 10 1 
it isnt even an achievement as a sobaditsgood or sobaditsmemorable movie 0 
the result is a powerhouse achievement made more timely now perhaps because of our cultures disturbing fascination with celebrity and its distorted interpretations of fame 1 
but the premise of the film was so ridiculous that the president of the us 0 
the shower area is outside so you can only rinse not take a full shower unless you dont mind being nude for everyone to see 0 
for a self proclaimed coffee cafe i was wildly disappointed 0 
but its just not funny 0 
the manager was the worst 0 
you share general loewenhielms exquisite joy in his partaking of the cailles en sarcophage even though you are just watching a movie but you do wish for just a small sample to savor 1 
i hate movies like that 0 
the acting is fantastic the stories are seamlessly woven together and the dogs are splendid a must rent view or see 1 
its hard not to fall headoverheels in love with that girl 1 
the bathrooms are clean and the place itself is well decorated 1 
definitely worth seeing its the sort of thought provoking film that forces you to question your own threshold of loneliness 1 
beautiful styling though 1 
this is a great restaurant at the mandalay bay 1 
waitress was sweet and funny 1 
the bathroom is just next door and very nice 1 
dont waste your time here 0 
performed awful muffled tinny incoming sound and severe echo for those on the other end of the call 0 
the bose noise cancelling is amazing which is very important for a nyc commuter 1 
unreliable im giving up 0 
if you look for authentic thai food go else where 0 
but in any case the best part is you can download these pictures to your laptop using ir or even send pictures from your laptop to the phone 1 
omelets are to die for 1 
i wouldnt return 0 
lasted one day and then blew up 0 
spend your money and time some place else 0 
but above all the exquisite visual composition of each moment with inventive and elegant use of closeup camera angle and lighting including pointillistic faux home movie footage is a wonder and joy to behold 1 
the best scene in the movie was when gerardo is trying to find a song that keeps running through his head 1 
plus its only 8 bucks 1 
the story line is just awful 0 
initially the local sites in the film which was filmed here in buffalo intrigued me 1 
at first glance it is a lovely bakery cafe nice ambiance clean friendly staff 1 
you could drive a semi truck into these holes 0 
aailiyah was pretty good as akasha in places compelling her first entrance and mini dance scene 1 
does not fit 0 
the crêpe was delicate and thin and moist 1 
perhaps i caught them on an off night judging by the other reviews but im not inspired to go back 0 
problem is that the ear loops are made of weak material and break easily 0 
also great directing and photography 1 
all in all ha long bay was a bit of a flop 0 
the greek dressing was very creamy and flavorful 1 
logitech bluetooth headset is a 10 1 
babie bop is very cute 1 
the range is very decent ive been able to roam around my house with the phone in the living room with no receptionsound quality issues 1 
saggy floppy piece of junk 0 
the only thing that i think could improve is the sound leaks out from the headset 0 
the goat taco didnt skimp on the meat and wow what flavor 1 
i have to mention this and it is a huge spoiler i loved the ending how all the characters of the three films were the remaining survivors of the ferry disaster with valentine and the young judge together and the old man watching it on her tv solidifying his happiness over the suffering which he dealt with for those many years 1 
service was exceptional and food was a good as all the reviews 1 
great phone 1 
often the dialogue doesnt really follow from one line to another or fit the surroundings 0 
instead we got a bore fest about a whiny spoiled brat babysitting 0 
while you dont yet hear mickey speak there are tons of sound effects and music throughout the filmsomething we take for granted now but which was a huge crowd pleaser in 1928 1 
i have purchased these for both family and friends and all enjoy their clarity and ease of use 1 
but above all the exquisite visual composition of each moment with inventive and elegant use of closeup camera angle and lighting including pointillistic faux home movie footage is a wonder and joy to behold 1 
dont waste your time 0 
alexander nevsky is a great film 1 
so in a nutshell 1 the restaraunt smells like a combination of a dirty fish market and a sewer 0 
also makes it easier to hold on to 1 
the cast is good 1 
if you look for authentic thai food go else where 0 
i am so tired of clichés that is just lazy writing and here they come in thick and fast 0 
terrible service 0 
the attempts at humor were pitiful and story is so awful it dosent bear thinking about which basically involves a vulcan stealing the enterprise to find god seriously i just didnt care about any of this film and oh not to mention uhura does a belly dance to distract male guards 0 
the service here leaves a lot to be desired 0 
you need two hands to operate the screenthis software interface is decade old and cannot compete with new software designs 0 
needless to say we will never be back here again 0 
it was a long time that i didnt see a so charismatic actor on screen 1 
the show would begin with smart ass ed comments to each other that would be totally off the wall and uncalled for 0 
a cheap and cheerless heist movie with poor characterisation lots of underbite style stoic emoting think chow yun fat in a better tomorrow and some cheesy clichés thrown into an abandoned factory ready for a few poorly executed flying judo rolls a la john woo 0 
plus it was wellpaced and suited its relatively short run time 1 
its a total package 1 
i especially liked the noncliche choices with the parents in other movies i could predict the dialog verbatim but the writing in this movie made better selections 1 
the servers went back and forth several times not even so much as an are you being helped 0 
if there was ever an indication of a writer and a directors ability to meld two highly volatile temperaments into a seamless union of creativity then this is it 1 
worked perfectly 1 
in summary this was a largely disappointing dining experience 0 
sam shepards portrayal of a gung ho marine was sobering 1 
the decor is nice and the piano music soundtrack is pleasant 1 
the 12 mega pixel camera being a part of a phone is reasonably good7 1 
i love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it 1 
be sure to order dessert even if you need to pack it togo the tiramisu and cannoli are both to die for 1 
if you are reading this please dont go there 0 
in the summer you can dine in a charming outdoor patio so very delightful 1 
the food amazing 1 
we asked for the bill to leave without eating and they didnt bring that either 0 
my 5year old nokia 2160 from tracfone holds the charge a lot better than this 0 
lovely little thriller from hitchcock with lots of nice shenanigans surrounding a murdered spy a kidnapped child a nasty church a foreign plot and some random taxidermists 1 
nice headset priced right 1 
the cast is good 1
