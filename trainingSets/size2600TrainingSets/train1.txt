not too screamy not to masculine but just right 1 
good protection and does not make phone too bulky 1 
id advise anyone to go and see it 1 
love this phone 1 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
all the other cases ive tried normally fall apart after a few months but this one seems to be in for the long haul 1 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
everything was good and tasty 1 
service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is vegas and located inside the crystals shopping mall by aria 1 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
the jamaican mojitos are delicious 1 
also makes it easier to hold on to 1 
if you do watch it however there are small consolations the actresses playing annes sisters each do a wonderful job with their roles 1 
i guess i should have known that this place would suck because it is inside of the excalibur but i didnt use my common sense 0 
that one didnt work either 0 
another thing i didnt really like is when a character got punched in the face a gallon of blood would spew forth soon after 0 
very funny 1 
it is zillion times away from reality 0 
however bt headsets are currently not good for real time games like firstperson shooters since the audio delay messes me up 0 
best tater tots in the southwest 1 
i was very excited to get this headset because i thought it was really cute 1 
the cashew cream sauce was bland and the vegetables were undercooked 0 
full of unconvincing cardboard characters it is blandly written by edward chodorov who also produced and is surprisingly directed by jean negulesco from whom one would expect a great deal more 0 
furthermore you cant even find hours of operation on the website 0 
i dont know exactly what it is about this movie but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our familys memories 1 
horrible horrible protector 0 
i received my supposedly new motorola 375 and apparently there was not a match between the phone and the charger 0 
now imagine that every single one of those decisions was made wrong 0 
the telephone repair man was really funny and his reactions to the nuts and bitchy boss were truly genuine 1 
all in all ha long bay was a bit of a flop 0 
as a sushi lover avoid this place by all means 0 
otherwise easy to install and use clear sound 1 
my sanyo has survived dozens of drops on blacktop without ill effect 1 
anyway the plot flowed smoothly and the malebonding scenes were a hoot 1 
my boyfriend and i sat at the bar and had a completely delightful experience 1 
this is the kind of money that is wasted properly 1 
best service and food ever maria our server was so good and friendly she made our day 1 
i do think tom hanks is a good actor 1 
it was horrible 0 
for readers who have already seen one of miyazakis films he is still in top form and made another worthwhile experience 1 
i highly recommend these and encourage people to give them a try 1 
its a great tool for entertainment communication and data managementoh be sure to use activesync 42 for optimal data synchronization results 1 
i own 2 of these cases and would order another 1 
i dont think ill be running back to carlys anytime soon for food 0 
nice leather 1 
also the fries are without a doubt the worst fries ive ever had 0 
worked perfectly 1 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
will order from them again 1 
this really is how vegas fine dining used to be right down to the menus handed to the ladies that have no prices listed 1 
my experience was terrible this was my fourth bluetooth headset and while it was much more comfortable than my last jabra which i hated 0 
it was equally awful 0 
the servers are not pleasant to deal with and they dont always honor pizza hut coupons 0 
if you want healthy authentic or ethic food try this place 1 
it has a great camera thats 2mp and the pics are nice and clear with great picture quality 1 
my husband said she was very rude did not even apologize for the bad food or anything 0 
spend your money and time some place else 0 
the good cinematography also makes her and monica bellucci look very beautiful 1 
nothing short of magnificent photographycinematography in this film 1 
i seriously cannot believe that the owner has so many unexperienced employees that all are running around like chickens with their heads cut off 0 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
the flat reenactments dont hold your attention because they are emotionally adrift and stagy 0 
everything about it is fine and reasonable for the price ie 1 
the shower area is outside so you can only rinse not take a full shower unless you dont mind being nude for everyone to see 0 
this if the first movie ive given a 10 to in years 1 
then our food came out disappointment ensued 0 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
the best scene in the movie was when gerardo is trying to find a song that keeps running through his head 1 
in my house i was getting dropped coverage upstairs and no coverage in my basement 0 
maybe its just their vegetarian fare but ive been twice and i thought it was average at best 0 
i gave it 5 stars then and im giving it 5 stars now 1 
i agree with jessica this movie is pretty bad 0 
i want to first say our server was great and we had perfect service 1 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
this is the phone to get for 2005 i just bought my s710a and all i can say is wow 1 
it felt like a very gripping intelligent stage play but without the overly theatrical feeling one actually gets from watching people on a stage which plays on everyones terror of a white lie escalating to monstrous consequences 1 
i recommend igo to anyone with different brand cell phonesmp3 players in the family 1 
if you havent choked in your own vomit by the end by all the cheap drama and worthless dialogue youve must have bored yourself to death with this waste of time 0 
he is one of my favourite directors and one of the most talented directors in the history of cinema 1 
overall the film is interesting and thoughtprovoking 1 
the service was poor and thats being nice 0 
i was very excited to get this headset because i thought it was really cute 1 
you can find better movies at youtube 0 
now we were chosen to be tortured with this disgusting piece of blatant american propaganda 0 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
product is exactly as described 1 
an hour and a half i wish i could bring back 0 
great pocket pc phone combination 1 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
if you love death and decay and shakespears lyrics this is the one 1 
i am so pleased to know such a modern day genius is out there letting is passion for art drive him and taking us as an audience with him 1 
you cant go wrong with any of the food here 1 
i love this device 1 
oh and i forgot to also mention the weird color effect it has on your phone 0 
the movie showed a lot of florida at its best made it look very appealing 1 
after one bite i was hooked 1 
its a total package 1 
bland and flavorless is a good way of describing the barely tepid meat 0 
mic doesnt work 0 
the film succeeds despite or perhaps because of an obviously meagre budget 1 
i did not expect this to be so good 1 
id like to return it 0 
adapter does not provide enough charging current 0 
the croutons also taste homemade which is an extra plus 1 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
logitech bluetooth headset is a 10 1 
i great reception all the time 1 
absolutel junk 0 
great audio 1 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
it is simple to use and i like it 1 
if you love death and decay and shakespears lyrics this is the one 1 
although i very much liked the look and sound of this place the actual experience was a bit disappointing 0 
the film has an ultracheap look to it 0 
too bad you have to pay up to a month for the service 0 
add betty white and jean smart and you have a great cast everyone played their parts really well 1 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
the story line is just awful 0 
the screen size is big key pad lit well enough and the camera quality is excellent for a camera phone 1 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurv√•g being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
i go to far too many places and ive never seen any restaurant that serves a 1 egg breakfast especially for 400 0 
that one didnt work either 0 
then i had to continue pairing it periodically since it somehow kept dropping 0 
but other than that the movie seemed to drag and the heroes didnt really work for their freedom 0 
went in for happy hour great list of wines 1 
the fact is this film is a wonderful heartwarming tale about two people chasing their dreams 1 
the cast was great 1 
the pancake was also really good and pretty large at that 1 
same problem as others have mentioned 0 
ryans bar is definitely one edinburgh establishment i wont be revisiting 0 
the poor actors 0 
on the ground right next to our table was a large smeared beensteppedinandtrackedeverywhere pile of green bird poop 0 
i guess maybe we went on an off night but it was disgraceful 0 
horrible phone 0 
omg i felt like i had never eaten thai food until this dish 1 
the steak and the shrimp are in my opinion the best entrees at gc 1 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
both do good jobs and are quite amusing 1 
but this movie is not funny considering the ridiculousness of it 0 
best ive found so far ive tried 2 other bluetooths and this one has the best quality for both me and the listener as well as ease of using 1 
this is a great phone 1 
we made the drive all the way from north scottsdale and i was not one bit disappointed 1 
this is a bad film with bad writing and good actorsan ugly cartoon crafted by paul haggis for people who cant handle anything but the bold strokes in storytellinga picture painted with crayons 0 
it is very comfortable to wear as well which is probably the most important aspect about using a case 1 
im in az all the time and now have my new spot 1 
it has a very good plot it holds your complete attention the acting is superb tom wilkinson was fantastic and emily watson was also very good 1 
the only thing really worth watching was the scenery and the house because it is beautiful 1 
the pleather case doesnt fit 0 
dont bother coming here 0 
went in for happy hour great list of wines 1 
i would avoid this place if you are staying in the mirage 0 
would recommend this item 1 
one of the most disappointing aspects is the lack of notable gore 0 
the kids are annoying 0 
at first i thought i was grtting a good deal at 744 until i plugged it into my phone v3c razr 0 
avoid avoid avoid 0 
this product is clearly not ready for prime time i dont care how cool it looks if you cant tell a call is coming in its worthless 0 
i received it quickly and it works great 1 
i let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this bad idea we both hated it 0 
the soundtrack sucked 0 
good item low price 1 
it only recognizes the phone as its storage device 0 
this movie is also revealing 1 
and it was way to expensive 0 
i would recommend it 1 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
i really wanted the plantronics 510 to be the right one but it has too many issues for methe good 0 
i also didnt like the on button it felt like it would crack with use 0 
the ri style calamari was a joke 0 
we loved the biscuits 1 
i love the camera its really pretty good quality 1 
generally it just lacked imagination 0 
worst foodservice ive had in a while 0 
dont waste your time 0 
definitely worth checking out 1 
she carries the movie well 1 
all in all i can assure you ill be back 1 
in my house i was getting dropped coverage upstairs and no coverage in my basement 0 
i especially liked the noncliche choices with the parents in other movies i could predict the dialog verbatim but the writing in this movie made better selections 1 
i had strawberry tea which was good 1 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
this is just a great movie 1 
it is very comfortable to wear as well which is probably the most important aspect about using a case 1 
all in all i give this one a resounding 9 out of 10 1 
considering the relations off screen between taylor and stanwyck it was surprising how little chemistry there was on screen between the two of them 0 
the veggitarian platter is out of this world 1 
everything is appalling 0 
my headset works just peachykeen 1 
its fits like a glove and is strong secure and durable 1 
i had a salad with the wings and some ice cream for dessert and left feeling quite satisfied 1 
it is zillion times away from reality 0 
however after seeing the short again after about 25 years i was amazed at how timeless the film actually is 1 
i mean this in a terrible way 0 
if you have several dozen or several hundred contacts then imagine the fun of sending each of them one by one 0 
i love this place 1 
appetite instantly gone 0 
we had fantastic service and were pleased by the atmosphere 1 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
crisp and clear 1 
i would highly recommend this 1 
ordered burger rare came in well done 0 
our server was super nice and checked on us many times 1 
i did not have any problem with this item and would order it again if needed 1 
totally different with loads of understatement and black comedy this is a film few get to see but those who do will remember it 1 
i love this cable it allows me to connect any miniusb device to my pc 1 
a cheap and cheerless heist movie with poor characterisation lots of underbite style stoic emoting think chow yun fat in a better tomorrow and some cheesy clich√©s thrown into an abandoned factory ready for a few poorly executed flying judo rolls a la john woo 0 
ill be looking for a new earpiece 0 
easy to use 1 
it is unusable in a moving car at freeway speed 0 
doesnt last long 0 
very slow at seating even with reservation 0 
totally believable 1 
very funny 1 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
not much dialogue not much music the whole film was shot as elaborately and aesthetically like a sculpture 1 
the phone loads super 1 
bad characters bad story and bad acting 0 
great place to relax and have an awesome burger and beer 1 
20th century foxs road house 1948 is not only quite a silly noir but is an implausible unmitigated bore of a movie 0 
i can think of no other film where something vitally important occurs every other minute 1 
comfortable in my hand 1 
the manager was the worst 0 
who in their right mind is gonna buy this battery 0 
theres really nothing bad i can say about this headset 0 
50 down the drain 0 
nice ambiance 1 
your servers suck wait correction our server heimer sucked 0 
however i recently watched the whole thing again on dvd and i was completely struck by how extremely stupid the storyline was how it contained holes inconsistencies and frankly a whole lot of crap and how horrid the dancing was 0 
this was one of the worst films i have ever seen 0 
it was a pale color instead of nice and char and has no flavor 0 
it will drive you barking mad 0 
its a sad movie but very good 1 
makes it easier to keep up with my bluetooth when im not wearing it 0 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
the eargels channel the sound directly into your ear and seem to increase the sound volume and clarity 1 
the script is bad very bad ¬ñ it contains both cheesiness and unethical joke that you normally see in rated r or nc17 movie 0 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
the film succeeds despite or perhaps because of an obviously meagre budget 1 
i bought this phone as a replacement for my startac and have regretted it since 0 
the very idea of it was lame take a minor character from a mediocre pg13 film and make a complete nonsequel while changing its tone to a pgrated family movie 0 
do not buy do not buyit sucks 0 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
service was good and the company was better 1 
your servers suck wait correction our server heimer sucked 0 
echo problemvery unsatisfactory 0 
i love this device 1 
the worst one of the series 0 
they do not last forever but is not overly expensive to replaceeasy to operate and the sound is much better than others i have tried 1 
i gave it a 10 1 
total waste of time 0 
you cant beat that 1 
crostini that came with the salad was stale 0 
this is an outstanding little restaurant with some of the best food i have ever tasted 1 
i was disgusted because i was pretty sure that was human hair 0 
it was a drive to get there 0 
but storm trooper is not even bad enough to make it to the list of wonderfully terrible movies 0 
dont waste your time 0 
this is just a great movie 1 
its kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly its embarrassing how childlike the company is 0 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
they could be used as exemplars for any set designer 1 
dont buy this product it fails 0 
the food was great as always compliments to the chef 1 
this is an excellent film 1 
excellent short film 1 
my order was not correct 0 
great sound and service 1 
babie bop is very cute 1 
the ambiance was incredible 1 
a disappointment 0 
the chicken i got was definitely reheated and was only ok the wedges were cold and soggy 0 
ordered burger rare came in well done 0 
you will leave the theater wanting to go out and dance under the stars 1 
dont waste your money 0 
your servers suck wait correction our server heimer sucked 0 
the bathroom is just next door and very nice 1 
an hour and a half i wish i could bring back 0 
the success of the film depends on the casting of sydney greenstreet as the alexander yardley character 1 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
its a campy sort of film thats a joy to watch 1 
i had a seriously solid breakfast here 1 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
the puppets look really cheesy not in a good way like in the puppet master 80s flicks 0 
it didnt work people can not hear me when i talk 0 
this phone is very fast with sending any kind of messages and web browsing is significantly faster than previous phones i have used 1 
paolo sorrentino has written a wonderful story about loneliness and tony has built one of the most unforgettable characters seen in movies in recent years 1 
best service and food ever maria our server was so good and friendly she made our day 1 
i have to mention this and it is a huge spoiler i loved the ending how all the characters of the three films were the remaining survivors of the ferry disaster with valentine and the young judge together and the old man watching it on her tv solidifying his happiness over the suffering which he dealt with for those many years 1 
the script is a big flawed mess 0 
i will come back here every time im in vegas 1 
a piece of junk that broke after being on my phone for 2 days 0 
i would recommend this 1 
good case excellent value 1 
the cast of veteran actors are more than just a nostalgia trip 1 
we made the drive all the way from north scottsdale and i was not one bit disappointed 1 
which is precisely why i am giving it such a bad review 0 
what is even more stupid is that who had thought an idea that there should be a volcano in los angeles 0 
useless phone simply deaf 0 
i knew when i saw the film that more great things were to come from this gifted actor 1 
great earpiece 1 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
i have had mine for about a year and this christmas i bought some for the rest of the family 1 
avoid this establishment 0 
it is wonderful and inspiring to watch and i hope that it gets released again on to video or dvd 1 
echo problemvery unsatisfactory 0 
im really disappointed all i have now is a charger that doesnt work 0 
i left the theater with a lilt in my step joy in my heart and hope for the human race 1 
the sweet potato fries were very good and seasoned well 1 
works great 1 
do not buy for d807wrongly advertised for d807 0 
nothing special 0 
they know how to make them here 1 
im still trying to get over how bad it was 0 
the menu had so much good stuff on it i could not decide 1 
the ambiance was incredible 1 
very nice and relaxing late night viewing 1 
this place is good 1 
i had absolutely no problem with this headset linking to my 8530 blackberry curve 1 
the film has an ultracheap look to it 0 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
that was nice 1 
ive never been treated so bad 0 
i had the mac salad and it was pretty bland so i will not be getting that again 0 
there is no plot here to keep you going in the first place 0 
what a mistake 0 
but this movie really got to me 1 
very good though 1 
also if your phone is dropped this case is not going to save it specially when dropped face down 0 
lightweight and works well 1 
its very slow 0 
this pda rocks 1 
now the pizza itself was good the peanut sauce was very tasty 1 
all of the tapas dishes were delicious 1 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
appetite instantly gone 0 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
we started with the tuna sashimi which was brownish in color and obviously wasnt fresh 0 
the cast is always entertaining as usual 1 
mobile phone tools are a must have 1 
someone shouldve invented this sooner 1 
no plot whatsoever 0 
a great touch 1 
they refuse to refund or replace 0 
it was probably dirt 0 
ill definitely be in soon again 1 
its not what it says it is 0 
we made the drive all the way from north scottsdale and i was not one bit disappointed 1 
my 5year old nokia 2160 from tracfone holds the charge a lot better than this 0 
i asked multiple times for the wine list and after some time of being ignored i went to the hostess and got one myself 0 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
price is good too 1 
would recommend this item 1 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
after my phone got to be about a year old its been slowly breaking despite much care on my part 0 
this convention never worked well in the past and certainly doesnt work here 0 
the only thing worse than taylors acting was stanwycks singing 0 
unfortunately it was not good 0 
the soundtrack wasnt terrible either 1 
all in all i give this one a resounding 9 out of 10 1 
the best place in vegas for breakfast just check out a sat or sun 1 
great phone 1 
my drink was never empty and he made some really great menu suggestions 1 
no complaints 1 
its a case of so bad it is laughable 0 
definitely will come back here again 1 
and finally after all that we get to an ending that wouldve been great had it been handled by competent people and not jerry falwell 0 
this place receives stars for their appetizers 1 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
returned 8 hours later 0 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
i especially liked the noncliche choices with the parents in other movies i could predict the dialog verbatim but the writing in this movie made better selections 1 
at first i thought i was grtting a good deal at 744 until i plugged it into my phone v3c razr 0 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
does everything it should and more 1 
all the characters in this film are tremendously well played 1 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
alexander nevsky is a great film 1 
disappointing experience 0 
this place deserves no stars 0 
i highly recommend this modest priced cellular phone 1 
eew this location needs a complete overhaul 0 
i like the fact that it rests lightly against your ear rather than inside 1 
terrible management 0 
you could drive a semi truck into these holes 0 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
excellent phone 1 
logitech bluetooth headset is a 10 1 
piece of junk 0 
the movie in movie situations in the beginning and through the game that is played with her by the acting coach are fascinating 1 
item does not match picture 0 
one thing i hate is the mode set button at the side 0 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
a happy wonderful feel good ending 1 
this is an unbelievable bargain 1 
ordered burger rare came in well done 0 
highly unrecommended 0 
the seller is very understanding and patient i would definitely buy from them again 1 
the use of slowmotion needlessly repeats itself throughout the movie but is well backed up by bad acting and bad is a kind word here no continuity scenes that are thrown in for no reason whatsoever vehicles that looked like they were made from a corn flakes box and a directorial style that bordered on stupidity 0 
great hands free device 1 
first time there and might just be the last 0 
i think i was one of the people who found this another one of roths pearls 1 
i consider this theft 0 
steer clear of this product and go with the genuine palm replacementr pens which come in a threepack 0 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
the best electronics of the available fm transmitters 1 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
it was a good thing that the tickets only cost five dollars because i would be mad if id have paid 750 to see this crap 0 
i can assure you that you wont be disappointed 1 
ive bought 5 wired headphones that sound better than these 0 
the ri style calamari was a joke 0 
would recommend this item 1 
we loved the biscuits 1 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
the service was great even the manager came and helped with our table 1 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
all the other cases ive tried normally fall apart after a few months but this one seems to be in for the long haul 1 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
the films dialogue is natural real to life 1 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of qu√©bec 0 
good works fine 1 
maybe its just their vegetarian fare but ive been twice and i thought it was average at best 0 
i am very impressed with this headset from plantronics 1 
this place is handsdown one of the best places to eat in the phoenix metro area 1 
its pure brilliance 1 
its also great to see that renowned silent screenwriter frances marion hasnt missed a step going from silent to sound 1 
but kevin spacey is an excellent verbal tsunami as buddy ackerman ¬ñ and totally believable because he is a great actor 1 
works well 1 
gotta love those closeups of slimy drooling teeth 1 
tom wilkinson broke my heart at the end and everyone elses judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike 1 
i must say i have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again 1 
all the actors give a wonderful performance especially jennifer rubin as jamie harris who changes from the nervous starlet in the beginning through the strange events she is part of to the cool star 1 
same problem as others have mentioned 0 
the service was terrible though 0 
still waiting im sure this item would work well if i ever recieve it 0 
what a waste 0 
the bose noise cancelling is amazing which is very important for a nyc commuter 1 
hackneyed writing certainly but made even worse by the bad directing 0 
my brother in law who works at the mall ate here same day and guess what he was sick all night too 0 
the chains which im no fan of beat this place easily 0 
it is shameful 0 
the sound is clear and the people i talk to on it are amazed at the quality too 1 
the potato chip order was sad i could probably count how many chips were in that box and it was probably around 12 0 
bad reception 0 
they work about 2 weeks then break 0 
but it wasnt anything at all just one big yawn 0 
what did bother me was the slow service 0 
as always the evening was wonderful and the food delicious 1 
so far it has worked like a charm 1 
wed definitely go back here again 1 
the story starts too fast with absolutely no suspense or buildup in the slightest 0 
a very good film indeed about great and unconditional love 1 
this wonderful experience made this place a muststop whenever we are in town again 1 
it is very educational for children 1 to 8 years old 1 
terrible my car will not accept this cassette 0 
i received my orders well within the shipping timeframe everything was in good working order and overall i am very excited to have this source 1 
i have to jiggle the plug to get it to line up right to get decent volume 0 
the service was great even the manager came and helped with our table 1 
i love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it 1 
new battery works great in phone 1 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
beware this is not a trashy cult movie this is trash period 0 
first of all it doesnt wear well 0 
this place should honestly be blown up 0 
none of it works just dont buy it 0 
one of the best mexican movies ever and one of the less understood even by mexican themselves no matter how identified the should have felt with it 1 
the screen size is big key pad lit well enough and the camera quality is excellent for a camera phone 1 
this is one of the better buffets that i have been to 1 
everything from acting to cinematography was solid 1 
definitely not worth the 3 i paid 0 
not much flavor to them and very poorly constructed 0 
this place is overpriced not consistent with their boba and it really is overpriced 0 
it also had a new problem 0 
i was sitting in my vehicle with the cradle on my belt and the headset lost signal 0 
the secondary plot line is incomprehensible and its relation to the primary plot line is mystifying 0 
its too bad the food is so damn generic 0 
this place is not worth your time let alone vegas 0 
this place deserves no stars 0 
wasted two hours 0 
i would advise to not purchase this item it never worked very well 0 
now we were chosen to be tortured with this disgusting piece of blatant american propaganda 0 
i felt asleep the first time i watched it so i can recommend it for insomniacs 0 
it showed exactly how the government and the scientist argued for humanity and the reasons of the gadget 1 
i even dropped this phone into a stream and it was submerged for 15 seconds and it still works great 1 
i received my orders well within the shipping timeframe everything was in good working order and overall i am very excited to have this source 1 
its a sad movie but very good 1 
highly entertaining at all angles 1 
he really didnt seem to want to be hosting his voiceovers were monotonous didnt get involved with the guests 0 
timely shipment and quality product 1 
it ranks highly as a great noircrimedrama incredible performances by belmondo and lino ventura 1 
do not waste your time 0 
what i really like there is the crepe station 1 
the acting was bad the dialogs were extremely shallow and insincere 0 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
the bt headset was such a disapoinment 0 
the incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film 1 
works fine 1 
so i had to take the battery out of the phone put it all back together and then restart it 0 
the foreigner is not worth one second of your time 0 
judith light is one of my favorite actresses and i think she does a superb job in this film 1 
it was a good thing that the tickets only cost five dollars because i would be mad if id have paid 750 to see this crap 0 
brilliant 1 
very disappointing 0 
i also didnt like the on button it felt like it would crack with use 0 
we will not be coming back 0 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
what is even more stupid is that who had thought an idea that there should be a volcano in los angeles 0 
back to good bbq lighter fare reasonable pricing and tell the public they are back to the old ways 1 
the dining space is tiny but elegantly decorated and comfortable 1 
the good cinematography also makes her and monica bellucci look very beautiful 1 
highly unrecommended 0 
i love this bluetooth 1 
why was this film made 0 
so i bought about 10 of these and saved alot of money 1 
one nice thing was that they added gratuity on the bill since our party was larger than 6 or 8 and they didnt expect more tip than that 1 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
now the burgers arent as good the pizza which used to be amazing is doughy and flavorless 0 
product was excellent and works better than the verizon one and boy was it cheaper 1 
and considering the two of us left there very full and happy for about 20 you just cant go wrong 1 
a fantastic neighborhood gem 1 
the phone takes forever to charge like 2 to 5 hours literally 0 
i like armand assante my cable companys summary sounded interesting so i watched it twice already and probably will again 1 
we got sitting fairly fast but ended up waiting 40 minutes just to place our order another 30 minutes before the food arrived 0 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
the staff was very attentive 1 
lot of holes in the plot theres nothing about how he became the emperor nothing about where he spend 20 years between his childhood and mature age 0 
it is an hour and half waste of time following a bunch of very pretty high schoolers whine and cry about life 0 
the mic there is a joke and the volume is quite low 0 
in addition it feels amp looks as if the phone is all lightweight cheap plastic 0 
i think that it is a must see older john wayne film 1 
very disappointed in accessoryone 0 
its so bad its actually worth seeing just for that reason 0 
its pretty easy 1 
not what i wanted 0 
they have been around for years and carries the highest quality of antiglare screen protector that i have found to date 1 
kids pizza is always a hit too with lots of great side dish options for the kiddos 1 
itll be a regular stop on my trips to phoenix 1 
i saw mirrormask last night and it was an unsatisfactory experience 0 
you share general loewenhielms exquisite joy in his partaking of the cailles en sarcophage even though you are just watching a movie but you do wish for just a small sample to savor 1 
from what my dinner companions told meeverything was very fresh with nice texture and taste 1 
it was equally awful 0 
very good lunch spot 1 
i love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it 1 
ill definitely be in soon again 1 
i took back my money and got outta there 0 
the ambiance was incredible 1 
if that bug never showed up i would have given a 4 for sure but on the other side of the wall where this bug was climbing was the kitchen 0 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
reasonably priced also 1 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
i believe that this place is a great stop for those with a huge belly and hankering for sushi 1 
was not happy 0 
the owners really really need to quit being soooooo cheap let them wrap my freaking sandwich in two papers not one 0 
using all earpieces left or right this thing will not stay on my ear 0 
yes this film does require a rather significant amount of puzzlesolving but the pieces fit together to create a beautiful picture 1 
i left the theater with a lilt in my step joy in my heart and hope for the human race 1 
in fact i liked it better than interview with a vampire and i liked this lestat stuart townsend better than cruises attempt 1 
now the burgers arent as good the pizza which used to be amazing is doughy and flavorless 0 
about ten minutes into this film i started having second thoughts 0 
returned 8 hours later 0 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
this is a simple little phone to use but the breakage is unacceptible 0 
just whatever you do avoid groove as its the antithesis of all that is good about human traffic 0 
i wasnt expecting oscar material but this 0 
service is friendly and inviting 1 
the shower area is outside so you can only rinse not take a full shower unless you dont mind being nude for everyone to see 0 
schrader has made a resume full of lousy amateurish films 0 
only like 3 or 4 buildings used a couple of locations maybe poor hummh 0 
their frozen margaritas are way too sugary for my taste 0 
i enjoyed it 1 
i have had tmobile service for 2 or 3 years now and i am pretty happy with it 1 
not only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic but it also managed to give away the entire movie and im not exaggerating every moment every plot point every joke is told in the trailer 0 
i hate writing bad reviews about films especially those in which i really like the star but this film is so bad i dont believe for one second that anyone could have been proud of it 0 
i only hear garbage for audio 0 
juano hernandez an exceptional actor who played supporting roles in many films of the era is a proud black man who is accused of murdering a white man in the south 1 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
strike 2 who wants to be rushed 0 
it has kept up very well 1 
i hate writing bad reviews about films especially those in which i really like the star but this film is so bad i dont believe for one second that anyone could have been proud of it 0 
the pleather case doesnt fit 0 
graphics is far from the best part of the game 0 
there were too many close ups 0 
perhaps i caught them on an off night judging by the other reviews but im not inspired to go back 0 
the nokia ca42 usb cable did not work with my phone 0 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
watching washing machine twirling around wouldnt hurt your eyes as much as this show 0 
when my mom and i got home she immediately got sick and she only had a few bites of salad 0 
the only thing worse than taylors acting was stanwycks singing 0 
i would have given no star if i was able 0 
we wont be returning 0 
unfortunately inexperience of direction meant that scene after scene passed with little in the way of dramatic tension or conflict 0 
and the chef was generous with his time even came around twice so we can take pictures with him 1 
i have had mine for about a year and this christmas i bought some for the rest of the family 1 
this is my new fav vegas buffet spot 1 
not my thing 0 
the steaks are all well trimmed and also perfectly cooked 1 
easy to use 1 
this short film certainly pulls no punches 0 
i dont think you will be disappointed 1 
i thoroughly enjoyed it when christopher eccleston took control of the tardis and the continuation of the series 1 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
she carries the movie well 1 
magical help 1 
i really do recommend this place you can go wrong with this donut place 1 
excellent product 1 
for that price i can think of a few place i would have much rather gone 0 
but storm trooper is not even bad enough to make it to the list of wonderfully terrible movies 0 
the scripting of the subtle comedy is unmatched by any movie in recent years 1 
so i am here to warn youdo not rent this movie it is the dumbest thing you have never seen 0 
so good i am going to have to review this place twice once hereas a tribute to the place and once as a tribute to an event held here last night 1 
instead we got a bore fest about a whiny spoiled brat babysitting 0 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
all things considered a job very well done 1 
if i take a picture the battery drops a bar and starts beeping letting me know its dieing 0 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
unfortunately it did not work 0 
the headsets are easy to use and everyone loves them 1 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
saggy floppy piece of junk 0 
if only someone involved with it knew how to string together narrative 0 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
the acting was bad the dialogs were extremely shallow and insincere 0 
as a courtroom drama its compelling as an indictment on the american justice system its frightening 1 
nice design and quality 1 
im returning them 0 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
when im on this side of town this will definitely be a spot ill hit up again 1 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
it will drive you barking mad 0 
the hockey scenes are terrible defensemen playing like theyre 5 years old goalies diving at shots that are 10 feet wide of the net etc 0 
waste of 13 bucks 0 
the staff is friendly and the joint is always clean 1 
the best place in vegas for breakfast just check out a sat or sun 1 
it is wonderful and inspiring to watch and i hope that it gets released again on to video or dvd 1 
i cannot make calls at certain places 0 
the worst experience ever 0 
after i pulled up my car i waited for another 15 minutes before being acknowledged 0 
the staff is always super friendly and helpful which is especially cool when you bring two small boys and a baby 1 
by the time the film ended i not only disliked it i despised it 0 
his use of the colours of the french flag in the three films was nothing short of incredible every shot every scene was like a work of art 1 
the kids are very cool too 1 
its a little geeky but i think thats its sex on toast and it rocks and oozes sex right down to its battery embedded sleek stylish leather case 1 
one more thing i can tolerate political incorrectness very well im all for artistic freedom and suspension of disbelief but the slavic female character was just too much 0 
the classic maine lobster roll was fantastic 1 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
also the fries are without a doubt the worst fries ive ever had 0 
i understand that its supposed to be a cheap popcorn comedy but that doesnt mean that it has to completely insult our intelligence and have writing so incredibly hackneyed that it borders on offensive 0 
this place is great 1 
an hour seriously 0 
i was very disappointed in the movie 0 
very satisifed with that 1 
freezes frequently4 0 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
very disappointed 0 
then scene where they debated whether or not to sack the trumpeter who falsely was accused for the murder is pure horror really stupid 0 
ive seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie 0 
i had the mac salad and it was pretty bland so i will not be getting that again 0 
i received my headset in good time and was happy with it 1 
the acting was decidely wooden though no worse than a period universal b movie 0 
unfortunately this is a bad movie that is just plain bad 0 
i work in the hospitality industry in paradise valley and have refrained from recommending cibo any longer 0 
bad choice 0 
after i pulled up my car i waited for another 15 minutes before being acknowledged 0 
nothing short of magnificent photographycinematography in this film 1 
damian is so talented and versatile in so many ways of writing and portraying different characters on screen 1 
always a great time at dos gringos 1 
i checked everywhere and there is no feature for it which is really disappointing 0 
no real improvement 0 
lasted one day and then blew up 0 
jawbone era is awesome too 1 
back to good bbq lighter fare reasonable pricing and tell the public they are back to the old ways 1 
the price was very good and with the free shipping and all it was a good purchase 1 
youll love how thin it is 1 
this place should honestly be blown up 0 
the camera really likes her in this movie 1 
his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic 1 
very unreliable service from tmobile 0 
it was so bad i had lost the heart to finish it 0 
the new characters werent all that memorable and i found myself forgetting who was who 0 
other than that the leather is nice and soft the fit is very tight the cut out for the face is a good shape 1 
ordered a double cheeseburger got a single patty that was falling apart picture uploaded yeah still sucks 0 
the film gives meaning to the phrase never in the history of human conflict has so much been owed by so many to so few 1 
what a big waste of time 0 
all i can do is whine on the internet so here it goesthe more i use the thing the less i like it 0 
maybe its just their vegetarian fare but ive been twice and i thought it was average at best 0 
strike 2 who wants to be rushed 0 
it didnt charge for me 0 
the hockey scenes are terrible defensemen playing like theyre 5 years old goalies diving at shots that are 10 feet wide of the net etc 0 
pricing is a bit of a concern at mellow mushroom 0 
im not eating here 0 
i am very happy 1 
what this film lacks is a convincing script 0 
great software for motorolas 1 
the food is not tasty at all not to say its real traditional hunan style 0 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
in fact i liked it better than interview with a vampire and i liked this lestat stuart townsend better than cruises attempt 1 
i had strawberry tea which was good 1 
steamboat willie is an amazingly important film to our cinema history 1 
because both ears are occupied background is not distracting at all 1 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
i thought errol flynn was brilliant as custer and has since become my favourite actor 1 
they do not care about the consumer one bit 0 
my husband said she was very rude did not even apologize for the bad food or anything 0 
on the up side their cafe serves really good food 1 
if you have several dozen or several hundred contacts then imagine the fun of sending each of them one by one 0 
this is a good joint 1 
he is almost unbearable to watch on screen he has little to no charisma and terrible comedic timing 0 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
pretty piece of junk 0 
the awful dialogue and hopeless overacting by everyone who gets shot top off a real waste of space and time 0 
good food good service 1 
but this movie is not funny considering the ridiculousness of it 0 
seriously flavorful delights folks 1 
meredith m was better than all right 1 
regardless the film fails on most levels 0 
an interesting premise and billy drago is always good as a dangerous nutbag side note id love to see drago stephen mchattie and lance hendrikson in a flick together talk about raging cheekbones 1 
i used bitpim a free program you can find on the internetto transfer data to the phonethe price of the cable was excellent 1 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
lordy the khao soi is a dish that is not to be missed for curry lovers 1 
the film is well paced understated and one of the best courtroom documentaries ive seen 1 
this is a disgrace 0 
i highly recommend this device to everyone 1 
the plastic breaks really easy on this clip 0 
service was good and the company was better 1 
no ear loop needed its tiny and the sound is great 1 
i am sorry i made this purchase 0 
drinks took close to 30 minutes to come out at one point 0 
omg i felt like i had never eaten thai food until this dish 1 
not much seafood and like 5 strings of pasta at the bottom 0 
the live music on fridays totally blows 0 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
due to this happening on every call i was forced to stop using this headset 0 
the films dialogue is natural real to life 1 
speaking of the music it is unbearably predictably and kitchy 0 
highly entertaining at all angles 1 
the only consistent thread holding the series together were the amazing performances of leni parker and anita laselva as the two taelons in quiet idealogical conflict 0 
its a fresh subtle and rather sublime effect 1 
seriously flavorful delights folks 1 
after arguing with verizon regarding the dropped calls we returned the phones after two days 0 
even allowing for poor production values for the time 1971 and the format some kind of miniseries this is baaaaaad 0 
a very very very slowmoving aimless movie about a distressed drifting young man 0 
overall a great experience 1 
strike 2 who wants to be rushed 0 
if you dont find it too bad as again the unit comes with one earpad onlyi would not recommend this to anyone 0 
its a long time since i was so entertained by a movie 1 
the real disappointment was our waiter 0 
not nearly as good looking as the amazon picture makes it look 0 
this film has no redeeming features 0 
but the service was beyond bad 0 
these are fabulous 1 
the voice recognition thru the handset is excellent 1 
the worst experience ever 0 
it was a bit too sweet not really spicy enough and lacked flavor 0 
1 long lasting battery you dont have to recharge it as frequentyly as some of the flip phones2 0 
regardless the film fails on most levels 0 
i like armand assante my cable companys summary sounded interesting so i watched it twice already and probably will again 1 
gotta love those closeups of slimy drooling teeth 1 
i believe that pitch black was done well 1 
the film gives meaning to the phrase never in the history of human conflict has so much been owed by so many to so few 1 
the bathroom is just next door and very nice 1 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
i wasnt really impressed with strip steak 0 
the movie was very interesting from beginning to the end 1 
no plot whatsoever 0 
it is an insane game 1 
it is unusable in a moving car at freeway speed 0 
and his subtle connections between the three films are awesome 1 
very happy with this product 1 
its a campy sort of film thats a joy to watch 1 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
and the rest of it just sits there being awful with soldiers singing songs about the masculinity they pledge themselves to hairsplitting about purity the admiration of swords etc 0 
hackneyed writing certainly but made even worse by the bad directing 0 
beware this is not a trashy cult movie this is trash period 0 
the design is very odd as the ear clip is not very comfortable at all 0 
works great when my cat attacked the phone he scratched the protective strip instead of destroying the screen 1 
service stinks here 0 
the only good thing was our waiter he was very helpful and kept the bloddy marys coming 1 
you can find better movies at youtube 0 
the movie was very interesting from beginning to the end 1 
will never ever go back and have told many people what had happened 0 
it looked like a wonderful story 1 
its a gloriously fun fast paced and fairly accurate portrayal of the night of a raver 1 
the service was great even the manager came and helped with our table 1 
excellent cast story line performances 1 
the design is very good4 1 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
this is one of the better buffets that i have been to 1 
at a time when it seems that film animation has been dominated by disneypixars cgi masterpieces it is both refreshing and comforting to know that miyazaki is still relying on traditional handdrawn animation to tell his charming and enchanting stories 1 
beware this is not a trashy cult movie this is trash period 0 
chinese forgeries abound 0 
dont buy it 0 
you learn a lot about the real inside emotions of people in this movie and a lot about the movie business itself 1 
first of all there are enough racial stereotypes and racial jokes to offend everyone 0 
i have seen many movies starring jaclyn smith but my god this was one of her best though it came out 12 years ago 1 
the first time i ever came here i had an amazing experience i still tell people how awesome the duck was 1 
great food and service huge portions and they give a military discount 1 
i enjoyed reading this book to my children when they were little 1 
excellent product for the price 1 
a lot of websites have been rating this a very good phone and so do i 1 
nonlinear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well 1 
im trying to return it for a refund 0 
the budget was evidently very limited 0 
i dont know what the big deal is about this place but i wont be back yaall 0 
i felt insulted and disrespected how could you talk and judge another human being like that 0 
i dont have very many words to say about this place but it does everything pretty well 1 
we waited an hour for what was a breakfast i could have done 100 times better at home 0 
i know this is not like the other restaurants at all something is very off here 0 
this is the first phone ive had that has been so cheaply made 0 
the attention given to every character and complex psychological portrayals detailing loyalty treachery love and hope are tremendous 1 
everything about this product is wrongfirst 0 
third the cheese on my friends burger was cold 0 
2 thumbs up 1 
the seasonal fruit was fresh white peach puree 1 
the food amazing 1 
the only suspense i was feeling was the frustration at just how retarded the girls were 0 
if only someone involved with it knew how to string together narrative 0 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
the directing and the cinematography arent quite as good 0 
the steak and the shrimp are in my opinion the best entrees at gc 1 
very happy with this product 1 
sucked most of the stuff does not work with my phone 0 
very good though 1 
the plot was the same as pretty much every other cheap horror 0 
awesome device 1 
this short film certainly pulls no punches 0 
great audio 1 
we have gotten a lot of compliments on it 1 
i am a fan of his this movie sucked really bad 0 
great atmosphere friendly and fast service 1 
very unreliable service from tmobile 0 
ambience is perfect 1 
there is so much good food in vegas that i feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to rice and company 0 
i heart this place 1 
probably not in a hurry to go back 0 
i found the product to be easy to set up and use 1 
i will never forget it now 1 
if you are reading this please dont go there 0 
treo and tmobile refused to replace it again and forced me to buy another phone without any kind of upgrade discount 0 
the memories are murky but i can only say that i enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show 1 
he came running after us when he realized my husband had left his sunglasses on the table 1 
not even a hello we will be right with you 0 
i purcashed this for the car charger and it does not work 0 
my husband and i ate lunch here and were very disappointed with the food and service 0 
i only hear garbage for audio 0 
despite how hard i rate businesses its actually rare for me to give a 1 star 0 
i thoroughly enjoyed it when christopher eccleston took control of the tardis and the continuation of the series 1 
the best example of how dumb the writing is when its established that you can turn the zombiestudents back into humans by removing a necklace containing a piece of the meteorite 0 
today was my first taste of a buldogis gourmet hot dog and i have to tell you it was more than i ever thought possible 1 
it probably would have been better if the director hadnt spent most of the movie showcasing his own art work which really isnt that noteworthy 0 
it is so small and you dont even realize that it is there after a while of getting used to it 1 
special thanks to dylan t for the recommendation on what to order all yummy for my tummy 1 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
i had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get some relief 0 
perabo has a nice energy level and is obviously very comfortable in front of a camera 1 
the performances are not improved by improvisation because the actors now have twice as much to worry about not only whether theyre delivering the line well but whether the line itself is any good 0 
those burgers were amazing 1 
a world better than 95 of the garbage in the theatres today 1 
the bt headset was such a disapoinment 0 
then our food came out disappointment ensued 0 
i checked everywhere and there is no feature for it which is really disappointing 0 
things happen characters personalities change plot twists occur for no real reason other than that script calls for it 0 
think it over when you plan to own this onethis sure is the last moto phone for me 0 
not tasty and the texture was just nasty 0 
both of them were truly unbelievably good and i am so glad we went back 1 
i like the fact that it rests lightly against your ear rather than inside 1 
why are these sad little vegetables so overcooked 0 
stopped by during the late may bank holiday off rick steve recommendation and loved it 1 
i let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this bad idea we both hated it 0 
if she had not rolled the eyes we may have stayed not sure if we will go back and try it again 0 
schrader has made a resume full of lousy amateurish films 0 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
on the good side the staff was genuinely pleasant and enthusiastic a real treat 1 
i could care less the interior is just beautiful 1 
the ngage is still lacking in earbuds 0 
the food was excellent and service was very good 1 
i received it quickly and it works great 1 
the food came out at a good pace 1 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
i would recommend saving room for this 1 
ray charles is legendary 1 
this product had a strong rubberpetroleum smell that was unbearable after a while and caused me to return it 0 
last time buying from you 0 
i have two more years left in this contract and i hate this phone 0 
sending it back 0 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
it is a joy to use 1 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
excellent phone 1 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
overall i like there food and the service 1 
its not what it says it is 0 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
on the ground right next to our table was a large smeared beensteppedinandtrackedeverywhere pile of green bird poop 0 
i didnt know pulled pork could be soooo delicious 1 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
this was reflected not only in the cast but also in the belowpar script which borrowed much from the earlier classic 0 
the bus boy on the other hand was so rude 0 
i am so tired of clich√©s that is just lazy writing and here they come in thick and fast 0 
this case seems well made 1 
the descriptions said yum yum sauce and another said eel sauce yet another said spicy mayowell none of the rolls had sauces on them 0 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
the kids are very cool too 1 
these headphones were a great find and i think they are perhaps the best purchase ive made in the last several years seriously 1 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
this fixes all the problems 1 
the pan cakes everyone are raving about taste like a sugary disaster tailored to the palate of a six year old 0 
i saw this short film on hbo the other day and absolutely loved it 1 
talk about useless customer service 0 
which has more depth and character than the man underneath it 0 
definitely will come back here again 1 
the eargels channel the sound directly into your ear and seem to increase the sound volume and clarity 1 
nonlinear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well 1 
pretty awesome place 1 
either way it sucks 0 
theres really nothing bad i can say about this headset 0 
magical help 1 
if she had not rolled the eyes we may have stayed not sure if we will go back and try it again 0 
that being said for a phone the camera is very nice many cool effects to play with and video is decent as well 1 
if you have not seen this movie i definitely recommend it 1 
its the best headset i have used 1 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
see both films if you can 1 
i think not again 0 
the writers were smack on and i think the best actors and actresses were a bonus to the showthese characters were so real 1 
great phone 1 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
i am going to have to be the first to negatively review this product 0 
the new characters werent all that memorable and i found myself forgetting who was who 0 
i think that it is a must see older john wayne film 1 
this is a really fantastic thai restaurant which is definitely worth a visit 1 
disappointing accessory from a good manufacturer 0 
the charger arrived within the promised timeframe but it did not work 0 
mark my words this is one of those cult films like evil dead 2 or phantasm that people will still be discovering and falling in love with 20 30 40 years down the line 1 
this second appearance of mickey mouse following the silent plane crazy earlier that year is probably his most famous filmmostly because it was so groundbreaking 1 
this product is great it makes working a lot easier i can go to the copier while waiting on hold for something 1 
battery life is also great 1 
this is was due to the fact that it took 20 minutes to be acknowledged then another 35 minutes to get our foodand they kept forgetting things 0 
it was so cool 1 
best tater tots in the southwest 1 
the flat reenactments dont hold your attention because they are emotionally adrift and stagy 0 
you will leave the theater wanting to go out and dance under the stars 1 
how this piece of trash was ever released is beyond me the acting the story the characters the supposedly special effects etcits all wrong 0 
the real disappointment was our waiter 0 
we wont be returning 0 
the acting from all involved and that includes those like shatner and nimoy is bad and washed out and making them seem as old as they look in real life the special effects are tacky like when spock has to rescue kirk on a jet pack when he falls down from a mountain 0 
this if the first movie ive given a 10 to in years 1 
great charger 1 
seriously flavorful delights folks 1 
but the movie makes a lot of serious mistakes 0 
comfortable nice range good battery life 1 
i love this device 1 
during several different 2 minute calls i experienced 5 drops and it was in an area that had 5 bars 0 
their rotating beers on tap is also a highlight of this place 1 
there are so many problems i dont know where to start 0 
my only complaint is the standard sound volume is a little low even when turned up to 5of 5 0 
would come back again if i had a sushi craving while in vegas 1 
first off the reception sucks i have never had more than 2 bars ever 0 
as always the evening was wonderful and the food delicious 1 
after trying many many handsfree gadgets this is the one that finally works well 1 
i will be back many times soon 1 
wasted two hours 0 
in my house i was getting dropped coverage upstairs and no coverage in my basement 0 
it was just not a fun experience 1 
my fella got the huevos rancheros and they didnt look too appealing 0 
hitchcock is a great director 1 
car charger as well as ac charger are included to make sure you never run out of juicehighy recommended 1 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
overall i would recommend this phone over the new walkman 1 
this place is not quality sushi it is not a quality restaurant 0 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
also notable is john baileys fine crisp beautifully colored cinematography and the great production design costumes by eiko ishioka who went on to do the memorable costumes for coppolas dracula for which she received a well deserved oscar 1 
very prompt service 1 
although i very much liked the look and sound of this place the actual experience was a bit disappointing 0 
speaking of the music it is unbearably predictably and kitchy 0 
its fits like a glove and is strong secure and durable 1 
i ended up sliding it on the edge of my pants or back pockets instead 1 
leopard print is wonderfully wild 1 
you wont be disappointed 1 
it is a true classic 1 
poor reliability 0 
perfect for the ps3 1 
its a gloriously fun fast paced and fairly accurate portrayal of the night of a raver 1 
this place is handsdown one of the best places to eat in the phoenix metro area 1 
give this one a look 1 
avoid avoid avoid 0 
very easy to use 1 
there were several moments in the movie that just didnt need to be there and were excruciatingly slow moving 0 
couldnt ask for a more satisfying meal 1 
the burrittos blah 0 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
an interesting premise and billy drago is always good as a dangerous nutbag side note id love to see drago stephen mchattie and lance hendrikson in a flick together talk about raging cheekbones 1 
they could serve it with just the vinaigrette and it may make for a better overall dish but it was still very good 1 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
cant say enough good things about this place 1 
what makes this story different are the terrific production values faultless photography composition and editing the terrific casting the underappreciated brian keith playing a bully teddy and vivid history 1 
the shower area is outside so you can only rinse not take a full shower unless you dont mind being nude for everyone to see 0 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
its just painful 0 
appetite instantly gone 0 
bland not a liking this place for a number of reasons and i dont want to waste time on bad reviewing ill leave it at that 0 
i found this place by accident and i could not be happier 1 
would not go back 0 
their menu is diverse and reasonably priced 1 
but even the talented carrell cant save this 0 
disappointed with battery 0 
it was horrendous 0 
pretty cool i would say 1 
i am very impressed with the job that motorola did on the sturdiness of this phone 1 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
highly unrecommended 0 
never got it 0 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
an awesome new look for fall 2000 1 
the acting is terrible and the writing is worse 0 
really really good rice all the time 1 
funny clever hip just like prays previous film hype 1 
cute quaint simple honest 1 
this is a witty and delightful adaptation of the dr seuss book brilliantly animated by upas finest and thoroughly deserving of its academy award 1 
i started this review with two stars but im editing it to give it only one 0 
there are so many problems i dont know where to start 0 
everyone is very attentive providing excellent customer service 1 
a week later after i activated it it suddenly died 0 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
i went on motorolas website and followed all directions but could not get it to pair again 0 
i couldnt think of a better way to end the film but a smile on my face great way to wrap up an amazing film and trilogy 1 
just spicy enough perfect actually 1 
wow loved this place 1 
if there was ever an indication of a writer and a directors ability to meld two highly volatile temperaments into a seamless union of creativity then this is it 1 
they brought a fresh batch of fries and i was thinking yay something warm but no 0 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
cinematography noteworthy including fine views of barcelona and its famed gaudi towers 1 
also makes it easier to hold on to 1 
great service and food 1 
and it was way to expensive 0 
great it was new packaged nice works good no problems and it came in less time then i expected 1 
what a mistake that was 0 
it looked like a wonderful story 1 
the only place good for this film is in the garbage 0 
if you see it you should probably just leave it on the shelf 0 
im not sure what he was trying to do with this film 0 
a bit predictable 0 
the headsets are easy to use and everyone loves them 1 
the range is very decent ive been able to roam around my house with the phone in the living room with no receptionsound quality issues 1 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
awsome device works great 1 
i would advise to not purchase this item it never worked very well 0 
customer service was terrible 0 
worst martini ever 0 
they are so cool 1 
the construction of the headsets is poor 0 
the microphone also works well but according to people i have called it applifies everything 1 
it is practically useless and did not add any kind of boost to my reception after i bought it 0 
i love the ringtones because they are so upbeat 1 
weird vibe from owners 0 
ordered burger rare came in well done 0 
someone shouldve invented this sooner 1 
i love it 1 
back to good bbq lighter fare reasonable pricing and tell the public they are back to the old ways 1 
they made this case too small and is very difficult to install 0 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
the cinematography is simply stunning to say the least and the fx are nothing if not stateoftheart 1 
the food was terrible 0 
what a mistake that was 0 
the earpiece on this is too large or too heavyit keeps falling out of my ear 0 
my fianc√© and i came in the middle of the day and we were greeted and seated right away 1 
im glad the film didnt go for the most obvious choice as a lesser film certainly would have 1 
best of all is the rotating feature very helpful 1 
soggy and not good 0 
cumbersome design 0 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
that said our mouths and bellies were still quite pleased 1 
as for the service i thought it was good 1 
i was not happy with this item 0 
third the cheese on my friends burger was cold 0 
oh this is such a thing of beauty this restaurant 1 
not as good as i had hoped 0 
this is truly an art movieit actually has a lot of art in it 1 
my 810 score is mostly for the plot 1 
the cg opening sequence in space looked like it could have been created on microsoft slideshow for gods sake 0 
either way it sucks 0 
you have to hold the phone at a particular angle for the other party to hear you clearly 0 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
the explosion of the gas tanks at the end was just as awful 0 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
for readers who have already seen one of miyazakis films he is still in top form and made another worthwhile experience 1 
the attempts at humor were pitiful and story is so awful it dosent bear thinking about which basically involves a vulcan stealing the enterprise to find god seriously i just didnt care about any of this film and oh not to mention uhura does a belly dance to distract male guards 0 
the football scenes at the end were perplexing 0 
im a bit disappointed 0 
its practically perfect in all of them ¬ñ a true masterpiece in a sea of faux masterpieces 1 
im terribly disappointed that this film would receive so many awards and accolades especially when there are far more deserving works of film out there 0 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
delicious 1 
ive also had problems with the phone reading the memory card in which i always turn it on and then off again 0 
only pros large seating area nice bar area great simple drink menu the best brick oven pizza with homemade dough 1 
the phone is sturdy and waterproof 1 
the directing and the cinematography arent quite as good 0 
this results in the phone being either stuck at max volume or mute 0 
i am very impressed with the job that motorola did on the sturdiness of this phone 1 
my salad had a bland vinegrette on the baby greens and hearts of palm 0 
but what really made it unwatchable was the direction 0 
from here on the widmark character turns unintentionally comical 0 
i go to far too many places and ive never seen any restaurant that serves a 1 egg breakfast especially for 400 0 
their steaks are 100 recommended 1 
probably not in a hurry to go back 0 
the presentation of the food was awful 0 
bland and flavorless is a good way of describing the barely tepid meat 0 
good value works fine power via usb car or wall outlet 1 
the ambiance was incredible 1 
nice spicy and tender 1 
this results in the phone being either stuck at max volume or mute 0 
my gyro was basically lettuce only 0 
i was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar not only because the quality is great but the service is fast and the food impeccable 1 
by the time the film ended i not only disliked it i despised it 0 
everything was fresh and delicious 1 
i had a salad with the wings and some ice cream for dessert and left feeling quite satisfied 1 
im returning them 0 
i guess that nobody at the network that aired this dribble watched it before putting it on 0 
buttons are too small 0 
i recently tried caballeros and i have been back every week since 1 
secondly hitchcock pretty much perfected the thriller and chase movie 1 
that movie was bad 0 
it has a great camera thats 2mp and the pics are nice and clear with great picture quality 1 
i gave it 5 stars then and im giving it 5 stars now 1 
so dont go there if you are looking for good food 0 
10 out of 10 for both the movie and trilogy 1 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
thats how id describe this painfully dreary timewaster of a film 0 
its just lame 0 
they really want to make your experience a good one 1 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
the pancake was also really good and pretty large at that 1 
ordered burger rare came in well done 0 
what this film lacks is a convincing script 0 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
this is such a fun and funny movie 1 
the first thing that happened was that the tracking was off 0 
great place to relax and have an awesome burger and beer 1 
this movie creates its own universe and is fascinating in every way 1 
not only did the software do a great job of this i could also make my own ringtones form my existing cds without an internet connection 1 
it was way over fried 0 
the lines the cuts the audio everything is wrong 0 
putting the race card aside lets look at the major flaw in the film they destroy latifas character 0 
the films sole bright spot was jonah hill who will look almost unrecognizable to fans of the recent superbad due to the amount of weight he lost in the interim 1 
im trying to return it for a refund 0 
comes with a strong light that you can use to light up your camera shots and even flash sos signals seriously 1 
i would definitely recommend the jabra bt250v for those who are looking for comfort clarity and a great price 1 
not what i wanted 0 
when a song could explain the emotions of the subjects better such as when jay adams unfortunate life was a subject of talk the song old man by neil young was played which evokes many emotions 1 
disappointing accessory from a good manufacturer 0 
i would highly recommend this product 1 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurv√•g being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
totally different with loads of understatement and black comedy this is a film few get to see but those who do will remember it 1 
trouble is the writing and directing make it impossible to establish those things that make a movie watchable like character story theme and so on 0 
i wont spoil it but the ending in pretty amazing 1 
the biggest complaint i have is the battery drains superfast 0 
if there was ever an indication of a writer and a directors ability to meld two highly volatile temperaments into a seamless union of creativity then this is it 1 
the only downside is the service 0 
it only recognizes the phone as its storage device 0 
i checked out this place a couple years ago and was not impressed 0 
i go to far too many places and ive never seen any restaurant that serves a 1 egg breakfast especially for 400 0 
think it over when you plan to own this onethis sure is the last moto phone for me 0 
im very disappointed with my decision 0 
fans of the genre will be in heaven 1 
cant get the software to work with my computer 0 
the range is very decent ive been able to roam around my house with the phone in the living room with no receptionsound quality issues 1 
cumbersome design 0 
i highly recommend this modest priced cellular phone 1 
the phone is sturdy and waterproof 1 
seafood was limited to boiled shrimp and crab legs but the crab legs definitely did not taste fresh 0 
the cashew cream sauce was bland and the vegetables were undercooked 0 
i got to enjoy the seafood salad with a fabulous vinegrette 1 
the show would begin with smart ass ed comments to each other that would be totally off the wall and uncalled for 0 
it wasnt busy at all and now we know why 0 
chinese forgeries abound 0 
my sashimi was poor quality being soggy and tasteless 0 
saggy floppy piece of junk 0 
great pizza and salads 1 
this is a bad film with bad writing and good actorsan ugly cartoon crafted by paul haggis for people who cant handle anything but the bold strokes in storytellinga picture painted with crayons 0 
the cashew cream sauce was bland and the vegetables were undercooked 0 
worst customer service 0 
soggy and not good 0 
dont waste your time watching this rubbish nonresearched film 0 
there are massive levels massive unlockable characters its just a massive game 1 
battery has no life 0 
this is an outstanding little restaurant with some of the best food i have ever tasted 1 
even the squibs look awful 0 
some applause should be given to the prelude however 1 
sorry i will not be getting food from here anytime soon 0 
my side greek salad with the greek dressing was so tasty and the pita and hummus was very refreshing 1 
id advise anyone to go and see it 1 
the igo chargers and tips are really great 1 
it clicks into place in a way that makes you wonder how long that mechanism would last 0 
however bt headsets are currently not good for real time games like firstperson shooters since the audio delay messes me up 0 
pretty awesome place 1 
i have been in more than a few bars in vegas and do not ever recall being charged for tap water 0 
you will leave the theater wanting to go out and dance under the stars 1 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
best tater tots in the southwest 1 
and i just love the colors 1 
utterly without merit on any level this is akin to torture 0 
waste of money 0 
this is a disgrace 0 
i received it quickly and it works great 1 
delicious and i will absolutely be back 1 
problem is that the ear loops are made of weak material and break easily 0 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
ive had this bluetoooth headset for some time now and still not comfortable with the way it fits on the ear 0 
this place is awesome if you want something light and healthy during the summer 1 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
iam very pleased with my purchase 1 
try them in the airport to experience some tasty food and speedy friendly service 1 
i checked out this place a couple years ago and was not impressed 0 
for service i give them no stars 0 
this short film certainly pulls no punches 0 
once you get inside youll be impressed with the place 1 
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
it ranks highly as a great noircrimedrama incredible performances by belmondo and lino ventura 1 
highly entertaining at all angles 1 
this is probably one of the least effective and utterly unoriginal films i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
all of the tapas dishes were delicious 1 
the worst sappiest dialogue i could go on and on 0 
battery life is real good 1 
i believe that this place is a great stop for those with a huge belly and hankering for sushi 1 
needless to say i wont be going back anytime soon 0 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
im translating movies for a living and this is the first movie in my 5year working experience that i found offensive to my intelligence 0 
this phone is very fast with sending any kind of messages and web browsing is significantly faster than previous phones i have used 1 
the structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema 1 
its the best headset i have used 1 
i want my money back 0 
really bad 0 
customer service was terrible 0 
the movie showed a lot of florida at its best made it look very appealing 1 
we ordered the duck rare and it was pink and tender on the inside with a nice char on the outside 1 
then as if i hadnt wasted enough of my life there they poured salt in the wound by drawing out the time it took to bring the check 0 
service is quick and friendly 1 
i really dont see how anyone could enjoy this movie 0 
at least think to refill my water before i struggle to wave you over for 10 minutes 0 
ive had this for nearly 2 years and it has worked great for me 1 
excellent phone 1 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
this place is overpriced not consistent with their boba and it really is overpriced 0 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
great pizza and salads 1 
great atmosphere friendly and fast service 1 
love it great armband 1 
one character is totally annoying with a voice that gives me the feeling of fingernails on a chalkboard 0 
we were promptly greeted and seated 1 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
omelets are to die for 1 
okay i like to consider myself a fair critic so ill give credit where credits duethe creature effects were actually pretty cool 1 
not a good bargain 0 
linksys should have some way to exchange a bad phone for a refurb unit or something 0 
the music in the film is really nice too 1 
its also great to see that renowned silent screenwriter frances marion hasnt missed a step going from silent to sound 1 
the film has great actors a master director a significant themeat least a wouldbe significant theme undertone of fifties existential worldweariness aerial scenes that ought to have thrilled both senses and imagination and characters about which one might deeply care 1 
very clear quality sound and you dont have to mess with the sound on your ipod since you have the sound buttons on the headset 1 
i found a six inch long piece of wire in my salsa 0 
the burger is good beef cooked just right 1 
bad characters bad story and bad acting 0 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
but its just not funny 0 
very good lunch spot 1 
the only downside is the service 0 
its a feelgood film and thats how i felt when i came out of the cinema 1 
on three different occasions i asked for well done or medium well and all three times i got the bloodiest piece of meat on my plate 0 
this is hands down the best phone ive ever had 1 
very displeased 0 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
it is a true classic 1 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
it ranks highly as a great noircrimedrama incredible performances by belmondo and lino ventura 1 
works as described 1 
price is good too 1 
it is very educational for children 1 to 8 years old 1 
funny clever hip just like prays previous film hype 1 
they really want to make your experience a good one 1 
not much flavor to them and very poorly constructed 0 
it will drive you barking mad 0 
all i can do is whine on the internet so here it goesthe more i use the thing the less i like it 0 
very displeased 0 
this may be the only bad film he ever made 0 
it is the best charger i have seen on the market yet 1 
in a word it is embarrassing 0 
the only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port irda 0 
the chefs were friendly and did a good job 1 
this may be the only bad film he ever made 0 
its just painful 0 
i am so tired of clich√©s that is just lazy writing and here they come in thick and fast 0 
i felt as though her going to ireland did absolutely nothing whatsoever 0 
so for our enjoyment we get to see them run around play games and be dangerous 1 
lordy the khao soi is a dish that is not to be missed for curry lovers 1 
lovely little thriller from hitchcock with lots of nice shenanigans surrounding a murdered spy a kidnapped child a nasty church a foreign plot and some random taxidermists 1 
it is perfect for a sitdown family meal or get together with a few friends 1 
disappointing experience 0 
reaching for the bottom row is uncomfortable and the send and end keys are not where i expect them to be3 0 
verizon tech support walked my through a few procedures none of which worked and i ended up having to do a hard reset wiping out all my data 0 
the food was great as always compliments to the chef 1 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
i took back my money and got outta there 0 
jabra ear gels r the best 1 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
the worst phone from samsungcrap this crappy samsung e715 is the worst i have ever seeen 0 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
i got to enjoy the seafood salad with a fabulous vinegrette 1 
finally after three or four times the spring of the latch broke and i could not use it any longer on the visor 0 
not recommended 0 
a week later after i activated it it suddenly died 0 
worked great 1 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
nothing short of magnificent photographycinematography in this film 1 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani ¬ñ particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
also makes it easier to hold on to 1 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
you get what you pay for i guess 0 
i even dropped this phone into a stream and it was submerged for 15 seconds and it still works great 1 
it worked very well 1 
the performances are not improved by improvisation because the actors now have twice as much to worry about not only whether theyre delivering the line well but whether the line itself is any good 0 
editing the editing of this film was phenomenal in my opinion 1 
good show samsung 1 
the chips and sals a here is amazing 1 
service is also cute 1 
also the phone doesnt seem to accept anything except cbr mp3s preferably ripped by windows media player 0 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
good show samsung 1 
this movie is possibly one of the most creative works of horror ever 1 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
very funny 1 
definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly will return next time im in vegas 1 
oh the charger seems to work fine 1 
i was very excited to get this headset because i thought it was really cute 1 
my sister has one also and she loves it 1 
they know how to make them here 1 
avoid at all costs 0 
i really like this product over the motorola because it is allot clearer on the ear piece and the mic 1 
all i have to say is the food was amazing 1 
recommend with confidence 1 
we received a white colored battery that goes dead after a couple hoursthe original used to last a week but still lasts longer than thereplacement 0 
buyerbe very careful 0 
works great 1 
i dont know what kind it is but they have the best iced tea 1 
uncomfortable in the ear dont use with lg vx9900 env 0 
i think it was robert ryans best film because he portrayed someone like my father and he was a schizophrenic in real lifemy father although he never murdered anyone but was affected more so during the second world war which made him worse 1 
oh the charger seems to work fine 1 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
this short film certainly pulls no punches 0 
the point is the journey a journey that touches every member of the family 1 
now you know why i gave it a 10 1 
after the first charge kept going dead after 12 minutes 0 
the jalapeno bacon is soooo good 1 
i totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is 1 
the cast is always entertaining as usual 1 
the only thing really worth watching was the scenery and the house because it is beautiful 1 
there were too many close ups 0 
the ngage is still lacking in earbuds 0 
the kids are annoying 0 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
plug was the wrong size 0 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
i cannot make calls at certain places 0 
i only hear garbage for audio 0 
this early film from future goremeister lucio fulci is a very good addition to the giallo subgenre 1 
a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it 1 
it was equally awful 0 
after one bite i was hooked 1 
aside from its terrible lead this film has loads of other debits 0 
it came free with a dvd player i bought but i still turned the thing off halfway through because i was embarrassed for howell 0 
nice ambiance 1 
this was utterly confusing at first which caused me to lose a couple of very very important contacts 0 
in fact i liked it better than interview with a vampire and i liked this lestat stuart townsend better than cruises attempt 1 
summary the witticisms werent witty 0 
good transmit audio 1 
i came back today since they relocated and still not impressed 0 
at first i thought i was grtting a good deal at 744 until i plugged it into my phone v3c razr 0 
wed definitely go back here again 1 
i dont think ive ever gone to a movie and disliked it as much 0 
a greasy unhealthy meal 0 
overall i like this place a lot 1 
will be back again 1 
this is infuriating 0 
ive had this for nearly 2 years and it has worked great for me 1 
they really want to make your experience a good one 1 
i dont think you will be disappointed 1 
new battery works great in phone 1 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
not too screamy not to masculine but just right 1 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
on three different occasions i asked for well done or medium well and all three times i got the bloodiest piece of meat on my plate 0 
the spaghetti is nothing special whatsoever 0 
the characters are interesting and you want to find out more about them the longer the movie goes on and i think people will be surprised by who does and doesnt make it 1 
the portion was huge 1 
the majority of the logitech earbud headsets failed 0 
i have tried these cables with my computer and my ipod and it works just fine 1 
i totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is 1 
this was like the final blow 0 
i would definitely recommend the jabra bt250v for those who are looking for comfort clarity and a great price 1 
i knew when i saw the film that more great things were to come from this gifted actor 1 
great for ipods too 1 
each day of the week they have a different deal and its all so delicious 1 
this short film certainly pulls no punches 0 
disappointed 0 
and the sound quality is great 1 
i cannot believe that the actors agreed to do this film 0 
the warmth it generates is in contrast to its austere backdrop 1 
in the summer you can dine in a charming outdoor patio so very delightful 1 
which is precisely why i am giving it such a bad review 0 
service is perfect and the family atmosphere is nice to see 1 
very dissapointing performance 0 
the plot is nonsense that doesnt interest in the slightest way or have any uniqueness to it 0 
i asked multiple times for the wine list and after some time of being ignored i went to the hostess and got one myself 0 
i liked the patio and the service was outstanding 1 
arrived quickly and much less expensive than others being sold 1 
the writer gorman bechard undoubtedly did his homework because all references are industry and characterage appropriate 1 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
as a sushi lover avoid this place by all means 0 
it quit working after id used it for about 18 months so i just purchased another one because this is the best headset ive ever owned 1 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
gave up trying to eat any of the crust teeth still sore 0 
my first visit to hiro was a delight 1 
good case excellent value 1 
phone falls out easily 0 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
i dont think it would hold it too securly on your belt 0 
the memories are murky but i can only say that i enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show 1 
we will not be coming back 0 
clear skype calls long battery life long range 1 
very very fun chef 1 
i am going to have to be the first to negatively review this product 0 
his losing his marbles so early in the proceedings is totally implausible and unconvincing 0 
nice headset priced right 1 
but it is great i would really recommend it 1 
i have been to very few places to eat that under no circumstances would i ever return to and this tops the list 0 
you get incredibly fresh fish prepared with care 1 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
those burgers were amazing 1 
sprint charges for this service 0 
if only someone involved with it knew how to string together narrative 0 
this place is awesome if you want something light and healthy during the summer 1 
after one bite i was hooked 1 
regardless the film fails on most levels 0 
waited 2 hours never got either of our pizzas as many other around us who came in later did 0 
he really didnt seem to want to be hosting his voiceovers were monotonous didnt get involved with the guests 0 
you wont regret it 1 
oh the charger seems to work fine 1 
the transfers are very good 1 
mobile phone tools are a must have 1 
it came free with a dvd player i bought but i still turned the thing off halfway through because i was embarrassed for howell 0 
i like armand assante my cable companys summary sounded interesting so i watched it twice already and probably will again 1 
i go to far too many places and ive never seen any restaurant that serves a 1 egg breakfast especially for 400 0 
comfortable fit you need your headset to be comfortable for at least an hour at a time if not for an entire day 1 
im so happy to be here 1 
this is essentially a communications tool that does not communicate 0 
went in for happy hour great list of wines 1 
you could only take 2 videos at a time and the quality was very poor 0 
worst ever 0 
i received my orders well within the shipping timeframe everything was in good working order and overall i am very excited to have this source 1 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
it even has its sweet moments 1 
the servers are not pleasant to deal with and they dont always honor pizza hut coupons 0 
it has northern humour and positive about the community it represents 1 
not nearly as good looking as the amazon picture makes it look 0 
good beer drink selection and good food selection 1 
1 hour 54 minutes of sheer tedium melodrama and horrible acting a mess of a script and a sinking feeling of good lord what were they thinking 0 
his losing his marbles so early in the proceedings is totally implausible and unconvincing 0 
i do not know if this was emilio estevezs directorial debut but the pacing the interplay and development of the characters as well as some clever camera work surrounding the character estevez plays all suggest a natural eye 1 
i own 2 of these cases and would order another 1 
it didnt work people can not hear me when i talk 0 
and i really did find them funny 1 
i have had problems wit hit dropping signal and more 0 
talk about useless customer service 0 
the ripped banana was not only ripped but petrified and tasteless 0 
the food was excellent and service was very good 1 
this is one of peter watkins most accessible films 1 
works great 1 
i am a fan of his this movie sucked really bad 0 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
the two main characters may be two of the most believable children i ever saw put on screen 1 
battery life is also great 1 
this product is great it makes working a lot easier i can go to the copier while waiting on hold for something 1 
so i am here to warn youdo not rent this movie it is the dumbest thing you have never seen 0 
20th century foxs road house 1948 is not only quite a silly noir but is an implausible unmitigated bore of a movie 0 
the ambiance isnt much better 0 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
i didnt know pulled pork could be soooo delicious 1 
performed awful muffled tinny incoming sound and severe echo for those on the other end of the call 0 
not recommended 0 
rude inconsiderate management 0 
and the red curry had so much bamboo shoots and wasnt very tasty to me 0 
hard to judge whether these sides were good because we were grossed out by the melted styrofoam and didnt want to eat it for fear of getting sick 0 
piece of junk 0 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
the sound is clear and the people i talk to on it are amazed at the quality too 1 
dont bother coming here 0 
i can say that the desserts were yummy 1 
i go to far too many places and ive never seen any restaurant that serves a 1 egg breakfast especially for 400 0 
their research and development division obviously knows what theyre doing 1 
service is also cute 1 
i saw this movie and i thought this is a stupid movie 0 
i totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is 1 
rating 010 grade z note the show is so bad that even mother of the cast pull her daughter out of the show 0 
utterly without merit on any level this is akin to torture 0 
it was a great phone 1 
good value works fine power via usb car or wall outlet 1 
and sometimes it was so embarrassing that i had to look away 0 
works great when my cat attacked the phone he scratched the protective strip instead of destroying the screen 1 
works well 1 
both great 1 
if you have several dozen or several hundred contacts then imagine the fun of sending each of them one by one 0 
spoilers whatever else can or cant be said about it surface is superbly crafted 1 
bt50 battery junk 0 
just does not work 0 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
after two i felt disgusting 0 
totally believable 1 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
my boyfriend tried the mediterranean chicken salad and fell in love 1 
items stated as included from the description are not included 0 
all it took was one drop from about 6 inches above the kitchen counter and it was crackedi am not impressed and i am not laughing 0 
great food 1 
the dining space is tiny but elegantly decorated and comfortable 1 
it is shameful 0 
buyerbe very careful 0 
after the first charge kept going dead after 12 minutes 0 
talk about great customer service of course we will be back 1 
this film has no redeeming features 0 
again lame 0 
you wont forget this movie 1 
by this time our side of the restaurant was almost empty so there was no excuse 0 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
the real killer is the volume and of course it breaking 0 
it was a waste of my money 0 
but it wasnt until i watched this film that i realised how great he actually was 1 
i wasnt the least bit interested 0 
this is a good battery and it got here really fast 1 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
each track commands sentiment actually contributing to the scenes and characters 1 
unfortunately it did not work 0 
lasted one day and then blew up 0 
love this headset 1 
i liked it 1 
im very disappointed with my decision 0 
just really good so far probably the best bt headset i have ever had 1 
wed definitely go back here again 1 
this is one of the best movies out there that shows such strong sibling bond for each other 1 
i dont have to be an accountant to know im getting screwed 0 
similarly the delivery man did not say a word of apology when our food was 45 minutes late 0 
an amazing finale to possibly the best trilogy of all time 1 
lots of holes in the script 0 
the classic maine lobster roll was fantastic 1 
great case and price 1 
its not hard to make a decent hamburger 0 
so flavorful and has just the perfect amount of heat 1 
from here on the widmark character turns unintentionally comical 0 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
dont go here 0 
each track commands sentiment actually contributing to the scenes and characters 1 
theres barely a boring moment in the film and there are plenty of humorous parts 1 
the chips and salsa were really good the salsa was very fresh 1 
if you simply want a small flip phone look elsewhere as the extra bells whistles are mediocre 0 
i love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it 1 
bland and flavorless is a good way of describing the barely tepid meat 0 
worst service to boot but that is the least of their worries 0 
the shower area is outside so you can only rinse not take a full shower unless you dont mind being nude for everyone to see 0 
i couldnt think of a better way to end the film but a smile on my face great way to wrap up an amazing film and trilogy 1 
we got the food and apparently they have never heard of salt and the batter on the fish was chewy 0 
this item worked great but it broke after 6 months of use 0 
the writer gorman bechard undoubtedly did his homework because all references are industry and characterage appropriate 1 
today the graphics are crap 0 
was not happy 0 
i was left shattered from the experience of watching this film and i took a good two hours to fully recover 0 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
this movie is possibly one of the most creative works of horror ever 1 
the pizza selections are good 1 
oh yeah and the storyline was pathetic too 0 
if you do watch it however there are small consolations the actresses playing annes sisters each do a wonderful job with their roles 1 
but if you liked movies like the matrix and better yet their sequels i think youll appreciate the thought provoking mindblowing experience this film will give you 1 
its a sad movie but very good 1 
i have had tmobile service for 2 or 3 years now and i am pretty happy with it 1 
the least said about the acting the better 0 
waste your money on this game 1 
special thanks to dylan t for the recommendation on what to order all yummy for my tummy 1 
the food was great as always compliments to the chef 1 
the mic there is a joke and the volume is quite low 0 
this is the kind of money that is wasted properly 1 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
also the area where my unit broke im not too fond of the magnetic strap 0 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
god and i can never get that 90 minutes back 0 
i give wirefly 1 stari will contact cingularatt and inform them of this practice 0 
perabo has a nice energy level and is obviously very comfortable in front of a camera 1 
this if the first movie ive given a 10 to in years 1 
1 hour 54 minutes of sheer tedium melodrama and horrible acting a mess of a script and a sinking feeling of good lord what were they thinking 0 
the visual effects were awful 0 
great choice 1 
the best electronics of the available fm transmitters 1 
this case has passed the one year mark and while it shows signs of wear it is 100 functional 1 
the handsfree part works fine but then the car tries to download the address book and the treo rebootsoverall i still rate this device high 1 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
this is a witty and delightful adaptation of the dr seuss book brilliantly animated by upas finest and thoroughly deserving of its academy award 1 
his use of the colours of the french flag in the three films was nothing short of incredible every shot every scene was like a work of art 1 
if you want a real scare rent this one 1 
for 40 bucks a head i really expect better food 0 
weird vibe from owners 0 
awful service 0 
tom wilkinson broke my heart at the end and everyone elses judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike 1 
i waited and waited 0 
the success of the film depends on the casting of sydney greenstreet as the alexander yardley character 1 
i really recommend this faceplates since it looks very nice elegant and cool 1 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
i wish i could return the unit and get back my money 0 
if i take a picture the battery drops a bar and starts beeping letting me know its dieing 0 
i have recommended it to friends 1 
the cinematography is simply stunning to say the least and the fx are nothing if not stateoftheart 1 
the mic is great 1 
i thoroughly enjoyed it when christopher eccleston took control of the tardis and the continuation of the series 1 
freezes frequently4 0 
definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly will return next time im in vegas 1 
he is one of my favourite directors and one of the most talented directors in the history of cinema 1 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
four stars for the food the guy in the blue shirt for his great vibe still letting us in to eat 1 
just really good so far probably the best bt headset i have ever had 1 
will be back again 1 
easy to pair with my samsung cell 1 
i dont know what the big deal is about this place but i wont be back yaall 0 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
when i received my pita it was huge it did have a lot of meat in it so thumbs up there 1 
i am very impressed with this headset from plantronics 1 
excellent cast story line performances 1 
terrible management 0 
service is quick and friendly 1 
worst hour and a half of my lifeoh my gosh 0 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
my fianc√© and i came in the middle of the day and we were greeted and seated right away 1 
service was very prompt 1 
it definitely was not as good as my s11 1 
hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in 0 
and the sound quality is great 1 
all of the main players are mesmerising 1 
i liked the patio and the service was outstanding 1 
i have eaten here multiple times and each time the food was delicious 1 
2 thumbs up 1 
service stinks here 0 
this movie is so awesome 1 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
with the originality and freshness of the first movie now spent this remake had little else to offer 0 
dont waste your time here 0 
i dont think there are any redeeming qualities in this remake 0 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
i love this cable it allows me to connect any miniusb device to my pc 1 
great price too 1 
oh and i forgot to also mention the weird color effect it has on your phone 0 
gets the job done 1 
the chefs were friendly and did a good job 1 
nothing special 0 
do not waste your money here 0 
it has everything i need and i couldnt ask for more 1 
its a mediocre miserable hollow laughable and predictable piece of garbage 0 
i have eaten here multiple times and each time the food was delicious 1 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
we asked for the bill to leave without eating and they didnt bring that either 0 
their rotating beers on tap is also a highlight of this place 1 
the directing and the cinematography arent quite as good 0 
bland and flavorless is a good way of describing the barely tepid meat 0 
the phone takes forever to charge like 2 to 5 hours literally 0 
ive also had problems with the phone reading the memory card in which i always turn it on and then off again 0 
i saw this movie and i thought this is a stupid movie 0 
nice blanket of moz over top but i feel like this was done to cover up the subpar food 1 
i really like this product over the motorola because it is allot clearer on the ear piece and the mic 1 
nargile i think you are great 1 
i had absolutely no problem with this headset linking to my 8530 blackberry curve 1 
i found this move beautiful enjoyable and uplifting 1 
i did not bother contacting the company for few dollar product but i learned the lesson that i should not have bought this form online anyway 0 
delicious and i will absolutely be back 1 
i couldnt think of a better way to end the film but a smile on my face great way to wrap up an amazing film and trilogy 1 
i got to enjoy the seafood salad with a fabulous vinegrette 1 
i understand that its supposed to be a cheap popcorn comedy but that doesnt mean that it has to completely insult our intelligence and have writing so incredibly hackneyed that it borders on offensive 0 
the only good thing was our waiter he was very helpful and kept the bloddy marys coming 1 
best tacos in town by far 1 
the buffet at bellagio was far from what i anticipated 0 
the mic there is a joke and the volume is quite low 0 
i love their fries and their beans 1 
problem is that the ear loops are made of weak material and break easily 0 
sound quality on both end is excellent i use headset to call my wife and ask my wife to use headset to call me 2 1 
the plug did not work very well 0 
the microphone also works well but according to people i have called it applifies everything 1 
it rocked my world and is certainly a must see for anyone with no social or physical outlets 1 
i love this phone it is very handy and has a lot of features 1 
i was left shattered from the experience of watching this film and i took a good two hours to fully recover 0 
this is the kind of money that is wasted properly 1 
the basic premise is wasted since it is sidelined by the inexplicable focus on the documentary crew 0 
emily watsons character is very strong and she has only to give a quick glance and you understand everything 1 
the cow tongue and cheek tacos are amazing 1 
good works fine 1 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
youll love it 1 
the owners really really need to quit being soooooo cheap let them wrap my freaking sandwich in two papers not one 0 
all of the tapas dishes were delicious 1 
i was so insulted 0 
and finally after all that we get to an ending that wouldve been great had it been handled by competent people and not jerry falwell 0 
now imagine that every single one of those decisions was made wrong 0 
i would recommend it 1 
the camera really likes her in this movie 1 
i checked out this place a couple years ago and was not impressed 0 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
the point is the journey a journey that touches every member of the family 1 
waiter was a jerk 0 
the design is very good4 1 
constantine gives everything the right intensity and seems to have a good understanding of the underlying psychological motivations 1 
the bose noise cancelling is amazing which is very important for a nyc commuter 1 
the ngage is still lacking in earbuds 0 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
the screen size is big key pad lit well enough and the camera quality is excellent for a camera phone 1 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
there is so much good food in vegas that i feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to rice and company 0 
a world better than 95 of the garbage in the theatres today 1 
i enjoyed reading this book to my children when they were little 1 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
i was sitting in my vehicle with the cradle on my belt and the headset lost signal 0 
this was one of the worst films i have ever seen 0 
its too bad the food is so damn generic 0 
a drive thru means you do not want to wait around for half an hour for your food but somehow when we end up going here they make us wait and wait 0 
his use of the colours of the french flag in the three films was nothing short of incredible every shot every scene was like a work of art 1 
total letdown i would much rather just go to the camelback flower shop and cartel coffee 0 
the basic premise is wasted since it is sidelined by the inexplicable focus on the documentary crew 0 
i purchased this and within 2 days it was no longer working 0 
i went to bachi burger on a friends recommendation and was not disappointed 1 
so dont go there if you are looking for good food 0 
our server was very nice and even though he looked a little overwhelmed with all of our needs he stayed professional and friendly until the end 1 
but in terms of the writing its very fresh and bold 1 
bland not a liking this place for a number of reasons and i dont want to waste time on bad reviewing ill leave it at that 0 
i thought errol flynn was brilliant as custer and has since become my favourite actor 1 
this is an excellent film 1 
but the service was beyond bad 0 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
i dressed up to be treated so rudely 0 
rating 1 out of 10 0 
you share general loewenhielms exquisite joy in his partaking of the cailles en sarcophage even though you are just watching a movie but you do wish for just a small sample to savor 1 
i was particularly pleased with the acting ability of dwight schultz 1 
an hour seriously 0 
first of all there are enough racial stereotypes and racial jokes to offend everyone 0 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
the problem was the script 0 
the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach 0 
it is zillion times away from reality 0 
easily none other cartoon made me laugh in a tender way before getting into dark sitcoms oriented for teenagers 1 
the cast of veteran actors are more than just a nostalgia trip 1 
great for ipods too 1 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
nice blanket of moz over top but i feel like this was done to cover up the subpar food 1 
the turkey and roast beef were bland 0 
i am very happy 1 
great for ipods too 1 
the only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive 1 
ill even say it again ¬ñ this is torture 0 
it is very comfortable to wear as well which is probably the most important aspect about using a case 1 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
im a bit disappointed 0 
similarly the delivery man did not say a word of apology when our food was 45 minutes late 0 
the ngage is still lacking in earbuds 0 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani ¬ñ particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
the good cinematography also makes her and monica bellucci look very beautiful 1 
disappointing 0 
i will never forget it now 1 
the result is a powerhouse achievement made more timely now perhaps because of our cultures disturbing fascination with celebrity and its distorted interpretations of fame 1 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
there is no plot or storyline 0 
i didnt realize how wonderful the short really is until the last two scenes 1 
never got it 0 
works great 1 
there is no plot here to keep you going in the first place 0 
it was just not a fun experience 1 
i am very happy 1 
an hour and a half i wish i could bring back 0 
yes this film does require a rather significant amount of puzzlesolving but the pieces fit together to create a beautiful picture 1 
clear skype calls long battery life long range 1 
it definitely was not as good as my s11 1 
the jerky camera movements were also annoying 0 
and if that isnt enough of a mess of a movie for you the picture is also marred with a constant use of studio sets and indoor exteriors 0 
long whiny and pointless 0 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
i would recommend this 1 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
comfortable fit you need your headset to be comfortable for at least an hour at a time if not for an entire day 1 
the art style has the appearance of crayonpencil drawings and is wonderfully colorful and fanciful 1 
waited and waited and waited 0 
if that bug never showed up i would have given a 4 for sure but on the other side of the wall where this bug was climbing was the kitchen 0 
favorite place in town for shawarrrrrrma 1 
my ribeye steak was cooked perfectly and had great mesquite flavor 1 
when i opened the sandwich i was impressed but not in a good way 0 
ambience is perfect 1 
its also great to see that renowned silent screenwriter frances marion hasnt missed a step going from silent to sound 1 
the things that the four kids get themselves into is absolutely hilarious to watch 1 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
it was way over fried 0 
piece of junk 0 
basically the service was very bad 0 
at around 4 pm i bought it at around 8pm i started to watch at around 815pm i fast forwarded the remaining film to see if there was anything left watchable for a human being with a brain but there wasnt 0 
if you do watch it however there are small consolations the actresses playing annes sisters each do a wonderful job with their roles 1 
the acting was decidely wooden though no worse than a period universal b movie 0 
o my gosh the best phone i have ever had 1 
service is quick and even to go orders are just like we like it 1 
mishima is extremely uninteresting 0 
i tried talking real loud but shouting on the telephone gets old and i was still told it wasnt great 0 
the service was extremely slow 0 
raw and sublimely moving 1 
a great touch 1 
i was very excited to get this headset because i thought it was really cute 1 
crash is a depressing little nothing that provokes emotion but teaches you nothing if you already know racism and prejudice are bad things 0 
ive had this bluetoooth headset for some time now and still not comfortable with the way it fits on the ear 0 
this is so embarassing and also my ears hurt if i try to push the ear plug into my ear 0 
the shipping time was also very quick 1 
it was too predictable even for a chick flick 0 
they brought a fresh batch of fries and i was thinking yay something warm but no 0 
of course the acting is blah 0 
i have had this phone for over a year now and i will tell you its not that great 0 
the movie lacks visual interest drama expression of feeling and celebration of the very patriotism that underlines the narrative 0 
lots of holes in the script 0 
the best scene in the movie was when gerardo is trying to find a song that keeps running through his head 1 
it quit working after id used it for about 18 months so i just purchased another one because this is the best headset ive ever owned 1 
definitely worth checking out 1 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
now imagine that every single one of those decisions was made wrong 0 
this one is simply a disappointment 0 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
it is a joy to use 1 
the music in the film is really nice too 1 
this is just a great movie 1 
echo problemvery unsatisfactory 0 
if there is a wind it is completely useless 0 
overall i like there food and the service 1 
call me a nut but i think this is one of the best movies ever 1 
it failed to convey the broad sweep of landscapes that were a great part of the original 0 
the worst phone from samsungcrap this crappy samsung e715 is the worst i have ever seeen 0 
it never condescends all the characters have good genuine hearts and believable problems 1 
i couldnt think of a better way to end the film but a smile on my face great way to wrap up an amazing film and trilogy 1 
juano hernandez an exceptional actor who played supporting roles in many films of the era is a proud black man who is accused of murdering a white man in the south 1 
the worst piece of crap ever along with the verizon customer service 0 
we waited for thirty minutes to be seated although there were 8 vacant tables and we were the only folks waiting 0 
interesting decor 1 
a very very very slowmoving aimless movie about a distressed drifting young man 0 
prosgood camera very nice pictures also has cool styles like black and white and more 1 
then our food came out disappointment ensued 0 
they are so easy to love but even more easy to identify with 1 
i bought this phone as a replacement for my startac and have regretted it since 0 
excellent short film 1 
probably not in a hurry to go back 0 
i know he was a contract player with little control over his scripts but the acting was as bad as the script 0 
i loved it 1 
this is an excellent film 1 
i was not happy with this item 0 
best service and food ever maria our server was so good and friendly she made our day 1 
a fantastic neighborhood gem 1 
this movie is terrible 0 
you wont be disappointed 1 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
excellent phone 1 
i love this bluetooth 1 
im not sure what he was trying to do with this film 0 
piece of trash 0 
give this one a look 1 
conclusion i loved it 1 
i was deeply impressed with the character he played 1 
the service here is fair at best 0 
the new characters werent all that memorable and i found myself forgetting who was who 0 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
the service was meh 0 
they could serve it with just the vinaigrette and it may make for a better overall dish but it was still very good 1 
i could not recommend these more 0 
it was a pale color instead of nice and char and has no flavor 0 
my experience was terrible this was my fourth bluetooth headset and while it was much more comfortable than my last jabra which i hated 0 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
this gets a 1 out of 10 simply because theres nothing lower 0 
this one is simply a disappointment 0 
just really good so far probably the best bt headset i have ever had 1 
food was so gooodd 1 
now this is a movie i really dislike 0 
not tasty and the texture was just nasty 0 
it doesnt make you look cool 0 
stopped by during the late may bank holiday off rick steve recommendation and loved it 1 
what a great double cheeseburger 1 
also great directing and photography 1 
i could care less the interior is just beautiful 1 
the chicken i got was definitely reheated and was only ok the wedges were cold and soggy 0 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
one of the most disappointing aspects is the lack of notable gore 0 
ive dropped my phone more times than i can say even on concrete and my phone is still great knock on wood 1 
i would recommend this 1 
but it does get better reception and clarity than any phone ive had before 1 
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1 
this is an excellent tool especially when paired with your phones autoanswer 1 
great charger 1 
it will drive you barking mad 0 
trying to make a call on these is an exercise in frustration 0 
this movie was kind of long in length but i enjoyed every minute of it 1 
also great directing and photography 1 
here in the wind and the lion we see a wonderful rendering of americas own imperial age 1 
it rocked my world and is certainly a must see for anyone with no social or physical outlets 1 
it is unusable in a moving car at freeway speed 0 
im in az all the time and now have my new spot 1 
an interesting premise and billy drago is always good as a dangerous nutbag side note id love to see drago stephen mchattie and lance hendrikson in a flick together talk about raging cheekbones 1 
i guess that nobody at the network that aired this dribble watched it before putting it on 0 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
to call this movie a drama is ridiculous 0 
i get absolutely horrible reception in my apartment where with other phones i have not had this problem 0 
i am very impressed with this headset from plantronics 1 
only like 3 or 4 buildings used a couple of locations maybe poor hummh 0 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
all the characters in this film are tremendously well played 1 
this product is clearly not ready for prime time i dont care how cool it looks if you cant tell a call is coming in its worthless 0 
awful 0 
i received my headset in good time and was happy with it 1 
also notable is john baileys fine crisp beautifully colored cinematography and the great production design costumes by eiko ishioka who went on to do the memorable costumes for coppolas dracula for which she received a well deserved oscar 1 
long whiny and pointless 0 
i love this thing 1 
i love all the features and form factor 1 
there was no chemistry between ben affleck and sandra bullock in this film and i couldnt understand why he would consider even leaving his wifetobe for this chick that he supposedly was knocked out by 0 
highly unprofessional and rude to a loyal patron 0 
nice headset priced right 1 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
down the drain because of a weak snap 0 
battery has no life 0 
so bad 0 
i liked it 1 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
voice quality signal strength dropped calls 0 
down the drain because of a weak snap 0 
it was that loudglad to say that the plantronics 510 maintains a flawless connection to my cell and with no static during normal use 1 
conclusion i loved it 1 
great choice 1 
i love the camera its really pretty good quality 1 
excellent cast story line performances 1 
however bt headsets are currently not good for real time games like firstperson shooters since the audio delay messes me up 0 
dont make the same mistake that i did and please dont buy this phone 0 
it even has its sweet moments 1 
would not go back 0 
im so happy to be here 1 
the acting is beyond abysmal 0 
we walked away stuffed and happy about our first vegas buffet experience 1 
if you havent gone here go now 1 
very serious spoilers this movie was a huge disappointment 0 
overall i like there food and the service 1 
at least think to refill my water before i struggle to wave you over for 10 minutes 0 
be sure to order dessert even if you need to pack it togo the tiramisu and cannoli are both to die for 1 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
the story is also both funny and poignant at times 1 
there is nothing authentic about this place 0 
great product for the price 1 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
the roast beef sandwich tasted really good 1 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
it is just the sort of pap that is screened in the afternoon to punish the unemployed for not having jobs 0 
easily none other cartoon made me laugh in a tender way before getting into dark sitcoms oriented for teenagers 1 
incredible 1 
i did not bother contacting the company for few dollar product but i learned the lesson that i should not have bought this form online anyway 0 
the puppets look really cheesy not in a good way like in the puppet master 80s flicks 0 
damn good steak 1 
dont make the same mistake that i did and please dont buy this phone 0 
my order was not correct 0 
the cashew cream sauce was bland and the vegetables were undercooked 0 
it is light has plenty of battery capacity and is very confortable to wear for somewhat extended periods of time 1 
setup went very smoothly 1 
an interesting premise and billy drago is always good as a dangerous nutbag side note id love to see drago stephen mchattie and lance hendrikson in a flick together talk about raging cheekbones 1 
you truly take this journey through the eyes and soul of a child 1 
same problem as others have mentioned 0 
the bathrooms are clean and the place itself is well decorated 1 
not what i wanted 0 
great earpiece 1 
definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly will return next time im in vegas 1 
as many people complained i found this headsets microphone was very weak 0 
it is unusable in a moving car at freeway speed 0 
doesnt hold charge 0 
the dialogue is composed of things that make little sense 0 
another note about this phones appearance is that it really looks rather bland especially in the all black model 0 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
almost everyone involved must be return to school acting is utterly predictable and bad script is pile of garbage all round 0 
greatno problems at all 1 
nice blanket of moz over top but i feel like this was done to cover up the subpar food 1 
a good commentary of todays love and undoubtedly a film worth seeing 1 
low quality 0 
i felt asleep the first time i watched it so i can recommend it for insomniacs 0 
so i am here to warn youdo not rent this movie it is the dumbest thing you have never seen 0 
give this one a look 1 
the design is very good4 1 
nice spicy and tender 1 
very good though 1 
after 3 months screen just went black all of a sudden 0 
the food wasnt good 0 
i saw this short film on hbo the other day and absolutely loved it 1 
everyone is very attentive providing excellent customer service 1 
the phone was unusable and was not new 0 
steve martin delivers a really funny performance of a middleaged upper class uptight white guy 1 
the potato chip order was sad i could probably count how many chips were in that box and it was probably around 12 0 
always a great time at dos gringos 1 
the only thing really worth watching was the scenery and the house because it is beautiful 1 
the acting is fantastic the stories are seamlessly woven together and the dogs are splendid a must rent view or see 1 
the jerky camera movements were also annoying 0 
i love the camera its really pretty good quality 1 
i will not return 0 
favorite place in town for shawarrrrrrma 1 
crust is not good 0 
performed awful muffled tinny incoming sound and severe echo for those on the other end of the call 0 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
you truly take this journey through the eyes and soul of a child 1 
returned 8 hours later 0 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
this was such an awesome movie that i bought it off of ebay 1 
the food wasnt good 0 
a standout scene 1 
all i can do is whine on the internet so here it goesthe more i use the thing the less i like it 0 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
i always order from the vegetarian menu during dinner which has a wide array of options to choose from 1 
it is not good 0 
treo and tmobile refused to replace it again and forced me to buy another phone without any kind of upgrade discount 0 
add betty white and jean smart and you have a great cast everyone played their parts really well 1 
i wont be back 0 
unfortunately it will not recharge my iphone 4s despite connecting it from multiple power sources imac external battery wall outlet etc 0 
the biggest complaint i have is the battery drains superfast 0 
bluetooth does not work phone locks up screens just flash up and now it just makes calls randomly while in my pocket locked 0 
the chips and salsa were really good the salsa was very fresh 1 
perhaps my phone is defective but people cannot hear me when i use this 0 
bad purchase 0 
would come back again if i had a sushi craving while in vegas 1 
it didnt work people can not hear me when i talk 0 
service was good and the company was better 1 
there was no chemistry between ben affleck and sandra bullock in this film and i couldnt understand why he would consider even leaving his wifetobe for this chick that he supposedly was knocked out by 0 
never got it 0 
tom wilkinson broke my heart at the end and everyone elses judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike 1 
this movie totally grates on my nerves 0 
it was so funny 1 
when achille and philippa beautifully sing a duet from don giovanni that perfectly describes their situation in the movie you appreciate the subtle layers of this excellent film 1 
the block was amazing 1 
terrible my car will not accept this cassette 0 
probably never coming back and wouldnt recommend it 0 
it looked like a wonderful story 1 
after 3 months screen just went black all of a sudden 0 
the film has great actors a master director a significant themeat least a wouldbe significant theme undertone of fifties existential worldweariness aerial scenes that ought to have thrilled both senses and imagination and characters about which one might deeply care 1 
putting the race card aside lets look at the major flaw in the film they destroy latifas character 0 
judith light is one of my favorite actresses and i think she does a superb job in this film 1 
this company charge me a restocking fee and still not given me my refund back 0 
you could only take 2 videos at a time and the quality was very poor 0 
this was my first time and i cant wait until the next 1 
i got this phone on reccomendation from a relative and im glad i did 1 
classywarm atmosphere fun and fresh appetizers succulent steaks baseball steak 1 
i know this is not like the other restaurants at all something is very off here 0 
its uncomfortable and the sound quality is quite poor compared with the phone razr or with my previous wired headset that plugged into an lg 0 
our server was very nice and even though he looked a little overwhelmed with all of our needs he stayed professional and friendly until the end 1 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
i want my money back 0 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
both films are terrible but to the credit of the 1986 version it was watchable 0 
i like armand assante my cable companys summary sounded interesting so i watched it twice already and probably will again 1 
it felt like a very gripping intelligent stage play but without the overly theatrical feeling one actually gets from watching people on a stage which plays on everyones terror of a white lie escalating to monstrous consequences 1 
lordy the khao soi is a dish that is not to be missed for curry lovers 1 
i could barely stomach the meal but didnt complain because it was a business lunch 0 
your servers suck wait correction our server heimer sucked 0 
good item low price 1 
the cg opening sequence in space looked like it could have been created on microsoft slideshow for gods sake 0 
the good cinematography also makes her and monica bellucci look very beautiful 1 
this is probably one of the least effective and utterly unoriginal films i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
great service and food 1 
after trying many many handsfree gadgets this is the one that finally works well 1 
i cannot make calls at certain places 0 
i love being able to use one headset for both by landline and cell 1 
the screen size is big key pad lit well enough and the camera quality is excellent for a camera phone 1 
very good stuff for the price 1 
his performance is simply genius 1 
i great reception all the time 1 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
their onscreen chemistry critical to the entire film is genuine 1 
i work in the hospitality industry in paradise valley and have refrained from recommending cibo any longer 0 
att is not clear sound is very distorted and you have to yell when you talk 0 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
not good enough for the price 0 
the owners really really need to quit being soooooo cheap let them wrap my freaking sandwich in two papers not one 0 
damian is so talented and versatile in so many ways of writing and portraying different characters on screen 1 
very dissapointing performance 0 
i just wanted to leave 0 
these are the nicest restaurant owners ive ever come across 1 
my experience was terrible this was my fourth bluetooth headset and while it was much more comfortable than my last jabra which i hated 0 
constantine gives everything the right intensity and seems to have a good understanding of the underlying psychological motivations 1 
worst service to boot but that is the least of their worries 0 
the plastic breaks really easy on this clip 0 
pretty piece of junk 0 
i give wirefly 1 stari will contact cingularatt and inform them of this practice 0 
the phone is sturdy and waterproof 1 
i dont know exactly what it is about this movie but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our familys memories 1 
w810i is just superb 1 
walked in and the place smelled like an old grease trap and only 2 others there eating 0 
utter crap sound quality is terrible 0 
the scenery that the two daughters paint and photograph are beautiful 1 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
this second appearance of mickey mouse following the silent plane crazy earlier that year is probably his most famous filmmostly because it was so groundbreaking 1 
very happy with this product 1 
what a waste 0 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
so anyone near you will hear part of your conversation 0 
i could barely stomach the meal but didnt complain because it was a business lunch 0 
this place is not worth your time let alone vegas 0 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
i will not return 0 
it quit working after id used it for about 18 months so i just purchased another one because this is the best headset ive ever owned 1 
it felt too light and tinny 0 
i couldnt think of a better way to end the film but a smile on my face great way to wrap up an amazing film and trilogy 1 
how this piece of trash was ever released is beyond me the acting the story the characters the supposedly special effects etcits all wrong 0 
nice headset priced right 1 
delicious nyc bagels good selections of cream cheese real lox with capers even 1 
all the bread is made inhouse 1 
i highly recommend this movie for anyone interested in art poetry theater politics or japanese history 1 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
the camera really likes her in this movie 1 
this movie has a cutting edge to it 1 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
the writer gorman bechard undoubtedly did his homework because all references are industry and characterage appropriate 1 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
i love this place 1 
they do not last forever but is not overly expensive to replaceeasy to operate and the sound is much better than others i have tried 1 
so far so good 1 
this is some seriously good pizza and im an expertconnisseur on the topic 1 
all the actors give a wonderful performance especially jennifer rubin as jamie harris who changes from the nervous starlet in the beginning through the strange events she is part of to the cool star 1 
i didnt know pulled pork could be soooo delicious 1 
doesnt work at all i bougth it for my l7c and its not working 0 
saw the movie today and thought it was a good effort good messages for kids 1 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
the instruction manual is lacking 0 
this was like the final blow 0 
i even dropped this phone into a stream and it was submerged for 15 seconds and it still works great 1 
but in any case the best part is you can download these pictures to your laptop using ir or even send pictures from your laptop to the phone 1 
i dont have to be an accountant to know im getting screwed 0 
sweetest phone 1 
not good by any stretch of the imagination 0 
i think it was robert ryans best film because he portrayed someone like my father and he was a schizophrenic in real lifemy father although he never murdered anyone but was affected more so during the second world war which made him worse 1 
i wasnt really impressed with strip steak 0 
crostini that came with the salad was stale 0 
during several different 2 minute calls i experienced 5 drops and it was in an area that had 5 bars 0 
this is hands down the best phone ive ever had 1 
raw and sublimely moving 1 
i took back my money and got outta there 0 
i like steiners because its dark and it feels like a bar 1 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
there was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth but it didnt really work into the rest of the plot 0 
it is unusable in a moving car at freeway speed 0 
the best scene in the movie was when gerardo is trying to find a song that keeps running through his head 1 
i still maintain that monkeys shouldnt make headphones we just obviously dont share enough dna to copy the design over to humans 0 
the service was not up to par either 0 
total brunch fail 0 
i would recommend saving room for this 1 
the football scenes at the end were perplexing 0 
everything was gross 0 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
interesting decor 1 
special mention should be made of the superb music score and sound effects which are an integral element in helping to make this such a memorable and enjoyable cartoon 1 
have been going since 2007 and every meal has been awesome 1 
when im on this side of town this will definitely be a spot ill hit up again 1 
very unreliable service from tmobile 0 
the presentation of the food was awful 0 
the acting sucks the music sucks the script sucks the pacing sucks the special fx suck the directing sucks basically this movie sucks 0 
juano hernandez an exceptional actor who played supporting roles in many films of the era is a proud black man who is accused of murdering a white man in the south 1 
at least think to refill my water before i struggle to wave you over for 10 minutes 0 
i think it was robert ryans best film because he portrayed someone like my father and he was a schizophrenic in real lifemy father although he never murdered anyone but was affected more so during the second world war which made him worse 1 
needless to say we will never be back here again 0 
omelets are to die for 1 
the acting helps the writing along very well maybe the idiotsavant sister could have been played better and it is a real joy to watch 1 
the staff is friendly and the joint is always clean 1 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
id like to return it 0 
this phone tries very hard to do everything but fails at its very ability to be a phone 0 
for a product that costs as much as this one does i expect it to work far better and with greater ease than this thing does 0 
he deserves 5 stars 1 
food quality has been horrible 0 
i got the aluminum case for my new palm vx and it worked really wellit has protected my handheld perfectly so far 1 
it was also the right balance of war and love 1 
the cashew cream sauce was bland and the vegetables were undercooked 0 
ive also had problems with the phone reading the memory card in which i always turn it on and then off again 0 
buttons are too small 0 
nice case feels good in your hands 1 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
the handsfree part works fine but then the car tries to download the address book and the treo rebootsoverall i still rate this device high 1 
everyone is treated equally special 1 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
the performances are not improved by improvisation because the actors now have twice as much to worry about not only whether theyre delivering the line well but whether the line itself is any good 0 
i thoroughly enjoyed it when christopher eccleston took control of the tardis and the continuation of the series 1 
seriously flavorful delights folks 1 
it was a bit too sweet not really spicy enough and lacked flavor 0 
when a song could explain the emotions of the subjects better such as when jay adams unfortunate life was a subject of talk the song old man by neil young was played which evokes many emotions 1 
theres also enough hypocrisy in this film to make me vomit 0 
this movie is terrible 0 
this movie is possibly one of the most creative works of horror ever 1 
disappointing accessory from a good manufacturer 0 
the tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu 0 
this was utterly confusing at first which caused me to lose a couple of very very important contacts 0 
if you do watch it however there are small consolations the actresses playing annes sisters each do a wonderful job with their roles 1 
if you love death and decay and shakespears lyrics this is the one 1 
the update procedure is difficult and cumbersome 0 
the price is reasonable and the service is great 1 
id like to return it 0 
i checked out this place a couple years ago and was not impressed 0 
i recently tried caballeros and i have been back every week since 1 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
the lines the cuts the audio everything is wrong 0 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
dont waste your time watching this rubbish nonresearched film 0 
from what my dinner companions told meeverything was very fresh with nice texture and taste 1 
the battery is completely useless to me 0 
i thought it was bad 0 
poor voice clarity 0 
very displeased 0 
lordy the khao soi is a dish that is not to be missed for curry lovers 1 
i agree with jessica this movie is pretty bad 0 
i will not return 0 
best ive found so far ive tried 2 other bluetooths and this one has the best quality for both me and the listener as well as ease of using 1 
a great film by a great director 1 
yeah the movie pretty much sucked 0 
i am not a filmmaker nor am i a director but i would hide my head in the sand if id spent whatever amount of money and time on this movie 0 
it is an hour and half waste of time following a bunch of very pretty high schoolers whine and cry about life 0 
never got it 0 
by far the best cheesecurds we have ever had 1 
seriously its not worth wasting your or your kids time on 0 
this is hands down the best phone ive ever had 1 
crust is not good 0 
omelets are to die for 1 
this is a beautiful phone 1 
i give wirefly 1 stari will contact cingularatt and inform them of this practice 0 
uncomfortable in the ear dont use with lg vx9900 env 0 
this is some seriously good pizza and im an expertconnisseur on the topic 1 
its not what it says it is 0 
then scene where they debated whether or not to sack the trumpeter who falsely was accused for the murder is pure horror really stupid 0 
i dont recommend unless your car breaks down in front of it and you are starving 0 
this wonderful experience made this place a muststop whenever we are in town again 1 
up there with the best of melville 1 
it presents a idyllic yet serious portrayal of the ups and downs of the characters lives 1 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
attempting artiness with black white and clever camera angles the movie disappointed became even more ridiculous as the acting was poor and the plot and lines almost nonexistent 0 
so flavorful and has just the perfect amount of heat 1 
oh the charger seems to work fine 1 
the reception has been generally good 1 
we thought youd have to venture further away to get good sushi but this place really hit the spot that night 1 
people who like european films and art movies will like this movie 1 
uncomfortable in the ear dont use with lg vx9900 env 0 
great place to eat reminds me of the little mom and pop shops in the san francisco bay area 1 
i was very disappointed in the movie 0 
it was that year however that reminded us that huston was still at the top of his game as evinced by his faithful adaptation of james joyces acclaimed novella the dead 1 
the service was not up to par either 0 
very disappointed 0 
i know this is not like the other restaurants at all something is very off here 0 
lightweight and works well 1 
the awful dialogue and hopeless overacting by everyone who gets shot top off a real waste of space and time 0 
this product had a strong rubberpetroleum smell that was unbearable after a while and caused me to return it 0 
disappointed with battery 0 
the problem was the script 0 
thank you for such great service 1 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
poor talk time performance 0 
we definately enjoyed ourselves 1 
this is the first phone ive had that has been so cheaply made 0 
i wont spoil it but the ending in pretty amazing 1 
rating 010 grade z note the show is so bad that even mother of the cast pull her daughter out of the show 0 
for those that havent seen it dont waste your time 0 
maybe its just their vegetarian fare but ive been twice and i thought it was average at best 0 
my 810 score is mostly for the plot 1 
the stories were as unbelievable as the actors 0 
too politically correct 0 
the owner used to work at nobu so this place is really similar for half the price 1 
too bad cause i know its family owned i really wanted to like this place 0 
the worst experience ever 0 
comfortable nice range good battery life 1 
last night was my second time dining here and i was so happy i decided to go back 1 
avoid avoid avoid 0 
there is no real plot 0 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
i had strawberry tea which was good 1 
the sweet potato fries were very good and seasoned well 1 
you wont regret it 1 
great product 1 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
battery has no life 0 
seafood was limited to boiled shrimp and crab legs but the crab legs definitely did not taste fresh 0 
i waited and waited 0 
there is nothing authentic about this place 0 
im a big fan of this series mostly due to anne rices style sensitivities and treatments 1 
the food was delicious our bartender was attentive and personable and we got a great deal 1 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
you also cannot take pictures with it in the case because the lense is covered 0 
a very very very slowmoving aimless movie about a distressed drifting young man 0 
it makes very strange ticking noises before it ends the call 0 
i recently tried caballeros and i have been back every week since 1 
the real disappointment was our waiter 0 
this is an unbelievable bargain 1 
the worst sappiest dialogue i could go on and on 0 
i rather enjoyed it 1 
saggy floppy piece of junk 0 
think of the film being like a dream 1 
an hour and a half i wish i could bring back 0 
it was a drive to get there 0 
i have to jiggle the plug to get it to line up right to get decent volume 0 
but i dont like it 0 
this case seems well made 1 
its still wild stuff though and is highly recommended to fans of giallo cinema 1 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
ive also had problems with the phone reading the memory card in which i always turn it on and then off again 0 
i paid too much 0 
they are so easy to love but even more easy to identify with 1 
works great 1 
the chains which im no fan of beat this place easily 0 
2 thumbs up to this seller 1 
i will come back here every time im in vegas 1 
good audio quality 1 
you cant beat that 1 
this is a disgrace 0 
better than youd expect 1 
it lasts less than 3o minutes if i actually try to use the phonemy wife has the same phone with the same problem 0 
mediocre food 0 
not even a hello we will be right with you 0 
plantronics bluetooth excelent buy 1 
i also didnt like the on button it felt like it would crack with use 0 
this place deserves no stars 0 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
i probably would not go here again 0 
watching washing machine twirling around wouldnt hurt your eyes as much as this show 0 
food was really boring 0 
how this piece of trash was ever released is beyond me the acting the story the characters the supposedly special effects etcits all wrong 0 
im a bit disappointed 0 
the sets especially designed to work with the camera are amazingstylized beautiful and effective 1 
ive only had my bluetooth for a few weeks but i really like it 1 
2 times very bad customer service 0 
not my thing 0 
i had to go to a store and bought a new nokia phone which is working great 1 
this is an extraordinary film 1 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
after two i felt disgusting 0 
the steak and the shrimp are in my opinion the best entrees at gc 1 
hes a national treasure 1 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
it didnt charge for me 0 
great character actors telly savalas and peter boyle 1 
an excellent new restaurant by an experienced frenchman 1 
putting the race card aside lets look at the major flaw in the film they destroy latifas character 0 
i cannot believe that the actors agreed to do this film 0 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
howeverthe riingtones are not the best and neither are the games 0 
also the area where my unit broke im not too fond of the magnetic strap 0 
mark my words this is one of those cult films like evil dead 2 or phantasm that people will still be discovering and falling in love with 20 30 40 years down the line 1 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
best of all is the rotating feature very helpful 1 
the movie is terribly boring in places 0 
graphics is far from the best part of the game 0 
o my gosh the best phone i have ever had 1 
the directing and the cinematography arent quite as good 0 
really pleased with this product so far 1 
i have to mention this and it is a huge spoiler i loved the ending how all the characters of the three films were the remaining survivors of the ferry disaster with valentine and the young judge together and the old man watching it on her tv solidifying his happiness over the suffering which he dealt with for those many years 1 
piece of trash 0 
it is simple to use and i like it 1 
trouble is the writing and directing make it impossible to establish those things that make a movie watchable like character story theme and so on 0 
if there was ever an indication of a writer and a directors ability to meld two highly volatile temperaments into a seamless union of creativity then this is it 1 
you learn a lot about the real inside emotions of people in this movie and a lot about the movie business itself 1 
it is cheap and it feel and look just as cheap 0 
these were so good we ordered them twice 1 
the service was meh 0 
see both films if you can 1 
maybe its just their vegetarian fare but ive been twice and i thought it was average at best 0 
worst hour and a half of my lifeoh my gosh 0 
exactly what i wanted 1 
my rating just 3 out of 10 0 
good beer drink selection and good food selection 1 
after 3 months screen just went black all of a sudden 0 
great food 1 
overall i like this place a lot 1 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
it rocked my world and is certainly a must see for anyone with no social or physical outlets 1 
i bought this phone as a replacement for my startac and have regretted it since 0 
this is an excellent film 1 
so they performed 1 
fans of the genre will be in heaven 1 
this place lacked style 0 
aside from its terrible lead this film has loads of other debits 0 
my fella got the huevos rancheros and they didnt look too appealing 0 
they are so easy to love but even more easy to identify with 1 
just whatever you do avoid groove as its the antithesis of all that is good about human traffic 0 
the tracfonewebsite is user friendly and makes it easy toactivate etc 1 
wasted two hours 0 
spend your money and time some place else 0 
same evening him and i are both drastically sick 0 
the servers went back and forth several times not even so much as an are you being helped 0 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
it worked very well 1 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
sam shepards portrayal of a gung ho marine was sobering 1 
this is an outstanding little restaurant with some of the best food i have ever tasted 1 
bad quality 0 
service is also cute 1 
easy to use 1 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
this case seems well made 1 
it is so small and you dont even realize that it is there after a while of getting used to it 1 
it is zillion times away from reality 0 
i received it quickly and it works great 1 
they made this case too small and is very difficult to install 0 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
the service was terrible though 0 
first time going but i think i will quickly become a regular 1 
this is an unbelievable bargain 1 
not my thing 0 
this pair of headphones is the worst that i have ever had soundwise 0 
it is super charged up for use as a small hybrid palmtopcameracellphone and excels in those roles 1 
a standout scene 1 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
but the premise of the film was so ridiculous that the president of the us 0 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
battery is holding up well 1 
its a long time since i was so entertained by a movie 1 
it was so bad i had lost the heart to finish it 0 
highquality chicken on the chicken caesar salad 1 
sound quality on both end is excellent i use headset to call my wife and ask my wife to use headset to call me 2 1 
this is one of the better buffets that i have been to 1 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
nonlinear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well 1 
good food good service 1 
would not go back 0 
the script is horrendously stupid 0 
nice quality build unlike some cheap s out there 1 
does not fit 0 
this company charge me a restocking fee and still not given me my refund back 0 
after my phone got to be about a year old its been slowly breaking despite much care on my part 0 
the loudspeaker option is great the bumpers with the lights is very appealing 0 
the music in the film is really nice too 1 
the cinematographyif it can be called thatsucked 0 
the ambiance isnt much better 0 
i went to bachi burger on a friends recommendation and was not disappointed 1 
his use of the colours of the french flag in the three films was nothing short of incredible every shot every scene was like a work of art 1 
awful service 0 
the service here leaves a lot to be desired 0 
very disappointed 0 
they do not care about the consumer one bit 0 
the last 15 minutes of movie are also not bad as well 1 
the attractive set used throughout most of the film is an eyepleasing gem 1 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
i am not a filmmaker nor am i a director but i would hide my head in the sand if id spent whatever amount of money and time on this movie 0 
item arrived quickly and works great with my metro pcs samsung schr450 slider phone and sony premium sound in ear plugs 1 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
each day of the week they have a different deal and its all so delicious 1 
nice sound 1 
painful on the ear 0 
excellent 1 
they dropped more than the ball 0 
gotta love those closeups of slimy drooling teeth 1 
great brunch spot 1 
the films dialogue is natural real to life 1 
these are fabulous 1 
i would advise to not purchase this item it never worked very well 0 
so i basically threw my money out the window for nothing 0 
interesting decor 1 
eew this location needs a complete overhaul 0 
the two main characters may be two of the most believable children i ever saw put on screen 1 
the movie showed a lot of florida at its best made it look very appealing 1 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
very very disappointed ordered the 35 big bay plater 0 
this was my first time and i cant wait until the next 1 
i am not a filmmaker nor am i a director but i would hide my head in the sand if id spent whatever amount of money and time on this movie 0 
2 thumbs up to this seller 1 
before i go in to why i gave a 1 star rating please know that this was my third time eating at bachi burger before writing a review 0 
the only good thing was our waiter he was very helpful and kept the bloddy marys coming 1 
garbo who showed right off the bat that her talents could carry over from the silent era i wanted to see some of her silent work but netflix doesnt seem to be stocking them 1 
this pda rocks 1 
good service very clean and inexpensive to boot 1 
later i found myself lost in the power of the film 1 
that movie was bad 0 
this is the kind of money that is wasted properly 1 
it was also the right balance of war and love 1 
the shipping time was also very quick 1 
raw and sublimely moving 1 
for 40 bucks a head i really expect better food 0 
not good for the money 0 
really pleased with this product so far 1 
we walked away stuffed and happy about our first vegas buffet experience 1 
the staff are great the ambiance is great 1 
this place lacked style 0 
be sure to order dessert even if you need to pack it togo the tiramisu and cannoli are both to die for 1 
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 
it does everything the description said it would 1 
service was good and the company was better 1 
the potatoes were like rubber and you could tell they had been made up ahead of time being kept under a warmer 0 
ray charles is legendary 1 
this was my first time and i cant wait until the next 1 
i hate those things as much as cheap quality black olives 0 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
food was average at best 0 
very good though 1 
i highly recommend this device to everyone 1 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
i will never forget it now 1 
the bose noise cancelling is amazing which is very important for a nyc commuter 1 
this place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver 0 
went for lunch service was slow 0 
i will continue to come here on ladies night andddd date night highly recommend this place to anyone who is in the area 1 
i think not again 0 
the film is well paced understated and one of the best courtroom documentaries ive seen 1 
this film and i use that word loosely is an insult to the moviegoing public 0 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
2 times very bad customer service 0 
the chips and salsa were really good the salsa was very fresh 1 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
you wont regret it 1 
in short dont bother with this movie 0 
everything captain howdy says is either laughable or just plain stupid 0 
if you do go see this movie bring a pillow or a girlfriendboyfriend to keep you occupied through out 0 
the portion was huge 1 
the kids are very cool too 1 
this is definitely a cult classic well worth viewing and sharing with others 1 
an extensive menu provides lots of options for breakfast 1 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
im really disappointed all i have now is a charger that doesnt work 0 
too bad you have to pay up to a month for the service 0 
battery is holding up well 1 
point your finger at any item on the menu order it and you wont be disappointed 1 
we made the drive all the way from north scottsdale and i was not one bit disappointed 1 
the veggitarian platter is out of this world 1 
it looks very nice 1 
warning do not buy 0 
another note about this phones appearance is that it really looks rather bland especially in the all black model 0 
a very charming film with wonderful sentiment and heart 1 
i am far from a sushi connoisseur but i can definitely tell the difference between good food and bad food and this was certainly bad food 0 
very funny 1 
the charger arrived within the promised timeframe but it did not work 0 
the last 15 minutes of movie are also not bad as well 1 
i heart this place 1 
steer clear of this product and go with the genuine palm replacementr pens which come in a threepack 0 
go rent it 1 
5 stars for the brick oven bread app 1 
the only thing really worth watching was the scenery and the house because it is beautiful 1 
the pleather case doesnt fit 0 
we had so much to say about the place before we walked in that he expected it to be amazing but was quickly disappointed 0 
a film not easily forgotten 1 
service stinks here 0 
ive only had my bluetooth for a few weeks but i really like it 1 
i had a seriously solid breakfast here 1 
freezes frequently4 0 
the chains which im no fan of beat this place easily 0 
timely shipment and quality product 1 
i thought it was bad 0 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
doesnt last long 0 
i have had this phone for over a year now and i will tell you its not that great 0 
predictable but not a bad watch 1 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
terrible service 0 
dont buy this product it fails 0 
before i go in to why i gave a 1 star rating please know that this was my third time eating at bachi burger before writing a review 0 
i could not understand what kind of idiot would produce this mess in the first place not to mention several season 0 
horrible dont waste your time and money 0 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clich√©s to be admitted elsewhere 0 
i totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is 1 
it was a great phone 1 
it ranks highly as a great noircrimedrama incredible performances by belmondo and lino ventura 1 
great food and awesome service 1 
definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly will return next time im in vegas 1 
the result is a powerhouse achievement made more timely now perhaps because of our cultures disturbing fascination with celebrity and its distorted interpretations of fame 1 
the movie in movie situations in the beginning and through the game that is played with her by the acting coach are fascinating 1 
stopped by during the late may bank holiday off rick steve recommendation and loved it 1 
go and see it 1 
the waiter wasnt helpful or friendly and rarely checked on us 0 
obviously they have a terrible customer service so you get what you pay for 0 
all the bread is made inhouse 1 
the things that the four kids get themselves into is absolutely hilarious to watch 1 
they brought a fresh batch of fries and i was thinking yay something warm but no 0 
your servers suck wait correction our server heimer sucked 0 
would not go back 0 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
it crackles with an unpredictable youthful energy but honestly i found it hard to follow and concentrate on it meanders so badly 0 
this is one of the worst sandra bullock movie since speed 2 but not quite that bad 0 
however paul schrader has indeed made a film about mishima that is both superb complex 1 
it fits my ear well and is comfortable on 1 
best of all is the rotating feature very helpful 1 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1
