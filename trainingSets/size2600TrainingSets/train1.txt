the telephone repair man was really funny and his reactions to the nuts and bitchy boss were truly genuine 1 
the fried rice was dry as well 0 
the story is beyond stupid 0 
the design is very good4 1 
wed definitely go back here again 1 
frankly after cotton club and unfaithful it was kind of embarrassing to watch lane and gere in this film because it is bad 0 
macbeth jason connery moved me to tears with his final monolog out brief candle outhe gave the sphere of moral decay and dark forces a human face which makes it the more interesting 1 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
highly entertaining at all angles 1 
all i can do is whine on the internet so here it goesthe more i use the thing the less i like it 0 
avoid this establishment 0 
awful 0 
after 3 months screen just went black all of a sudden 0 
fantastic buy and will get again for whatever my next phone is 1 
it was clear that she had the range and ability to pull off this part 1 
good price 1 
dont waste your time here 0 
i will never forget it now 1 
the reception has been generally good 1 
owners are really great people 1 
after the disappointing dinner we went elsewhere for dessert 0 
omit watching this 0 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
nice solid keyboard 1 
what i really like there is the crepe station 1 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
much better than the other ayce sushi place i went to in vegas 1 
its a total package 1 
the story line is totally predictable 0 
very friendly staff 1 
its not user friendly 0 
they have a plethora of salads and sandwiches and everything ive tried gets my seal of approval 1 
overall i like this place a lot 1 
it never condescends all the characters have good genuine hearts and believable problems 1 
the shower area is outside so you can only rinse not take a full shower unless you dont mind being nude for everyone to see 0 
after watching this film i wanted to learn more about the works of this artist 1 
lifetime does not air it enough so if anyone knows what store sells it let me know because this is a musthave 1 
the sergeant pepper beef sandwich with auju sauce is an excellent sandwich as well 1 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
very serious spoilers this movie was a huge disappointment 0 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
i was hoping for more 0 
the presentation of the food was awful 0 
in fact im going to round up to 4 stars just because she was so awesome 1 
the story is beyond stupid 0 
good quality 1 
you wont be disappointed 1 
i received my orders well within the shipping timeframe everything was in good working order and overall i am very excited to have this source 1 
the noise shield is incrediable 1 
about ten minutes into this film i started having second thoughts 0 
appears to actually outperform the original battery from china that came with my v325i 1 
awful service 0 
i give wirefly 1 stari will contact cingularatt and inform them of this practice 0 
the nano stated itmy son was dissapointed 0 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
appears to actually outperform the original battery from china that came with my v325i 1 
it doesnt work in europe or asia 0 
what i really like there is the crepe station 1 
i do not know if this was emilio estevezs directorial debut but the pacing the interplay and development of the characters as well as some clever camera work surrounding the character estevez plays all suggest a natural eye 1 
the desserts were a bit strange 0 
the goat taco didnt skimp on the meat and wow what flavor 1 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
the staff was very attentive 1 
buyerbe very careful 0 
for a product that costs as much as this one does i expect it to work far better and with greater ease than this thing does 0 
i took back my money and got outta there 0 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
the service was not up to par either 0 
couldnt ask for a more satisfying meal 1 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
i ordered the voodoo pasta and it was the first time id had really excellent pasta since going gluten free several years ago 1 
it has kept up very well 1 
i probably wont be coming back here 0 
after 3 months screen just went black all of a sudden 0 
hes a national treasure 1 
but now i was completely grossed out 0 
id like to return it 0 
excellent hands free tool 1 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
on the negative its insipid enough to cause regret for another 2 hours of life wasted in front of the screen 0 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
the chips and salsa were really good the salsa was very fresh 1 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
the foreigner is not worth one second of your time 0 
voice recognition is tremendous 1 
this product is clearly not ready for prime time i dont care how cool it looks if you cant tell a call is coming in its worthless 0 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
ive never been treated so bad 0 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
add betty white and jean smart and you have a great cast everyone played their parts really well 1 
essentially you can forget microsofts tech support 0 
trouble is the writing and directing make it impossible to establish those things that make a movie watchable like character story theme and so on 0 
the seasonal fruit was fresh white peach puree 1 
not much flavor to them and very poorly constructed 0 
worse theres an incredibly weak subplot thrown in that follows a little band of latterday mansonites as they go after a reporter whos working on a story on the anniversary of the killings 0 
one of the most disappointing aspects is the lack of notable gore 0 
later i found myself lost in the power of the film 1 
i wouldnt return 0 
the bathrooms are clean and the place itself is well decorated 1 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
and service was super friendly 1 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
the cast was great 1 
it was a huge awkward 15lb piece of cow that was 34ths gristle and fat 0 
the charger worked for about a week and then completely stopped charging my phone 0 
he was terrible 0 
not much seafood and like 5 strings of pasta at the bottom 0 
i have always used corded headsets and the freedom from the wireless is very helpful 1 
main thing i didnt enjoy is that the crowd is of older crowd around mid 30s and up 0 
dee snider just plain sucks 0 
what is even more stupid is that who had thought an idea that there should be a volcano in los angeles 0 
this film offers many delights and surprises 1 
much less than the jawbone i was going to replace it with 1 
lifetime does not air it enough so if anyone knows what store sells it let me know because this is a musthave 1 
this movie now joins revenge of the boogeyman and zombiez as part of the hellish trinity of horror films 0 
on the ground right next to our table was a large smeared beensteppedinandtrackedeverywhere pile of green bird poop 0 
ive never been treated so bad 0 
it really is impressive that the place hasnt closed down 0 
very true to shakespear and a must for all shakespear fans 1 
i still maintain that monkeys shouldnt make headphones we just obviously dont share enough dna to copy the design over to humans 0 
enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film 1 
probably never coming back and wouldnt recommend it 0 
i liked the patio and the service was outstanding 1 
this is truly an art movieit actually has a lot of art in it 1 
delicious and i will absolutely be back 1 
food was delicious 1 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
i was hoping for more 0 
the whole experience was underwhelming and i think well just go to ninja sushi next time 0 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
all of the main players are mesmerising 1 
sam shepards portrayal of a gung ho marine was sobering 1 
it is a joy to use 1 
the food was terrible 0 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
bela lugosi was totally extraneous intoning odd lines 0 
yes this film does require a rather significant amount of puzzlesolving but the pieces fit together to create a beautiful picture 1 
this wonderful experience made this place a muststop whenever we are in town again 1 
the food was barely lukewarm so it must have been sitting waiting for the server to bring it out to us 0 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
is pretty funny 1 
i still maintain that monkeys shouldnt make headphones we just obviously dont share enough dna to copy the design over to humans 0 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
case was more or less an extra that i originally put on but later discarded because it scratched my ear 0 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
i wish i could enter negative values admins 0 
it finds my cell phone right away when i enter the car 1 
this one wants to surf on the small wave of space movies in 1998 deep impact and armageddon and this one fails everywhere 0 
very good food great atmosphere1 1 
after 3 months screen just went black all of a sudden 0 
no additional ear gels provided and no instructions whatsoever 0 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
about ten minutes into this film i started having second thoughts 0 
iam very pleased with my purchase 1 
from what my dinner companions told meeverything was very fresh with nice texture and taste 1 
the sound is clear and the people i talk to on it are amazed at the quality too 1 
my gyro was basically lettuce only 0 
i had absolutely no problem with this headset linking to my 8530 blackberry curve 1 
i would have given no star if i was able 0 
happy so far 1 
a pretty good product 1 
they are so cool 1 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
great bluetooth 1 
a good time 1 
after a year the battery went completely dead on my headset 0 
excellent sound battery life and inconspicuous to boot 1 
i can assure you that you wont be disappointed 1 
bt50 battery junk 0 
very good though 1 
the 12 mega pixel camera being a part of a phone is reasonably good7 1 
this place is great 1 
i am very impressed with this headset from plantronics 1 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
battery has no life 0 
very very disappointed ordered the 35 big bay plater 0 
case was more or less an extra that i originally put on but later discarded because it scratched my ear 0 
great brunch spot 1 
damn good steak 1 
2 times very bad customer service 0 
oh this is such a thing of beauty this restaurant 1 
the story itself is just predictable and lazy 0 
this place is not worth your time let alone vegas 0 
it was a riot to see hugo weaving play a sexobsessed gay real estate salesman who uses his clients houses for his trysts with the flaming darren tom hollander 1 
the fish is badly made and some of its underwater shots are repeated a thousand times in the film 0 
why was this film made 0 
i wish i could return the unit and get back my money 0 
in addition it feels amp looks as if the phone is all lightweight cheap plastic 0 
otherwise dont even waste your time on this 0 
this totally unfunny movie is so over the top and pathetic and unrealistic that throughout the whole 90 minutes of utter torture i probably looked at my watch about 70000 times 0 
main thing i didnt enjoy is that the crowd is of older crowd around mid 30s and up 0 
i was shocked because no signs indicate cash only 0 
reaching for the bottom row is uncomfortable and the send and end keys are not where i expect them to be3 0 
they work about 2 weeks then break 0 
this mostly routine factbased tv drama gets a boost from the fine performance by cole 1 
they dropped more than the ball 0 
seller shipped quickly and much cheaper than the competitors 1 
this is cool because most cases are just open there allowing the screen to get all scratched up 1 
everything is appalling 0 
the story is also both funny and poignant at times 1 
yet i enjoy watching it 1 
this movie contained an allstar cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i havent seen before 1 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
i guess that nobody at the network that aired this dribble watched it before putting it on 0 
what the hell kind of crap is that 0 
i got the aluminum case for my new palm vx and it worked really wellit has protected my handheld perfectly so far 1 
this is was due to the fact that it took 20 minutes to be acknowledged then another 35 minutes to get our foodand they kept forgetting things 0 
but whatever it was that cost them so much it didnt translate to quality thats for sure 0 
the basic premise is wasted since it is sidelined by the inexplicable focus on the documentary crew 0 
other than that the leather is nice and soft the fit is very tight the cut out for the face is a good shape 1 
the film is way too long 0 
the restaurant is very clean and has a family restaurant feel to it 1 
i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
highly unrecommended 0 
excellent phone 1 
all i can do is whine on the internet so here it goesthe more i use the thing the less i like it 0 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
the foreigner is not worth one second of your time 0 
i have had this phone for over a year now and i will tell you its not that great 0 
the crêpe was delicate and thin and moist 1 
if you plan to use this in a car forget about it 0 
very dissapointing performance 0 
poor talk time performance 0 
for that price i can think of a few place i would have much rather gone 0 
theres barely a boring moment in the film and there are plenty of humorous parts 1 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
1010 1 
the battery is working well as a replacement for the original that came with the phone over 2 years ago 1 
all this movie does is make you sick watching all these slackers make excuses for their stupid actions for 90 minutes 0 
his performance as awarded was stunning 1 
but the service was beyond bad 0 
by this time our side of the restaurant was almost empty so there was no excuse 0 
the burrittos blah 0 
a must study for anyone interested in the worst sins of industrial design 0 
it finds my cell phone right away when i enter the car 1 
one character is totally annoying with a voice that gives me the feeling of fingernails on a chalkboard 0 
left very frustrated 0 
his losing his marbles so early in the proceedings is totally implausible and unconvincing 0 
the lead man is charismafree 0 
it only recognizes the phone as its storage device 0 
never going back 0 
i guess i should have known that this place would suck because it is inside of the excalibur but i didnt use my common sense 0 
the cast was great 1 
im not eating here 0 
third the cheese on my friends burger was cold 0 
the attempts at humor were pitiful and story is so awful it dosent bear thinking about which basically involves a vulcan stealing the enterprise to find god seriously i just didnt care about any of this film and oh not to mention uhura does a belly dance to distract male guards 0 
disappointing experience 0 
the food was delicious our bartender was attentive and personable and we got a great deal 1 
its a gloriously fun fast paced and fairly accurate portrayal of the night of a raver 1 
totally believable 1 
the bipolarity of the ruthless thug one minute a ruthless killer the next minute a luvs diaper commercial is completely unconvincing 0 
very good lunch spot 1 
you can even take self portraits with the outside exterior display very cool 1 
if there were zero stars i would give it zero stars 0 
on a positive note our server was very attentive and provided great service 1 
i know this is not like the other restaurants at all something is very off here 0 
also great directing and photography 1 
there are the usual hitchcock logic flaws 0 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
good case 1 
this case has passed the one year mark and while it shows signs of wear it is 100 functional 1 
if you love authentic mexican food and want a whole bunch of interesting yet delicious meats to choose from you need to try this place 1 
so flavorful and has just the perfect amount of heat 1 
and i just love the colors 1 
rude inconsiderate management 0 
great food and service huge portions and they give a military discount 1 
nice docking station for home or work 1 
but whatever it was that cost them so much it didnt translate to quality thats for sure 0 
excellent sound battery life and inconspicuous to boot 1 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
about 30 minutes of footage is wasted to show mediocre elderly actors awkwardly babbling overwrought pseudosatanic gibberish corny enough to make a teen goth blush almost always in olde english and sometimes in latin that may or may not be made up words 0 
the staff is great the food is delish and they have an incredible beer selection 1 
nice ambiance 1 
these are certainly very comfortable and functionality is decent 1 
for a self proclaimed coffee cafe i was wildly disappointed 0 
the plot is nonsense that doesnt interest in the slightest way or have any uniqueness to it 0 
this movie is terrible 0 
sauce was tasteless 0 
very good lunch spot 1 
i have had this phone for over a year now and i will tell you its not that great 0 
it has a great camera thats 2mp and the pics are nice and clear with great picture quality 1 
i got home to see the driest damn wings ever 0 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
phenomenal food service and ambiance 1 
avoid at all costs 0 
of course the acting is blah 0 
total brunch fail 0 
echo problemvery unsatisfactory 0 
this film highlights the fundamental flaws of the legal process that its not about discovering guilt or innocence but rather is about who presents better in court 1 
friends pasta also bad he barely touched it 0 
i have to use the smallest earpieces provided but it stays on pretty well 1 
small sleek impressive looking practical setup with ample storage in place 1 
disappointing 0 
i cannot believe that the actors agreed to do this film 0 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
the first thing that happened was that the tracking was off 0 
there is however some pretty good acting at least for this type of film 1 
punishment park is a brilliant piece of cinema 1 
go rent it 1 
the warmth it generates is in contrast to its austere backdrop 1 
disapointing results 0 
the ri style calamari was a joke 0 
however this didnt make up for the fact that overall this was a tremendously boring movie 0 
nine out of ten for a truly lovely film 1 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
i highly recommend this modest priced cellular phone 1 
a pretty good product 1 
it really created a unique feeling though 1 
will be back again 1 
this is the kind of money that is wasted properly 1 
this if the first movie ive given a 10 to in years 1 
you can watch them preparing the delicious food 1 
not nearly as good looking as the amazon picture makes it look 0 
updatewent back for a second time and it was still just as amazing 1 
all in all ha long bay was a bit of a flop 0 
maybe its just their vegetarian fare but ive been twice and i thought it was average at best 0 
great price also 1 
very unreliable service from tmobile 0 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
the chips and salsa were really good the salsa was very fresh 1 
dont buy this product 0 
they never brought a salad we asked for 0 
i saw mirrormask last night and it was an unsatisfactory experience 0 
i love the ringtones because they are so upbeat 1 
crash is a depressing little nothing that provokes emotion but teaches you nothing if you already know racism and prejudice are bad things 0 
the characters were all funny and had the peculiarity of not having a true lead character 1 
we loved the biscuits 1 
rating 1 out of 10 0 
great pizza and salads 1 
we got the food and apparently they have never heard of salt and the batter on the fish was chewy 0 
everything was perfect the night we were in 1 
dont waste your money 0 
the worst phone from samsungcrap this crappy samsung e715 is the worst i have ever seeen 0 
you get what you pay for i guess 0 
service was very prompt 1 
also the fries are without a doubt the worst fries ive ever had 0 
they have a plethora of salads and sandwiches and everything ive tried gets my seal of approval 1 
it was a great phone 1 
i really do recommend this place you can go wrong with this donut place 1 
very serious spoilers this movie was a huge disappointment 0 
then i watched it again two sundays ago march 20th 2005 and i began to really enjoy it and this time i taped the entire thing 1 
things that went wrong they burned the saganaki 0 
i immediately said i wanted to talk to the manager but i did not want to talk to the guy who was doing shots of fireball behind the bar 0 
i wont be back 0 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
i dont have very many words to say about this place but it does everything pretty well 1 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
you cant beat the price on these 1 
this was reflected not only in the cast but also in the belowpar script which borrowed much from the earlier classic 0 
the acting by the whole cast could be put on a scale and balanced perfectly between overacting and underacting 0 
it was just not a fun experience 1 
awesome service and food 1 
best headset ever 1 
1010 1 
battery life is also great 1 
it was a long time that i didnt see a so charismatic actor on screen 1 
the ngage is still lacking in earbuds 0 
the cashier had no care what so ever on what i had to say it still ended up being wayyy overpriced 0 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
i hate to disagree with my fellow yelpers but my husband and i were so disappointed with this place 0 
i struggle to find anything bad to say about it 1 
they could serve it with just the vinaigrette and it may make for a better overall dish but it was still very good 1 
overall a delight 1 
then scene where they debated whether or not to sack the trumpeter who falsely was accused for the murder is pure horror really stupid 0 
dont buy this product it fails 0 
dont make the same mistake that i did and please dont buy this phone 0 
i was not happy with this item 0 
every thing on phone work perfectly she like it 1 
disappointing 0 
it is an hour and half waste of time following a bunch of very pretty high schoolers whine and cry about life 0 
very easy to use 1 
the price is reasonable and the service is great 1 
damn good steak 1 
i felt as though her going to ireland did absolutely nothing whatsoever 0 
my wife had the lobster bisque soup which was lukewarm 0 
the entire audience applauded at the conclusion of the film 1 
so in a nutshell 1 the restaraunt smells like a combination of a dirty fish market and a sewer 0 
the scenes with the ohsomature neighbourgirl are a misplace 0 
after watching this film i wanted to learn more about the works of this artist 1 
this place is not worth your time let alone vegas 0 
the sangria was about half of a glass wine full and was 12 ridiculous 0 
this is one of the worst sandra bullock movie since speed 2 but not quite that bad 0 
you cant beat that 1 
its just lame 0 
i was shocked because no signs indicate cash only 0 
the cocktails are all handmade and delicious 1 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
but it picked up speed and got right to the point 1 
all in all an excellent restaurant highlighted by great service a unique menu and a beautiful setting 1 
i was amazed at the quick arrival of the two original lg cell phone batteries and and at a fraction of the price 1 
all of the main players are mesmerising 1 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
macbeth jason connery moved me to tears with his final monolog out brief candle outhe gave the sphere of moral decay and dark forces a human face which makes it the more interesting 1 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
the worst was the salmon sashimi 0 
our server was very nice and even though he looked a little overwhelmed with all of our needs he stayed professional and friendly until the end 1 
just reading on the specs alone makes you say wow 1 
the text messaging feature is really tricky to use 0 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
theres really nothing bad i can say about this headset 0 
after charging overnight these batteries work great 1 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
the writer gorman bechard undoubtedly did his homework because all references are industry and characterage appropriate 1 
as for the killer dont expect anything original or even remotely frightening 0 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
nice case feels good in your hands 1 
phone falls out easily 0 
superb phone on a great network 1 
they do not last forever but is not overly expensive to replaceeasy to operate and the sound is much better than others i have tried 1 
great food 1 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
wed definitely go back here again 1 
ive never been treated so bad 0 
it was too predictable even for a chick flick 0 
very poor service 0 
i mean really how do you get so famous for your fish and chips when its so terrible 0 
after 20 minutes wait i got a table 0 
i kept looking at the time and it had soon become 35 minutes yet still no food 0 
i would not recommend this place 0 
elias koteasjack palance play good roles angelina is hot and gets nakedbilly drago appears in this and is cool as usual a cameo by sven ole thorsen helps make this a very enjoyable movie with good acting and a decent budget 1 
imdb ratings only go as low 1 for awful its time to get some negative numbers in there for cases such as these 0 
to my disbelief each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods i have ever tasted 0 
all in all an excellent restaurant highlighted by great service a unique menu and a beautiful setting 1 
the service was outshining i definitely recommend the halibut 1 
items stated as included from the description are not included 0 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
never again will i be dining at this place 0 
dont buy it 0 
the plastic breaks really easy on this clip 0 
overall a delight 1 
its aggravating 0 
i am a fan of his this movie sucked really bad 0 
they could be used as exemplars for any set designer 1 
i guess that nobody at the network that aired this dribble watched it before putting it on 0 
happy so far 1 
for sushi on the strip this is the place to go 1 
the dining space is tiny but elegantly decorated and comfortable 1 
battery life is real good 1 
honeslty it didnt taste that fresh 0 
insults profound deuchebaggery and had to go outside for a smoke break while serving just to solidify it 0 
this is a great place to eat 1 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
i searched the internet and found this one to be the best value 1 
i give wirefly 1 stari will contact cingularatt and inform them of this practice 0 
i think that it is a must see older john wayne film 1 
the lead man is charismafree 0 
my boyfriend and i sat at the bar and had a completely delightful experience 1 
soggy and not good 0 
i could barely stomach the meal but didnt complain because it was a business lunch 0 
the flat reenactments dont hold your attention because they are emotionally adrift and stagy 0 
you cant beat the price on these 1 
the real disappointment was our waiter 0 
not a good item it worked for a while then started having problems in my auto reverse tape player 0 
he came running after us when he realized my husband had left his sunglasses on the table 1 
the service was a little slow considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace 0 
the buffet at bellagio was far from what i anticipated 0 
battery chargelife is quite long 1 
i love this place 1 
this is probably the most irritating show i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
schrader has made a resume full of lousy amateurish films 0 
to be honest with you this is unbelievable nonsense and very foolish 0 
if you have several dozen or several hundred contacts then imagine the fun of sending each of them one by one 0 
setup went very smoothly 1 
the attempts at humor were pitiful and story is so awful it dosent bear thinking about which basically involves a vulcan stealing the enterprise to find god seriously i just didnt care about any of this film and oh not to mention uhura does a belly dance to distract male guards 0 
both rickman and stowe play their roles to the hilt in this tale of a childrens book writer who maybe has written a subversive tract 1 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
speaking of the music it is unbearably predictably and kitchy 0 
i hate writing bad reviews about films especially those in which i really like the star but this film is so bad i dont believe for one second that anyone could have been proud of it 0 
this place is awesome if you want something light and healthy during the summer 1 
i will not be eating there again 0 
i started this review with two stars but im editing it to give it only one 0 
i found this place by accident and i could not be happier 1 
frozen pucks of disgust with some of the worst people behind the register 0 
for 40 bucks a head i really expect better food 0 
the only downside is the service 0 
the transfers are very good 1 
and the rest of it just sits there being awful with soldiers singing songs about the masculinity they pledge themselves to hairsplitting about purity the admiration of swords etc 0 
low quality 0 
theres also enough hypocrisy in this film to make me vomit 0 
the charger arrived within the promised timeframe but it did not work 0 
i bought this battery with a coupon from amazon and im very happy with my purchase 1 
a disappointment 0 
the food was terrible 0 
regrettably the film fails 0 
an amazing finale to possibly the best trilogy of all time 1 
the pan cakes everyone are raving about taste like a sugary disaster tailored to the palate of a six year old 0 
this movie is so awesome 1 
i wouldnt see this movie again for free 0 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
by the time the film ended i not only disliked it i despised it 0 
you get extra minutes so that you can carry out the call and not get cut off 1 
needless to say i wont be going back anytime soon 0 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
definitely will come back here again 1 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
spend your money and time some place else 0 
so for our enjoyment we get to see them run around play games and be dangerous 1 
would not reccommend 0 
everything about this movie is stupid 0 
ample portions and good prices 1 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
would not recommend to others 0 
it lasts less than 3o minutes if i actually try to use the phonemy wife has the same phone with the same problem 0 
the grilled chicken was so tender and yellow from the saffron seasoning 1 
the cg opening sequence in space looked like it could have been created on microsoft slideshow for gods sake 0 
instead we got a bore fest about a whiny spoiled brat babysitting 0 
worst service to boot but that is the least of their worries 0 
overall i would recommend this phone over the new walkman 1 
disappointed 0 
this is the first phone ive had that has been so cheaply made 0 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
when achille and philippa beautifully sing a duet from don giovanni that perfectly describes their situation in the movie you appreciate the subtle layers of this excellent film 1 
i am very impressed with the job that motorola did on the sturdiness of this phone 1 
the food is very good for your typical bar food 1 
great movie 1 
both of the egg rolls were fantastic 1 
it had some average acting from the main person and it was a low budget as you clearly can see 0 
still waiting im sure this item would work well if i ever recieve it 0 
garbo who showed right off the bat that her talents could carry over from the silent era i wanted to see some of her silent work but netflix doesnt seem to be stocking them 1 
he was extremely rude and really there are so many other restaurants i would love to dine at during a weekend in vegas 0 
this movie has a cutting edge to it 1 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
strike 2 who wants to be rushed 0 
how can anyone in their right mind ask for anything more from a movie than this 1 
restored my phone to like new performance 1 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
i never come again 0 
i will come back here every time im in vegas 1 
other than that the leather is nice and soft the fit is very tight the cut out for the face is a good shape 1 
could not get strong enough signal 0 
i give it 2 thumbs down 0 
overall the film is interesting and thoughtprovoking 1 
the structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema 1 
a great film by a great director 1 
ive tried several different earpieces for my cell phone and this jabra one is the first one ive found that fits my ear comfortably 1 
the file browser offers all the options that one needshandsfree is great 1 
coming here is like experiencing an underwhelming relationship where both parties cant wait for the other person to ask to break up 0 
aside from its terrible lead this film has loads of other debits 0 
my mother and brother had to do thiswhen i saw robert ryan portraying this type of man it was a very good imitation of this type of individual and i was impressed 1 
i didnt realize how wonderful the short really is until the last two scenes 1 
this is one of the best italian thrillers of the early 70s 1 
for the price on amazon it is an excellent product which i would highly recommend 1 
very poor service 0 
unfortunately it will not recharge my iphone 4s despite connecting it from multiple power sources imac external battery wall outlet etc 0 
his costars dont fare much better with people like morgan freeman jonah hill and ed helms just wasted 0 
this was a different cut than the piece the other day but still wonderful and tender s well as well flavored 1 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
i bought this to use with my kindle fire and absolutely loved it 1 
warning do not buy 0 
we were promptly greeted and seated 1 
an amazing finale to possibly the best trilogy of all time 1 
the acting sucked 0 
very dissapointing performance 0 
this film has no redeeming features 0 
both of them were truly unbelievably good and i am so glad we went back 1 
seafood was limited to boiled shrimp and crab legs but the crab legs definitely did not taste fresh 0 
seller shipped quickly and much cheaper than the competitors 1 
the food was terrible 0 
setup went very smoothly 1 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
my ribeye steak was cooked perfectly and had great mesquite flavor 1 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
i just cant explain this movie more than romanticcharminghilariousand adorablethe junkyard scenes are funnyall the junkyard dogs have something specialtoo funny i laughedkids will love itbuy it when it comes outit has new features 1 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
it will drive you barking mad 0 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
not worth it 0 
the cast of veteran actors are more than just a nostalgia trip 1 
the phone was unusable and was not new 0 
cinematography noteworthy including fine views of barcelona and its famed gaudi towers 1 
mobile phone tools are a must have 1 
horrible had to switch 3 times 0 
i believe that pitch black was done well 1 
i started this review with two stars but im editing it to give it only one 0 
comfort for our whole family 1 
so good i am going to have to review this place twice once hereas a tribute to the place and once as a tribute to an event held here last night 1 
the waiter wasnt helpful or friendly and rarely checked on us 0 
the films dialogue is natural real to life 1 
excellent phone 1 
i had absolutely no problem with this headset linking to my 8530 blackberry curve 1 
very funny 1 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
horrible 0 
first of all it doesnt wear well 0 
it is indescribably the most annoying and idiotic show i have ever seen 0 
excellent sound battery life and inconspicuous to boot 1 
works fine 1 
for sushi on the strip this is the place to go 1 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
the writer gorman bechard undoubtedly did his homework because all references are industry and characterage appropriate 1 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
the poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying 0 
give this one a look 1 
we recently witnessed her poor quality of management towards other guests as well 0 
cant store anything but phone numbers to sim 0 
this review is long overdue since i consider a tale of two sisters to be the single greatest film ever made 1 
my friend loved the salmon tartar 1 
its like a really sexy party in your mouth where youre outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party 1 
warning do not buy 0 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
i can say that the desserts were yummy 1 
there is so much good food in vegas that i feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to rice and company 0 
this is some seriously good pizza and im an expertconnisseur on the topic 1 
there are massive levels massive unlockable characters its just a massive game 1 
do not make the same mistake as me 0 
wow what a bad film 0 
my husband and i ate lunch here and were very disappointed with the food and service 0 
cant get the software to work with my computer 0 
i ordered albondigas soup which was just warm and tasted like tomato soup with frozen meatballs 0 
the cast of veteran actors are more than just a nostalgia trip 1 
this one is simply a disappointment 0 
very poor service 0 
the food was outstanding and the prices were very reasonable 1 
hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in 0 
insults profound deuchebaggery and had to go outside for a smoke break while serving just to solidify it 0 
its a great item 1 
maybe its just their vegetarian fare but ive been twice and i thought it was average at best 0 
conclusion very filling meals 1 
after the first charge kept going dead after 12 minutes 0 
about half way through this film i started to dislike it 0 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
seller shipped quickly and much cheaper than the competitors 1 
i cant believe theres even a sequel to this 0 
either way it sucks 0 
for that price i can think of a few place i would have much rather gone 0 
i love this device 1 
heres where the movie really pied me off 0 
great pocket pc phone combination 1 
he is almost unbearable to watch on screen he has little to no charisma and terrible comedic timing 0 
i love the scream movies and all horror movies and this one ranks way up there 1 
i like armand assante my cable companys summary sounded interesting so i watched it twice already and probably will again 1 
after i pulled up my car i waited for another 15 minutes before being acknowledged 0 
the manager was the worst 0 
i wouldnt see this movie again for free 0 
it defeats the purpose of a bluetooth headset 0 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
piece of trash 0 
the aerial scenes were welldone 1 
the characters are interesting and you really care for them 1 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
it fits my ear well and is comfortable on 1 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
there was so much hype over this phone that i assumed it was the best my mistake 0 
so in a nutshell 1 the restaraunt smells like a combination of a dirty fish market and a sewer 0 
it is a very well acted and done tv movie 1 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
bland not a liking this place for a number of reasons and i dont want to waste time on bad reviewing ill leave it at that 0 
its an empty hollow shell of a movie 0 
item arrived quickly and works great with my metro pcs samsung schr450 slider phone and sony premium sound in ear plugs 1 
if you see it you should probably just leave it on the shelf 0 
all the other cases ive tried normally fall apart after a few months but this one seems to be in for the long haul 1 
not only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic but it also managed to give away the entire movie and im not exaggerating every moment every plot point every joke is told in the trailer 0 
was not happy 0 
highly entertaining at all angles 1 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
it was equally awful 0 
we are so glad we found this place 1 
great it was new packaged nice works good no problems and it came in less time then i expected 1 
i would not recommend this place 0 
the film is way too long 0 
portable and it works 1 
after 20 minutes wait i got a table 0 
its a long time since i was so entertained by a movie 1 
this is definitely one of the better documentaries i have seen looking at family relationships and marriage 1 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
the malta settings are as dry and as barren as the dialogue 0 
the service was extremely slow 0 
started watching this but didnt believe in any of the characters 0 
comfort for our whole family 1 
this is one of the best movies out there that shows such strong sibling bond for each other 1 
this is a bad film with bad writing and good actorsan ugly cartoon crafted by paul haggis for people who cant handle anything but the bold strokes in storytellinga picture painted with crayons 0 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
battery life is real good 1 
almost all of the songs in cover girl are oldfashioned and not very tuneful 0 
there is so much good food in vegas that i feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to rice and company 0 
you learn a lot about the real inside emotions of people in this movie and a lot about the movie business itself 1 
the scenes are often funny and occasionally touching as the characters evaluate their lives and where they are going 1 
i wont say any more i dont like spoilers so i dont want to be one but i believe this film is worth your time 1 
the charger worked for about a week and then completely stopped charging my phone 0 
i just cant explain this movie more than romanticcharminghilariousand adorablethe junkyard scenes are funnyall the junkyard dogs have something specialtoo funny i laughedkids will love itbuy it when it comes outit has new features 1 
appetite instantly gone 0 
see it with your kids if you have a chanceit will open up some amazing dialog about how far race relations have come in the last 50 years 1 
i wasnt really impressed with strip steak 0 
it also had a new problem 0 
i could not recommend these more 0 
the real disappointment was our waiter 0 
later i found myself lost in the power of the film 1 
the staff was very attentive 1 
20th century foxs road house 1948 is not only quite a silly noir but is an implausible unmitigated bore of a movie 0 
the jamaican mojitos are delicious 1 
magical help 1 
i would recommend purchasing the jabra jx10 series 2 which works flawlessly with my moto q go figure 1 
at least think to refill my water before i struggle to wave you over for 10 minutes 0 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
i dont like this nokia either 0 
sending it back 0 
i do think tom hanks is a good actor 1 
however paul schrader has indeed made a film about mishima that is both superb complex 1 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
not a good item it worked for a while then started having problems in my auto reverse tape player 0 
the charger arrived within the promised timeframe but it did not work 0 
truly awful 0 
very funny 1 
gotta love those closeups of slimy drooling teeth 1 
what makes this story different are the terrific production values faultless photography composition and editing the terrific casting the underappreciated brian keith playing a bully teddy and vivid history 1 
a fantastic neighborhood gem 1 
the acting by the whole cast could be put on a scale and balanced perfectly between overacting and underacting 0 
oh yeah and the storyline was pathetic too 0 
then i had to continue pairing it periodically since it somehow kept dropping 0 
this blueant supertooth handsfree phone speaker is awesome 1 
there are so many problems i dont know where to start 0 
they have a really nice atmosphere 1 
server did a great job handling our large rowdy table 1 
this is a great deal 1 
if you check the directors filmography on this site you will see why this film didnt have a chance 0 
we started with the tuna sashimi which was brownish in color and obviously wasnt fresh 0 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
leopard print is wonderfully wild 1 
the sound quality is excellent as well 1 
so far so good 1 
also the phone doesnt seem to accept anything except cbr mp3s preferably ripped by windows media player 0 
waste of money 0 
jamie foxx absolutely is ray charles 1 
steve martin delivers a really funny performance of a middleaged upper class uptight white guy 1 
it was horrendous 0 
what i really like there is the crepe station 1 
cant say enough good things about this place 1 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
the casting is also horrible cause all you see is a really really bad actors period 0 
this second appearance of mickey mouse following the silent plane crazy earlier that year is probably his most famous filmmostly because it was so groundbreaking 1 
the ri style calamari was a joke 0 
its a long time since i was so entertained by a movie 1 
it finds my cell phone right away when i enter the car 1 
the soundtrack sucked 0 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
really awful 0 
it was a great phone 1 
the sets especially designed to work with the camera are amazingstylized beautiful and effective 1 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
i would recommend purchasing the jabra jx10 series 2 which works flawlessly with my moto q go figure 1 
the construction of the headsets is poor 0 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
avoid at all cost 0 
the worst phone from samsungcrap this crappy samsung e715 is the worst i have ever seeen 0 
absolutely great 1 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
the service here is fair at best 0 
you cant relate with them hell you barely can understand them 0 
after watching this film i wanted to learn more about the works of this artist 1 
and the rest of it just sits there being awful with soldiers singing songs about the masculinity they pledge themselves to hairsplitting about purity the admiration of swords etc 0 
this is a great product sure beats using your fingers 1 
their chow mein is so good 1 
i dont think it would hold it too securly on your belt 0 
our server was super nice and checked on us many times 1 
this scene is very strong and unpleasant 0 
its one of the movies i need to see whenever it comes on tvnever mind the fact that i already have it memorized 1 
loved itfriendly servers great food wonderful and imaginative menu 1 
very unreliable service from tmobile 0 
essentially you can forget microsofts tech support 0 
stopped by during the late may bank holiday off rick steve recommendation and loved it 1 
fits comfortably came with three sizes of earbud tips 1 
the scenes are often funny and occasionally touching as the characters evaluate their lives and where they are going 1 
the worst one of the series 0 
so badwellits just bad 0 
this is hands down the best phone ive ever had 1 
helen baxendale is a very credible lady macbeth who can be very cheerfull at times and sometimes she just looks like a naughty girl but deadly in her taste for blood and evil 1 
i highly recommend this modest priced cellular phone 1 
it will drive you barking mad 0 
it even has its sweet moments 1 
good service very clean and inexpensive to boot 1 
no im going to eat the potato that i found some strangers hair in it 0 
i was deeply impressed with the character he played 1 
i got the aluminum case for my new palm vx and it worked really wellit has protected my handheld perfectly so far 1 
there is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again 0 
updatewent back for a second time and it was still just as amazing 1 
often the dialogue doesnt really follow from one line to another or fit the surroundings 0 
in summary this was a largely disappointing dining experience 0 
i cant use this case because the smell is disgusting 0 
the restaurant atmosphere was exquisite 1 
the lighting is just dark enough to set the mood 1 
we got sitting fairly fast but ended up waiting 40 minutes just to place our order another 30 minutes before the food arrived 0 
it fits my ear well and is comfortable on 1 
low quality 0 
i have bought this nokia cell phone a few weeks ago and it was a nightmare 0 
it is wonderful and inspiring to watch and i hope that it gets released again on to video or dvd 1 
i would give this television series a 10 plus if i could 1 
i would advise to not purchase this item it never worked very well 0 
it was awesome 1 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
heres where the movie really pied me off 0 
i was mortified 0 
initially the local sites in the film which was filmed here in buffalo intrigued me 1 
the battery life is highly unacceptable 0 
otherwise dont even waste your time on this 0 
bt50 battery junk 0 
delicious and i will absolutely be back 1 
what a waste 0 
took an hour to get our food only 4 tables in restaurant my food was luke warm our sever was running around like he was totally overwhelmed 0 
i wont be back 0 
awesome selection of beer 1 
dont waste your money 0 
you get incredibly fresh fish prepared with care 1 
the cinematography is simply stunning to say the least and the fx are nothing if not stateoftheart 1 
i am sorry i made this purchase 0 
i love this device 1 
would come back again if i had a sushi craving while in vegas 1 
he is almost unbearable to watch on screen he has little to no charisma and terrible comedic timing 0 
i have purchased these for both family and friends and all enjoy their clarity and ease of use 1 
the ambience is wonderful and there is music playing 1 
i also didnt like the on button it felt like it would crack with use 0 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
one of the best mexican movies ever and one of the less understood even by mexican themselves no matter how identified the should have felt with it 1 
omg the food was delicioso 1 
a must study for anyone interested in the worst sins of industrial design 0 
it is practically useless and did not add any kind of boost to my reception after i bought it 0 
this results in the phone being either stuck at max volume or mute 0 
does not fit 0 
too bad you have to pay up to a month for the service 0 
food was really boring 0 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
i seriously cannot believe that the owner has so many unexperienced employees that all are running around like chickens with their heads cut off 0 
the worst phone from samsungcrap this crappy samsung e715 is the worst i have ever seeen 0 
the food is not tasty at all not to say its real traditional hunan style 0 
better than new 1 
sam shepards portrayal of a gung ho marine was sobering 1 
both of the egg rolls were fantastic 1 
yet i enjoy watching it 1 
we definately enjoyed ourselves 1 
its not hard to make a decent hamburger 0 
its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
the sweet potato tots were good but the onion rings were perfection or as close as i have had 1 
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1 
battery is holding up well 1 
battery is terrible 0 
the results well are a shame 0 
not impressed 0 
it was a great phone 1 
the acting is fantastic the stories are seamlessly woven together and the dogs are splendid a must rent view or see 1 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
del taco is pretty nasty and should be avoided if possible 0 
very nice and relaxing late night viewing 1 
love this product 1 
when my order arrived one of the gyros was missing 0 
hated it 0 
friends pasta also bad he barely touched it 0 
to those who find this movie intelligent or even masterful i can only say its your intelligence and your imagination you obviously used to try and make some sense of this pitiful attempt its in our human nature to try and make sense of things 0 
i am glad i purchased it 1 
i especially liked the noncliche choices with the parents in other movies i could predict the dialog verbatim but the writing in this movie made better selections 1 
i own 2 of these cases and would order another 1 
i totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is 1 
unfortunately any virtue in this films production work was lost on a regrettable script 0 
all of the tapas dishes were delicious 1 
camera color balance is awful 0 
not a good bargain 0 
i dont think ive ever gone to a movie and disliked it as much 0 
my only problem is i thought the actor playing the villain was a low rent michael ironside 0 
wont ever go here again 0 
they are so cool 1 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
food was good service was good prices were good 1 
i bought this to use with my kindle fire and absolutely loved it 1 
piece of trash 0 
this second appearance of mickey mouse following the silent plane crazy earlier that year is probably his most famous filmmostly because it was so groundbreaking 1 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
they work about 2 weeks then break 0 
but if you liked movies like the matrix and better yet their sequels i think youll appreciate the thought provoking mindblowing experience this film will give you 1 
his losing his marbles so early in the proceedings is totally implausible and unconvincing 0 
this if the first movie ive given a 10 to in years 1 
the owners really really need to quit being soooooo cheap let them wrap my freaking sandwich in two papers not one 0 
kind of hard to mess up a steak but they did 0 
i took back my money and got outta there 0 
linked to my phone without effort 1 
i wouldnt see this movie again for free 0 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
all this movie does is make you sick watching all these slackers make excuses for their stupid actions for 90 minutes 0 
1010 1 
what a waste of money and time 0 
disappointing 0 
both rickman and stowe play their roles to the hilt in this tale of a childrens book writer who maybe has written a subversive tract 1 
then the film just dropped the ball 0 
the acting is beyond abysmal 0 
would not recommend to others 0 
the very idea of it was lame take a minor character from a mediocre pg13 film and make a complete nonsequel while changing its tone to a pgrated family movie 0 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
alexander nevsky is a great film 1 
both the hot sour the egg flower soups were absolutely 5 stars 1 
wed definitely go back here again 1 
i probably wont be coming back here 0 
avoid this one if you can 0 
i dont like this nokia either 0 
i never walked out of a movie faster 0 
another thing i didnt really like is when a character got punched in the face a gallon of blood would spew forth soon after 0 
a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it 1 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
summary the witticisms werent witty 0 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
the owners are super friendly and the staff is courteous 1 
i was mortified 0 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
i want my money back 0 
if you have several dozen or several hundred contacts then imagine the fun of sending each of them one by one 0 
this is high adventure at its best 1 
but the duet between the astronaut and his doctor at the beginning of the movie is a perfect exchange if one considers that this movie was made well into the cold war and the astronauts biggest fear is that he has crashed in the ussr 1 
this is a great place to eat 1 
these were so good we ordered them twice 1 
say bye bye to your tip lady 0 
left very frustrated 0 
you have to hold the phone at a particular angle for the other party to hear you clearly 0 
i didnt know pulled pork could be soooo delicious 1 
mark my words this is one of those cult films like evil dead 2 or phantasm that people will still be discovering and falling in love with 20 30 40 years down the line 1 
i also decided not to send it back because our waitress looked like she was on the verge of having a heart attack 0 
this is a great product sure beats using your fingers 1 
i got this phone on reccomendation from a relative and im glad i did 1 
poor construction 0 
great software for motorolas 1 
very displeased 0 
nothing special 0 
camerawork again bad 0 
bad purchase 0 
in fact this stinker smells like a directtovideo release 0 
damian is so talented and versatile in so many ways of writing and portraying different characters on screen 1 
you have to hold the phone at a particular angle for the other party to hear you clearly 0 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
the service was terrible food was mediocre 0 
i have always used corded headsets and the freedom from the wireless is very helpful 1 
worst martini ever 0 
server did a great job handling our large rowdy table 1 
i would advise to not purchase this item it never worked very well 0 
i will not be eating there again 0 
we got sitting fairly fast but ended up waiting 40 minutes just to place our order another 30 minutes before the food arrived 0 
warning stay away 0 
it seems completely secure both holding on to my belt and keeping the iphone inside 1 
dont buy this product 0 
unfortunately any virtue in this films production work was lost on a regrettable script 0 
voice quality signal strength dropped calls 0 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
im happy about this purchase good quality and low price 1 
it was so cool 1 
i heart this place 1 
the characters are interesting and you want to find out more about them the longer the movie goes on and i think people will be surprised by who does and doesnt make it 1 
the bt headset was such a disapoinment 0 
does not work 0 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
it only recognizes the phone as its storage device 0 
i cant use this case because the smell is disgusting 0 
same problem as others have mentioned 0 
you can watch them preparing the delicious food 1 
car charger as well as ac charger are included to make sure you never run out of juicehighy recommended 1 
they were goldencrispy and delicious 1 
the presentation of the food was awful 0 
if this premise sound stupid thats because it is 0 
everything about this film is simply incredible 1 
useless phone simply deaf 0 
this is an unbelievable bargain 1 
this fixes all the problems 1 
this wonderful experience made this place a muststop whenever we are in town again 1 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
sam shepards portrayal of a gung ho marine was sobering 1 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
product was excellent and works better than the verizon one and boy was it cheaper 1 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
i would give this television series a 10 plus if i could 1 
this place receives stars for their appetizers 1 
it lasts less than 3o minutes if i actually try to use the phonemy wife has the same phone with the same problem 0 
this place is horrible and way overpriced 0 
there was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth but it didnt really work into the rest of the plot 0 
phone now holds charge like it did when it was new 1 
our server was super nice and checked on us many times 1 
the story line is totally predictable 0 
there arent death scenes like in previous movies and the fx are terrible 0 
if you have not seen this movie i definitely recommend it 1 
great food 1 
by the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant i was bored and didnt care what happened next and so i switched off 0 
and his subtle connections between the three films are awesome 1 
i have only had it for a few weeks but so far so good 1 
its a total package 1 
trying to make a call on these is an exercise in frustration 0 
i wasted my little money with this earpiece 0 
but in terms of the writing its very fresh and bold 1 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
i will continue to come here on ladies night andddd date night highly recommend this place to anyone who is in the area 1 
after 20 minutes wait i got a table 0 
lange had become a great actress 1 
this is a witty and delightful adaptation of the dr seuss book brilliantly animated by upas finest and thoroughly deserving of its academy award 1 
con spotty service 0 
the characters are fleshed out surprisingly well particularly grimes and blake and all the actors deliver their sharply scripted lines with just the right amount of deadpan tongue in cheek to make the dialogue both hilarious and realistic 1 
thats how id describe this painfully dreary timewaster of a film 0 
it is indescribably the most annoying and idiotic show i have ever seen 0 
setup couldnt have been simpler 1 
i came back today since they relocated and still not impressed 0 
penne vodka excellent 1 
the acting is beyond abysmal 0 
it was just too horrible 0 
terrible product and waste of money 0 
we waited for forty five minutes in vain 0 
very funny 1 
the ri style calamari was a joke 0 
i know that sounds funny but to me it seemed like sketchy technology that wouldnt work wellwell this one works great 1 
none of the new ones have ever quite worked properly 0 
best of all is the rotating feature very helpful 1 
it was absolutely amazing 1 
uncomfortable in the ear dont use with lg vx9900 env 0 
works great when my cat attacked the phone he scratched the protective strip instead of destroying the screen 1 
i dont each much pasta but i love the homemade hand made pastas and thin pizzas here 1 
sending it back 0 
i dont know exactly what it is about this movie but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our familys memories 1 
when my mom and i got home she immediately got sick and she only had a few bites of salad 0 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
i can take a little bad service but the food sucks 0 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
its kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly its embarrassing how childlike the company is 0 
being a 90s child i truly enjoyed this show and i can proudly say that i enjoyed it big time and even more than the classical wb cartoons 1 
we will not be coming back 0 
this hole in the wall has great mexican street tacos and friendly staff 1 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
i connected my wifes bluetoothmotorola hs850 to my phone and it worked like a charm whether the phone was in my pocket or the case 1 
we have tried 2 units and they both failed within 2 months pros 0 
these are certainly very comfortable and functionality is decent 1 
i especially liked the noncliche choices with the parents in other movies i could predict the dialog verbatim but the writing in this movie made better selections 1 
echo problemvery unsatisfactory 0 
the sound is clear and the people i talk to on it are amazed at the quality too 1 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
love this place hits the spot when i want something healthy but not lacking in quantity or flavor 1 
it is light easy to use and has very clear reception and transmission 1 
to sum the film up breeders is a terrible cheaply made horror movie that should be avoided like the ebola virus 0 
constantine gives everything the right intensity and seems to have a good understanding of the underlying psychological motivations 1 
it holds a charge for a long time is reasonably comfortable under longwearing conditions and the quality of sound is tremendous 1 
using all earpieces left or right this thing will not stay on my ear 0 
the pairing of the two devices was so easy it barely took a couple minutes before i started making calls with the voice dialing feature 1 
but now i was completely grossed out 0 
bad purchase 0 
first time going but i think i will quickly become a regular 1 
it was clear that she had the range and ability to pull off this part 1 
best breakfast buffet 1 
the desserts were a bit strange 0 
not much dialogue not much music the whole film was shot as elaborately and aesthetically like a sculpture 1 
his costars dont fare much better with people like morgan freeman jonah hill and ed helms just wasted 0 
this is a simple little phone to use but the breakage is unacceptible 0 
the burrittos blah 0 
actually the graphics were good at the time 1 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
nothing new there 0 
i guess i should have known that this place would suck because it is inside of the excalibur but i didnt use my common sense 0 
this phone is slim and light and the display is beautiful 1 
sauce was tasteless 0 
our server was super nice and checked on us many times 1 
ive owned this phone for 7 months now and can say that its the best mobile phone ive had 1 
a week later after i activated it it suddenly died 0 
the malta settings are as dry and as barren as the dialogue 0 
updatewent back for a second time and it was still just as amazing 1 
made very sturdy 1 
excellent service 1 
highly recommended a 1 
but the convoluted plot just didnt convince me and much of the film was watched with a weird questioning glance 0 
the kids are annoying 0 
for sushi on the strip this is the place to go 1 
makes it easier to keep up with my bluetooth when im not wearing it 0 
i can take a little bad service but the food sucks 0 
disappointed 0 
must have been an off night at this place 0 
if only someone involved with it knew how to string together narrative 0 
my wife had the lobster bisque soup which was lukewarm 0 
it is a very well acted and done tv movie 1 
its a mediocre miserable hollow laughable and predictable piece of garbage 0 
food was delicious 1 
an interesting premise and billy drago is always good as a dangerous nutbag side note id love to see drago stephen mchattie and lance hendrikson in a flick together talk about raging cheekbones 1 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
w810i is just superb 1 
bt50 battery junk 0 
and the chef was generous with his time even came around twice so we can take pictures with him 1 
elias koteasjack palance play good roles angelina is hot and gets nakedbilly drago appears in this and is cool as usual a cameo by sven ole thorsen helps make this a very enjoyable movie with good acting and a decent budget 1 
none of the three sizes they sent with the headset would stay in my ears 0 
it failed to convey the broad sweep of landscapes that were a great part of the original 0 
simply beautiful 1 
the movie has almost no action scenes in it and very little comedy 0 
this phone is slim and light and the display is beautiful 1 
the stories were powerful explorations of the nature of man and of art 1 
have been going since 2007 and every meal has been awesome 1 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
the worst phone ive ever had only had it for a few months 0 
the acting was bad 0 
not enough volume 0 
a bit predictable 0 
the story line is totally predictable 0 
this is the place where i first had pho and it was amazing 1 
i dont think there are any redeeming qualities in this remake 0 
having trouble with volume 0 
but she is still a bad actress repeating her robotic face moves in each of her pictures 0 
i like the fact that it rests lightly against your ear rather than inside 1 
it always cuts out and makes a beep beep beep sound then says signal failed 0 
what a piece of junk i lose more calls on this phone 0 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
even allowing for poor production values for the time 1971 and the format some kind of miniseries this is baaaaaad 0 
the construction of the headsets is poor 0 
considering the relations off screen between taylor and stanwyck it was surprising how little chemistry there was on screen between the two of them 0 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
the food amazing 1 
defective crap 0 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
the food wasnt good 0 
and his subtle connections between the three films are awesome 1 
the film deserves strong kudos for taking this stand for having exceptional acting from its mostly lesserknown cast and for the superintelligent script that doesnt insult the audience or take the easy way out when it comes to white racism 1 
i would advise to not purchase this item it never worked very well 0 
i have never had such bland food which surprised me considering the article we read focused so much on their spices and flavor 0 
my first visit to hiro was a delight 1 
no real improvement 0 
muddy low quality sound and the casing around the wires insert was poorly super glued and slid off 0 
disapointing results 0 
how stupid is that 0 
the sound quality for the device is unacceptableunless you are in a really quiet area you almost hear nothing 0 
thus far have only visited twice and the food was absolutely delicious each time 1 
what a piece of junk i lose more calls on this phone 0 
love this place hits the spot when i want something healthy but not lacking in quantity or flavor 1 
this is a good battery and it got here really fast 1 
i ordered the voodoo pasta and it was the first time id had really excellent pasta since going gluten free several years ago 1 
however paul schrader has indeed made a film about mishima that is both superb complex 1 
i was not happy with this item 0 
i can take a little bad service but the food sucks 0 
very disappointed in accessoryone 0 
i dont like this nokia either 0 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
unreliable im giving up 0 
this place is way too overpriced for mediocre food 0 
the keyboard is a nice compromise between a full qwerty and the basic cell phone number keypad 1 
it was way over fried 0 
what possesed me to get this junk i have no idea 0 
fantastic service here 1 
would not go back 0 
bluetooth range is good a few days ago i left my phone in the trunk got a call and carried the conversation without a hitch 1 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
just whatever you do avoid groove as its the antithesis of all that is good about human traffic 0 
this is was due to the fact that it took 20 minutes to be acknowledged then another 35 minutes to get our foodand they kept forgetting things 0 
to call this movie a drama is ridiculous 0 
uncomfortable in the ear dont use with lg vx9900 env 0 
the delivery was on time 1 
like the other reviewer said you couldnt pay me to eat at this place again 0 
youd have to have the iq of particularly stupid mollusk not to see that one coming 0 
conclusion i loved it 1 
after two i felt disgusting 0 
performed awful muffled tinny incoming sound and severe echo for those on the other end of the call 0 
a greasy unhealthy meal 0 
hands down my favorite italian restaurant 1 
hard to judge whether these sides were good because we were grossed out by the melted styrofoam and didnt want to eat it for fear of getting sick 0 
we thought youd have to venture further away to get good sushi but this place really hit the spot that night 1 
truly awful 0 
doesnt work 0 
the fried rice was dry as well 0 
the tracfonewebsite is user friendly and makes it easy toactivate etc 1 
and dont even get me started on the jerky camerawork 0 
both great 1 
dont waste your time 0 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
the stories were as unbelievable as the actors 0 
not a good bargain 0 
dessert panna cotta was amazing 1 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
great it was new packaged nice works good no problems and it came in less time then i expected 1 
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 
the fish is badly made and some of its underwater shots are repeated a thousand times in the film 0 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
great place to eat reminds me of the little mom and pop shops in the san francisco bay area 1 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
does not fit 0 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
i am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this 1 
special thanks to dylan t for the recommendation on what to order all yummy for my tummy 1 
then scene where they debated whether or not to sack the trumpeter who falsely was accused for the murder is pure horror really stupid 0 
it works fine on my motorola 325 cellphone and a lot better than the wornout battery did 1 
very dissapointing performance 0 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
nargile i think you are great 1 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
the staff is great the food is delish and they have an incredible beer selection 1 
for that price i can think of a few place i would have much rather gone 0 
this was my first and only vegas buffet and it did not disappoint 1 
product is useless since it does not have enough charging current to charge the 2 cellphones i was planning to use it with 0 
i wear it everyday and it holds up very well 1 
this one wants to surf on the small wave of space movies in 1998 deep impact and armageddon and this one fails everywhere 0 
join the club and get awesome offers via email 1 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
i love this thing 1 
i wouldnt return 0 
too bad you have to pay up to a month for the service 0 
things that went wrong they burned the saganaki 0 
what a mistake that was 0 
i wasted my little money with this earpiece 0 
overall i am psyched to have a phone which has all my appointments and contacts in and gets great reception 1 
in addition to having one of the most lovely songs ever written french cancan also boasts one of the cutest leading ladies ever to grace the screen 1 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
for 40 bucks a head i really expect better food 0 
this movie was kind of long in length but i enjoyed every minute of it 1 
perfect for someone me who only likes beer ice cold or in this case even colder 1 
the concert sequences just sucked 0 
i advise everyone do not be fooled 0 
but now that it is out of warranty the same problems reoccurebottom line put your money somewhere else cingular will not support it 0 
the dialogue sucked 0 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
best tater tots in the southwest 1 
on a positive note our server was very attentive and provided great service 1 
the movie has almost no action scenes in it and very little comedy 0 
the food was great as always compliments to the chef 1 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
im super pissd 0 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
but when someone strives for greatness and poetry but delivers a muddled and often ridiculous story a bunch of disparate scenes pretentious dialogue then you get the worst kind of a movie that some other reviewer very accurately defined as pretentious crap 0 
service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is vegas and located inside the crystals shopping mall by aria 1 
the story line is just awful 0 
then our food came out disappointment ensued 0 
cool phone 1 
i promise they wont disappoint 1 
none of the three sizes they sent with the headset would stay in my ears 0 
avoid at all cost 0 
my gyro was basically lettuce only 0 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
we got the food and apparently they have never heard of salt and the batter on the fish was chewy 0 
bad script bad direction and horrible acting make this one plain bad 0 
loved itfriendly servers great food wonderful and imaginative menu 1 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
i like steiners because its dark and it feels like a bar 1 
the burrittos blah 0 
the holster that arrived did not match the photo in the ad 0 
everything was perfect the night we were in 1 
bad fit way too big 0 
this particular model would not work with my motorola q smartphone 0 
from what my dinner companions told meeverything was very fresh with nice texture and taste 1 
waitress was good though 1 
i would highly recommend this 1 
when im on this side of town this will definitely be a spot ill hit up again 1 
the writer gorman bechard undoubtedly did his homework because all references are industry and characterage appropriate 1 
if you dont find it too bad as again the unit comes with one earpad onlyi would not recommend this to anyone 0 
none of them are engaging or exciting 0 
i just cant explain this movie more than romanticcharminghilariousand adorablethe junkyard scenes are funnyall the junkyard dogs have something specialtoo funny i laughedkids will love itbuy it when it comes outit has new features 1 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
i rather enjoyed it 1 
plug was the wrong size 0 
alexander nevsky is a great film 1 
the buttons for on and off are bad 0 
i dont think there are any redeeming qualities in this remake 0 
this is the place where i first had pho and it was amazing 1 
this was my first time and i cant wait until the next 1 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
too bad cause i know its family owned i really wanted to like this place 0 
we got sitting fairly fast but ended up waiting 40 minutes just to place our order another 30 minutes before the food arrived 0 
i guess that nobody at the network that aired this dribble watched it before putting it on 0 
the service was poor and thats being nice 0 
its reception is very very poor 0 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
elias koteasjack palance play good roles angelina is hot and gets nakedbilly drago appears in this and is cool as usual a cameo by sven ole thorsen helps make this a very enjoyable movie with good acting and a decent budget 1 
if it were possible to give them zero stars theyd have it 0 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
the fish is badly made and some of its underwater shots are repeated a thousand times in the film 0 
lasted one day and then blew up 0 
i particularly remember my senses being assaulted by strident cords of music that would blare out with very little warning and even less meaning 0 
total waste of time 0 
waste of money 0 
i enjoyed reading this book to my children when they were little 1 
punishment park is a brilliant piece of cinema 1 
exceptionally bad 0 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
this was my first time and i cant wait until the next 1 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
it is a true classic 1 
i cannot make calls at certain places 0 
the sergeant pepper beef sandwich with auju sauce is an excellent sandwich as well 1 
sending it back 0 
this is a great product sure beats using your fingers 1 
were jerks on the phone 0 
the structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema 1 
this is truly an art movieit actually has a lot of art in it 1 
their onscreen chemistry critical to the entire film is genuine 1 
my 5year old nokia 2160 from tracfone holds the charge a lot better than this 0 
its an empty hollow shell of a movie 0 
i am sorry i made this purchase 0 
for service i give them no stars 0 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
it is so small and you dont even realize that it is there after a while of getting used to it 1 
razr battery good buy 1 
i am so tired of clichés that is just lazy writing and here they come in thick and fast 0 
another thing i didnt really like is when a character got punched in the face a gallon of blood would spew forth soon after 0 
food was average at best 0 
i will never forget it now 1 
the film has an ultracheap look to it 0 
this is a good joint 1 
its a piece of crap 0 
it fits my ear well and is comfortable on 1 
this was a different cut than the piece the other day but still wonderful and tender s well as well flavored 1 
call me a nut but i think this is one of the best movies ever 1 
the script is bad very bad  it contains both cheesiness and unethical joke that you normally see in rated r or nc17 movie 0 
ive never been treated so bad 0 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
the performances are not improved by improvisation because the actors now have twice as much to worry about not only whether theyre delivering the line well but whether the line itself is any good 0 
def coming back to bowl next time 1 
i have seen many movies starring jaclyn smith but my god this was one of her best though it came out 12 years ago 1 
doesnt last long 0 
disappointing accessory from a good manufacturer 0 
his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic 1 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
i would highly recommend this 1 
exactly what i wanted 1 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
if you plan to use this in a car forget about it 0 
ive also had problems with the phone reading the memory card in which i always turn it on and then off again 0 
the attention given to every character and complex psychological portrayals detailing loyalty treachery love and hope are tremendous 1 
i have two more years left in this contract and i hate this phone 0 
almost everyone involved must be return to school acting is utterly predictable and bad script is pile of garbage all round 0 
its very slow 0 
i would recommend purchasing the jabra jx10 series 2 which works flawlessly with my moto q go figure 1 
great it was new packaged nice works good no problems and it came in less time then i expected 1 
the cg opening sequence in space looked like it could have been created on microsoft slideshow for gods sake 0 
the fish is badly made and some of its underwater shots are repeated a thousand times in the film 0 
oh the charger seems to work fine 1 
i also decided not to send it back because our waitress looked like she was on the verge of having a heart attack 0 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly will return next time im in vegas 1 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
definitely a bargain 1 
it worked very well 1 
case was more or less an extra that i originally put on but later discarded because it scratched my ear 0 
the sweet potato fries were very good and seasoned well 1 
we walked away stuffed and happy about our first vegas buffet experience 1 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
i am far from a sushi connoisseur but i can definitely tell the difference between good food and bad food and this was certainly bad food 0 
dont waste your money 0 
before i go in to why i gave a 1 star rating please know that this was my third time eating at bachi burger before writing a review 0 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
meredith m was better than all right 1 
the phone gets extremely hot 0 
i wont spoil it but the ending in pretty amazing 1 
excellent bluetooth headset 1 
this is one of the worst sandra bullock movie since speed 2 but not quite that bad 0 
otherwise easy to install and use clear sound 1 
service stinks here 0 
all it took was one drop from about 6 inches above the kitchen counter and it was crackedi am not impressed and i am not laughing 0 
the movie is littered with overt racial slurs towards the black cast members and in return the whites are depicted as morons and boobs 0 
dont waste your time here 0 
buyerbe very careful 0 
it was either too cold not enough flavor or just bad 0 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
friends pasta also bad he barely touched it 0 
i really like this product over the motorola because it is allot clearer on the ear piece and the mic 1 
seriously flavorful delights folks 1 
youll love it 1 
avoid at all costs 0 
its practically perfect in all of them  a true masterpiece in a sea of faux masterpieces 1 
and service was super friendly 1 
those burgers were amazing 1 
you get extra minutes so that you can carry out the call and not get cut off 1 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
i am glad i purchased it 1 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
i was left shattered from the experience of watching this film and i took a good two hours to fully recover 0 
kind of flops around 0 
the battery is working well as a replacement for the original that came with the phone over 2 years ago 1 
gotta love those closeups of slimy drooling teeth 1 
the characters are fleshed out surprisingly well particularly grimes and blake and all the actors deliver their sharply scripted lines with just the right amount of deadpan tongue in cheek to make the dialogue both hilarious and realistic 1 
the reception is excellent 1 
phone now holds charge like it did when it was new 1 
very funny 1 
it was a drive to get there 0 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
we had fantastic service and were pleased by the atmosphere 1 
i would give this television series a 10 plus if i could 1 
linksys should have some way to exchange a bad phone for a refurb unit or something 0 
our server was very nice and even though he looked a little overwhelmed with all of our needs he stayed professional and friendly until the end 1 
setup couldnt have been simpler 1 
this is a stunning movie 1 
a very good film indeed about great and unconditional love 1 
all the other cases ive tried normally fall apart after a few months but this one seems to be in for the long haul 1 
an excellent new restaurant by an experienced frenchman 1 
as for the killer dont expect anything original or even remotely frightening 0 
this phone is pretty sturdy and ive never had any large problems with it 1 
it is very comfortable to wear as well which is probably the most important aspect about using a case 1 
not good when wearing a hat or sunglasses 0 
i love this place 1 
stay away from the q 0 
very poor service 0 
one nice thing was that they added gratuity on the bill since our party was larger than 6 or 8 and they didnt expect more tip than that 1 
i tried the cape cod ravoli chickenwith cranberrymmmm 1 
id say that would be the hardest decision honestly all of ms dishes taste how they are supposed to taste amazing 1 
but what really made it unwatchable was the direction 0 
it will drive you barking mad 0 
this is was due to the fact that it took 20 minutes to be acknowledged then another 35 minutes to get our foodand they kept forgetting things 0 
the kids are annoying 0 
in the span of an hour i had two people exclaim whoa is that the new phone on tv 1 
the worst was the salmon sashimi 0 
disappointing experience 0 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
it was packed 0 
hackneyed writing certainly but made even worse by the bad directing 0 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
tom wilkinson broke my heart at the end and everyone elses judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike 1 
oh and i forgot to also mention the weird color effect it has on your phone 0 
the only suspense i was feeling was the frustration at just how retarded the girls were 0 
i mean really how do you get so famous for your fish and chips when its so terrible 0 
bought mainly for the charger which broke soon after purchasing 0 
a greasy unhealthy meal 0 
there was so much hype over this phone that i assumed it was the best my mistake 0 
love it great armband 1 
the management is rude 0 
earbud piece breaks easily 0 
this was a poor remake of my best friends wedding 0 
this movie is terrible 0 
the ngage is still lacking in earbuds 0 
the food was barely lukewarm so it must have been sitting waiting for the server to bring it out to us 0 
for a self proclaimed coffee cafe i was wildly disappointed 0 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
the design is very good4 1 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
i go to far too many places and ive never seen any restaurant that serves a 1 egg breakfast especially for 400 0 
and if that isnt enough of a mess of a movie for you the picture is also marred with a constant use of studio sets and indoor exteriors 0 
the food was terrible 0 
there was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth but it didnt really work into the rest of the plot 0 
food was delicious 1 
both of the egg rolls were fantastic 1 
i ordered this for sony ericsson w810i but i think it only worked once thats when i first used it 0 
great steak great sides great wine amazing desserts 1 
i think the most wonderful parts literally full of wonder are the excerpts from his works 1 
i did not have any problem with this item and would order it again if needed 1 
great product 1 
it wasnt busy either also the building was freezing cold 0 
essentially you can forget microsofts tech support 0 
nothing special 0 
everyone is very attentive providing excellent customer service 1 
the story which was told so eloquently by francis ford coppola 25 years earlier really unfolds gradually and leaves room for the characters to develop 1 
loved itfriendly servers great food wonderful and imaginative menu 1 
this place is overpriced not consistent with their boba and it really is overpriced 0 
it always cuts out and makes a beep beep beep sound then says signal failed 0 
food is way overpriced and portions are fucking small 0 
your brain will attempt to shutdown as part of a primal impulse of selfpreservation 0 
it was so bad i had lost the heart to finish it 0 
1 long lasting battery you dont have to recharge it as frequentyly as some of the flip phones2 0 
the calls drop the phone comes on and off at will the screen goes black and the worst of all it stops ringing intermittently 0 
i can say that the desserts were yummy 1 
ambience is perfect 1 
just does not work 0 
after 3 months screen just went black all of a sudden 0 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
it didnt work people can not hear me when i talk 0 
highly recommended a 1 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
i dressed up to be treated so rudely 0 
great phone 1 
maybe its just their vegetarian fare but ive been twice and i thought it was average at best 0 
fantastic earphones 1 
this is definitely one of the better documentaries i have seen looking at family relationships and marriage 1 
it was probably dirt 0 
timely shipment and quality product 1 
it really created a unique feeling though 1 
1 long lasting battery you dont have to recharge it as frequentyly as some of the flip phones2 0 
the phone gets extremely hot 0 
the loudspeaker option is great the bumpers with the lights is very appealing 0 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
glad i didnt pay to see it 0 
i gave it a 10 1 
strike 2 who wants to be rushed 0 
good prices 1 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
comfort for our whole family 1 
one nice thing was that they added gratuity on the bill since our party was larger than 6 or 8 and they didnt expect more tip than that 1 
very easy to use 1 
nice headphones for the price and they work great 1 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
the building itself seems pretty neat the bathroom is pretty trippy but i wouldnt eat here again 0 
a great film by a great director 1 
see it with your kids if you have a chanceit will open up some amazing dialog about how far race relations have come in the last 50 years 1 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
the acting by the whole cast could be put on a scale and balanced perfectly between overacting and underacting 0 
only like 3 or 4 buildings used a couple of locations maybe poor hummh 0 
the vanilla ice cream was creamy and smooth while the profiterole choux pastry was fresh enough 1 
however paul schrader has indeed made a film about mishima that is both superb complex 1 
she carries the movie well 1 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
good protection and does not make phone too bulky 1 
waitress was good though 1 
fantastic service here 1 
none of it works just dont buy it 0 
think of the film being like a dream 1 
i love their fries and their beans 1 
a bit predictable 0 
i asked multiple times for the wine list and after some time of being ignored i went to the hostess and got one myself 0 
the selection of food was not the best 0 
i would give this television series a 10 plus if i could 1 
there are the usual hitchcock logic flaws 0 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
i really loved the story line and the poler bear was kinda cutebut if anyone has a question about fort steele just ask away 1 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
bad fit way too big 0 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
but it does get better reception and clarity than any phone ive had before 1 
almost everyone involved must be return to school acting is utterly predictable and bad script is pile of garbage all round 0 
my breakfast was perpared great with a beautiful presentation of 3 giant slices of toast lightly dusted with powdered sugar 1 
the food came out at a good pace 1 
i cant tell you how disappointed i was 0 
exceptionally bad 0 
very poor service 0 
full of unconvincing cardboard characters it is blandly written by edward chodorov who also produced and is surprisingly directed by jean negulesco from whom one would expect a great deal more 0 
the story line is totally predictable 0 
this movie has a cutting edge to it 1 
i advise everyone do not be fooled 0 
personally i think it shows that people should learn to find a compromise them self without involving other people into issue 1 
from what my dinner companions told meeverything was very fresh with nice texture and taste 1 
i would highly recommend this 1 
a cheap and cheerless heist movie with poor characterisation lots of underbite style stoic emoting think chow yun fat in a better tomorrow and some cheesy clichés thrown into an abandoned factory ready for a few poorly executed flying judo rolls a la john woo 0 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
an extensive menu provides lots of options for breakfast 1 
looks great and is strong 1 
i might have gotten a defect but i would not risk buying it again because of the built quality alone 0 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
that said our mouths and bellies were still quite pleased 1 
the writers were smack on and i think the best actors and actresses were a bonus to the showthese characters were so real 1 
we asked for the bill to leave without eating and they didnt bring that either 0 
i had about two bites and refused to eat anymore 0 
gave up trying to eat any of the crust teeth still sore 0 
great software for motorolas 1 
a disappointment 0 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
he owns the film just as spacek owned coal miners daughter and quaid owned great balls of fire 1 
awsome device works great 1 
the movie is littered with overt racial slurs towards the black cast members and in return the whites are depicted as morons and boobs 0 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
it is shameful 0 
i have eaten here multiple times and each time the food was delicious 1 
light weight i hardly notice it is there 1 
the vanilla ice cream was creamy and smooth while the profiterole choux pastry was fresh enough 1 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
the worst sappiest dialogue i could go on and on 0 
nice design and quality 1 
the macarons here are insanely good 1 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
i dont think i will be back for a very long time 0 
bt50 battery junk 0 
terrible service 0 
the management is rude 0 
the nano stated itmy son was dissapointed 0 
awsome device works great 1 
the chains which im no fan of beat this place easily 0 
love it great armband 1 
meredith m was better than all right 1 
totally believable 1 
all in all i can assure you ill be back 1 
i wont say any more i dont like spoilers so i dont want to be one but i believe this film is worth your time 1 
punishment park is a brilliant piece of cinema 1 
awsome device works great 1 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
cinematography the film was shot in an interesting way 1 
the food was very good 1 
alexander nevsky is a great film 1 
simply beautiful 1 
the writer gorman bechard undoubtedly did his homework because all references are industry and characterage appropriate 1 
leopard print is wonderfully wild 1 
battery life is real good 1 
we wont be returning 0 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
imdb ratings only go as low 1 for awful its time to get some negative numbers in there for cases such as these 0 
this place has it 1 
if only someone involved with it knew how to string together narrative 0 
everything about this product is wrongfirst 0 
this is one of the best italian thrillers of the early 70s 1 
del taco is pretty nasty and should be avoided if possible 0 
it was a bit too sweet not really spicy enough and lacked flavor 0 
probably never coming back and wouldnt recommend it 0 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
the attempts at humor were pitiful and story is so awful it dosent bear thinking about which basically involves a vulcan stealing the enterprise to find god seriously i just didnt care about any of this film and oh not to mention uhura does a belly dance to distract male guards 0 
will definitely be back 1 
conclusion very filling meals 1 
the story starts too fast with absolutely no suspense or buildup in the slightest 0 
a fantastic neighborhood gem 1 
the croutons also taste homemade which is an extra plus 1 
best of all is the rotating feature very helpful 1 
a film not easily forgotten 1 
not sure who was more lost the flat characters or the audience nearly half of whom walked out 0 
the staff are also very friendly and efficient 1 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
long whiny and pointless 0 
the ngage is still lacking in earbuds 0 
everything about this film is simply incredible 1 
i mean in a realistic world she would never have gotten into that ballet repertory the whole thing was quite pathetic 0 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
ill be looking for a new earpiece 0 
all in all i can assure you ill be back 1 
this was a poor remake of my best friends wedding 0 
the whole experience was underwhelming and i think well just go to ninja sushi next time 0 
its a feelgood film and thats how i felt when i came out of the cinema 1 
this was like the final blow 0 
do not buy do not buyit sucks 0 
i wasted my little money with this earpiece 0 
in addition to having one of the most lovely songs ever written french cancan also boasts one of the cutest leading ladies ever to grace the screen 1 
this place is like chipotle but better 1 
an awesome new look for fall 2000 1 
he was very impressed when going from the original battery to the extended battery 1 
total letdown i would much rather just go to the camelback flower shop and cartel coffee 0 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
the design is very good4 1 
this is a great little item 1 
in a word it is embarrassing 0 
definitely will come back here again 1 
overall i would recommend this phone over the new walkman 1 
it is a joy to use 1 
how awesome is that 1 
clear crisp sound 1 
but the duet between the astronaut and his doctor at the beginning of the movie is a perfect exchange if one considers that this movie was made well into the cold war and the astronauts biggest fear is that he has crashed in the ussr 1 
will be back again 1 
this is one of the better buffets that i have been to 1 
the sound quality is excellent as well 1 
best tater tots in the southwest 1 
they could be used as exemplars for any set designer 1 
utter crap sound quality is terrible 0 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
the burger is good beef cooked just right 1 
the sound quality for the device is unacceptableunless you are in a really quiet area you almost hear nothing 0 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
the range is very decent ive been able to roam around my house with the phone in the living room with no receptionsound quality issues 1 
i tried talking real loud but shouting on the telephone gets old and i was still told it wasnt great 0 
nice leather 1 
to be honest with you this is unbelievable nonsense and very foolish 0 
conclusion very filling meals 1 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
definitely a turn off for me i doubt ill be back unless someone else is buying 0 
pricing is a bit of a concern at mellow mushroom 0 
i always order from the vegetarian menu during dinner which has a wide array of options to choose from 1 
i saw this movie and i thought this is a stupid movie 0 
for 40 bucks a head i really expect better food 0 
spend your money and time some place else 0 
the acting was decidely wooden though no worse than a period universal b movie 0 
a usable keyboard actually turns a pda into a realworld useful machine instead of just a neat gadget 1 
i liked this movie way too much 1 
i ate there twice on my last visit and especially enjoyed the salmon salad 1 
elias koteasjack palance play good roles angelina is hot and gets nakedbilly drago appears in this and is cool as usual a cameo by sven ole thorsen helps make this a very enjoyable movie with good acting and a decent budget 1 
in fact this stinker smells like a directtovideo release 0 
horrible horrible protector 0 
everything was perfect the night we were in 1 
its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
the acting was bad 0 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
it will drive you barking mad 0 
it never condescends all the characters have good genuine hearts and believable problems 1 
i was seated immediately 1 
what a waste of time 0 
the only consistent thread holding the series together were the amazing performances of leni parker and anita laselva as the two taelons in quiet idealogical conflict 0 
but now that it is out of warranty the same problems reoccurebottom line put your money somewhere else cingular will not support it 0 
a very good film indeed about great and unconditional love 1 
that said our mouths and bellies were still quite pleased 1 
worst ever 0 
it lasts less than 3o minutes if i actually try to use the phonemy wife has the same phone with the same problem 0 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
when my order arrived one of the gyros was missing 0 
come hungry leave happy and stuffed 1 
i am very impressed with the job that motorola did on the sturdiness of this phone 1 
once you get inside youll be impressed with the place 1 
but i thought his acting was skilled 1 
theres also enough hypocrisy in this film to make me vomit 0 
it did not work in my cell phone plug i am very up set with the charger 0 
ill even say it again  this is torture 0 
i probably wont be coming back here 0 
we also ordered the spinach and avocado salad the ingredients were sad and the dressing literally had zero taste 0 
call me a nut but i think this is one of the best movies ever 1 
the potato chip order was sad i could probably count how many chips were in that box and it was probably around 12 0 
i think this restaurant suffers from not trying hard enough 0 
sam shepards portrayal of a gung ho marine was sobering 1 
the cashew cream sauce was bland and the vegetables were undercooked 0 
i checked out this place a couple years ago and was not impressed 0 
20th century foxs road house 1948 is not only quite a silly noir but is an implausible unmitigated bore of a movie 0 
i started this review with two stars but im editing it to give it only one 0 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
server did a great job handling our large rowdy table 1 
the feel of the dining room was more college cooking course than high class dining and the service was slow at best 0 
my sashimi was poor quality being soggy and tasteless 0 
she carries the movie well 1 
the songs were the best and the muppets were so hilarious 1 
i am so pleased to know such a modern day genius is out there letting is passion for art drive him and taking us as an audience with him 1 
ill definitely be in soon again 1 
seafood was limited to boiled shrimp and crab legs but the crab legs definitely did not taste fresh 0 
its really easy 1 
as always the evening was wonderful and the food delicious 1 
all the other cases ive tried normally fall apart after a few months but this one seems to be in for the long haul 1 
join the club and get awesome offers via email 1 
useless phone simply deaf 0 
if only someone involved with it knew how to string together narrative 0 
mobile phone tools are a must have 1 
dont make the same mistake i did 0 
the movie in movie situations in the beginning and through the game that is played with her by the acting coach are fascinating 1 
im glad the film didnt go for the most obvious choice as a lesser film certainly would have 1 
not as good as i had hoped 0 
ive had no trouble accessing the internet downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions 1 
i would recommend this 1 
if you love death and decay and shakespears lyrics this is the one 1 
the steak was amazingrge fillet relleno was the best seafood plate i have ever had 1 
has been working great 1 
almost all of the songs in cover girl are oldfashioned and not very tuneful 0 
i connected my wifes bluetoothmotorola hs850 to my phone and it worked like a charm whether the phone was in my pocket or the case 1 
would not recommend to others 0 
its welldesigned and very sharp the blue is a very nice color 1 
very good phone 1 
my phone doesnt slide around my car now and the grip prevents my phone from slipping out of my hand 1 
first off the reception sucks i have never had more than 2 bars ever 0 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
it is indescribably the most annoying and idiotic show i have ever seen 0 
not even a hello we will be right with you 0 
secondly hitchcock pretty much perfected the thriller and chase movie 1 
appears to actually outperform the original battery from china that came with my v325i 1 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
i bought two of them and neither will charge 0 
both do good jobs and are quite amusing 1 
it was packed 0 
we asked for the bill to leave without eating and they didnt bring that either 0 
i wouldnt return 0 
theres barely a boring moment in the film and there are plenty of humorous parts 1 
simple lightweight and great fit 1 
easy to pair with my samsung cell 1 
it was a long time that i didnt see a so charismatic actor on screen 1 
these are the nicest restaurant owners ive ever come across 1 
delicious and i will absolutely be back 1 
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0 
great software for motorolas 1 
it is an excellent drama an excellent thriller and an excellent film 1 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
first off the reception sucks i have never had more than 2 bars ever 0 
no complaints 1 
all in all i give this one a resounding 9 out of 10 1 
perfect for someone me who only likes beer ice cold or in this case even colder 1 
having trouble with volume 0 
i had ordered a motorola data cable got a very well finished and working product 1 
one of the best mexican movies ever and one of the less understood even by mexican themselves no matter how identified the should have felt with it 1 
logitech bluetooth headset is a 10 1 
i was disgusted because i was pretty sure that was human hair 0 
and generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode 0 
works great 1 
by this time our side of the restaurant was almost empty so there was no excuse 0 
in a word it is embarrassing 0 
it sure does beat the nachos at the movies but i would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant 0 
the nano stated itmy son was dissapointed 0 
did not like at all 0 
i hope this place sticks around 1 
excellent dualpurpose headset 1 
it is unusable in a moving car at freeway speed 0 
it holds a charge for a long time is reasonably comfortable under longwearing conditions and the quality of sound is tremendous 1 
i recommend this for everyone who loves film movies anythinga work of art 1 
i still maintain that monkeys shouldnt make headphones we just obviously dont share enough dna to copy the design over to humans 0 
the service was meh 0 
i received my orders well within the shipping timeframe everything was in good working order and overall i am very excited to have this source 1 
has been working great 1 
for the price on amazon it is an excellent product which i would highly recommend 1 
what a big waste of time 0 
comes with a strong light that you can use to light up your camera shots and even flash sos signals seriously 1 
this place is good 1 
very well made and fits my surefire gx2 perfectly 1 
and finally after all that we get to an ending that wouldve been great had it been handled by competent people and not jerry falwell 0 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
everyone is very attentive providing excellent customer service 1 
very satisifed with that 1 
i had verizon 2 years ago and really liked their service 1 
very easy to use 1 
made very sturdy 1 
i had about two bites and refused to eat anymore 0 
the service was outshining i definitely recommend the halibut 1 
i was left shattered from the experience of watching this film and i took a good two hours to fully recover 0 
the story starts too fast with absolutely no suspense or buildup in the slightest 0 
excellent cast story line performances 1 
avoid this one if you can 0 
there are massive levels massive unlockable characters its just a massive game 1 
it came free with a dvd player i bought but i still turned the thing off halfway through because i was embarrassed for howell 0 
of course the acting is blah 0 
very satisifed with that 1 
now the pizza itself was good the peanut sauce was very tasty 1 
im probably one of the few people to ever go to ians and not like it 0 
i dont think well be going back anytime soon 0 
when achille and philippa beautifully sing a duet from don giovanni that perfectly describes their situation in the movie you appreciate the subtle layers of this excellent film 1 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
and dont even get me started on the jerky camerawork 0 
brilliance indeed 1 
very windresistant 1 
this product is great it makes working a lot easier i can go to the copier while waiting on hold for something 1 
new battery works great in phone 1 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
internet is excrutiatingly slow 0 
this is the kind of money that is wasted properly 1 
it has northern humour and positive about the community it represents 1 
he deserves 5 stars 1 
it was a huge awkward 15lb piece of cow that was 34ths gristle and fat 0 
it makes very strange ticking noises before it ends the call 0 
but now i was completely grossed out 0 
thats how id describe this painfully dreary timewaster of a film 0 
the chains which im no fan of beat this place easily 0 
thank you for such great service 1 
service is perfect and the family atmosphere is nice to see 1 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
again no plot at all 0 
muddy low quality sound and the casing around the wires insert was poorly super glued and slid off 0 
the vegetables are so fresh and the sauce feels like authentic thai 1 
what a mistake 0 
an absolute must visit 1 
i have yet to run this new battery below two bars and thats three days without charging 1 
i really do recommend this place you can go wrong with this donut place 1 
the foreigner is not worth one second of your time 0 
do not make the same mistake as me 0 
has been working great 1 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
the battery life is highly unacceptable 0 
nice design and quality 1 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
overall i would recommend this phone over the new walkman 1 
i am very impressed with this headset from plantronics 1 
it was forced like everything in this movie 0 
lastly the mozzarella sticks they were the best thing we ordered 1 
what should have been a hilarious yummy christmas eve dinner to remember was the biggest fail of the entire trip for us 0 
i dont think you will be disappointed 1 
today was my first taste of a buldogis gourmet hot dog and i have to tell you it was more than i ever thought possible 1 
im still infatuated with this phone 1 
definitely worth seeing its the sort of thought provoking film that forces you to question your own threshold of loneliness 1 
its been my choice headset for yearsgreat sound good volume good noise cancellation 1 
we had 7 at our table and the service was pretty fast 1 
i received my orders well within the shipping timeframe everything was in good working order and overall i am very excited to have this source 1 
shrimp when i unwrapped it i live only 12 a mile from brushfire it was literally ice cold 0 
i wish i could return the unit and get back my money 0 
this movie is so awesome 1 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
avoid at all costs 0 
i had to wait over 30 minutes to get my drink and longer to get 2 arepas 0 
the chicken i got was definitely reheated and was only ok the wedges were cold and soggy 0 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
when my mom and i got home she immediately got sick and she only had a few bites of salad 0 
you need at least 3 mins to get to your phone book from the time you first turn on the phonebattery life is short 0 
nice design and quality 1 
lousy product 0 
this is high adventure at its best 1 
never been to hard rock casino before will never ever step forward in it again 0 
these headphones were a great find and i think they are perhaps the best purchase ive made in the last several years seriously 1 
brilliance indeed 1 
rude inconsiderate management 0 
babie bop is very cute 1 
ive had no trouble accessing the internet downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions 1 
none of the three sizes they sent with the headset would stay in my ears 0 
a good quality bargain i bought this after i bought a cheapy from big lots that sounded awful and people on the other end couldnt hear me 1 
nothing at all to recommend 0 
its a total package 1 
great price too 1 
id say that would be the hardest decision honestly all of ms dishes taste how they are supposed to taste amazing 1 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
we will not be coming back 0 
product is useless since it does not have enough charging current to charge the 2 cellphones i was planning to use it with 0 
as many people complained i found this headsets microphone was very weak 0 
this is a stunning movie 1 
i let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this bad idea we both hated it 0 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
then i watched it again two sundays ago march 20th 2005 and i began to really enjoy it and this time i taped the entire thing 1 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
his costars dont fare much better with people like morgan freeman jonah hill and ed helms just wasted 0 
good product good seller 1 
however my girl was complain that some time the phone doesnt wake up like normal phone does 0 
very nice and relaxing late night viewing 1 
the dialogue sucked 0 
2 thumbs up to this seller 1 
the bartender was also nice 1 
however this didnt make up for the fact that overall this was a tremendously boring movie 0 
i had a salad with the wings and some ice cream for dessert and left feeling quite satisfied 1 
not a good bargain 0 
i am going to have to be the first to negatively review this product 0 
and the sound quality is great 1 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
worst foodservice ive had in a while 0 
also the fries are without a doubt the worst fries ive ever had 0 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
mobile phone tools are a must have 1 
the characters were all funny and had the peculiarity of not having a true lead character 1 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
a good time 1 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
think it over when you plan to own this onethis sure is the last moto phone for me 0 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
i bought this battery with a coupon from amazon and im very happy with my purchase 1 
terrible phone holder 0 
constantine gives everything the right intensity and seems to have a good understanding of the underlying psychological motivations 1 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
motorola finally got the voice quality of a bluetooth headset right 1 
the feel of the dining room was more college cooking course than high class dining and the service was slow at best 0 
but it does get better reception and clarity than any phone ive had before 1 
basically the service was very bad 0 
great phone 1 
this movie is terrible 0 
i found a six inch long piece of wire in my salsa 0 
for sushi on the strip this is the place to go 1 
my order was not correct 0 
the pizza tasted old super chewy in not a good way 0 
phone falls out easily 0 
piece of trash 0 
it deserves strong love 1 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
very very fun chef 1 
the cast of veteran actors are more than just a nostalgia trip 1 
often the dialogue doesnt really follow from one line to another or fit the surroundings 0 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
we ordered the duck rare and it was pink and tender on the inside with a nice char on the outside 1 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
he was very impressed when going from the original battery to the extended battery 1 
the handsfree part works fine but then the car tries to download the address book and the treo rebootsoverall i still rate this device high 1 
this second appearance of mickey mouse following the silent plane crazy earlier that year is probably his most famous filmmostly because it was so groundbreaking 1 
bought mainly for the charger which broke soon after purchasing 0 
the chefs were friendly and did a good job 1 
i would have given no star if i was able 0 
food was delicious 1 
the vanilla ice cream was creamy and smooth while the profiterole choux pastry was fresh enough 1 
dont waste your on this one 0 
this was like the final blow 0 
youd have to have the iq of particularly stupid mollusk not to see that one coming 0 
so badwellits just bad 0 
the transfers are very good 1 
couldnt use the unit with sunglasses not good in texas 0 
terrible my car will not accept this cassette 0 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
also its a real treat to see anthony quinn playing crazy horse 1 
same evening him and i are both drastically sick 0 
the story itself is just predictable and lazy 0 
i will not be eating there again 0 
even in my bmw 3 series which is fairly quiet i have trouble hearing what the other person is saying 0 
the delivery was on time 1 
what makes this story different are the terrific production values faultless photography composition and editing the terrific casting the underappreciated brian keith playing a bully teddy and vivid history 1 
the price was very good and with the free shipping and all it was a good purchase 1 
considering the relations off screen between taylor and stanwyck it was surprising how little chemistry there was on screen between the two of them 0 
you wont forget this movie 1 
very happy with this product 1 
the attention given to every character and complex psychological portrayals detailing loyalty treachery love and hope are tremendous 1 
however this didnt make up for the fact that overall this was a tremendously boring movie 0 
i guess i should have known that this place would suck because it is inside of the excalibur but i didnt use my common sense 0 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
new battery works great in phone 1 
ryans bar is definitely one edinburgh establishment i wont be revisiting 0 
service is quick and friendly 1 
also notable is john baileys fine crisp beautifully colored cinematography and the great production design costumes by eiko ishioka who went on to do the memorable costumes for coppolas dracula for which she received a well deserved oscar 1 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
it is unusable in a moving car at freeway speed 0 
the casting is also horrible cause all you see is a really really bad actors period 0 
this film offers many delights and surprises 1 
kind of hard to mess up a steak but they did 0 
the croutons also taste homemade which is an extra plus 1 
cute quaint simple honest 1 
simple lightweight and great fit 1 
another thing i didnt really like is when a character got punched in the face a gallon of blood would spew forth soon after 0 
the pancake was also really good and pretty large at that 1 
highly recommend for any one who has a blue tooth phone 1 
its not hard to make a decent hamburger 0 
their onscreen chemistry critical to the entire film is genuine 1 
later i found myself lost in the power of the film 1 
all in all i can assure you ill be back 1 
cooked to perfection and the service was impeccable 1 
the plot simply rumbles on like a machine desperately depending on the addition of new scenes 0 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
the staff are also very friendly and efficient 1 
waiter was a jerk 0 
yet plantronincs continues to use the same flawed charger design 0 
the sound is clear and the people i talk to on it are amazed at the quality too 1 
this is an excellent tool especially when paired with your phones autoanswer 1 
the wind and the lion is well written and superbly acted 1 
they are so easy to love but even more easy to identify with 1 
terrible management 0 
the black eyed peas and sweet potatoes unreal 1 
so in a nutshell 1 the restaraunt smells like a combination of a dirty fish market and a sewer 0 
the ambiance isnt much better 0 
could not get strong enough signal 0 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
i immediately said i wanted to talk to the manager but i did not want to talk to the guy who was doing shots of fireball behind the bar 0 
the phone loads super 1 
of course the acting is blah 0 
it is unusable in a moving car at freeway speed 0 
add betty white and jean smart and you have a great cast everyone played their parts really well 1 
the battery works great 1 
both actors truly understand and become their particular character delivering a convincing sincere performance 1 
good show samsung 1 
whatever prompted such a documentary is beyond me 0 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
good audio quality 1 
you need two hands to operate the screenthis software interface is decade old and cannot compete with new software designs 0 
what a mistake that was 0 
itll be a regular stop on my trips to phoenix 1 
its not what it says it is 0 
rude inconsiderate management 0 
i cannot make calls at certain places 0 
the acting was bad 0 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
fantastic service here 1 
i give it 2 thumbs down 0 
this place is awesome if you want something light and healthy during the summer 1 
total letdown i would much rather just go to the camelback flower shop and cartel coffee 0 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
id like to return it 0 
the restaurant atmosphere was exquisite 1 
not a good item it worked for a while then started having problems in my auto reverse tape player 0 
i still maintain that monkeys shouldnt make headphones we just obviously dont share enough dna to copy the design over to humans 0 
this is a great place to eat 1 
this place is like chipotle but better 1 
but then they came back cold 0 
could not get strong enough signal 0 
i really hope the team behind this movie makes more movies and that they will continue to do so in their own some kinda weird style 1 
excellent sound battery life and inconspicuous to boot 1 
mobile phone tools are a must have 1 
1 hour 54 minutes of sheer tedium melodrama and horrible acting a mess of a script and a sinking feeling of good lord what were they thinking 0 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
a fly was in my apple juice a fly 0 
highly entertaining at all angles 1 
as for the service i thought it was good 1 
it was so bad i had lost the heart to finish it 0 
phone falls out easily 0 
i got home to see the driest damn wings ever 0 
too bad cause i know its family owned i really wanted to like this place 0 
terrible service 0 
i didnt realize how wonderful the short really is until the last two scenes 1 
do not make the same mistake as me 0 
never again will i be dining at this place 0 
in addition to having one of the most lovely songs ever written french cancan also boasts one of the cutest leading ladies ever to grace the screen 1 
it is easy to turn on and off when you are in the car and the volume controls are quite accessable 1 
this is one of the best italian thrillers of the early 70s 1 
i mean really how do you get so famous for your fish and chips when its so terrible 0 
as for the killer dont expect anything original or even remotely frightening 0 
great product 1 
warning stay away 0 
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0 
if there were zero stars i would give it zero stars 0 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
the characters are interesting and you want to find out more about them the longer the movie goes on and i think people will be surprised by who does and doesnt make it 1 
it fits my ear well and is comfortable on 1 
one of the worst shows of all time 0 
trumbull on i love lucy 1 
best ive found so far ive tried 2 other bluetooths and this one has the best quality for both me and the listener as well as ease of using 1 
really ugly 0 
phone is sturdy as all nokia bar phones are 1 
i have yet to run this new battery below two bars and thats three days without charging 1 
superb phone on a great network 1 
think it over when you plan to own this onethis sure is the last moto phone for me 0 
excellent starter wireless headset 0 
very disappointing 0 
lightweight and works well 1 
and dont even get me started on the jerky camerawork 0 
not nearly as good looking as the amazon picture makes it look 0 
the last 15 minutes of movie are also not bad as well 1 
steamboat willie is an amazingly important film to our cinema history 1 
to sum the film up breeders is a terrible cheaply made horror movie that should be avoided like the ebola virus 0 
those phones are working just fine now 1 
it was a drive to get there 0 
this case has passed the one year mark and while it shows signs of wear it is 100 functional 1 
the pairing of the two devices was so easy it barely took a couple minutes before i started making calls with the voice dialing feature 1 
and sometimes it was so embarrassing that i had to look away 0 
this review is long overdue since i consider a tale of two sisters to be the single greatest film ever made 1 
this product is great it makes working a lot easier i can go to the copier while waiting on hold for something 1 
the story line is just awful 0 
setup went very smoothly 1 
victor mclaglen was even bad and brian donlevy was almost unrecognizable 0 
i would recommend purchasing the jabra jx10 series 2 which works flawlessly with my moto q go figure 1 
muddy low quality sound and the casing around the wires insert was poorly super glued and slid off 0 
good show samsung 1 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
if you want a real scare rent this one 1 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
the best phone in market 1 
phone falls out easily 0 
who in their right mind is gonna buy this battery 0 
how awful she is 0 
today the graphics are crap 0 
whatever the producer was going for he missed entirely 0 
stay away from this store be careful 0 
also were served hot bread and butter and home made potato chips with bacon bits on topvery original and very good 1 
the range is very decent ive been able to roam around my house with the phone in the living room with no receptionsound quality issues 1 
dont make the same mistake i did 0 
it fits my ear well and is comfortable on 1 
the only thing that i think could improve is the sound leaks out from the headset 0 
my boyfriend and i sat at the bar and had a completely delightful experience 1 
crostini that came with the salad was stale 0 
bluetooth does not work phone locks up screens just flash up and now it just makes calls randomly while in my pocket locked 0 
excellent starter wireless headset 0 
its a campy sort of film thats a joy to watch 1 
the ripped banana was not only ripped but petrified and tasteless 0 
disappointing experience 0 
the bathrooms are clean and the place itself is well decorated 1 
its a fresh subtle and rather sublime effect 1 
the movie is full of wonderful dancing hence the title 1 
best tater tots in the southwest 1 
the worst phone ive ever had only had it for a few months 0 
for people who are first timers in film making i think they did an excellent job 1 
battery life is also great 1 
the food was great as always compliments to the chef 1 
the crêpe was delicate and thin and moist 1 
its like a bad two hour tv movie 0 
good case excellent value 1 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
if you plan to use this in a car forget about it 0 
a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it 1 
i can assure you that you wont be disappointed 1 
the service was terrible food was mediocre 0 
i just saw this film and i recommend it 1 
what the hell kind of crap is that 0 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
the story which was told so eloquently by francis ford coppola 25 years earlier really unfolds gradually and leaves room for the characters to develop 1 
defective crap 0 
then i had to continue pairing it periodically since it somehow kept dropping 0 
save your money ive had this item for 11 months now 0 
people couldnt hear me talk and i had to pull out the earphone and talk on the phone 0 
theres barely a boring moment in the film and there are plenty of humorous parts 1 
my boyfriend and i sat at the bar and had a completely delightful experience 1 
the phone was unusable and was not new 0 
great for ipods too 1 
so i am here to warn youdo not rent this movie it is the dumbest thing you have never seen 0 
the acting was decidely wooden though no worse than a period universal b movie 0 
i felt asleep the first time i watched it so i can recommend it for insomniacs 0 
very disappointed in accessoryone 0 
dont buy this product it fails 0 
perfect for someone me who only likes beer ice cold or in this case even colder 1 
another thing i didnt really like is when a character got punched in the face a gallon of blood would spew forth soon after 0 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
now we were chosen to be tortured with this disgusting piece of blatant american propaganda 0 
the grilled chicken was so tender and yellow from the saffron seasoning 1 
i left with a stomach ache and felt sick the rest of the day 0 
its a piece of crap 0 
waste your money on this game 1 
today was my first taste of a buldogis gourmet hot dog and i have to tell you it was more than i ever thought possible 1 
one nice thing was that they added gratuity on the bill since our party was larger than 6 or 8 and they didnt expect more tip than that 1 
i could not stand to even watch it for very long for fear of losing iq 0 
what a waste 0 
i was very disappointed 0 
the shipping time was also very quick 1 
im so sorry but i really cant recommend it to anyone 0 
pretty piece of junk 0 
also difficult to put onid recommend avoiding this product 0 
you get what you pay for i guess 0 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
the seasonal fruit was fresh white peach puree 1 
and it was way to expensive 0 
worst thai ever 0 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
in the summer you can dine in a charming outdoor patio so very delightful 1 
the plot has more holes than a pair of fishnet stockings and the direction and editing is astonishingly ham fisted 0 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
i was deeply impressed with the character he played 1 
just whatever you do avoid groove as its the antithesis of all that is good about human traffic 0 
a good film by a great director 1 
the structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema 1 
the service was a little slow considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace 0 
loved itfriendly servers great food wonderful and imaginative menu 1 
this film has no redeeming features 0 
best headset ever 1 
maybe there would be a reasonable explanation for this atrocity 0 
the first thing that happened was that the tracking was off 0 
not impressed 0 
it also had a new problem 0 
worst foodservice ive had in a while 0 
its not user friendly 0 
for those that havent seen it dont waste your time 0 
overall i wasnt very impressed with noca 0 
essentially you can forget microsofts tech support 0 
talk about useless customer service 0 
this phone tries very hard to do everything but fails at its very ability to be a phone 0 
i give it 2 thumbs down 0 
it wasnt busy either also the building was freezing cold 0 
if you simply want a small flip phone look elsewhere as the extra bells whistles are mediocre 0 
great pizza and salads 1 
i could care less the interior is just beautiful 1 
made very sturdy 1 
the staff are great the ambiance is great 1 
1 long lasting battery you dont have to recharge it as frequentyly as some of the flip phones2 0 
works like a charm it work the same as the one i got with the phone 1 
who in their right mind is gonna buy this battery 0 
i left the theater with a lilt in my step joy in my heart and hope for the human race 1 
a usable keyboard actually turns a pda into a realworld useful machine instead of just a neat gadget 1 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
very disappointed 0 
best tater tots in the southwest 1 
and then tragedy struck 0 
gave up trying to eat any of the crust teeth still sore 0 
i know he was a contract player with little control over his scripts but the acting was as bad as the script 0 
needless to say i wont be going back anytime soon 0 
one thing i hate is the mode set button at the side 0 
this was such an awesome movie that i bought it off of ebay 1 
its kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly its embarrassing how childlike the company is 0 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
all in all its an insult to ones intelligence and a huge waste of money 0 
we had a group of 70 when we claimed we would only have 40 and they handled us beautifully 1 
the selection was probably the worst ive seen in vegasthere was none 0 
i found this place by accident and i could not be happier 1 
good beer drink selection and good food selection 1 
it was too predictable even for a chick flick 0 
great case and price 1 
her lines seem to have been written by a fifteen year old though they are trying oh so so hard to sound like how a fifteen year old would really um you know well talk 0 
excellent sound battery life and inconspicuous to boot 1 
well never go again 0 
the service here is fair at best 0 
using all earpieces left or right this thing will not stay on my ear 0 
there arent death scenes like in previous movies and the fx are terrible 0 
its a great tool for entertainment communication and data managementoh be sure to use activesync 42 for optimal data synchronization results 1 
if this premise sound stupid thats because it is 0 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
this place is way too overpriced for mediocre food 0 
it was a great phone 1 
if there was ever an indication of a writer and a directors ability to meld two highly volatile temperaments into a seamless union of creativity then this is it 1 
dont buy it 0 
the battery is working well as a replacement for the original that came with the phone over 2 years ago 1 
good servicecheck 1 
i have had this phone for over a year now and i will tell you its not that great 0 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
service was fantastic 1 
this is just a great movie 1 
linked to my phone without effort 1 
they dropped more than the ball 0 
this phone might well be the worst ive ever had in any brand 0 
the writer gorman bechard undoubtedly did his homework because all references are industry and characterage appropriate 1 
i found this place by accident and i could not be happier 1 
good price 1 
everything about it is fine and reasonable for the price ie 1 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
i like steiners because its dark and it feels like a bar 1 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
the steak was amazingrge fillet relleno was the best seafood plate i have ever had 1 
the writers were smack on and i think the best actors and actresses were a bonus to the showthese characters were so real 1 
unfortunately the ability to actually know you are receiving a call is a rather important feature and this phone is pitiful in that respect 0 
his performance is simply genius 1 
schrader has made a resume full of lousy amateurish films 0 
a pretty good product 1 
great phone 1 
the feel of the dining room was more college cooking course than high class dining and the service was slow at best 0 
i recommend this for everyone who loves film movies anythinga work of art 1 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
give this one a look 1 
the classic maine lobster roll was fantastic 1 
the microphone also works well but according to people i have called it applifies everything 1 
i found this place by accident and i could not be happier 1 
very very fun chef 1 
no real improvement 0 
i cant tell you how disappointed i was 0 
first the bathrooms at this location were dirty seat covers were not replenished just plain yucky 0 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
the acting helps the writing along very well maybe the idiotsavant sister could have been played better and it is a real joy to watch 1 
very disappointing 0 
my brother in law who works at the mall ate here same day and guess what he was sick all night too 0 
wonderful lil tapas and the ambience made me feel all warm and fuzzy inside 1 
both rickman and stowe play their roles to the hilt in this tale of a childrens book writer who maybe has written a subversive tract 1 
the art style has the appearance of crayonpencil drawings and is wonderfully colorful and fanciful 1 
and i just love the colors 1 
one of the most disappointing aspects is the lack of notable gore 0 
the servers went back and forth several times not even so much as an are you being helped 0 
after i pulled up my car i waited for another 15 minutes before being acknowledged 0 
great phone 1 
as many people complained i found this headsets microphone was very weak 0 
it is a really good show to watch 1 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
looks great and is strong 1 
you get extra minutes so that you can carry out the call and not get cut off 1 
this place should honestly be blown up 0 
i give wirefly 1 stari will contact cingularatt and inform them of this practice 0 
the film has an ultracheap look to it 0 
the salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop which was perfectly cooked 1 
you can even take self portraits with the outside exterior display very cool 1 
i had about two bites and refused to eat anymore 0 
either way it sucks 0 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
very nice and relaxing late night viewing 1 
the pairing of the two devices was so easy it barely took a couple minutes before i started making calls with the voice dialing feature 1 
this is definitely a cult classic well worth viewing and sharing with others 1 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
however i recently watched the whole thing again on dvd and i was completely struck by how extremely stupid the storyline was how it contained holes inconsistencies and frankly a whole lot of crap and how horrid the dancing was 0 
the construction of the headsets is poor 0 
all in all id expected a better consumer experience from motorola 0 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
despite how hard i rate businesses its actually rare for me to give a 1 star 0 
bad choice 0 
say bye bye to your tip lady 0 
1010 1 
one nice thing was that they added gratuity on the bill since our party was larger than 6 or 8 and they didnt expect more tip than that 1 
the good cinematography also makes her and monica bellucci look very beautiful 1 
the story line is just awful 0 
not tasty and the texture was just nasty 0 
the characters are interesting and you really care for them 1 
good audio quality 1 
i love this cable it allows me to connect any miniusb device to my pc 1 
the only good thing was that it fits comfortably on small ears 1 
you wont be disappointed 1 
totally believable 1 
omg i felt like i had never eaten thai food until this dish 1 
the only good thing was that it fits comfortably on small ears 1 
much more interesting more action more suspense and less of the unneeded controversy 1 
nothing special 0 
this is definitely one of the better documentaries i have seen looking at family relationships and marriage 1 
i love this phone 1 
i received my supposedly new motorola 375 and apparently there was not a match between the phone and the charger 0 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
i particularly remember my senses being assaulted by strident cords of music that would blare out with very little warning and even less meaning 0 
i can say that the desserts were yummy 1 
shes poised and amazing 1 
i wasnt expecting oscar material but this 0 
service was fantastic 1 
a fantastic neighborhood gem 1 
i felt insulted and disrespected how could you talk and judge another human being like that 0 
im big fan of rpg games too but this movie its a disgrace to any selfrespecting rpger there is 0 
i heart this place 1 
a very very very slowmoving aimless movie about a distressed drifting young man 0 
frozen pucks of disgust with some of the worst people behind the register 0 
this hole in the wall has great mexican street tacos and friendly staff 1 
fantastic food 1 
he came running after us when he realized my husband had left his sunglasses on the table 1 
kind of flops around 0 
i particularly remember my senses being assaulted by strident cords of music that would blare out with very little warning and even less meaning 0 
the battery is completely useless to me 0 
this place is pretty good nice little vibe in the restaurant 1 
i highly recommend this modest priced cellular phone 1 
very very sad 0 
i loved it 1 
when my mom and i got home she immediately got sick and she only had a few bites of salad 0 
really really good rice all the time 1 
i literally vomited while watching this film 0 
the acting sucks the music sucks the script sucks the pacing sucks the special fx suck the directing sucks basically this movie sucks 0 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
bought mainly for the charger which broke soon after purchasing 0 
on the ground right next to our table was a large smeared beensteppedinandtrackedeverywhere pile of green bird poop 0 
very disappointing 0 
the first thing that happened was that the tracking was off 0 
your brain will attempt to shutdown as part of a primal impulse of selfpreservation 0 
the calls drop the phone comes on and off at will the screen goes black and the worst of all it stops ringing intermittently 0 
they could be used as exemplars for any set designer 1 
worst thai ever 0 
i never come again 0 
however after seeing the short again after about 25 years i was amazed at how timeless the film actually is 1 
the vanilla ice cream was creamy and smooth while the profiterole choux pastry was fresh enough 1 
i love this phone it is very handy and has a lot of features 1 
couldnt ask for a more satisfying meal 1 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
ive had better not only from dedicated boba tea spots but even from jenni pho 0 
i found a six inch long piece of wire in my salsa 0 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
to be honest with you this is unbelievable nonsense and very foolish 0 
light weight i hardly notice it is there 1 
best ive found so far ive tried 2 other bluetooths and this one has the best quality for both me and the listener as well as ease of using 1 
it was a huge awkward 15lb piece of cow that was 34ths gristle and fat 0 
crostini that came with the salad was stale 0 
doesnt last long 0 
before i go in to why i gave a 1 star rating please know that this was my third time eating at bachi burger before writing a review 0 
for 40 bucks a head i really expect better food 0 
works as described 1 
the lead man is charismafree 0 
left very frustrated 0 
the sound quality for the device is unacceptableunless you are in a really quiet area you almost hear nothing 0 
the script is was there a script 0 
but storm trooper is not even bad enough to make it to the list of wonderfully terrible movies 0 
we walked away stuffed and happy about our first vegas buffet experience 1 
it is so small and you dont even realize that it is there after a while of getting used to it 1 
very very sad 0 
its an empty hollow shell of a movie 0 
great pizza and salads 1 
this is an unbelievable bargain 1 
ordered an appetizer and took 40 minutes and then the pizza another 10 minutes 0 
if you dont find it too bad as again the unit comes with one earpad onlyi would not recommend this to anyone 0 
food was good service was good prices were good 1 
wow loved this place 1 
i will not return 0 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
we thought youd have to venture further away to get good sushi but this place really hit the spot that night 1 
1010 1 
this wonderful experience made this place a muststop whenever we are in town again 1 
its aggravating 0 
we loved the biscuits 1 
couldnt figure it out 0 
i left the theater with a lilt in my step joy in my heart and hope for the human race 1 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
he came running after us when he realized my husband had left his sunglasses on the table 1 
but it does get better reception and clarity than any phone ive had before 1 
service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is vegas and located inside the crystals shopping mall by aria 1 
another note about this phones appearance is that it really looks rather bland especially in the all black model 0 
my 5year old nokia 2160 from tracfone holds the charge a lot better than this 0 
i even dropped this phone into a stream and it was submerged for 15 seconds and it still works great 1 
waste of money 0 
this is a very average phone with bad battery life that operates on a weak network 0 
my husband and i ate lunch here and were very disappointed with the food and service 0 
works great 1 
rude inconsiderate management 0 
all in all its an insult to ones intelligence and a huge waste of money 0 
i just saw this film and i recommend it 1 
soggy and not good 0 
this movie now joins revenge of the boogeyman and zombiez as part of the hellish trinity of horror films 0 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
works great 1 
greatno problems at all 1 
conclusion very filling meals 1 
worthless product 0 
excellent product for the price 1 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
there is however some pretty good acting at least for this type of film 1 
worthless product 0 
camerawork again bad 0 
basically the service was very bad 0 
i find this inexcusable and so will probably be returning this phone and perhaps changing carriers 0 
hard to judge whether these sides were good because we were grossed out by the melted styrofoam and didnt want to eat it for fear of getting sick 0 
it is an excellent drama an excellent thriller and an excellent film 1 
but when someone strives for greatness and poetry but delivers a muddled and often ridiculous story a bunch of disparate scenes pretentious dialogue then you get the worst kind of a movie that some other reviewer very accurately defined as pretentious crap 0 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
secondly hitchcock pretty much perfected the thriller and chase movie 1 
i totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is 1 
unfortunately it was not good 0 
it was a great phone 1 
talk about useless customer service 0 
regardless the film fails on most levels 0 
both the hot sour the egg flower soups were absolutely 5 stars 1 
the cast is always entertaining as usual 1 
then the film just dropped the ball 0 
good service very clean and inexpensive to boot 1 
i have two more years left in this contract and i hate this phone 0 
their onscreen chemistry critical to the entire film is genuine 1 
definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly will return next time im in vegas 1 
it has northern humour and positive about the community it represents 1 
its a campy sort of film thats a joy to watch 1 
it deserves strong love 1 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
shes poised and amazing 1 
instead we got a bore fest about a whiny spoiled brat babysitting 0 
its a mediocre miserable hollow laughable and predictable piece of garbage 0 
the pleather case doesnt fit 0 
long whiny and pointless 0 
its a total package 1 
i guess i liked the details of his dysfunctionhe was believable 1 
doesnt do the job 0 
terrible phone holder 0 
very pleased with this headset 1 
you will leave the theater wanting to go out and dance under the stars 1 
best tater tots in the southwest 1 
w810i is just superb 1 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
each track commands sentiment actually contributing to the scenes and characters 1 
they do not care about the consumer one bit 0 
once you get inside youll be impressed with the place 1 
first of all it doesnt wear well 0 
this movie is bad 0 
i wish i could return the unit and get back my money 0 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
it looks very nice 1 
not loud enough and doesnt turn on like it should 0 
doesnt work 0 
i got home to see the driest damn wings ever 0 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
it was delicious 1 
i am glad i purchased it 1 
i wouldnt see this movie again for free 0 
third the cheese on my friends burger was cold 0 
i dont think well be going back anytime soon 0 
i was bored throughout the whole damn thing 0 
top line dont waste your time and money on this one its as bad as it comes 0 
the owner used to work at nobu so this place is really similar for half the price 1 
i was deeply impressed with the character he played 1 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
disappointing experience 0 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
the decor is nice and the piano music soundtrack is pleasant 1 
to sum the film up breeders is a terrible cheaply made horror movie that should be avoided like the ebola virus 0 
i even dropped this phone into a stream and it was submerged for 15 seconds and it still works great 1 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
a pretty good product 1 
her lines seem to have been written by a fifteen year old though they are trying oh so so hard to sound like how a fifteen year old would really um you know well talk 0 
muddy low quality sound and the casing around the wires insert was poorly super glued and slid off 0 
the reception is excellent 1 
the bus boy on the other hand was so rude 0 
it looks very nice 1 
great price too 1 
i literally vomited while watching this film 0 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
gotta love those closeups of slimy drooling teeth 1 
highly entertaining at all angles 1 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
excellent dualpurpose headset 1 
its so bad its actually worth seeing just for that reason 0 
lewis blacks considerable talent is wasted here too as he is at his most incendiary when he is unrestrained which the pg13 rating certainly wont allow 0 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
it presents a idyllic yet serious portrayal of the ups and downs of the characters lives 1 
just whatever you do avoid groove as its the antithesis of all that is good about human traffic 0 
predictable but not a bad watch 1 
lets start with all the problemsthe acting especially from the lead professor was very very bad 0 
case was more or less an extra that i originally put on but later discarded because it scratched my ear 0 
how can that bethe audio quality is poor 0 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
the vegetables are so fresh and the sauce feels like authentic thai 1 
so flavorful and has just the perfect amount of heat 1 
i think it was robert ryans best film because he portrayed someone like my father and he was a schizophrenic in real lifemy father although he never murdered anyone but was affected more so during the second world war which made him worse 1 
what happened next was prettyoff putting 0 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
awsome device works great 1 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
i rate this movie 910 1 
also the phone doesnt seem to accept anything except cbr mp3s preferably ripped by windows media player 0 
after i pulled up my car i waited for another 15 minutes before being acknowledged 0 
after the disappointing dinner we went elsewhere for dessert 0 
there are massive levels massive unlockable characters its just a massive game 1 
im really disappointed all i have now is a charger that doesnt work 0 
very dissapointing performance 0 
whatever the producer was going for he missed entirely 0 
conclusion i loved it 1 
was not happy 0 
while i managed to bend the leaf spring back in place the metal now has enough stress that it will break on the next drop 0 
elias koteasjack palance play good roles angelina is hot and gets nakedbilly drago appears in this and is cool as usual a cameo by sven ole thorsen helps make this a very enjoyable movie with good acting and a decent budget 1 
and finally after all that we get to an ending that wouldve been great had it been handled by competent people and not jerry falwell 0 
the chicken dishes are ok the beef is like shoe leather 0 
but the service was beyond bad 0 
the biggest complaint i have is the battery drains superfast 0 
the sangria was about half of a glass wine full and was 12 ridiculous 0 
works great when my cat attacked the phone he scratched the protective strip instead of destroying the screen 1 
the film has an ultracheap look to it 0 
they do not last forever but is not overly expensive to replaceeasy to operate and the sound is much better than others i have tried 1 
i have never had such bland food which surprised me considering the article we read focused so much on their spices and flavor 0 
easy to pair with my samsung cell 1 
not nearly as good looking as the amazon picture makes it look 0 
i swung in to give them a try but was deeply disappointed 0 
the structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema 1 
so good i am going to have to review this place twice once hereas a tribute to the place and once as a tribute to an event held here last night 1 
con spotty service 0 
battery lasts only a few hours 0 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
i received my orders well within the shipping timeframe everything was in good working order and overall i am very excited to have this source 1 
a usable keyboard actually turns a pda into a realworld useful machine instead of just a neat gadget 1 
it was so funny 1 
the interplay between martin and emilio contains the same wonderful chemistry we saw in wall street with martin and charlie 1 
see it 1 
good food good service 1 
when my order arrived one of the gyros was missing 0 
audio quality is poor very poor 0 
bad purchase 0 
helen baxendale is a very credible lady macbeth who can be very cheerfull at times and sometimes she just looks like a naughty girl but deadly in her taste for blood and evil 1 
his losing his marbles so early in the proceedings is totally implausible and unconvincing 0 
im not eating here 0 
very good phone 1 
what this film lacks is a convincing script 0 
loved itfriendly servers great food wonderful and imaginative menu 1 
it is unusable in a moving car at freeway speed 0 
this place is not quality sushi it is not a quality restaurant 0 
i bought this to use with my kindle fire and absolutely loved it 1 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
there was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters 0 
reversible plug works great 1 
dont waste your time here 0 
go watch it 1 
very disappointed in accessoryone 0 
we waited for forty five minutes in vain 0 
dont buy this product 0 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
the battery runs down quickly 0 
the plot simply rumbles on like a machine desperately depending on the addition of new scenes 0 
the structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema 1 
he is one of my favourite directors and one of the most talented directors in the history of cinema 1 
everything was perfect the night we were in 1 
the delivery was on time 1 
i dont have very many words to say about this place but it does everything pretty well 1 
this place is pretty good nice little vibe in the restaurant 1 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
im glad i found this product on amazon it is hard to find it wasnt high priced 1 
this place is horrible and way overpriced 0 
hes a national treasure 1 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
the chips and sals a here is amazing 1 
i bought this battery with a coupon from amazon and im very happy with my purchase 1 
your staff spends more time talking to themselves than me 0 
but this movie is definitely a below average rent 0 
i asked multiple times for the wine list and after some time of being ignored i went to the hostess and got one myself 0 
i guess i should have known that this place would suck because it is inside of the excalibur but i didnt use my common sense 0 
unfortunately it was not good 0 
rating 010 grade z note the show is so bad that even mother of the cast pull her daughter out of the show 0 
the stories were powerful explorations of the nature of man and of art 1 
a fantastic neighborhood gem 1 
great it was new packaged nice works good no problems and it came in less time then i expected 1 
i only hear garbage for audio 0 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
it had some average acting from the main person and it was a low budget as you clearly can see 0 
setup couldnt have been simpler 1 
my boyfriend and i came here for the first time on a recent trip to vegas and could not have been more pleased with the quality of food and service 1 
this is a great product sure beats using your fingers 1 
the sergeant pepper beef sandwich with auju sauce is an excellent sandwich as well 1 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
this was a poor remake of my best friends wedding 0 
blue ant is easy to use 1 
the story is also both funny and poignant at times 1 
the story is also both funny and poignant at times 1 
if you do go see this movie bring a pillow or a girlfriendboyfriend to keep you occupied through out 0 
there is a brilliant twist ending 1 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
rip off over charge shipping 0 
i wouldnt return 0 
interesting decor 1
