also makes it easier to hold on to 1 
if you plan to use this in a car forget about it 0 
service is also cute 1 
it was an inexpensive piece but i would still have expected better quality 0 
the service was not up to par either 0 
the presentation of the food was awful 0 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
this is not moviemaking 0 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
i would recommend purchasing the jabra jx10 series 2 which works flawlessly with my moto q go figure 1 
but despite these few flaws this case is of exceptional quality and well worth the additional costs of owning an official oem product 1 
so good i am going to have to review this place twice once hereas a tribute to the place and once as a tribute to an event held here last night 1 
this isnt a small family restaurant this is a fine dining establishment 1 
the live music on fridays totally blows 0 
there still are good actors around 1 
much less than the jawbone i was going to replace it with 1 
the script is bad very bad  it contains both cheesiness and unethical joke that you normally see in rated r or nc17 movie 0 
from what my dinner companions told meeverything was very fresh with nice texture and taste 1 
if you are looking for a good quality motorola headset keep looking this isnt it 0 
i was very pleased to see that i could replace my well travled swivel holster for my blackberry flip 1 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
the sweet potato tots were good but the onion rings were perfection or as close as i have had 1 
director paul matthews who also wrotedirected the weak 1995 monster movie grim clearly doesnt know how to pace his films 0 
for people who are first timers in film making i think they did an excellent job 1 
10 out of 10 for both the movie and trilogy 1 
the grilled chicken was so tender and yellow from the saffron seasoning 1 
great price too 1 
also notable is john baileys fine crisp beautifully colored cinematography and the great production design costumes by eiko ishioka who went on to do the memorable costumes for coppolas dracula for which she received a well deserved oscar 1 
it was a good thing that the tickets only cost five dollars because i would be mad if id have paid 750 to see this crap 0 
great choice 1 
great audio 1 
if only someone involved with it knew how to string together narrative 0 
one of my favorite purchases ever 1 
i purchased this and within 2 days it was no longer working 0 
you also cannot take pictures with it in the case because the lense is covered 0 
other than that the leather is nice and soft the fit is very tight the cut out for the face is a good shape 1 
these were so good we ordered them twice 1 
characters are onedimensional even the good guys and especially the bad guys 0 
i was disgusted because i was pretty sure that was human hair 0 
interesting decor 1 
best of luck to the rude and noncustomer service focused new management 0 
however after finally watching this film i realized that not only had i had a closed mind to the brilliance it depicts i also found myself watching it over and over again 1 
i have yet to run this new battery below two bars and thats three days without charging 1 
an awesome new look for fall 2000 1 
if it was to turn my good day feeling into a night of disturbing memories than i guess he succeeded 0 
i really hope the team behind this movie makes more movies and that they will continue to do so in their own some kinda weird style 1 
one more thing i can tolerate political incorrectness very well im all for artistic freedom and suspension of disbelief but the slavic female character was just too much 0 
this is an unbelievable bargain 1 
yeah the movie pretty much sucked 0 
if there is a wind it is completely useless 0 
shes poised and amazing 1 
i bought this phone as a replacement for my startac and have regretted it since 0 
otherwise easy to install and use clear sound 1 
a good time 1 
i recommend this for everyone who loves film movies anythinga work of art 1 
by the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant i was bored and didnt care what happened next and so i switched off 0 
restored my phone to like new performance 1 
works well 1 
sound quality on both end is excellent i use headset to call my wife and ask my wife to use headset to call me 2 1 
what a piece of junk i lose more calls on this phone 0 
the atmosphere was great with a lovely duo of violinists playing songs we requested 1 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
it is super charged up for use as a small hybrid palmtopcameracellphone and excels in those roles 1 
i highly recommend this modest priced cellular phone 1 
the phone takes forever to charge like 2 to 5 hours literally 0 
your servers suck wait correction our server heimer sucked 0 
its this pandering to the audience that sabotages most of his films 0 
it was delicious 1 
mic doesnt work 0 
what a mistake that was 0 
both the hot sour the egg flower soups were absolutely 5 stars 1 
lately they have been extremely nice and helpful on the phone 1 
i cant see how this movie can be an inspiration to anyone to come out or overcome fear and rejection 0 
otherwise easy to install and use clear sound 1 
the awful dialogue and hopeless overacting by everyone who gets shot top off a real waste of space and time 0 
perfect for the ps3 1 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
absolutel junk 0 
what on earth is irons doing in this film 0 
the volume for the ringer is real good you have choices how loud 1 
the movie is terribly boring in places 0 
ive tried several different earpieces for my cell phone and this jabra one is the first one ive found that fits my ear comfortably 1 
unreliable im giving up 0 
you can watch them preparing the delicious food 1 
seriously flavorful delights folks 1 
this movie is greatespecially if you enjoy visual arts 1 
dont do it 0 
the ambience is wonderful and there is music playing 1 
everything about it is fine and reasonable for the price ie 1 
we arent ones to make a scene at restaurants but i just dont get itdefinitely lost the love after this one 0 
either way it sucks 0 
so far it has worked like a charm 1 
about half way through this film i started to dislike it 0 
i have bought this nokia cell phone a few weeks ago and it was a nightmare 0 
its quite simply the highest most superlative form of cinema imaginable 1 
portable and it works 1 
attempting artiness with black white and clever camera angles the movie disappointed became even more ridiculous as the acting was poor and the plot and lines almost nonexistent 0 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
its a piece of crap 0 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
it was absolutely amazing 1 
i have to use the smallest earpieces provided but it stays on pretty well 1 
i recommend this for everyone who loves film movies anythinga work of art 1 
one character is totally annoying with a voice that gives me the feeling of fingernails on a chalkboard 0 
lame would be the best way to describe it 0 
the price was very good and with the free shipping and all it was a good purchase 1 
works well 1 
but it wasnt anything at all just one big yawn 0 
excellent bluetooth headset 1 
everything is appalling 0 
you could drive a semi truck into these holes 0 
and i really did find them funny 1 
they have been around for years and carries the highest quality of antiglare screen protector that i have found to date 1 
by the time the film ended i not only disliked it i despised it 0 
i keep watching it over and over 1 
the battery runs down quickly 0 
the bottowm lineanother worthless cheap gimmick from sprint 0 
rude inconsiderate management 0 
i know this is not like the other restaurants at all something is very off here 0 
one more thing i can tolerate political incorrectness very well im all for artistic freedom and suspension of disbelief but the slavic female character was just too much 0 
first time there and might just be the last 0 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
is pretty funny 1 
if you do go see this movie bring a pillow or a girlfriendboyfriend to keep you occupied through out 0 
my rating just 3 out of 10 0 
small sleek impressive looking practical setup with ample storage in place 1 
it didnt work people can not hear me when i talk 0 
horrible phone 0 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
even in my bmw 3 series which is fairly quiet i have trouble hearing what the other person is saying 0 
their daily specials are always a hit with my group 1 
it was attached to a gas station and that is rarely a good sign 0 
it was so cool 1 
the steak was amazingrge fillet relleno was the best seafood plate i have ever had 1 
however bt headsets are currently not good for real time games like firstperson shooters since the audio delay messes me up 0 
this case seems well made 1 
we have gotten a lot of compliments on it 1 
and i just love the colors 1 
the cow tongue and cheek tacos are amazing 1 
they know how to make them here 1 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
i will continue to come here on ladies night andddd date night highly recommend this place to anyone who is in the area 1 
it plays louder than any other speaker of this size the price is so low that most would think the quality is lacking however its not 1 
trying to make a call on these is an exercise in frustration 0 
not my thing 0 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
its really easy 1 
during several different 2 minute calls i experienced 5 drops and it was in an area that had 5 bars 0 
the service here is fair at best 0 
its a case of so bad it is laughable 0 
the keyboard is a nice compromise between a full qwerty and the basic cell phone number keypad 1 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
overall the film is interesting and thoughtprovoking 1 
saw the movie today and thought it was a good effort good messages for kids 1 
this movie is excellentangel is beautiful and scamp is adorablehis little yelps when hes scaredand the funniest parts are whenscamp is caught under the curtain and when angel and scamp are singing ive never had this feeling beforei totally recommend this movieits coming out on special edition on june 20the cover has scamp on a garbage can and angel underneath the lid 1 
im very disappointed with my decision 0 
if you love authentic mexican food and want a whole bunch of interesting yet delicious meats to choose from you need to try this place 1 
sound quality on both end is excellent i use headset to call my wife and ask my wife to use headset to call me 2 1 
also notable is john baileys fine crisp beautifully colored cinematography and the great production design costumes by eiko ishioka who went on to do the memorable costumes for coppolas dracula for which she received a well deserved oscar 1 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
defective crap 0 
we waited for forty five minutes in vain 0 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
if you love death and decay and shakespears lyrics this is the one 1 
im really disappointed all i have now is a charger that doesnt work 0 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
not good for the money 0 
you need two hands to operate the screenthis software interface is decade old and cannot compete with new software designs 0 
the charger arrived within the promised timeframe but it did not work 0 
i wont be back 0 
i was disgusted because i was pretty sure that was human hair 0 
it was an inexpensive piece but i would still have expected better quality 0 
brilliance indeed 1 
the burger had absolutely no flavor the meat itself was totally bland the burger was overcooked and there was no charcoal flavor 0 
nice leather 1 
comfortable in my hand 1 
i advise you to look out for it 1 
things happen characters personalities change plot twists occur for no real reason other than that script calls for it 0 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
they refuse to refund or replace 0 
this film tries to be a serious and sophisticated thrillerhorror flick and it fails miserably 0 
but its just not funny 0 
i am not a filmmaker nor am i a director but i would hide my head in the sand if id spent whatever amount of money and time on this movie 0 
his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic 1 
returned 8 hours later 0 
i like steiners because its dark and it feels like a bar 1 
i guess it was supposed to be clever twist then shed some light on the situation but it was just stupid 0 
exactly what i wanted 1 
the real killer is the volume and of course it breaking 0 
overall i rate this movie a 10 out of a 110 scale 1 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
the worst one of the series 0 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
the fish is badly made and some of its underwater shots are repeated a thousand times in the film 0 
but the movie makes a lot of serious mistakes 0 
go watch it 1 
first off the reception sucks i have never had more than 2 bars ever 0 
however i needed some better instructions 0 
much better than the other ayce sushi place i went to in vegas 1 
all in all i can assure you ill be back 1 
none of them are engaging or exciting 0 
it was just too horrible 0 
ive bought 5 wired headphones that sound better than these 0 
better than new 1 
a good quality bargain i bought this after i bought a cheapy from big lots that sounded awful and people on the other end couldnt hear me 1 
an amazing finale to possibly the best trilogy of all time 1 
my only complaint is the standard sound volume is a little low even when turned up to 5of 5 0 
food arrived quickly 1 
it looked like a wonderful story 1 
this phone tries very hard to do everything but fails at its very ability to be a phone 0 
the wind and the lion is well written and superbly acted 1 
bad choice 0 
great service and food 1 
this is a witty and delightful adaptation of the dr seuss book brilliantly animated by upas finest and thoroughly deserving of its academy award 1 
i liked it 1 
and the red curry had so much bamboo shoots and wasnt very tasty to me 0 
this item worked great but it broke after 6 months of use 0 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
the acting is fantastic the stories are seamlessly woven together and the dogs are splendid a must rent view or see 1 
the food was outstanding and the prices were very reasonable 1 
i would highly recommend this product 1 
i guess that nobody at the network that aired this dribble watched it before putting it on 0 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
and i really did find them funny 1 
poor construction 0 
sauce was tasteless 0 
worthless product 0 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
if you hate earbugs avoid this phone by all means 0 
im trying to return it for a refund 0 
the worst one of the series 0 
could not get strong enough signal 0 
youll love how thin it is 1 
as always the evening was wonderful and the food delicious 1 
fantastic buy and will get again for whatever my next phone is 1 
level 5 spicy was perfect where spice didnt overwhelm the soup 1 
so anyone near you will hear part of your conversation 0 
i can barely ever hear on it and am constantly saying what 0 
only like 3 or 4 buildings used a couple of locations maybe poor hummh 0 
probably never coming back and wouldnt recommend it 0 
very much disappointed with this company 0 
it is an excellent drama an excellent thriller and an excellent film 1 
in other words the content level of this film is enough to easily fill a dozen other films 1 
so for our enjoyment we get to see them run around play games and be dangerous 1 
im using it with an iriver spinn with case and it fits fine 1 
2 thumbs up 1 
a great way to finish a great 1 
there were several moments in the movie that just didnt need to be there and were excruciatingly slow moving 0 
its one of the movies i need to see whenever it comes on tvnever mind the fact that i already have it memorized 1 
the cast was great 1 
only pros large seating area nice bar area great simple drink menu the best brick oven pizza with homemade dough 1 
the foreigner is not worth one second of your time 0 
the price is reasonable and the service is great 1 
we arent ones to make a scene at restaurants but i just dont get itdefinitely lost the love after this one 0 
the only suspense i was feeling was the frustration at just how retarded the girls were 0 
my rating just 3 out of 10 0 
the performances are not improved by improvisation because the actors now have twice as much to worry about not only whether theyre delivering the line well but whether the line itself is any good 0 
in the span of an hour i had two people exclaim whoa is that the new phone on tv 1 
both of them were truly unbelievably good and i am so glad we went back 1 
i believe that pitch black was done well 1 
this is essentially a communications tool that does not communicate 0 
i love that they put their food in nice plastic containers as opposed to cramming it in little paper takeout boxes 1 
not a weekly haunt but definitely a place to come back to every once in a while 1 
its pretty surprising that this wonderful film was made in 1949 as hollywood generally had its collective heads in the sand concerning black and white issues at that time 1 
the only very disappointing thing was there was no speakerphone 0 
this place is disgusting 0 
1010 1 
i have never had such bland food which surprised me considering the article we read focused so much on their spices and flavor 0 
very disappointed 0 
but this movie really got to me 1 
one character is totally annoying with a voice that gives me the feeling of fingernails on a chalkboard 0 
again no plot at all 0 
at a time when it seems that film animation has been dominated by disneypixars cgi masterpieces it is both refreshing and comforting to know that miyazaki is still relying on traditional handdrawn animation to tell his charming and enchanting stories 1 
i would recommend it 1 
im not really sure how joeys was voted best hot dog in the valley by readers of phoenix magazine 0 
well im satisfied 1 
i never come again 0 
the steak was amazingrge fillet relleno was the best seafood plate i have ever had 1 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
having to humour him just to get by and get through the day was so apt 1 
a week later after i activated it it suddenly died 0 
i guess i should have known that this place would suck because it is inside of the excalibur but i didnt use my common sense 0 
the company shipped my product very promptly and it works well 1 
it is simple to use and i like it 1 
with the originality and freshness of the first movie now spent this remake had little else to offer 0 
there is nothing privileged about workingeating there 0 
not recommended 0 
he is almost unbearable to watch on screen he has little to no charisma and terrible comedic timing 0 
how awesome is that 1 
it really is impressive that the place hasnt closed down 0 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
nice blanket of moz over top but i feel like this was done to cover up the subpar food 1 
i had about two bites and refused to eat anymore 0 
its a piece of crap 0 
this place is amazing 1 
bad fit way too big 0 
just really good so far probably the best bt headset i have ever had 1 
worst foodservice ive had in a while 0 
it holds a charge for a long time is reasonably comfortable under longwearing conditions and the quality of sound is tremendous 1 
i searched the internet and found this one to be the best value 1 
this place is horrible and way overpriced 0 
dont buy it 0 
i have to jiggle the plug to get it to line up right to get decent volume 0 
server did a great job handling our large rowdy table 1 
an italian reviewer called this a small great film and thats right 1 
love this place hits the spot when i want something healthy but not lacking in quantity or flavor 1 
frozen pucks of disgust with some of the worst people behind the register 0 
couldnt figure it out 0 
heres where the movie really pied me off 0 
it rocked my world and is certainly a must see for anyone with no social or physical outlets 1 
so far so good 1 
there is a lot of beautiful places 1 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
this is a bad film with bad writing and good actorsan ugly cartoon crafted by paul haggis for people who cant handle anything but the bold strokes in storytellinga picture painted with crayons 0 
yes i am simplifying things here for the sake of brevity for this really is at the core of the problems with this film it has too much going on without any real fulfilling explanation 0 
phone now holds charge like it did when it was new 1 
so far so good 1 
i really hope the team behind this movie makes more movies and that they will continue to do so in their own some kinda weird style 1 
the chicken wings contained the driest chicken meat i have ever eaten 0 
great phone 1 
so anyone near you will hear part of your conversation 0 
one of the best mexican movies ever and one of the less understood even by mexican themselves no matter how identified the should have felt with it 1 
timely shipment and quality product 1 
its too bad the food is so damn generic 0 
total brunch fail 0 
what a big waste of time 0 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
the movie was so boring that i sometimes found myself occupied peaking in the paper instead of watching never happened during a columbo movie before 0 
battery is terrible 0 
battery has no life 0 
i have only had it for a few weeks but so far so good 1 
needless to say we will never be back here again 0 
battery has no life 0 
this movie is bad 0 
i love this phone it is very handy and has a lot of features 1 
this movie has a cutting edge to it 1 
i recently had problems where i could not stay connected for more than 10 minutes before being disconnected 0 
i can take a little bad service but the food sucks 0 
raw and sublimely moving 1 
john garfield ann revere lilli plmer william conrad canada leeand filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screenjames wong howe 1 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
they will customize your order any way youd like my usual is eggplant with green bean stir fry love it 1 
similarly the delivery man did not say a word of apology when our food was 45 minutes late 0 
i rate this movie 910 1 
good product good seller 1 
we started with the tuna sashimi which was brownish in color and obviously wasnt fresh 0 
it is super charged up for use as a small hybrid palmtopcameracellphone and excels in those roles 1 
it did not work in my cell phone plug i am very up set with the charger 0 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
really really good rice all the time 1 
also great directing and photography 1 
the manager was the worst 0 
not much dialogue not much music the whole film was shot as elaborately and aesthetically like a sculpture 1 
comfortable fit you need your headset to be comfortable for at least an hour at a time if not for an entire day 1 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
the headset fulfills my requirements so i am happy with my purchase 1 
the worst experience ever 0 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
my headset works just peachykeen 1 
you need two hands to operate the screenthis software interface is decade old and cannot compete with new software designs 0 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
i have 23 bars on my cell phone when i am home but you cant not hear anything 0 
a piece of junk that broke after being on my phone for 2 days 0 
the worst was the salmon sashimi 0 
nice docking station for home or work 1 
how awful she is 0 
it didnt charge for me 0 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
well never go again 0 
he was terrible 0 
this pda rocks 1 
the plot such as it is is so derivative and predictable that the ending is like a mercy killing 0 
the warmth it generates is in contrast to its austere backdrop 1 
the pizza selections are good 1 
i wear glasses and it fits fine with them 1 
dont bother go to the store 0 
the bathrooms are clean and the place itself is well decorated 1 
this movie now joins revenge of the boogeyman and zombiez as part of the hellish trinity of horror films 0 
the only consistent thread holding the series together were the amazing performances of leni parker and anita laselva as the two taelons in quiet idealogical conflict 0 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
i did not have any problem with this item and would order it again if needed 1 
mark my words this is one of those cult films like evil dead 2 or phantasm that people will still be discovering and falling in love with 20 30 40 years down the line 1 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
it makes very strange ticking noises before it ends the call 0 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
i love this bluetooth 1 
comes with a strong light that you can use to light up your camera shots and even flash sos signals seriously 1 
i will be back many times soon 1 
it also took her forever to bring us the check when we asked for it 0 
if you are razr owneryou must have this 1 
see it 1 
waitress was a little slow in service 0 
the food is about on par with dennys which is to say not good at all 0 
it has northern humour and positive about the community it represents 1 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
excellent short film 1 
the movie was so boring that i sometimes found myself occupied peaking in the paper instead of watching never happened during a columbo movie before 0 
but it picked up speed and got right to the point 1 
my husband said she was very rude did not even apologize for the bad food or anything 0 
the service was a bit lacking 0 
you truly take this journey through the eyes and soul of a child 1 
nice ambiance 1 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
the explosion of the gas tanks at the end was just as awful 0 
i am not a filmmaker nor am i a director but i would hide my head in the sand if id spent whatever amount of money and time on this movie 0 
we recently witnessed her poor quality of management towards other guests as well 0 
its welldesigned and very sharp the blue is a very nice color 1 
is pretty funny 1 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
everything on the menu is terrific and we were also thrilled that they made amazing accommodations for our vegetarian daughter 1 
lasted one day and then blew up 0 
customer service was terrible 0 
my phone doesnt slide around my car now and the grip prevents my phone from slipping out of my hand 1 
if you stay in vegas you must get breakfast here at least once 1 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
cheap but hey it works was pleasantly suprised given the low cost of this item 1 
customer service was terrible 0 
you wont be disappointed 1 
the plot well i said id let that one go 0 
hard to judge whether these sides were good because we were grossed out by the melted styrofoam and didnt want to eat it for fear of getting sick 0 
plus it was wellpaced and suited its relatively short run time 1 
classywarm atmosphere fun and fresh appetizers succulent steaks baseball steak 1 
good prices 1 
the grilled chicken was so tender and yellow from the saffron seasoning 1 
the story unfolds in 18th century jutland and the use of period music played on period instruments is just one more fine touch 1 
this movie is excellentangel is beautiful and scamp is adorablehis little yelps when hes scaredand the funniest parts are whenscamp is caught under the curtain and when angel and scamp are singing ive never had this feeling beforei totally recommend this movieits coming out on special edition on june 20the cover has scamp on a garbage can and angel underneath the lid 1 
which are small and not worth the price 0 
very convenient since we were staying at the mgm 1 
great software for motorolas 1 
this film offers many delights and surprises 1 
its too bad the food is so damn generic 0 
but now i was completely grossed out 0 
dont buy it 0 
there is however some pretty good acting at least for this type of film 1 
ive also had problems with the phone reading the memory card in which i always turn it on and then off again 0 
i am so pleased to know such a modern day genius is out there letting is passion for art drive him and taking us as an audience with him 1 
all it took was one drop from about 6 inches above the kitchen counter and it was crackedi am not impressed and i am not laughing 0 
the only possible way this movie could be redeemed would be as mst3k fodder 0 
they have been around for years and carries the highest quality of antiglare screen protector that i have found to date 1 
these products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet 0 
the food was delicious our bartender was attentive and personable and we got a great deal 1 
my husband said she was very rude did not even apologize for the bad food or anything 0 
you cant beat that 1 
the price was very good and with the free shipping and all it was a good purchase 1 
there is no plot here to keep you going in the first place 0 
very disappointed in accessoryone 0 
the entire audience applauded at the conclusion of the film 1 
i swung in to give them a try but was deeply disappointed 0 
the very idea of it was lame take a minor character from a mediocre pg13 film and make a complete nonsequel while changing its tone to a pgrated family movie 0 
disappointing accessory from a good manufacturer 0 
generous portions and great taste 1 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
fantastic buy and will get again for whatever my next phone is 1 
i thought errol flynn was brilliant as custer and has since become my favourite actor 1 
blue ant is easy to use 1 
utterly without merit on any level this is akin to torture 0 
if it was to turn my good day feeling into a night of disturbing memories than i guess he succeeded 0 
both do good jobs and are quite amusing 1 
its quite simply the highest most superlative form of cinema imaginable 1 
bland and flavorless is a good way of describing the barely tepid meat 0 
they could be used as exemplars for any set designer 1 
an hour seriously 0 
good service very clean and inexpensive to boot 1 
the scenes are often funny and occasionally touching as the characters evaluate their lives and where they are going 1 
im in az all the time and now have my new spot 1 
would come back again if i had a sushi craving while in vegas 1 
we thought youd have to venture further away to get good sushi but this place really hit the spot that night 1 
all it took was one drop from about 6 inches above the kitchen counter and it was crackedi am not impressed and i am not laughing 0 
and those baby owls were adorable 1 
the acting was decidely wooden though no worse than a period universal b movie 0 
disappointment i hate anything that goes in my ear 0 
terrible service 0 
10 out of 10 stars 1 
it features an outlandish array of memorable psychotic but lovable nuts 1 
call me a nut but i think this is one of the best movies ever 1 
i have had mine for about a year and this christmas i bought some for the rest of the family 1 
that movie was bad 0 
the accompanied software is almost brilliant 1 
great phone 1 
this early film from future goremeister lucio fulci is a very good addition to the giallo subgenre 1 
give this one a look 1 
food was below average 0 
the basic premise is wasted since it is sidelined by the inexplicable focus on the documentary crew 0 
the lines the cuts the audio everything is wrong 0 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
the wind and the lion is well written and superbly acted 1 
the management is rude 0 
was not happy 0 
the movie is terribly boring in places 0 
definitely a turn off for me i doubt ill be back unless someone else is buying 0 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
absolutely great 1 
what a waste 0 
i really wanted the plantronics 510 to be the right one but it has too many issues for methe good 0 
i am glad i purchased it 1 
people who like european films and art movies will like this movie 1 
wont ever go here again 0 
i could not stand to even watch it for very long for fear of losing iq 0 
disappointing accessory from a good manufacturer 0 
we made the drive all the way from north scottsdale and i was not one bit disappointed 1 
good quality 1 
excellent bluetooth headset 1 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
i even dropped this phone into a stream and it was submerged for 15 seconds and it still works great 1 
definitely a bargain 1 
im not eating here 0 
we waited for forty five minutes in vain 0 
there were too many close ups 0 
we arent ones to make a scene at restaurants but i just dont get itdefinitely lost the love after this one 0 
so bad 0 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
both the hot sour the egg flower soups were absolutely 5 stars 1 
im trying to return it for a refund 0 
the film has great actors a master director a significant themeat least a wouldbe significant theme undertone of fifties existential worldweariness aerial scenes that ought to have thrilled both senses and imagination and characters about which one might deeply care 1 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
this film and i use that word loosely is an insult to the moviegoing public 0 
thank you for wasting my money 0 
i am also very happy with the price 1 
it probably would have been better if the director hadnt spent most of the movie showcasing his own art work which really isnt that noteworthy 0 
waitress was good though 1 
appetite instantly gone 0 
i get absolutely horrible reception in my apartment where with other phones i have not had this problem 0 
the chicken dishes are ok the beef is like shoe leather 0 
excellent product 1 
we walked away stuffed and happy about our first vegas buffet experience 1 
doesnt hold charge 0 
i have to jiggle the plug to get it to line up right to get decent volume 0 
this place is not worth your time let alone vegas 0 
interesting decor 1 
one more thing i can tolerate political incorrectness very well im all for artistic freedom and suspension of disbelief but the slavic female character was just too much 0 
first off the reception sucks i have never had more than 2 bars ever 0 
all in all id expected a better consumer experience from motorola 0 
this is a chilly unremarkable movie about an author livingworking in a chilly abstruse culture 0 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
not good for the money 0 
even when the women finally show up there is no sign of improvement the most expected things happen and by the time the film is over you might be far asleep 0 
much more interesting more action more suspense and less of the unneeded controversy 1 
i dont have to be an accountant to know im getting screwed 0 
lots of holes in the script 0 
then i exchanged for the same phone even that had the same problem 0 
all it took was one drop from about 6 inches above the kitchen counter and it was crackedi am not impressed and i am not laughing 0 
sound quality on both end is excellent i use headset to call my wife and ask my wife to use headset to call me 2 1 
you cant go wrong with any of the food here 1 
by the time the film ended i not only disliked it i despised it 0 
i highly recommend these and encourage people to give them a try 1 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
started watching this but didnt believe in any of the characters 0 
tasted like dirt 0 
i was very excited to get this headset because i thought it was really cute 1 
im probably one of the few people to ever go to ians and not like it 0 
secondly hitchcock pretty much perfected the thriller and chase movie 1 
i dont understand how this garbage got on the shelves of the movie store its not even a real movie 0 
i was amazed at the quick arrival of the two original lg cell phone batteries and and at a fraction of the price 1 
dont buy it 0 
this is was due to the fact that it took 20 minutes to be acknowledged then another 35 minutes to get our foodand they kept forgetting things 0 
i could not stand to even watch it for very long for fear of losing iq 0 
because both ears are occupied background is not distracting at all 1 
however the keypads are so tinny that i sometimes reach the wrong buttons 0 
the only downside is the service 0 
it is just the sort of pap that is screened in the afternoon to punish the unemployed for not having jobs 0 
the cg opening sequence in space looked like it could have been created on microsoft slideshow for gods sake 0 
its not what it says it is 0 
again no plot at all 0 
my husband said she was very rude did not even apologize for the bad food or anything 0 
the new characters werent all that memorable and i found myself forgetting who was who 0 
all of the main players are mesmerising 1 
my fella got the huevos rancheros and they didnt look too appealing 0 
the wind and the lion is well written and superbly acted 1 
iam very pleased with my purchase 1 
the real disappointment was our waiter 0 
sprint charges for this service 0 
the phone loads super 1 
an excellent new restaurant by an experienced frenchman 1 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
kind of hard to mess up a steak but they did 0 
great audio 1 
what a disappointment 0 
eew this location needs a complete overhaul 0 
but then they came back cold 0 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
this place is handsdown one of the best places to eat in the phoenix metro area 1 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
very happy with this product 1 
better than new 1 
phone falls out easily 0 
i recommend igo to anyone with different brand cell phonesmp3 players in the family 1 
it presents a idyllic yet serious portrayal of the ups and downs of the characters lives 1 
the update procedure is difficult and cumbersome 0 
it looses connection to the phone even when it is within a couple feet between the two 0 
disappointed with battery 0 
my sister has one also and she loves it 1 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
i know he was a contract player with little control over his scripts but the acting was as bad as the script 0 
a great way to finish a great 1 
at least think to refill my water before i struggle to wave you over for 10 minutes 0 
the folks at otto always make us feel so welcome and special 1 
it is wonderful and inspiring to watch and i hope that it gets released again on to video or dvd 1 
painful on the ear 0 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
worst customer service ever 0 
the phone crashed completely and now i have to get it replaced 0 
the script is bad very bad  it contains both cheesiness and unethical joke that you normally see in rated r or nc17 movie 0 
one of my favorite purchases ever 1 
i never come again 0 
rating 010 grade z note the show is so bad that even mother of the cast pull her daughter out of the show 0 
i totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is 1 
every time he opened his mouth you expect to hear you see kids pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show 0 
the roast beef sandwich tasted really good 1 
this is the place where i first had pho and it was amazing 1 
an hour and a half i wish i could bring back 0 
2 thumbs up to this seller 1 
brilliance indeed 1 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
i love this device 1 
the service was extremely slow 0 
they brought a fresh batch of fries and i was thinking yay something warm but no 0 
disappointed 0 
good works fine 1 
great it was new packaged nice works good no problems and it came in less time then i expected 1 
this game rocks 1 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
the fries were not hot and neither was my burger 0 
it is just the sort of pap that is screened in the afternoon to punish the unemployed for not having jobs 0 
not much seafood and like 5 strings of pasta at the bottom 0 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
the movie is not completely perfect but titta di girolamo will stay with you for a long time after the vision of the movie 1 
i totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is 1 
really ugly 0 
the bottowm lineanother worthless cheap gimmick from sprint 0 
very disappointed 0 
that just screams legit in my booksomethats also pretty rare here in vegas 1 
and then tragedy struck 0 
the only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port irda 0 
im happy about this purchase good quality and low price 1 
overall i rate this movie a 10 out of a 110 scale 1 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
nice solid keyboard 1 
now we were chosen to be tortured with this disgusting piece of blatant american propaganda 0 
we enjoy their pizza and brunch 1 
problem is that the ear loops are made of weak material and break easily 0 
this is essentially a communications tool that does not communicate 0 
so bad 0 
however after about a year the fliptop started to get loose and wobbly and eventually my screen went black and i couldnt receive and place calls 0 
my sashimi was poor quality being soggy and tasteless 0 
food was great and so was the serivce 1 
ray charles is legendary 1 
my boyfriend tried the mediterranean chicken salad and fell in love 1 
dessert panna cotta was amazing 1 
do not make the same mistake as me 0 
but the premise of the film was so ridiculous that the president of the us 0 
the nokia ca42 usb cable did not work with my phone 0 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
battery life is also great 1 
no shifting no bubbling no peeling not even a scratch nothingi couldnt be more happier with my new one for the droid 1 
its also great to see that renowned silent screenwriter frances marion hasnt missed a step going from silent to sound 1 
it was not good 0 
defective crap 0 
its still wild stuff though and is highly recommended to fans of giallo cinema 1 
overall i am psyched to have a phone which has all my appointments and contacts in and gets great reception 1 
i even dropped this phone into a stream and it was submerged for 15 seconds and it still works great 1 
bad choice 0 
personally i think it shows that people should learn to find a compromise them self without involving other people into issue 1 
lets start with all the problemsthe acting especially from the lead professor was very very bad 0 
its very attractive and appears to be of good quality 1 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
ill give this film 10 out of 10 1 
we definately enjoyed ourselves 1 
because both ears are occupied background is not distracting at all 1 
he really didnt seem to want to be hosting his voiceovers were monotonous didnt get involved with the guests 0 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
the vegetables are so fresh and the sauce feels like authentic thai 1 
cant say enough good things about this place 1 
using all earpieces left or right this thing will not stay on my ear 0 
it worked very well 1 
gotta love those closeups of slimy drooling teeth 1 
its welldesigned and very sharp the blue is a very nice color 1 
it was pretty gross 0 
there were several moments in the movie that just didnt need to be there and were excruciatingly slow moving 0 
it was absolutely amazing 1 
this place has it 1 
go watch it 1 
there is simply no excuse for something this poorly done 0 
characters are onedimensional even the good guys and especially the bad guys 0 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
alexander nevsky is a great film 1 
kind of hard to mess up a steak but they did 0 
the lighting is just dark enough to set the mood 1 
hes a national treasure 1 
im trying to return it for a refund 0 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
it is a joy to use 1 
great hands free device 1 
my sashimi was poor quality being soggy and tasteless 0 
here in the wind and the lion we see a wonderful rendering of americas own imperial age 1 
this item is fantastic and works perfectly 1 
it deserves strong love 1 
i gave it 5 stars because of the sound quality 1 
i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
if you want a sandwich just go to any firehouse 1 
the scenes with the ohsomature neighbourgirl are a misplace 0 
everything was good and tasty 1 
the potatoes were great and so was the biscuit 1 
its welldesigned and very sharp the blue is a very nice color 1 
food was really good and i got full petty fast 1 
how awesome is that 1 
i recommend this for everyone who loves film movies anythinga work of art 1 
we ordered some old classics and some new dishes after going there a few times and were sorely disappointed with everything 0 
the ri style calamari was a joke 0 
i hate to disagree with my fellow yelpers but my husband and i were so disappointed with this place 0 
from here on the widmark character turns unintentionally comical 0 
totally different with loads of understatement and black comedy this is a film few get to see but those who do will remember it 1 
good prices 1 
i was deeply impressed with the character he played 1 
with great sound effects and impressive special effects i cant recommend this movie enough 1 
i was mortified 0 
their regular toasted bread was equally satisfying with the occasional pats of butter mmmm 1 
this film tries to be a serious and sophisticated thrillerhorror flick and it fails miserably 0 
works well 1 
i do think tom hanks is a good actor 1 
will go back next trip out 1 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
the phone is sturdy and waterproof 1 
the bottowm lineanother worthless cheap gimmick from sprint 0 
i would have casted her in that role after ready the script 1 
an hour seriously 0 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
nine out of ten for a truly lovely film 1 
excellent starter wireless headset 0 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
it presents a idyllic yet serious portrayal of the ups and downs of the characters lives 1 
for 40 bucks a head i really expect better food 0 
great place to relax and have an awesome burger and beer 1 
great phone 1 
i give wirefly 1 stari will contact cingularatt and inform them of this practice 0 
the aerial scenes were welldone 1 
dont go here 0 
dont miss it 1 
i especially love the long battery life 1 
sucked most of the stuff does not work with my phone 0 
it is an excellent drama an excellent thriller and an excellent film 1 
will definitely be back 1 
a very charming film with wonderful sentiment and heart 1 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
and i just love the colors 1 
i kept catching the cable on the seat and i had to pull the phone out to turn it on an off 0 
nice quality build unlike some cheap s out there 1 
2 thumbs up 1 
sound quality on both end is excellent i use headset to call my wife and ask my wife to use headset to call me 2 1 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
i love being able to use one headset for both by landline and cell 1 
it deserves strong love 1 
damian is so talented and versatile in so many ways of writing and portraying different characters on screen 1 
im super pissd 0 
due to this happening on every call i was forced to stop using this headset 0 
perfect for the ps3 1 
the food is rich so order accordingly 1 
if you love death and decay and shakespears lyrics this is the one 1 
iam very pleased with my purchase 1 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
this movie is greatespecially if you enjoy visual arts 1 
here in the wind and the lion we see a wonderful rendering of americas own imperial age 1 
dee snider just plain sucks 0 
overpriced for what you are getting 0 
the films dialogue is natural real to life 1 
both of the egg rolls were fantastic 1 
essentially you can forget microsofts tech support 0 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
great pork sandwich 1 
car charger as well as ac charger are included to make sure you never run out of juicehighy recommended 1 
im using it with an iriver spinn with case and it fits fine 1 
the range is very decent ive been able to roam around my house with the phone in the living room with no receptionsound quality issues 1 
it was so bad i had lost the heart to finish it 0 
great food and service huge portions and they give a military discount 1 
the plot has more holes than a pair of fishnet stockings and the direction and editing is astonishingly ham fisted 0 
i love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it 1 
not worth it 0 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
never been to hard rock casino before will never ever step forward in it again 0 
great movie 1 
nothing at all to recommend 0 
stopped by during the late may bank holiday off rick steve recommendation and loved it 1 
the telephone repair man was really funny and his reactions to the nuts and bitchy boss were truly genuine 1 
it wasnt busy either also the building was freezing cold 0 
that was done in the second movie 0 
it showed exactly how the government and the scientist argued for humanity and the reasons of the gadget 1 
i did not have any problem with this item and would order it again if needed 1 
the atmosphere was great with a lovely duo of violinists playing songs we requested 1 
excellent product 1 
however after seeing the short again after about 25 years i was amazed at how timeless the film actually is 1 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
the worst sappiest dialogue i could go on and on 0 
good food good service 1 
why was this film made 0 
easy to use 1 
the food is very good for your typical bar food 1 
i had heard good things about this place but it exceeding every hope i could have dreamed of 1 
we made the drive all the way from north scottsdale and i was not one bit disappointed 1 
it defeats the purpose of a bluetooth headset 0 
the two main characters may be two of the most believable children i ever saw put on screen 1 
because both ears are occupied background is not distracting at all 1 
the cable looks so thin and flimsy it is scary 0 
the croutons also taste homemade which is an extra plus 1 
i was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar not only because the quality is great but the service is fast and the food impeccable 1 
dont waste your money 0 
we were promptly greeted and seated 1 
the best place to go for a tasty bowl of pho 1 
down the drain because of a weak snap 0 
definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly will return next time im in vegas 1 
poor sound quality 0 
gets a signal when other verizon phones wont 1 
it is a very well acted and done tv movie 1 
service was exceptional and food was a good as all the reviews 1 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
overall i wasnt very impressed with noca 0 
i really wanted the plantronics 510 to be the right one but it has too many issues for methe good 0 
never been to hard rock casino before will never ever step forward in it again 0 
in my house i was getting dropped coverage upstairs and no coverage in my basement 0 
say bye bye to your tip lady 0 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
but its just not funny 0 
the server was very negligent of our needs and made us feel very unwelcome i would not suggest this place 0 
worked perfectly 1 
it doesnt work in europe or asia 0 
piece of junk 0 
this phone is slim and light and the display is beautiful 1 
but despite these few flaws this case is of exceptional quality and well worth the additional costs of owning an official oem product 1 
i never walked out of a movie faster 0 
avoid this establishment 0 
they refuse to refund or replace 0 
they never brought a salad we asked for 0 
that movie was bad 0 
i wont spoil it but the ending in pretty amazing 1 
it didnt work people can not hear me when i talk 0 
this place is handsdown one of the best places to eat in the phoenix metro area 1 
it feels poorly constructed the menus are difficult to navigate and the buttons are so recessed that it is difficult to push them 0 
it also took her forever to bring us the check when we asked for it 0 
phone falls out easily 0 
however after about a year the fliptop started to get loose and wobbly and eventually my screen went black and i couldnt receive and place calls 0 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
its just adorable seeing mickey playing turkey in the straw in a highly imaginative if occasionally cruel way 1 
excellent hands free tool 1 
this is a great place to eat 1 
to my disbelief each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods i have ever tasted 0 
the phone crashed completely and now i have to get it replaced 0 
for people who are first timers in film making i think they did an excellent job 1 
ive had this for nearly 2 years and it has worked great for me 1 
i have two more years left in this contract and i hate this phone 0 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
the calls drop the phone comes on and off at will the screen goes black and the worst of all it stops ringing intermittently 0 
the selection of food was not the best 0 
the incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film 1 
poor talk time performance 0 
the things that the four kids get themselves into is absolutely hilarious to watch 1 
kind of flops around 0 
great pizza and salads 1 
good service very clean and inexpensive to boot 1 
you can watch them preparing the delicious food 1 
will definitely be back 1 
an hour seriously 0 
it presents a idyllic yet serious portrayal of the ups and downs of the characters lives 1 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
the classic maine lobster roll was fantastic 1 
and the accents are absolutely abysmal 0 
does not fit 0 
i rather enjoyed it 1 
also the area where my unit broke im not too fond of the magnetic strap 0 
great pizza and salads 1 
at around 4 pm i bought it at around 8pm i started to watch at around 815pm i fast forwarded the remaining film to see if there was anything left watchable for a human being with a brain but there wasnt 0 
ample portions and good prices 1 
unfortunately cover girl is an example of how hollywood used to exploit women for financial gain 0 
only like 3 or 4 buildings used a couple of locations maybe poor hummh 0 
the food was very good 1 
the jabra eargels fit my ears very well 1 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
love this place hits the spot when i want something healthy but not lacking in quantity or flavor 1 
lucy bell is so much higher than this crap and for her to sink this low is quite depressing 0 
by the time the film ended i not only disliked it i despised it 0 
needless to say we will never be back here again 0 
i highly recommend this movie for anyone interested in art poetry theater politics or japanese history 1 
highly recommend for any one who has a blue tooth phone 1 
i love the look and feel of samsung flipphones 1 
not recommended 0 
really pleased with this product so far 1 
service was exceptional and food was a good as all the reviews 1 
this is a bad film with bad writing and good actorsan ugly cartoon crafted by paul haggis for people who cant handle anything but the bold strokes in storytellinga picture painted with crayons 0 
no plot whatsoever 0 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
well just if you keep thinking how bad it is 0 
it is worth the drive 1 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
it was a huge awkward 15lb piece of cow that was 34ths gristle and fat 0 
i love this phone it is very handy and has a lot of features 1 
we walked away stuffed and happy about our first vegas buffet experience 1 
they are so easy to love but even more easy to identify with 1 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
there is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again 0 
as many people complained i found this headsets microphone was very weak 0 
ive only had my bluetooth for a few weeks but i really like it 1 
jawbone era is awesome too 1 
this place is amazing 1 
i like steiners because its dark and it feels like a bar 1 
we would recommend these to others 1 
that company is a joke 0 
loved itfriendly servers great food wonderful and imaginative menu 1 
the mic is great 1 
everything is appalling 0 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
generous portions and great taste 1 
weird vibe from owners 0 
i felt insulted and disrespected how could you talk and judge another human being like that 0 
the plot simply rumbles on like a machine desperately depending on the addition of new scenes 0 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
the burger i got the gold standard a 17 burger and was kind of disappointed 0 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
the meat was pretty dry i had the sliced brisket and pulled pork 0 
bluetooth range is good a few days ago i left my phone in the trunk got a call and carried the conversation without a hitch 1 
five star plus plus 1 
this is an excellent film 1 
the acting sucked 0 
i ordered the lemon raspberry ice cocktail which was also incredible 1 
this item is fantastic and works perfectly 1 
this does not fit the palm tungsten e2 and it broke the first time i tried to plug it in 0 
victor mclaglen was even bad and brian donlevy was almost unrecognizable 0 
this is a great product sure beats using your fingers 1 
perabo has a nice energy level and is obviously very comfortable in front of a camera 1 
this second appearance of mickey mouse following the silent plane crazy earlier that year is probably his most famous filmmostly because it was so groundbreaking 1 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
i could not understand what kind of idiot would produce this mess in the first place not to mention several season 0 
predictable but not a bad watch 1 
generally it just lacked imagination 0 
left very frustrated 0 
there are the usual hitchcock logic flaws 0 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
i am also very happy with the price 1 
i have been very happy with the 510 and have had no complaints from any one regarding my sound quality on their end 1 
i give wirefly 1 stari will contact cingularatt and inform them of this practice 0 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
battery life is also great 1 
the place was fairly clean but the food simply wasnt worth it 0 
that being said for a phone the camera is very nice many cool effects to play with and video is decent as well 1 
this is a really fantastic thai restaurant which is definitely worth a visit 1 
waited and waited and waited 0 
so i am here to warn youdo not rent this movie it is the dumbest thing you have never seen 0 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
dont buy it 0 
the plot is nonsense that doesnt interest in the slightest way or have any uniqueness to it 0 
best breakfast buffet 1 
conclusion very filling meals 1 
this is a really fantastic thai restaurant which is definitely worth a visit 1 
great product for the price 1 
the shrimp tender and moist 1 
food was really boring 0 
i like design and look of jabra behing the ear headsets and 5020 is pretty comfortible to wear 24 hours a day without pain in the ear 1 
but this movie is definitely a below average rent 0 
kind of hard to mess up a steak but they did 0 
audio quality is poor very poor 0 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
in my house i was getting dropped coverage upstairs and no coverage in my basement 0 
the performances are not improved by improvisation because the actors now have twice as much to worry about not only whether theyre delivering the line well but whether the line itself is any good 0 
this movie now joins revenge of the boogeyman and zombiez as part of the hellish trinity of horror films 0 
what on earth is irons doing in this film 0 
victor mclaglen was even bad and brian donlevy was almost unrecognizable 0 
the live music on fridays totally blows 0 
its really easy 1 
110 and only because there is no setting for 010 0 
the only thing i wasnt too crazy about was their guacamole as i dont like it puréed 0 
att is not clear sound is very distorted and you have to yell when you talk 0 
i guess i liked the details of his dysfunctionhe was believable 1 
director paul matthews who also wrotedirected the weak 1995 monster movie grim clearly doesnt know how to pace his films 0 
it also took her forever to bring us the check when we asked for it 0 
so anyone near you will hear part of your conversation 0 
come hungry leave happy and stuffed 1 
i got it because it was so small and adorable 1 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
the point is the journey a journey that touches every member of the family 1 
highly entertaining at all angles 1 
they have horrible attitudes towards customers and talk down to each one when customers dont enjoy their food 0 
essentially you can forget microsofts tech support 0 
the telephone repair man was really funny and his reactions to the nuts and bitchy boss were truly genuine 1 
i like steiners because its dark and it feels like a bar 1 
and generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode 0 
all the pretty pictures in the world cannot make up for a piece of work that is flawed at the core 0 
his performance as awarded was stunning 1 
unfortunately it was not good 0 
food was really good and i got full petty fast 1 
the place was fairly clean but the food simply wasnt worth it 0 
i would have casted her in that role after ready the script 1 
by the time the film ended i not only disliked it i despised it 0 
after one bite i was hooked 1 
this fixes all the problems 1 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
again no plot at all 0 
enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film 1 
worst hour and a half of my lifeoh my gosh 0 
the food was terrible 0 
i would avoid this place if you are staying in the mirage 0 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
it is a joy to use 1 
this is the place where i first had pho and it was amazing 1 
the film is way too long 0 
comfortable fit you need your headset to be comfortable for at least an hour at a time if not for an entire day 1 
the service was extremely slow 0 
so i basically threw my money out the window for nothing 0 
in the span of an hour i had two people exclaim whoa is that the new phone on tv 1 
i do not know if this was emilio estevezs directorial debut but the pacing the interplay and development of the characters as well as some clever camera work surrounding the character estevez plays all suggest a natural eye 1 
so good i am going to have to review this place twice once hereas a tribute to the place and once as a tribute to an event held here last night 1 
about 30 minutes of footage is wasted to show mediocre elderly actors awkwardly babbling overwrought pseudosatanic gibberish corny enough to make a teen goth blush almost always in olde english and sometimes in latin that may or may not be made up words 0 
i recently had problems where i could not stay connected for more than 10 minutes before being disconnected 0 
and the rest of it just sits there being awful with soldiers singing songs about the masculinity they pledge themselves to hairsplitting about purity the admiration of swords etc 0 
it really is impressive that the place hasnt closed down 0 
best headset ever 1 
it doesnt work in europe or asia 0 
also the story and acting were weak 0 
i am so pleased to know such a modern day genius is out there letting is passion for art drive him and taking us as an audience with him 1 
it wasnt busy either also the building was freezing cold 0 
the movie showed a lot of florida at its best made it look very appealing 1 
great place fo take out or eat in 1 
this is an excellent film 1 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
i was able to do voice dialing in the car with no problem 1 
great product 1 
this is high adventure at its best 1 
phone falls out easily 0 
i dont each much pasta but i love the homemade hand made pastas and thin pizzas here 1 
i promise they wont disappoint 1 
alexander nevsky is a great film 1 
very bad experience 0 
as always the evening was wonderful and the food delicious 1 
i ordered the voodoo pasta and it was the first time id had really excellent pasta since going gluten free several years ago 1 
rating 010 grade z note the show is so bad that even mother of the cast pull her daughter out of the show 0 
awesome device 1 
it is not good 0 
waaaaaayyyyyyyyyy over rated is all i am saying 0 
overall i was not impressed and would not go back 0 
i believe the screenwriter did a good job of tying up the loose ends 1 
definitely will come back here again 1 
great earpiece 1 
have been going since 2007 and every meal has been awesome 1 
i could not recommend these more 0 
i was not happy with this item 0 
well im satisfied 1 
due to this happening on every call i was forced to stop using this headset 0 
good works fine 1 
i am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this 1 
when i opened the sandwich i was impressed but not in a good way 0 
you have to hold the phone at a particular angle for the other party to hear you clearly 0 
i get absolutely horrible reception in my apartment where with other phones i have not had this problem 0 
performed awful muffled tinny incoming sound and severe echo for those on the other end of the call 0 
conclusion i loved it 1 
you cant go wrong with any of the food here 1 
the food is rich so order accordingly 1 
saw the movie today and thought it was a good effort good messages for kids 1 
very bad performance plays angela bennett a computer expert who is at home all the time 0 
i am very happy 1 
the bartender was also nice 1 
the headsets are easy to use and everyone loves them 1 
it is an excellent drama an excellent thriller and an excellent film 1 
trying to make a call on these is an exercise in frustration 0 
i guess maybe we went on an off night but it was disgraceful 0 
my fiancé and i came in the middle of the day and we were greeted and seated right away 1 
not much seafood and like 5 strings of pasta at the bottom 0 
its a campy sort of film thats a joy to watch 1 
my drink was never empty and he made some really great menu suggestions 1 
i was totally fascinated by the music the dancing everything 1 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
if you hate earbugs avoid this phone by all means 0 
none of the new ones have ever quite worked properly 0 
the movie is littered with overt racial slurs towards the black cast members and in return the whites are depicted as morons and boobs 0 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
in fact i liked it better than interview with a vampire and i liked this lestat stuart townsend better than cruises attempt 1 
this is one of the best movies out there that shows such strong sibling bond for each other 1 
see it 1 
after trying many many handsfree gadgets this is the one that finally works well 1 
cant get the software to work with my computer 0 
did not like at all 0 
delicious nyc bagels good selections of cream cheese real lox with capers even 1 
this is an outstanding little restaurant with some of the best food i have ever tasted 1 
excellent performance 1 
stopped by during the late may bank holiday off rick steve recommendation and loved it 1 
it was absolutely amazing 1 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
those burgers were amazing 1 
not recommended 0 
the chips that came out were dripping with grease and mostly not edible 0 
razr battery good buy 1 
and i really did find them funny 1 
must have been an off night at this place 0 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
yes its that bad 0 
the handsfree part works fine but then the car tries to download the address book and the treo rebootsoverall i still rate this device high 1 
gets a signal when other verizon phones wont 1 
i couldnt think of a better way to end the film but a smile on my face great way to wrap up an amazing film and trilogy 1 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
the lines the cuts the audio everything is wrong 0 
if you are razr owneryou must have this 1 
and those baby owls were adorable 1 
it was a very superficial movie and it gave me the feeling that i was watching play rather than a film 0 
the casting is also horrible cause all you see is a really really bad actors period 0 
it really is impressive that the place hasnt closed down 0 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
after one bite i was hooked 1 
plus it was wellpaced and suited its relatively short run time 1 
very disappointed in accessoryone 0 
also the story and acting were weak 0 
oh and i forgot to also mention the weird color effect it has on your phone 0 
i had the chicken pho and it tasted very bland 0 
no plot whatsoever 0 
this phone tries very hard to do everything but fails at its very ability to be a phone 0 
there was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters 0 
not sure who was more lost the flat characters or the audience nearly half of whom walked out 0 
could not get strong enough signal 0 
you share general loewenhielms exquisite joy in his partaking of the cailles en sarcophage even though you are just watching a movie but you do wish for just a small sample to savor 1 
im in az all the time and now have my new spot 1 
big disappointment with calendar sync 0 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
if that bug never showed up i would have given a 4 for sure but on the other side of the wall where this bug was climbing was the kitchen 0 
enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film 1 
leopard print is wonderfully wild 1 
i have had mine for about a year and this christmas i bought some for the rest of the family 1 
the story line is just awful 0 
terrible my car will not accept this cassette 0 
think it over when you plan to own this onethis sure is the last moto phone for me 0 
bluetooth range is good a few days ago i left my phone in the trunk got a call and carried the conversation without a hitch 1 
hands down my favorite italian restaurant 1 
they never brought a salad we asked for 0 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
excellent phone 1 
it is very educational for children 1 to 8 years old 1 
my sanyo has survived dozens of drops on blacktop without ill effect 1 
i think it was robert ryans best film because he portrayed someone like my father and he was a schizophrenic in real lifemy father although he never murdered anyone but was affected more so during the second world war which made him worse 1 
worst ever 0 
id advise anyone to go and see it 1 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
there is no plot here to keep you going in the first place 0 
i own a jabra earset and was very happy with it but the sound quality especially outgoing on this is better 1 
unfortunately the ability to actually know you are receiving a call is a rather important feature and this phone is pitiful in that respect 0 
if youre not familiar check it out 1 
nice case feels good in your hands 1 
he is one of my favourite directors and one of the most talented directors in the history of cinema 1 
it feels poorly constructed the menus are difficult to navigate and the buttons are so recessed that it is difficult to push them 0 
i highly recommend this movie for anyone interested in art poetry theater politics or japanese history 1 
the yellowtail carpaccio was melt in your mouth fresh 1 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
i did not have any problem with this item and would order it again if needed 1 
adapter does not provide enough charging current 0 
it looses connection to the phone even when it is within a couple feet between the two 0 
worst phone ever 0 
the only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port irda 0 
the range is very decent ive been able to roam around my house with the phone in the living room with no receptionsound quality issues 1 
love this phone 1 
one character is totally annoying with a voice that gives me the feeling of fingernails on a chalkboard 0 
dont make the same mistake i did 0 
kind of flops around 0 
its pure brilliance 1 
they will customize your order any way youd like my usual is eggplant with green bean stir fry love it 1 
the mic there is a joke and the volume is quite low 0 
the burger i got the gold standard a 17 burger and was kind of disappointed 0 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
i still maintain that monkeys shouldnt make headphones we just obviously dont share enough dna to copy the design over to humans 0 
another thing i didnt really like is when a character got punched in the face a gallon of blood would spew forth soon after 0 
dont go here 0 
youll love how thin it is 1 
very very fun chef 1 
all it took was one drop from about 6 inches above the kitchen counter and it was crackedi am not impressed and i am not laughing 0 
your brain will attempt to shutdown as part of a primal impulse of selfpreservation 0 
recommend with confidence 1 
but this movie is definitely a below average rent 0 
awesome device 1 
i would not recommend this place 0 
dont buy this product 0 
it was a drive to get there 0 
after 3 months screen just went black all of a sudden 0 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
great case and price 1 
perabo has a nice energy level and is obviously very comfortable in front of a camera 1 
it dit not work most of the time with my nokia 5320 0 
i wont say any more i dont like spoilers so i dont want to be one but i believe this film is worth your time 1 
much better than the other ayce sushi place i went to in vegas 1 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
nargile i think you are great 1 
do not waste your money here 0 
this movie is so awesome 1 
good protection and does not make phone too bulky 1 
i guess i should have known that this place would suck because it is inside of the excalibur but i didnt use my common sense 0 
total brunch fail 0 
the noise shield is incrediable 1 
a week later after i activated it it suddenly died 0 
mediocre food 0 
how awful she is 0 
im not eating here 0 
simple lightweight and great fit 1 
god and i can never get that 90 minutes back 0 
ambience is perfect 1 
the art style has the appearance of crayonpencil drawings and is wonderfully colorful and fanciful 1 
also great directing and photography 1 
painful on the ear 0 
again lame 0 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
all in all i think it was a good investment 1 
there is simply no excuse for something this poorly done 0 
i would highly recommend this product 1 
excellent product 1 
okay i like to consider myself a fair critic so ill give credit where credits duethe creature effects were actually pretty cool 1 
if youre not familiar check it out 1 
excellent product for the price 1 
price is good too 1 
will never ever go back and have told many people what had happened 0 
whatever prompted such a documentary is beyond me 0 
an instant classic with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits 1 
worse theres an incredibly weak subplot thrown in that follows a little band of latterday mansonites as they go after a reporter whos working on a story on the anniversary of the killings 0 
it is wonderful and inspiring to watch and i hope that it gets released again on to video or dvd 1 
there is no real plot 0 
however the ear pads come off easily and after only one week i lost one 0 
you get incredibly fresh fish prepared with care 1 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
lange had become a great actress 1 
i highly recommend these and encourage people to give them a try 1 
director paul matthews who also wrotedirected the weak 1995 monster movie grim clearly doesnt know how to pace his films 0 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
painful on the ear 0 
there was no chemistry between ben affleck and sandra bullock in this film and i couldnt understand why he would consider even leaving his wifetobe for this chick that he supposedly was knocked out by 0 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
this is the kind of money that is wasted properly 1 
the foreigner is not worth one second of your time 0 
doesnt work 0 
i enjoyed it 1 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
i love my 350 headset my jabra350 bluetooth headset is great the reception is very good and the ear piece is a comfortable fit 1 
it was a waste of my money 0 
this place is great 1 
dont waste your money 0 
this movie is terrible 0 
i might have gotten a defect but i would not risk buying it again because of the built quality alone 0 
emily watsons character is very strong and she has only to give a quick glance and you understand everything 1 
but now that it is out of warranty the same problems reoccurebottom line put your money somewhere else cingular will not support it 0 
so i bought about 10 of these and saved alot of money 1 
it plays louder than any other speaker of this size the price is so low that most would think the quality is lacking however its not 1 
very comfortable 1 
wow loved this place 1 
the worst experience ever 0 
there is no real plot 0 
at a time when it seems that film animation has been dominated by disneypixars cgi masterpieces it is both refreshing and comforting to know that miyazaki is still relying on traditional handdrawn animation to tell his charming and enchanting stories 1 
i have bought this nokia cell phone a few weeks ago and it was a nightmare 0 
and the red curry had so much bamboo shoots and wasnt very tasty to me 0 
1 long lasting battery you dont have to recharge it as frequentyly as some of the flip phones2 0 
the stories were powerful explorations of the nature of man and of art 1 
i wont be back 0 
having to humour him just to get by and get through the day was so apt 1 
unfortunately any virtue in this films production work was lost on a regrettable script 0 
excellent product for the price 1 
theres really nothing bad i can say about this headset 0 
the company shipped my product very promptly and it works well 1 
the directing seems too pretentious 0 
the worst was the salmon sashimi 0 
this film has no redeeming features 0 
paolo sorrentino has written a wonderful story about loneliness and tony has built one of the most unforgettable characters seen in movies in recent years 1 
great place fo take out or eat in 1 
this item is fantastic and works perfectly 1 
plantronics bluetooth excelent buy 1 
the new characters werent all that memorable and i found myself forgetting who was who 0 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
the only consistent thread holding the series together were the amazing performances of leni parker and anita laselva as the two taelons in quiet idealogical conflict 0 
friends pasta also bad he barely touched it 0 
very disappointed in accessoryone 0 
anne heche was utterly convincing 1 
the acting was bad the dialogs were extremely shallow and insincere 0 
now the burgers arent as good the pizza which used to be amazing is doughy and flavorless 0 
this is essentially a communications tool that does not communicate 0 
the keyboard is a nice compromise between a full qwerty and the basic cell phone number keypad 1 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
i will be back many times soon 1 
during several different 2 minute calls i experienced 5 drops and it was in an area that had 5 bars 0 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
this is an excellent film 1 
not good when wearing a hat or sunglasses 0 
comfortable in my hand 1 
a very good film indeed about great and unconditional love 1 
it had some average acting from the main person and it was a low budget as you clearly can see 0 
waited 2 hours never got either of our pizzas as many other around us who came in later did 0 
very tough and very short on flavor 0 
what a piece of junk i lose more calls on this phone 0 
not loud enough and doesnt turn on like it should 0 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
probably not in a hurry to go back 0 
im not eating here 0 
im big fan of rpg games too but this movie its a disgrace to any selfrespecting rpger there is 0 
i cant wait to go back 1 
i dont understand how this garbage got on the shelves of the movie store its not even a real movie 0 
just whatever you do avoid groove as its the antithesis of all that is good about human traffic 0 
def coming back to bowl next time 1 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
youd have to have the iq of particularly stupid mollusk not to see that one coming 0 
the steak was amazingrge fillet relleno was the best seafood plate i have ever had 1 
i love the pho and the spring rolls oh so yummy you have to try 1 
will go back next trip out 1 
and service was super friendly 1 
it wasnt busy either also the building was freezing cold 0 
this is a great product sure beats using your fingers 1 
i was particularly pleased with the acting ability of dwight schultz 1 
very bad experience 0 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
the yellowtail carpaccio was melt in your mouth fresh 1 
interesting decor 1 
one of the most disappointing aspects is the lack of notable gore 0 
i cant use this case because the smell is disgusting 0 
yes its that bad 0 
id rather eat airline food seriously 0 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
unfortunately this is a bad movie that is just plain bad 0 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
leopard print is wonderfully wild 1 
nothing new there 0 
the story unfolds in 18th century jutland and the use of period music played on period instruments is just one more fine touch 1 
comfort for our whole family 1 
the best electronics of the available fm transmitters 1 
highly recommended for all ages although the younger set will probably not appreciate some of the more subtle references they will certainly appreciate one galley scene in particular 1 
you share general loewenhielms exquisite joy in his partaking of the cailles en sarcophage even though you are just watching a movie but you do wish for just a small sample to savor 1 
i wont spoil it but the ending in pretty amazing 1 
i really hope the team behind this movie makes more movies and that they will continue to do so in their own some kinda weird style 1 
it is not good 0 
very unreliable service from tmobile 0 
worked great 1 
oh and i forgot to also mention the weird color effect it has on your phone 0 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
that said our mouths and bellies were still quite pleased 1 
my friend did not like his bloody mary 0 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
i will continue to come here on ladies night andddd date night highly recommend this place to anyone who is in the area 1 
comfortable in my hand 1 
dont waste your money and time 0 
he really didnt seem to want to be hosting his voiceovers were monotonous didnt get involved with the guests 0 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
horrible horrible protector 0 
kids pizza is always a hit too with lots of great side dish options for the kiddos 1 
fans of the genre will be in heaven 1 
it had some average acting from the main person and it was a low budget as you clearly can see 0 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
the only suspense i was feeling was the frustration at just how retarded the girls were 0 
the acting is like watching wooden puppets moving around and reading from a book thats how bad it is 0 
all in all its an insult to ones intelligence and a huge waste of money 0 
this place is disgusting 0 
juano hernandez an exceptional actor who played supporting roles in many films of the era is a proud black man who is accused of murdering a white man in the south 1 
also were served hot bread and butter and home made potato chips with bacon bits on topvery original and very good 1 
poor quality 0 
my friend did not like his bloody mary 0 
i can assure you that you wont be disappointed 1 
this is a chilly unremarkable movie about an author livingworking in a chilly abstruse culture 0 
it makes very strange ticking noises before it ends the call 0 
he is almost unbearable to watch on screen he has little to no charisma and terrible comedic timing 0 
id like to return it 0 
very funny 1 
when my order arrived one of the gyros was missing 0 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
terrible product and waste of money 0 
the chains which im no fan of beat this place easily 0 
this is probably one of the least effective and utterly unoriginal films i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
brilliance indeed 1 
you wont regret it 1 
made very sturdy 1 
does not fit 0 
another note about this phones appearance is that it really looks rather bland especially in the all black model 0 
never going back 0 
this is a great deal 1 
all it took was one drop from about 6 inches above the kitchen counter and it was crackedi am not impressed and i am not laughing 0 
i think that it is a must see older john wayne film 1 
but even the talented carrell cant save this 0 
i consider this theft 0 
id rather eat airline food seriously 0 
i really recommend this faceplates since it looks very nice elegant and cool 1 
and the chef was generous with his time even came around twice so we can take pictures with him 1 
you wont regret it 1 
an amazing finale to possibly the best trilogy of all time 1 
so far so good 1 
they keep getting better and better this is my third one and ive had numerous palms too 1 
i could barely stomach the meal but didnt complain because it was a business lunch 0 
it is light has plenty of battery capacity and is very confortable to wear for somewhat extended periods of time 1 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
def coming back to bowl next time 1 
i am very impressed with this headset from plantronics 1 
this is the place where i first had pho and it was amazing 1 
you could drive a semi truck into these holes 0 
i loved it 1 
overall a delight 1 
the cinematographyif it can be called thatsucked 0 
about ten minutes into this film i started having second thoughts 0 
this was such an awesome movie that i bought it off of ebay 1 
but it does get better reception and clarity than any phone ive had before 1 
yet plantronincs continues to use the same flawed charger design 0 
garbo who showed right off the bat that her talents could carry over from the silent era i wanted to see some of her silent work but netflix doesnt seem to be stocking them 1 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
see it 1 
this movie is a good and humorous comment on life in 2006 1 
i like design and look of jabra behing the ear headsets and 5020 is pretty comfortible to wear 24 hours a day without pain in the ear 1 
i especially liked the noncliche choices with the parents in other movies i could predict the dialog verbatim but the writing in this movie made better selections 1 
this is an outstanding little restaurant with some of the best food i have ever tasted 1 
items stated as included from the description are not included 0 
if you have not seen this movie i definitely recommend it 1 
the design is very good4 1 
it was a huge awkward 15lb piece of cow that was 34ths gristle and fat 0 
ill be looking for a new earpiece 0 
its so stupid to have to keep buying new chargers car chargers cradles headphones and car kits every time a new phone comes out 0 
fantastic food 1 
the charger arrived within the promised timeframe but it did not work 0 
the greek dressing was very creamy and flavorful 1 
that just screams legit in my booksomethats also pretty rare here in vegas 1 
the two main characters may be two of the most believable children i ever saw put on screen 1 
worked very well paired with a treo 700w and as a skype headset on my pc using a usb bluetooth transceiver 1 
im super pissd 0 
another note about this phones appearance is that it really looks rather bland especially in the all black model 0 
will never ever go back 0 
as an earlier review noted plug in this charger and nothing happens 0 
i think not again 0 
i kept looking at the time and it had soon become 35 minutes yet still no food 0 
there is nothing authentic about this place 0 
this place is horrible and way overpriced 0 
wont go back 0 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
shrimp when i unwrapped it i live only 12 a mile from brushfire it was literally ice cold 0 
the earpiece on this is too large or too heavyit keeps falling out of my ear 0 
a good commentary of todays love and undoubtedly a film worth seeing 1 
i guess maybe we went on an off night but it was disgraceful 0 
very well made and fits my surefire gx2 perfectly 1 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
you could drive a semi truck into these holes 0 
i am a fan of his this movie sucked really bad 0 
great brunch spot 1 
this film tries to be a serious and sophisticated thrillerhorror flick and it fails miserably 0 
i did not have any problem with this item and would order it again if needed 1 
four stars for the food the guy in the blue shirt for his great vibe still letting us in to eat 1 
it plays louder than any other speaker of this size the price is so low that most would think the quality is lacking however its not 1 
this convention never worked well in the past and certainly doesnt work here 0 
the dialogue sucked 0 
none of the three sizes they sent with the headset would stay in my ears 0 
i literally vomited while watching this film 0 
prosgood camera very nice pictures also has cool styles like black and white and more 1 
this movie contained an allstar cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i havent seen before 1 
i was very excited to get this headset because i thought it was really cute 1 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
it never condescends all the characters have good genuine hearts and believable problems 1 
doesnt work 0 
the directing seems too pretentious 0 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
now imagine that every single one of those decisions was made wrong 0 
lets start with all the problemsthe acting especially from the lead professor was very very bad 0 
if you simply want a small flip phone look elsewhere as the extra bells whistles are mediocre 0 
i as well wouldve given godfathers zero stars if possible 0 
definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly will return next time im in vegas 1 
this is a great place to eat 1 
this is a very average phone with bad battery life that operates on a weak network 0 
however after about a year the fliptop started to get loose and wobbly and eventually my screen went black and i couldnt receive and place calls 0 
you cant beat the price on these 1 
great product 1 
just as good as when i had it more than a year ago 1 
yet plantronincs continues to use the same flawed charger design 0 
needless to say i wont be going back anytime soon 0 
bland and flavorless is a good way of describing the barely tepid meat 0 
awesome device 1 
no actress has been worse used that june allison in this movie 0 
the menu is always changing food quality is going down service is extremely slow 0 
not good for the money 0 
there is really nothing for me at postinos hope your experience is better 0 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
the problem was the script 0 
the sangria was about half of a glass wine full and was 12 ridiculous 0 
i would recommend this 1 
like the other reviewer said you couldnt pay me to eat at this place again 0 
and if that isnt enough of a mess of a movie for you the picture is also marred with a constant use of studio sets and indoor exteriors 0 
excellent bluetooth headset 1 
about half way through this film i started to dislike it 0 
the desserts were a bit strange 0 
i even dropped this phone into a stream and it was submerged for 15 seconds and it still works great 1 
the cinematography is simply stunning to say the least and the fx are nothing if not stateoftheart 1 
it is an hour and half waste of time following a bunch of very pretty high schoolers whine and cry about life 0 
its practically perfect in all of them  a true masterpiece in a sea of faux masterpieces 1 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
there were several moments in the movie that just didnt need to be there and were excruciatingly slow moving 0 
the loudspeaker option is great the bumpers with the lights is very appealing 0 
before i go in to why i gave a 1 star rating please know that this was my third time eating at bachi burger before writing a review 0 
must have been an off night at this place 0 
im trying to return it for a refund 0 
has been working great 1 
the meat was pretty dry i had the sliced brisket and pulled pork 0 
server did a great job handling our large rowdy table 1 
john garfield ann revere lilli plmer william conrad canada leeand filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screenjames wong howe 1 
this place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver 0 
i had about two bites and refused to eat anymore 0 
i was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar not only because the quality is great but the service is fast and the food impeccable 1 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
the shrimp tender and moist 1 
we recently witnessed her poor quality of management towards other guests as well 0 
this totally unfunny movie is so over the top and pathetic and unrealistic that throughout the whole 90 minutes of utter torture i probably looked at my watch about 70000 times 0 
i really wanted the plantronics 510 to be the right one but it has too many issues for methe good 0 
i had high hopes for this place since the burgers are cooked over a charcoal grill but unfortunately the taste fell flat way flat 0 
the best phone in market 1 
i dont understand how this garbage got on the shelves of the movie store its not even a real movie 0 
i can take a little bad service but the food sucks 0 
overall i would recommend this phone over the new walkman 1 
i let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this bad idea we both hated it 0 
awful service 0 
it was a very superficial movie and it gave me the feeling that i was watching play rather than a film 0 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
good prices 1 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
love the margaritas too 1 
and it was way to expensive 0 
this place is handsdown one of the best places to eat in the phoenix metro area 1 
i was very excited to get this headset because i thought it was really cute 1 
it showed exactly how the government and the scientist argued for humanity and the reasons of the gadget 1 
the casting is also horrible cause all you see is a really really bad actors period 0 
it was a waste of my money 0 
eclectic selection 1 
later i found myself lost in the power of the film 1 
service is friendly and inviting 1 
totally believable 1 
crash is a depressing little nothing that provokes emotion but teaches you nothing if you already know racism and prejudice are bad things 0 
but this movie is definitely a below average rent 0 
there is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again 0 
the attempts at humor were pitiful and story is so awful it dosent bear thinking about which basically involves a vulcan stealing the enterprise to find god seriously i just didnt care about any of this film and oh not to mention uhura does a belly dance to distract male guards 0 
cant say enough good things about this place 1 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
i enjoyed it 1 
the phone loads super 1 
one of the worst shows of all time 0 
the shower area is outside so you can only rinse not take a full shower unless you dont mind being nude for everyone to see 0 
i love this thing 1 
camera color balance is awful 0 
but above all the exquisite visual composition of each moment with inventive and elegant use of closeup camera angle and lighting including pointillistic faux home movie footage is a wonder and joy to behold 1 
overall i wasnt very impressed with noca 0 
service is perfect and the family atmosphere is nice to see 1 
owners are really great people 1 
i received my supposedly new motorola 375 and apparently there was not a match between the phone and the charger 0 
superb phone on a great network 1 
good prices 1 
i dont know what kind it is but they have the best iced tea 1 
reversible plug works great 1 
it showed exactly how the government and the scientist argued for humanity and the reasons of the gadget 1 
you need two hands to operate the screenthis software interface is decade old and cannot compete with new software designs 0 
at no point in the proceedings does it look remotely like america 0 
the acting as youd expect from this cast is top notch 1 
the first thing that happened was that the tracking was off 0 
we arent ones to make a scene at restaurants but i just dont get itdefinitely lost the love after this one 0 
his costars dont fare much better with people like morgan freeman jonah hill and ed helms just wasted 0 
it feels poorly constructed the menus are difficult to navigate and the buttons are so recessed that it is difficult to push them 0 
it was pretty gross 0 
dee snider just plain sucks 0 
if you do go see this movie bring a pillow or a girlfriendboyfriend to keep you occupied through out 0 
we ordered the duck rare and it was pink and tender on the inside with a nice char on the outside 1 
he really didnt seem to want to be hosting his voiceovers were monotonous didnt get involved with the guests 0 
i like armand assante my cable companys summary sounded interesting so i watched it twice already and probably will again 1 
avoid at any and all costs 0 
this is a very average phone with bad battery life that operates on a weak network 0 
my friend did not like his bloody mary 0 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
he was extremely rude and really there are so many other restaurants i would love to dine at during a weekend in vegas 0 
i might have gotten a defect but i would not risk buying it again because of the built quality alone 0 
fast service 1 
in fact i liked it better than interview with a vampire and i liked this lestat stuart townsend better than cruises attempt 1 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
i think the most wonderful parts literally full of wonder are the excerpts from his works 1 
who in their right mind is gonna buy this battery 0 
omit watching this 0 
an italian reviewer called this a small great film and thats right 1 
overall i rate this movie a 10 out of a 110 scale 1 
i did not expect this to be so good 1 
the bus boy on the other hand was so rude 0 
i heart this place 1 
ray charles life provided excellent biographical material for the film which goes well beyond being just another movie about a musician 1 
good works fine 1 
host staff were for lack of a better word bitches 0 
its welldesigned and very sharp the blue is a very nice color 1 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
definitely worth checking out 1 
the classic maine lobster roll was fantastic 1 
mediocre food 0 
do not purchase this phone 0 
but now that it is out of warranty the same problems reoccurebottom line put your money somewhere else cingular will not support it 0 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
however the keypads are so tinny that i sometimes reach the wrong buttons 0 
the only thing really worth watching was the scenery and the house because it is beautiful 1 
rating 010 grade z note the show is so bad that even mother of the cast pull her daughter out of the show 0 
the veggitarian platter is out of this world 1 
this is one of peter watkins most accessible films 1 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
for readers who have already seen one of miyazakis films he is still in top form and made another worthwhile experience 1 
the phone is sturdy and waterproof 1 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
iam very pleased with my purchase 1 
excellent phone 1 
a very good film indeed about great and unconditional love 1 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
the characters are interesting even if a bit predictable 1 
saggy floppy piece of junk 0 
it is worth the drive 1 
10 out of 10 stars 1 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
ive had no trouble accessing the internet downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions 1 
chinese forgeries abound 0 
if you look for authentic thai food go else where 0 
only pros large seating area nice bar area great simple drink menu the best brick oven pizza with homemade dough 1 
the food wasnt good 0 
works fine 1 
the best phone in market 1 
this would not even be good as a made for tv flick 0 
much more interesting more action more suspense and less of the unneeded controversy 1 
the accompanied software is almost brilliant 1 
the only thing really worth watching was the scenery and the house because it is beautiful 1 
reasonably priced also 1 
i love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it 1 
the jamaican mojitos are delicious 1 
the film gives meaning to the phrase never in the history of human conflict has so much been owed by so many to so few 1 
what a mistake that was 0 
the handsfree part works fine but then the car tries to download the address book and the treo rebootsoverall i still rate this device high 1 
it was awesome 1 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
the owner used to work at nobu so this place is really similar for half the price 1 
this place is pretty good nice little vibe in the restaurant 1 
it was so cool 1 
when i placed my treo into the case not only was it not snug but there was a lot of extra room on the sides 0 
this place is disgusting 0 
the classic maine lobster roll was fantastic 1 
how can that bethe audio quality is poor 0 
but i definitely would not eat here again 0 
there is so much good food in vegas that i feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to rice and company 0 
lovely little thriller from hitchcock with lots of nice shenanigans surrounding a murdered spy a kidnapped child a nasty church a foreign plot and some random taxidermists 1 
there are the usual hitchcock logic flaws 0 
very disappointing 0 
it was way over fried 0 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
very bad experience 0 
phenomenal food service and ambiance 1 
exceptionally bad 0 
oh the charger seems to work fine 1 
also its a real treat to see anthony quinn playing crazy horse 1 
total brunch fail 0 
defective crap 0 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
that was funny 1 
tried to go here for lunch and it was a madhouse 0 
there is no plot here to keep you going in the first place 0 
the service was not up to par either 0 
dont waste your time here 0 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
after the disappointing dinner we went elsewhere for dessert 0 
and it was way to expensive 0 
if that bug never showed up i would have given a 4 for sure but on the other side of the wall where this bug was climbing was the kitchen 0 
i love this phone it is very handy and has a lot of features 1 
this is simply the best bluetooth headset for sound quality 1 
for people who are first timers in film making i think they did an excellent job 1 
not my thing 0 
i love the camera its really pretty good quality 1 
avoid avoid avoid 0 
the plastic breaks really easy on this clip 0 
cant upload ringtones from a third party 0 
plug was the wrong size 0 
the acting was decidely wooden though no worse than a period universal b movie 0 
i have been very happy with the 510 and have had no complaints from any one regarding my sound quality on their end 1 
i love this bluetooth 1 
if you see it you should probably just leave it on the shelf 0 
crisp and clear 1 
this is a very average phone with bad battery life that operates on a weak network 0 
i would not recommend this place 0 
not too screamy not to masculine but just right 1 
the only consistent thread holding the series together were the amazing performances of leni parker and anita laselva as the two taelons in quiet idealogical conflict 0 
cant upload ringtones from a third party 0 
it isnt even an achievement as a sobaditsgood or sobaditsmemorable movie 0 
it has all the features i want 1 
nevertheless yet another wonderful film from the great masters stable 1 
waste your money on this game 1 
an excellent new restaurant by an experienced frenchman 1 
eew this location needs a complete overhaul 0 
the scallop dish is quite appalling for value as well 0 
i tried talking real loud but shouting on the telephone gets old and i was still told it wasnt great 0 
steer clear of this product and go with the genuine palm replacementr pens which come in a threepack 0 
unfortunately the ability to actually know you are receiving a call is a rather important feature and this phone is pitiful in that respect 0 
what the hell kind of crap is that 0 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
everything was perfect the night we were in 1 
i dont like this nokia either 0 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
i connected my wifes bluetoothmotorola hs850 to my phone and it worked like a charm whether the phone was in my pocket or the case 1 
the only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive 1 
i saw this film over christmas and what a great film it was 1 
dont waste your money 0 
the acting is terrible and the writing is worse 0 
the chefs were friendly and did a good job 1 
i have been very happy with the 510 and have had no complaints from any one regarding my sound quality on their end 1 
i had a pretty satifying experience 1 
this phone is pretty sturdy and ive never had any large problems with it 1 
highquality chicken on the chicken caesar salad 1 
its pretty surprising that this wonderful film was made in 1949 as hollywood generally had its collective heads in the sand concerning black and white issues at that time 1 
nothing short of magnificent photographycinematography in this film 1 
no plot whatsoever 0 
ive had better not only from dedicated boba tea spots but even from jenni pho 0 
worthwhile 1 
sooooo good 1 
it also took her forever to bring us the check when we asked for it 0 
i received it quickly and it works great 1 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
by the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant i was bored and didnt care what happened next and so i switched off 0 
there are so many problems i dont know where to start 0 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
not nearly as good looking as the amazon picture makes it look 0 
this movie is terrible 0 
do not buy for d807wrongly advertised for d807 0 
they were excellent 1 
stopped by during the late may bank holiday off rick steve recommendation and loved it 1 
never got it 0 
unless youre just out to visually collect all extant films of austens work you can skip this one 0 
i wont spoil it but the ending in pretty amazing 1 
by this time our side of the restaurant was almost empty so there was no excuse 0 
a great touch 1 
i love the ownerchef his one authentic japanese cool dude 1 
needless to say we will never be back here again 0 
great time family dinner on a sunday night 1 
i just saw this film and i recommend it 1 
a good commentary of todays love and undoubtedly a film worth seeing 1 
personally i think it shows that people should learn to find a compromise them self without involving other people into issue 1 
they have a really nice atmosphere 1 
an hour seriously 0 
and it was boring 0 
it plays louder than any other speaker of this size the price is so low that most would think the quality is lacking however its not 1 
again lame 0 
horrible horrible protector 0 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
the macarons here are insanely good 1 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
im using it with an iriver spinn with case and it fits fine 1 
i have had problems wit hit dropping signal and more 0 
thank you for wasting my money 0 
you need two hands to operate the screenthis software interface is decade old and cannot compete with new software designs 0 
i keep watching it over and over 1 
much more interesting more action more suspense and less of the unneeded controversy 1 
you cant beat that 1 
very satisifed with that 1 
emily watsons character is very strong and she has only to give a quick glance and you understand everything 1 
dont waste your time 0 
very displeased 0 
then scene where they debated whether or not to sack the trumpeter who falsely was accused for the murder is pure horror really stupid 0 
ive seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie 0 
this hole in the wall has great mexican street tacos and friendly staff 1 
phone now holds charge like it did when it was new 1 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
after all the rave reviews i couldnt wait to eat herewhat a disappointment 0 
dont buy this product it fails 0 
left very frustrated 0 
the service was great even the manager came and helped with our table 1 
with great sound effects and impressive special effects i cant recommend this movie enough 1 
the only downside is the service 0 
lewis blacks considerable talent is wasted here too as he is at his most incendiary when he is unrestrained which the pg13 rating certainly wont allow 0 
doesnt work at all i bougth it for my l7c and its not working 0 
great for the jawbone 1 
the microphone also works well but according to people i have called it applifies everything 1 
o my gosh the best phone i have ever had 1 
its pure brilliance 1 
unreliable im giving up 0 
the ambiance was incredible 1 
i guess i should have known that this place would suck because it is inside of the excalibur but i didnt use my common sense 0 
the chicken i got was definitely reheated and was only ok the wedges were cold and soggy 0 
at a time when it seems that film animation has been dominated by disneypixars cgi masterpieces it is both refreshing and comforting to know that miyazaki is still relying on traditional handdrawn animation to tell his charming and enchanting stories 1 
the headset fulfills my requirements so i am happy with my purchase 1 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
nice sound 1 
the aerial scenes were welldone 1 
i was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar not only because the quality is great but the service is fast and the food impeccable 1 
the movie in movie situations in the beginning and through the game that is played with her by the acting coach are fascinating 1 
overall i am psyched to have a phone which has all my appointments and contacts in and gets great reception 1 
the text messaging feature is really tricky to use 0 
great food and great service in a clean and friendly setting 1 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
phenomenal food service and ambiance 1 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
will go back next trip out 1 
they are so cool 1 
fantastic service here 1 
delicious and i will absolutely be back 1 
but the premise of the film was so ridiculous that the president of the us 0 
i highly recommend this device to everyone 1 
if you see it you should probably just leave it on the shelf 0 
bad fit way too big 0 
good product good seller 1 
i was left shattered from the experience of watching this film and i took a good two hours to fully recover 0 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
he was terrible 0 
its practically perfect in all of them  a true masterpiece in a sea of faux masterpieces 1 
i heart this place 1 
we also ordered the spinach and avocado salad the ingredients were sad and the dressing literally had zero taste 0 
the things that the four kids get themselves into is absolutely hilarious to watch 1 
absolutely great 1 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
it ranks highly as a great noircrimedrama incredible performances by belmondo and lino ventura 1 
horrible dont waste your time and money 0 
yeah the movie pretty much sucked 0 
black water is a thriller that manages to completely transcend its limitations its an indie flick by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience 1 
i must say i have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again 1 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
this place should honestly be blown up 0 
portable and it works 1 
plus it was wellpaced and suited its relatively short run time 1 
we have tried 2 units and they both failed within 2 months pros 0 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
they keep getting better and better this is my third one and ive had numerous palms too 1 
the result is a powerhouse achievement made more timely now perhaps because of our cultures disturbing fascination with celebrity and its distorted interpretations of fame 1 
the stories were as unbelievable as the actors 0 
improper description i had to return it 0 
i like design and look of jabra behing the ear headsets and 5020 is pretty comfortible to wear 24 hours a day without pain in the ear 1 
the cow tongue and cheek tacos are amazing 1 
i guess i liked the details of his dysfunctionhe was believable 1 
i rate this movie 910 1 
theres also enough hypocrisy in this film to make me vomit 0 
you cant relate with them hell you barely can understand them 0 
there are so many problems i dont know where to start 0 
i love being able to use one headset for both by landline and cell 1 
the design is very odd as the ear clip is not very comfortable at all 0 
i work in the hospitality industry in paradise valley and have refrained from recommending cibo any longer 0 
the chefs were friendly and did a good job 1 
the range is very decent ive been able to roam around my house with the phone in the living room with no receptionsound quality issues 1 
if you plan to use this in a car forget about it 0 
this is definitely a cult classic well worth viewing and sharing with others 1 
this is infuriating 0 
cant get the software to work with my computer 0 
service is friendly and inviting 1 
not a good item it worked for a while then started having problems in my auto reverse tape player 0 
how can anyone in their right mind ask for anything more from a movie than this 1 
they were goldencrispy and delicious 1 
if you want healthy authentic or ethic food try this place 1 
poor talk time performance 0 
it was so bad i had lost the heart to finish it 0 
the seller is very understanding and patient i would definitely buy from them again 1 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
we had 7 at our table and the service was pretty fast 1 
worst customer service ever 0 
the classic maine lobster roll was fantastic 1 
i dont think well be going back anytime soon 0 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
even if you love bad movies do not watch this movie 0 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
the instruction manual is lacking 0 
doesnt last long 0 
cinematography noteworthy including fine views of barcelona and its famed gaudi towers 1 
the plot simply rumbles on like a machine desperately depending on the addition of new scenes 0 
simple lightweight and great fit 1 
the service was not up to par either 0 
excellent cast story line performances 1 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
i got home to see the driest damn wings ever 0 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
it was so cool 1 
im still infatuated with this phone 1 
when im on this side of town this will definitely be a spot ill hit up again 1 
if you are razr owneryou must have this 1 
does not work 0 
this movie has a cutting edge to it 1 
if youre not familiar check it out 1 
the plot is nonsense that doesnt interest in the slightest way or have any uniqueness to it 0 
if you love death and decay and shakespears lyrics this is the one 1 
but it is great i would really recommend it 1 
i came over from verizon because cingulair has nicer cell phones the first thing i noticed was the really bad service 0 
after 20 minutes wait i got a table 0 
the shower area is outside so you can only rinse not take a full shower unless you dont mind being nude for everyone to see 0 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
its very attractive and appears to be of good quality 1 
coming here is like experiencing an underwhelming relationship where both parties cant wait for the other person to ask to break up 0 
food was great and so was the serivce 1 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
i hate to disagree with my fellow yelpers but my husband and i were so disappointed with this place 0 
we had fantastic service and were pleased by the atmosphere 1 
good value works fine power via usb car or wall outlet 1 
it presents a idyllic yet serious portrayal of the ups and downs of the characters lives 1 
i went to bachi burger on a friends recommendation and was not disappointed 1 
recommend with confidence 1 
im big fan of rpg games too but this movie its a disgrace to any selfrespecting rpger there is 0 
this would not even be good as a made for tv flick 0 
just does not work 0 
great steak great sides great wine amazing desserts 1 
last night was my second time dining here and i was so happy i decided to go back 1 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
a good time 1 
restaurant is always full but never a wait 1 
then i watched it again two sundays ago march 20th 2005 and i began to really enjoy it and this time i taped the entire thing 1 
the foreigner is not worth one second of your time 0 
i go to far too many places and ive never seen any restaurant that serves a 1 egg breakfast especially for 400 0 
it was forced like everything in this movie 0 
their daily specials are always a hit with my group 1 
one of the best mexican movies ever and one of the less understood even by mexican themselves no matter how identified the should have felt with it 1 
as an earlier review noted plug in this charger and nothing happens 0 
really awful 0 
it is a very well acted and done tv movie 1 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
it is very educational for children 1 to 8 years old 1 
say bye bye to your tip lady 0 
love it great armband 1 
i still maintain that monkeys shouldnt make headphones we just obviously dont share enough dna to copy the design over to humans 0 
shes poised and amazing 1 
the worst experience ever 0 
its just painful 0 
unfortunately it did not work 0 
we are sending it back 0 
i ended up sliding it on the edge of my pants or back pockets instead 1 
10 out of 10 stars 1 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
seems like a good quick place to grab a bite of some familiar pub food but do yourself a favor and look elsewhere 0 
my sister has one also and she loves it 1 
but it wasnt until i watched this film that i realised how great he actually was 1 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
so i bought about 10 of these and saved alot of money 1 
come hungry leave happy and stuffed 1 
i had high hopes for this place since the burgers are cooked over a charcoal grill but unfortunately the taste fell flat way flat 0 
also great directing and photography 1 
wow loved this place 1 
dont waste your on this one 0 
i will never go back to this place and will never ever recommended this place to anyone 0 
very funny 1 
the voice recognition thru the handset is excellent 1 
a standout scene 1 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
it is so small and you dont even realize that it is there after a while of getting used to it 1 
special mention should be made of the superb music score and sound effects which are an integral element in helping to make this such a memorable and enjoyable cartoon 1 
his performance as awarded was stunning 1 
it was so cool 1 
1010 1 
i would not recommend this place 0 
for the price this was a great deal 1 
very good food great atmosphere1 1 
hard to judge whether these sides were good because we were grossed out by the melted styrofoam and didnt want to eat it for fear of getting sick 0 
the plot has more holes than a pair of fishnet stockings and the direction and editing is astonishingly ham fisted 0 
we wont be returning 0 
phone falls out easily 0 
i saw mirrormask last night and it was an unsatisfactory experience 0 
the film is well paced understated and one of the best courtroom documentaries ive seen 1 
of all the dishes the salmon was the best but all were great 1 
the service here leaves a lot to be desired 0 
item arrived quickly and works great with my metro pcs samsung schr450 slider phone and sony premium sound in ear plugs 1 
a good time 1 
i love the scream movies and all horror movies and this one ranks way up there 1 
i still maintain that monkeys shouldnt make headphones we just obviously dont share enough dna to copy the design over to humans 0 
good value works fine power via usb car or wall outlet 1 
all the pretty pictures in the world cannot make up for a piece of work that is flawed at the core 0 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
it sure does beat the nachos at the movies but i would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant 0 
i would highly recommend this 1 
last time buying from you 0 
strike 2 who wants to be rushed 0 
definitely worth checking out 1 
oh and i forgot to also mention the weird color effect it has on your phone 0 
ive never been treated so bad 0 
not recommended 0 
what happened next was prettyoff putting 0 
i think it was robert ryans best film because he portrayed someone like my father and he was a schizophrenic in real lifemy father although he never murdered anyone but was affected more so during the second world war which made him worse 1 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
defective crap 0 
excellent cast story line performances 1 
alexander nevsky is a great film 1 
overall a great experience 1 
these are the nicest restaurant owners ive ever come across 1 
i didnt want the clip going over the top of my ear causing discomfort 0 
im not eating here 0 
this film offers many delights and surprises 1 
it is light has plenty of battery capacity and is very confortable to wear for somewhat extended periods of time 1 
of course the acting is blah 0 
cinematography noteworthy including fine views of barcelona and its famed gaudi towers 1 
end of days is one of the worst bigbudget action movies ive ever seen 0 
about half way through this film i started to dislike it 0 
the ambiance isnt much better 0 
to call this movie a drama is ridiculous 0 
the success of the film depends on the casting of sydney greenstreet as the alexander yardley character 1 
honeslty it didnt taste that fresh 0 
often the dialogue doesnt really follow from one line to another or fit the surroundings 0 
very serious spoilers this movie was a huge disappointment 0 
i love the pho and the spring rolls oh so yummy you have to try 1 
i really liked that 1 
this phone might well be the worst ive ever had in any brand 0 
phone now holds charge like it did when it was new 1 
camerawork again bad 0 
i got it because it was so small and adorable 1 
why are these sad little vegetables so overcooked 0 
the pancake was also really good and pretty large at that 1 
there is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again 0 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
it looses connection to the phone even when it is within a couple feet between the two 0 
we watched our waiter pay a lot more attention to other tables and ignore us 0 
hes a national treasure 1 
no ear loop needed its tiny and the sound is great 1 
this is truly an art movieit actually has a lot of art in it 1 
point your finger at any item on the menu order it and you wont be disappointed 1 
overall i wasnt very impressed with noca 0 
the film is way too long 0 
its very attractive and appears to be of good quality 1 
the fried rice was dry as well 0 
the characters are interesting even if a bit predictable 1 
simply beautiful 1 
best of luck to the rude and noncustomer service focused new management 0 
couldnt ask for a more satisfying meal 1 
the entire audience applauded at the conclusion of the film 1 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
i ended up sliding it on the edge of my pants or back pockets instead 1 
never been to hard rock casino before will never ever step forward in it again 0 
service is perfect and the family atmosphere is nice to see 1 
so i had to take the battery out of the phone put it all back together and then restart it 0 
anne heche was utterly convincing 1 
enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film 1 
the cinematographyif it can be called thatsucked 0 
this is just a great movie 1 
2 thumbs up to this seller 1 
garbo who showed right off the bat that her talents could carry over from the silent era i wanted to see some of her silent work but netflix doesnt seem to be stocking them 1 
not much flavor to them and very poorly constructed 0 
after 20 minutes wait i got a table 0 
best fish ive ever had in my life 1 
clear skype calls long battery life long range 1 
anyways the food was definitely not filling at all and for the price you pay you should expect more 0 
first of all it doesnt wear well 0 
brilliance indeed 1 
my only complaint is the standard sound volume is a little low even when turned up to 5of 5 0 
im still trying to get over how bad it was 0 
the battery is working well as a replacement for the original that came with the phone over 2 years ago 1 
i used bitpim a free program you can find on the internetto transfer data to the phonethe price of the cable was excellent 1 
very cheap plastic creaks like an old wooden floor 0 
how can that bethe audio quality is poor 0 
avoid at any and all costs 0 
it just blew 0 
avoid at all cost 0 
why are these sad little vegetables so overcooked 0 
then a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use 0 
lordy the khao soi is a dish that is not to be missed for curry lovers 1 
the acting was bad the dialogs were extremely shallow and insincere 0 
it is worth the drive 1 
this is a beautiful phone 1 
the live music on fridays totally blows 0 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
saw the movie today and thought it was a good effort good messages for kids 1 
he was very impressed when going from the original battery to the extended battery 1 
excellent sound quality 1 
youll love it 1 
i paid the bill but did not tip because i felt the server did a terrible job 0 
i highly recommend this modest priced cellular phone 1 
it was that loudglad to say that the plantronics 510 maintains a flawless connection to my cell and with no static during normal use 1 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
anyways the food was definitely not filling at all and for the price you pay you should expect more 0 
this if the first movie ive given a 10 to in years 1 
the lighting is awful 0 
my boyfriend and i sat at the bar and had a completely delightful experience 1 
the ambiance isnt much better 0 
this is an outstanding little restaurant with some of the best food i have ever tasted 1 
poorly contstruct hinge 0 
i dont know what the big deal is about this place but i wont be back yaall 0 
my only complaint is the standard sound volume is a little low even when turned up to 5of 5 0 
this is definitely a cult classic well worth viewing and sharing with others 1 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
i dont think ive ever gone to a movie and disliked it as much 0 
the chips and salsa were really good the salsa was very fresh 1 
my sanyo has survived dozens of drops on blacktop without ill effect 1 
my side greek salad with the greek dressing was so tasty and the pita and hummus was very refreshing 1 
their chow mein is so good 1 
the shower area is outside so you can only rinse not take a full shower unless you dont mind being nude for everyone to see 0 
it defeats the purpose of a bluetooth headset 0 
everything about it is fine and reasonable for the price ie 1 
design flaw 0 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
an italian reviewer called this a small great film and thats right 1 
how can you call yourself a steakhouse if you cant properly cook a steak i dont understand 0 
the food came out at a good pace 1 
the telephone repair man was really funny and his reactions to the nuts and bitchy boss were truly genuine 1 
so flavorful and has just the perfect amount of heat 1 
performed awful muffled tinny incoming sound and severe echo for those on the other end of the call 0 
i would have given no star if i was able 0 
my friend loved the salmon tartar 1 
worst martini ever 0 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
the burger had absolutely no flavor the meat itself was totally bland the burger was overcooked and there was no charcoal flavor 0 
after all the rave reviews i couldnt wait to eat herewhat a disappointment 0 
simple lightweight and great fit 1 
i recently had problems where i could not stay connected for more than 10 minutes before being disconnected 0 
you cant go wrong with any of the food here 1 
great product 1 
the pairing of the two devices was so easy it barely took a couple minutes before i started making calls with the voice dialing feature 1 
for a product that costs as much as this one does i expect it to work far better and with greater ease than this thing does 0 
portable and it works 1 
i like the fact that it rests lightly against your ear rather than inside 1 
i am so tired of clichés that is just lazy writing and here they come in thick and fast 0 
dont go here 0 
i love the look and feel of samsung flipphones 1 
best tacos in town by far 1 
the steaks are all well trimmed and also perfectly cooked 1 
a film not easily forgotten 1 
it didnt make me scared horrified or make me sympathetic towards the characters it was simply annoying 0 
it works fine on my motorola 325 cellphone and a lot better than the wornout battery did 1 
every element of this story was so over the top excessively phony and contrived that it was painful to sit through 0 
the accompanied software is almost brilliant 1 
small sleek impressive looking practical setup with ample storage in place 1 
i dont think ill be running back to carlys anytime soon for food 0 
the film is way too long 0 
this item worked great but it broke after 6 months of use 0 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
the design is very good4 1 
its really easy 1 
but what really made it unwatchable was the direction 0 
razr battery good buy 1 
the scenes with the ohsomature neighbourgirl are a misplace 0 
the instructions didnt explain that a microphone jack could be used 0 
its a little geeky but i think thats its sex on toast and it rocks and oozes sex right down to its battery embedded sleek stylish leather case 1 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
will go back next trip out 1 
very disappointing 0 
the bus boy on the other hand was so rude 0 
their menu is diverse and reasonably priced 1 
its fits like a glove and is strong secure and durable 1 
however paul schrader has indeed made a film about mishima that is both superb complex 1 
it crackles with an unpredictable youthful energy but honestly i found it hard to follow and concentrate on it meanders so badly 0 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
poor quality 0 
it looked like a wonderful story 1 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
terrible product and waste of money 0 
ordered a double cheeseburger got a single patty that was falling apart picture uploaded yeah still sucks 0 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
i dont know what the big deal is about this place but i wont be back yaall 0 
the movie in movie situations in the beginning and through the game that is played with her by the acting coach are fascinating 1 
it is worth the drive 1 
excellent product for the price 1 
great headset very impressed h500 1 
we recently witnessed her poor quality of management towards other guests as well 0 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
this place is horrible and way overpriced 0 
comfortable fit you need your headset to be comfortable for at least an hour at a time if not for an entire day 1 
during several different 2 minute calls i experienced 5 drops and it was in an area that had 5 bars 0 
his losing his marbles so early in the proceedings is totally implausible and unconvincing 0 
it was forced like everything in this movie 0 
a film not easily forgotten 1 
echo problemvery unsatisfactory 0 
i wont spoil it but the ending in pretty amazing 1 
its like a really sexy party in your mouth where youre outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party 1 
it was pretty gross 0 
verizon tech support walked my through a few procedures none of which worked and i ended up having to do a hard reset wiping out all my data 0 
gets a signal when other verizon phones wont 1 
awesome device 1 
the cinematography is simply stunning to say the least and the fx are nothing if not stateoftheart 1 
it did not work in my cell phone plug i am very up set with the charger 0 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
the service was great even the manager came and helped with our table 1 
its a feelgood film and thats how i felt when i came out of the cinema 1 
unfortunately it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees 0 
product is exactly as described 1 
this place is good 1 
a happy wonderful feel good ending 1 
every thing on phone work perfectly she like it 1 
the results well are a shame 0 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
the jerky camera movements were also annoying 0 
however the keypads are so tinny that i sometimes reach the wrong buttons 0 
really pleased with this product so far 1 
my friend did not like his bloody mary 0 
the salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop which was perfectly cooked 1 
the movie was so boring that i sometimes found myself occupied peaking in the paper instead of watching never happened during a columbo movie before 0 
what a piece of junk i lose more calls on this phone 0 
its a campy sort of film thats a joy to watch 1 
dont make the same mistake i did 0 
maybe its just their vegetarian fare but ive been twice and i thought it was average at best 0 
the death row scenes were entirely unmoving 0 
very cheap plastic creaks like an old wooden floor 0 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
food was delicious 1 
i am not a filmmaker nor am i a director but i would hide my head in the sand if id spent whatever amount of money and time on this movie 0 
wow loved this place 1 
nice docking station for home or work 1 
dont waste your time 0 
definitely worth seeing its the sort of thought provoking film that forces you to question your own threshold of loneliness 1 
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
very friendly staff 1 
nothing at all to recommend 0 
as always the evening was wonderful and the food delicious 1 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
the phone crashed completely and now i have to get it replaced 0 
product is useless since it does not have enough charging current to charge the 2 cellphones i was planning to use it with 0 
i promise they wont disappoint 1 
the waiter wasnt helpful or friendly and rarely checked on us 0 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
dont waste your money and time 0 
setup couldnt have been simpler 1 
it has a great camera thats 2mp and the pics are nice and clear with great picture quality 1 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
its a mediocre miserable hollow laughable and predictable piece of garbage 0 
i cant see how this movie can be an inspiration to anyone to come out or overcome fear and rejection 0 
the use of slowmotion needlessly repeats itself throughout the movie but is well backed up by bad acting and bad is a kind word here no continuity scenes that are thrown in for no reason whatsoever vehicles that looked like they were made from a corn flakes box and a directorial style that bordered on stupidity 0 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
the company shipped my product very promptly and it works well 1 
excellent cast story line performances 1 
woa talk about awful 0 
i wish i could return the unit and get back my money 0 
obviously they have a terrible customer service so you get what you pay for 0 
too bad you have to pay up to a month for the service 0 
tried to go here for lunch and it was a madhouse 0 
works for me 1 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
brilliance indeed 1 
also the story and acting were weak 0 
good prices 1 
i would have casted her in that role after ready the script 1 
paolo sorrentino has written a wonderful story about loneliness and tony has built one of the most unforgettable characters seen in movies in recent years 1 
the selection was probably the worst ive seen in vegasthere was none 0 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
not much seafood and like 5 strings of pasta at the bottom 0 
avoid at all cost 0 
the headset fulfills my requirements so i am happy with my purchase 1 
favorite place in town for shawarrrrrrma 1 
it is a very well acted and done tv movie 1 
first time there and might just be the last 0 
lightweight and works well 1 
the staff is friendly and the joint is always clean 1 
easy to use 1 
i want to first say our server was great and we had perfect service 1 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
food was really good and i got full petty fast 1 
the bathroom is just next door and very nice 1 
i was sitting in my vehicle with the cradle on my belt and the headset lost signal 0 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
this one works and was priced right 1 
this movie creates its own universe and is fascinating in every way 1 
i think that it is a must see older john wayne film 1 
1 long lasting battery you dont have to recharge it as frequentyly as some of the flip phones2 0 
the awful dialogue and hopeless overacting by everyone who gets shot top off a real waste of space and time 0 
this is a great product sure beats using your fingers 1 
i love this thing 1 
has been working great 1 
an hour seriously 0 
the acting is like watching wooden puppets moving around and reading from a book thats how bad it is 0 
everything was gross 0 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
which are small and not worth the price 0 
the food was terrible 0 
one more thing i can tolerate political incorrectness very well im all for artistic freedom and suspension of disbelief but the slavic female character was just too much 0 
the waitress was friendly and happy to accomodate for veganveggie options 1 
go watch it 1 
great place to eat reminds me of the little mom and pop shops in the san francisco bay area 1 
every thing on phone work perfectly she like it 1 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
i had a salad with the wings and some ice cream for dessert and left feeling quite satisfied 1 
waste of money 0 
you also cannot take pictures with it in the case because the lense is covered 0 
for 40 bucks a head i really expect better food 0 
the battery is working well as a replacement for the original that came with the phone over 2 years ago 1 
the hockey scenes are terrible defensemen playing like theyre 5 years old goalies diving at shots that are 10 feet wide of the net etc 0 
i received it quickly and it works great 1 
very very fun chef 1 
some highlights great quality nigiri here 1 
eew this location needs a complete overhaul 0 
they could serve it with just the vinaigrette and it may make for a better overall dish but it was still very good 1 
now the burgers arent as good the pizza which used to be amazing is doughy and flavorless 0 
good value great food great service 1 
the majority of the logitech earbud headsets failed 0 
waited 2 hours never got either of our pizzas as many other around us who came in later did 0 
but kevin spacey is an excellent verbal tsunami as buddy ackerman  and totally believable because he is a great actor 1 
battery is terrible 0 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
this place should honestly be blown up 0 
the headsets are easy to use and everyone loves them 1 
however after about a year the fliptop started to get loose and wobbly and eventually my screen went black and i couldnt receive and place calls 0 
this movie is greatespecially if you enjoy visual arts 1 
the holster that arrived did not match the photo in the ad 0 
i might have gotten a defect but i would not risk buying it again because of the built quality alone 0 
my ribeye steak was cooked perfectly and had great mesquite flavor 1 
i hate writing bad reviews about films especially those in which i really like the star but this film is so bad i dont believe for one second that anyone could have been proud of it 0 
i really recommend this faceplates since it looks very nice elegant and cool 1 
first time there and might just be the last 0 
the acting by the whole cast could be put on a scale and balanced perfectly between overacting and underacting 0 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
yes its shiny on front side and i love it 1 
i am also very happy with the price 1 
do not make the same mistake as me 0 
i got home to see the driest damn wings ever 0 
crash is a depressing little nothing that provokes emotion but teaches you nothing if you already know racism and prejudice are bad things 0 
the atmosphere is modern and hip while maintaining a touch of coziness 1 
they really want to make your experience a good one 1 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
the bartender was also nice 1 
the steak was amazingrge fillet relleno was the best seafood plate i have ever had 1 
definitely worth checking out 1 
if you do go see this movie bring a pillow or a girlfriendboyfriend to keep you occupied through out 0 
the show would begin with smart ass ed comments to each other that would be totally off the wall and uncalled for 0 
a good film by a great director 1 
works for me 1 
i felt insulted and disrespected how could you talk and judge another human being like that 0 
i had high hopes for this place since the burgers are cooked over a charcoal grill but unfortunately the taste fell flat way flat 0 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
the only suspense i was feeling was the frustration at just how retarded the girls were 0 
its not what it says it is 0 
the headset fulfills my requirements so i am happy with my purchase 1 
i do love sushi but i found kabuki to be overpriced overhip and underservices 0 
i love this device 1 
the best electronics of the available fm transmitters 1 
this movie is bad 0 
i love the camera its really pretty good quality 1 
the malta settings are as dry and as barren as the dialogue 0 
works fine 1 
that movie was bad 0 
love this phone 1 
love this place hits the spot when i want something healthy but not lacking in quantity or flavor 1 
in fact its hard to remember that the part of ray charles is being acted and not played by the man himself 1 
food is way overpriced and portions are fucking small 0 
battery chargelife is quite long 1 
it is an hour and half waste of time following a bunch of very pretty high schoolers whine and cry about life 0 
the script is a big flawed mess 0 
the service was outshining i definitely recommend the halibut 1 
the phone is sturdy and waterproof 1 
no one at the table thought the food was above average or worth the wait that we had for it 0 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
a good time 1 
very nice and relaxing late night viewing 1 
it always cuts out and makes a beep beep beep sound then says signal failed 0 
a great way to finish a great 1 
for that its worth checking out 1 
the pizza tasted old super chewy in not a good way 0 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
it was a good thing that the tickets only cost five dollars because i would be mad if id have paid 750 to see this crap 0 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
with the originality and freshness of the first movie now spent this remake had little else to offer 0 
this is truly an art movieit actually has a lot of art in it 1 
i wasnt the least bit interested 0 
i really hope the team behind this movie makes more movies and that they will continue to do so in their own some kinda weird style 1 
overall i rate this movie a 10 out of a 110 scale 1 
works fine 1 
i guess it was supposed to be clever twist then shed some light on the situation but it was just stupid 0 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
i bought two of them and neither will charge 0 
for the price on amazon it is an excellent product which i would highly recommend 1 
love this place hits the spot when i want something healthy but not lacking in quantity or flavor 1 
im big fan of rpg games too but this movie its a disgrace to any selfrespecting rpger there is 0 
i could eat their bruschetta all day it is devine 1 
then theres the plot holes 0 
they are so cool 1 
thanks again to amazon for having the things i need for a good price 1 
fantastic earphones 1 
superb phone on a great network 1 
i am very happy 1 
if you are reading this please dont go there 0 
if there is a wind it is completely useless 0 
great phone 1 
the plastic breaks really easy on this clip 0 
dont do it 0 
if you love authentic mexican food and want a whole bunch of interesting yet delicious meats to choose from you need to try this place 1 
be sure to order dessert even if you need to pack it togo the tiramisu and cannoli are both to die for 1 
the server was very negligent of our needs and made us feel very unwelcome i would not suggest this place 0 
great place fo take out or eat in 1 
very very fun chef 1 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
unless youre just out to visually collect all extant films of austens work you can skip this one 0 
tom wilkinson broke my heart at the end and everyone elses judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike 1 
i struggle to find anything bad to say about it 1 
it was so cool 1 
bland not a liking this place for a number of reasons and i dont want to waste time on bad reviewing ill leave it at that 0 
how can that bethe audio quality is poor 0 
this place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver 0 
the potatoes were great and so was the biscuit 1 
saw the movie today and thought it was a good effort good messages for kids 1 
the movie was so boring that i sometimes found myself occupied peaking in the paper instead of watching never happened during a columbo movie before 0 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
poor quality 0 
would recommend this item 1 
i guess that nobody at the network that aired this dribble watched it before putting it on 0 
its reception is very very poor 0 
the awful dialogue and hopeless overacting by everyone who gets shot top off a real waste of space and time 0 
the flair bartenders are absolutely amazing 1 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
waste of 13 bucks 0 
great food and great service in a clean and friendly setting 1 
great food and service huge portions and they give a military discount 1 
if you hate earbugs avoid this phone by all means 0 
often the dialogue doesnt really follow from one line to another or fit the surroundings 0 
thats how id describe this painfully dreary timewaster of a film 0 
the chefs were friendly and did a good job 1 
i cant tell you how disappointed i was 0 
of course the footage from the 70s was grainy but that only enhanced the film 1 
which has more depth and character than the man underneath it 0 
its extremely slow and takes forever to do anything with it 0 
the potato chip order was sad i could probably count how many chips were in that box and it was probably around 12 0 
made very sturdy 1 
the service here leaves a lot to be desired 0 
tried to go here for lunch and it was a madhouse 0 
i left with a stomach ache and felt sick the rest of the day 0 
kids pizza is always a hit too with lots of great side dish options for the kiddos 1 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
the budget was evidently very limited 0 
i highly recommend this modest priced cellular phone 1 
my rating just 3 out of 10 0 
the best phone in market 1 
you will leave the theater wanting to go out and dance under the stars 1 
great phone 1 
there is no real plot 0 
the food wasnt good 0 
the manager was the worst 0 
i am pairing this with my iphone and i could not be happier with it so far 1 
he was very impressed when going from the original battery to the extended battery 1 
the acting sucked 0 
what a piece of junk i lose more calls on this phone 0 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
this was like the final blow 0 
mishima is extremely uninteresting 0 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
a must study for anyone interested in the worst sins of industrial design 0 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
not enough volume 0 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
i loved it it was really scary 1 
i tried talking real loud but shouting on the telephone gets old and i was still told it wasnt great 0 
the eargels channel the sound directly into your ear and seem to increase the sound volume and clarity 1 
this film highlights the fundamental flaws of the legal process that its not about discovering guilt or innocence but rather is about who presents better in court 1 
the chicken i got was definitely reheated and was only ok the wedges were cold and soggy 0 
the acting helps the writing along very well maybe the idiotsavant sister could have been played better and it is a real joy to watch 1 
i got it because it was so small and adorable 1 
but now i was completely grossed out 0 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
service is perfect and the family atmosphere is nice to see 1 
the voice recognition thru the handset is excellent 1 
anyways the food was definitely not filling at all and for the price you pay you should expect more 0 
im in az all the time and now have my new spot 1 
if it was to turn my good day feeling into a night of disturbing memories than i guess he succeeded 0 
the aerial scenes were welldone 1 
no ear loop needed its tiny and the sound is great 1 
the least said about the acting the better 0 
this film has no redeeming features 0 
seafood was limited to boiled shrimp and crab legs but the crab legs definitely did not taste fresh 0 
i bought this to use with my kindle fire and absolutely loved it 1 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
we literally sat there for 20 minutes with no one asking to take our order 0 
ill definitely be in soon again 1 
the performances are real and gripping the crocdodile is extremely well done indeed if the black water website is to be believed thats because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous 1 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
this is an extraordinary film 1 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
couldnt ask for a more satisfying meal 1 
it wasnt busy either also the building was freezing cold 0 
this second appearance of mickey mouse following the silent plane crazy earlier that year is probably his most famous filmmostly because it was so groundbreaking 1 
very disappointed 0 
it was also the right balance of war and love 1 
i love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it 1 
the food was barely lukewarm so it must have been sitting waiting for the server to bring it out to us 0 
the biggest complaint i have is the battery drains superfast 0 
i think that it is a must see older john wayne film 1 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
even worse than ticker 0 
it is unusable in a moving car at freeway speed 0 
very satisifed with that 1 
i felt insulted and disrespected how could you talk and judge another human being like that 0 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
i dont think ill be running back to carlys anytime soon for food 0 
took an hour to get our food only 4 tables in restaurant my food was luke warm our sever was running around like he was totally overwhelmed 0 
good protection and does not make phone too bulky 1 
if you are razr owneryou must have this 1 
were jerks on the phone 0 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
but other than that the movie seemed to drag and the heroes didnt really work for their freedom 0 
plug was the wrong size 0 
battery chargelife is quite long 1 
there is however some pretty good acting at least for this type of film 1 
the attractive set used throughout most of the film is an eyepleasing gem 1 
drinks took close to 30 minutes to come out at one point 0 
if you are looking for a good quality motorola headset keep looking this isnt it 0 
buyerbe very careful 0 
this may be the only bad film he ever made 0 
however i recently watched the whole thing again on dvd and i was completely struck by how extremely stupid the storyline was how it contained holes inconsistencies and frankly a whole lot of crap and how horrid the dancing was 0 
i advise everyone do not be fooled 0 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
i cant see how this movie can be an inspiration to anyone to come out or overcome fear and rejection 0 
terrible phone holder 0 
i highly recommend this movie for anyone interested in art poetry theater politics or japanese history 1 
soggy and not good 0 
i really wanted the plantronics 510 to be the right one but it has too many issues for methe good 0 
the least said about the acting the better 0 
think it over when you plan to own this onethis sure is the last moto phone for me 0 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
on the ground right next to our table was a large smeared beensteppedinandtrackedeverywhere pile of green bird poop 0 
the best place in vegas for breakfast just check out a sat or sun 1 
worked very well paired with a treo 700w and as a skype headset on my pc using a usb bluetooth transceiver 1 
you wont forget this movie 1 
i own a jabra earset and was very happy with it but the sound quality especially outgoing on this is better 1 
design flaw 0 
i left the theater with a lilt in my step joy in my heart and hope for the human race 1 
rating 010 grade z note the show is so bad that even mother of the cast pull her daughter out of the show 0 
the directing and the cinematography arent quite as good 0 
worst foodservice ive had in a while 0 
awful service 0 
its one of the movies i need to see whenever it comes on tvnever mind the fact that i already have it memorized 1 
everything about this movie is stupid 0 
we loved the biscuits 1 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
they could be used as exemplars for any set designer 1 
i like steiners because its dark and it feels like a bar 1 
the death row scenes were entirely unmoving 0 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
very disappointed and wondered how it could be in the oscar shortlist 0 
worthless product 0 
how can that bethe audio quality is poor 0 
woa talk about awful 0 
if you simply want a small flip phone look elsewhere as the extra bells whistles are mediocre 0 
of course the footage from the 70s was grainy but that only enhanced the film 1 
to call this movie a drama is ridiculous 0 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
this is a beautiful phone 1 
i paid the bill but did not tip because i felt the server did a terrible job 0 
you get what you pay for i guess 0 
great pocket pc phone combination 1 
considering the relations off screen between taylor and stanwyck it was surprising how little chemistry there was on screen between the two of them 0 
great product for the price 1 
waste your money on this game 1 
you wont be disappointed 1 
i highly recommend this modest priced cellular phone 1 
the very idea of it was lame take a minor character from a mediocre pg13 film and make a complete nonsequel while changing its tone to a pgrated family movie 0 
you wont forget this movie 1 
a week later after i activated it it suddenly died 0 
what a mistake that was 0 
the service here leaves a lot to be desired 0 
ordered an appetizer and took 40 minutes and then the pizza another 10 minutes 0 
the chicken wings contained the driest chicken meat i have ever eaten 0 
i guess that nobody at the network that aired this dribble watched it before putting it on 0 
its a mediocre miserable hollow laughable and predictable piece of garbage 0 
the only possible way this movie could be redeemed would be as mst3k fodder 0 
if you want a real scare rent this one 1 
it is a joy to use 1 
i could care less the interior is just beautiful 1 
it was packed 0 
simply beautiful 1 
i will come back here every time im in vegas 1 
dont waste your money 0 
i am going to have to be the first to negatively review this product 0 
a disappointment 0 
cumbersome design 0 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
be sure to order dessert even if you need to pack it togo the tiramisu and cannoli are both to die for 1 
could not get strong enough signal 0 
there is nothing authentic about this place 0 
i wasnt the least bit interested 0 
dont make the same mistake i did 0 
yes i am simplifying things here for the sake of brevity for this really is at the core of the problems with this film it has too much going on without any real fulfilling explanation 0 
no im going to eat the potato that i found some strangers hair in it 0 
awesome selection of beer 1 
it is wonderful and inspiring to watch and i hope that it gets released again on to video or dvd 1 
i am also very happy with the price 1 
also the area where my unit broke im not too fond of the magnetic strap 0 
excellent short film 1 
id rather eat airline food seriously 0 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
food was below average 0 
hard to judge whether these sides were good because we were grossed out by the melted styrofoam and didnt want to eat it for fear of getting sick 0 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
weird vibe from owners 0 
ill even say it again  this is torture 0 
his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic 1 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
improper description i had to return it 0 
what this film lacks is a convincing script 0 
great audio 1 
my ribeye steak was cooked perfectly and had great mesquite flavor 1 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
using all earpieces left or right this thing will not stay on my ear 0 
2 thumbs up 1 
the best part about nurse betty is its unpredictability 1 
and sometimes it was so embarrassing that i had to look away 0 
never again will i be dining at this place 0 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
but this movie is definitely a below average rent 0 
the movie lacks visual interest drama expression of feeling and celebration of the very patriotism that underlines the narrative 0 
despite the pans of reviewers i liked this movie 1 
the volume for the ringer is real good you have choices how loud 1 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
left very frustrated 0 
as a sushi lover avoid this place by all means 0 
the only downside is the service 0 
this if the first movie ive given a 10 to in years 1 
i would highly recommend this product 1 
rating 010 grade z note the show is so bad that even mother of the cast pull her daughter out of the show 0 
rude inconsiderate management 0 
the noise shield is incrediable 1 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
the story which was told so eloquently by francis ford coppola 25 years earlier really unfolds gradually and leaves room for the characters to develop 1 
i did not have any problem with this item and would order it again if needed 1 
plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job 1 
a great film by a great director 1 
they work about 2 weeks then break 0 
i was left shattered from the experience of watching this film and i took a good two hours to fully recover 0 
the owners really really need to quit being soooooo cheap let them wrap my freaking sandwich in two papers not one 0 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
waiter was a jerk 0 
this phone is very fast with sending any kind of messages and web browsing is significantly faster than previous phones i have used 1 
again lame 0
