i even dropped this phone into a stream and it was submerged for 15 seconds and it still works great 1 
very good lunch spot 1 
used and dirty 0 
overall a great experience 1 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
i ordered the voodoo pasta and it was the first time id had really excellent pasta since going gluten free several years ago 1 
anyway the plot flowed smoothly and the malebonding scenes were a hoot 1 
the explosion of the gas tanks at the end was just as awful 0 
why are these sad little vegetables so overcooked 0 
it was that year however that reminded us that huston was still at the top of his game as evinced by his faithful adaptation of james joyces acclaimed novella the dead 1 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
cant say enough good things about this place 1 
in fact its hard to remember that the part of ray charles is being acted and not played by the man himself 1 
i own a jabra earset and was very happy with it but the sound quality especially outgoing on this is better 1 
whatever the producer was going for he missed entirely 0 
im terribly disappointed that this film would receive so many awards and accolades especially when there are far more deserving works of film out there 0 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
i hate writing bad reviews about films especially those in which i really like the star but this film is so bad i dont believe for one second that anyone could have been proud of it 0 
this is a great product sure beats using your fingers 1 
i mean this in a terrible way 0 
the volume switch rocketed out of the unit to a destination unknown 0 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
comes with a strong light that you can use to light up your camera shots and even flash sos signals seriously 1 
its quite simply the highest most superlative form of cinema imaginable 1 
it was just too horrible 0 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
the directing seems too pretentious 0 
conclusion very filling meals 1 
oh yeah and the storyline was pathetic too 0 
this is was due to the fact that it took 20 minutes to be acknowledged then another 35 minutes to get our foodand they kept forgetting things 0 
after arguing with verizon regarding the dropped calls we returned the phones after two days 0 
anyway the plot flowed smoothly and the malebonding scenes were a hoot 1 
i work in the hospitality industry in paradise valley and have refrained from recommending cibo any longer 0 
i can think of no other film where something vitally important occurs every other minute 1 
and those baby owls were adorable 1 
it is easy to turn on and off when you are in the car and the volume controls are quite accessable 1 
i was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar not only because the quality is great but the service is fast and the food impeccable 1 
the fries were not hot and neither was my burger 0 
it was so cool 1 
the servers went back and forth several times not even so much as an are you being helped 0 
the food was outstanding and the prices were very reasonable 1 
back to good bbq lighter fare reasonable pricing and tell the public they are back to the old ways 1 
cumbersome design 0 
we walked away stuffed and happy about our first vegas buffet experience 1 
terrible management 0 
the plot such as it is is so derivative and predictable that the ending is like a mercy killing 0 
i enjoyed reading this book to my children when they were little 1 
seller shipped quickly and much cheaper than the competitors 1 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
it works fine on my motorola 325 cellphone and a lot better than the wornout battery did 1 
conclusion i loved it 1 
it sure does beat the nachos at the movies but i would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant 0 
i have always used corded headsets and the freedom from the wireless is very helpful 1 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
bad fit way too big 0 
the movie was so boring that i sometimes found myself occupied peaking in the paper instead of watching never happened during a columbo movie before 0 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
the scenes with the ohsomature neighbourgirl are a misplace 0 
this is a great product sure beats using your fingers 1 
i wasnt expecting oscar material but this 0 
not tasty and the texture was just nasty 0 
the speaker is of low quality so as making the ring tones sound very cheap 0 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
the songs were the best and the muppets were so hilarious 1 
everything was perfect the night we were in 1 
there is a lot of beautiful places 1 
it was awesome 1 
my mother and brother had to do thiswhen i saw robert ryan portraying this type of man it was a very good imitation of this type of individual and i was impressed 1 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
the pizza tasted old super chewy in not a good way 0 
this is a great little item 1 
unfortunately inexperience of direction meant that scene after scene passed with little in the way of dramatic tension or conflict 0 
it fits my ear well and is comfortable on 1 
this is a good joint 1 
to my disbelief each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods i have ever tasted 0 
they brought a fresh batch of fries and i was thinking yay something warm but no 0 
i want to first say our server was great and we had perfect service 1 
i enjoyed reading this book to my children when they were little 1 
it was just too horrible 0 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
the only downside is the service 0 
obviously they have a terrible customer service so you get what you pay for 0 
definitely worth checking out 1 
cant upload ringtones from a third party 0 
its one of the movies i need to see whenever it comes on tvnever mind the fact that i already have it memorized 1 
but it is great i would really recommend it 1 
the staff is great the food is delish and they have an incredible beer selection 1 
this results in the phone being either stuck at max volume or mute 0 
i started this review with two stars but im editing it to give it only one 0 
i highly recommend this movie for anyone interested in art poetry theater politics or japanese history 1 
hands down my favorite italian restaurant 1 
i never come again 0 
they keep getting better and better this is my third one and ive had numerous palms too 1 
the sound quality is excellent as well 1 
thanks good a movie like this was done and released 1 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
needless to say i wont be going back anytime soon 0 
walked in and the place smelled like an old grease trap and only 2 others there eating 0 
however i recently watched the whole thing again on dvd and i was completely struck by how extremely stupid the storyline was how it contained holes inconsistencies and frankly a whole lot of crap and how horrid the dancing was 0 
i left the theater with a lilt in my step joy in my heart and hope for the human race 1 
it was so bad i had lost the heart to finish it 0 
the bus boy on the other hand was so rude 0 
this film has no redeeming features 0 
star trek v the final frontier is the worst in the series 0 
it was forced like everything in this movie 0 
this greedy corporation will never see another dime from me 0 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
i couldnt think of a better way to end the film but a smile on my face great way to wrap up an amazing film and trilogy 1 
food arrived quickly 1 
i really liked that 1 
i was mortified 0 
i know this is not like the other restaurants at all something is very off here 0 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
it came free with a dvd player i bought but i still turned the thing off halfway through because i was embarrassed for howell 0 
the phone loads super 1 
will be back again 1 
this is one of the worst sandra bullock movie since speed 2 but not quite that bad 0 
the fact is this film is a wonderful heartwarming tale about two people chasing their dreams 1 
and i really did find them funny 1 
the sweet potato tots were good but the onion rings were perfection or as close as i have had 1 
great place to eat reminds me of the little mom and pop shops in the san francisco bay area 1 
so bad 0 
there are the usual hitchcock logic flaws 0 
at a time when it seems that film animation has been dominated by disneypixars cgi masterpieces it is both refreshing and comforting to know that miyazaki is still relying on traditional handdrawn animation to tell his charming and enchanting stories 1 
del taco is pretty nasty and should be avoided if possible 0 
you have to hold the phone at a particular angle for the other party to hear you clearly 0 
about half way through this film i started to dislike it 0 
the bathroom is just next door and very nice 1 
the burger i got the gold standard a 17 burger and was kind of disappointed 0 
i was shocked because no signs indicate cash only 0 
headset works great was packaged nicely to avoid any damage 1 
it lasts less than 3o minutes if i actually try to use the phonemy wife has the same phone with the same problem 0 
good value works fine power via usb car or wall outlet 1 
im in az all the time and now have my new spot 1 
their research and development division obviously knows what theyre doing 1 
i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
phone now holds charge like it did when it was new 1 
worse theres an incredibly weak subplot thrown in that follows a little band of latterday mansonites as they go after a reporter whos working on a story on the anniversary of the killings 0 
they have been around for years and carries the highest quality of antiglare screen protector that i have found to date 1 
great place to eat reminds me of the little mom and pop shops in the san francisco bay area 1 
awful service 0 
someone shouldve invented this sooner 1 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
unless youre just out to visually collect all extant films of austens work you can skip this one 0 
to summarize the food was incredible nay transcendant but nothing brings me joy quite like the memory of the pneumatic condiment dispenser 1 
each track commands sentiment actually contributing to the scenes and characters 1 
the secondary plot line is incomprehensible and its relation to the primary plot line is mystifying 0 
highquality chicken on the chicken caesar salad 1 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
using all earpieces left or right this thing will not stay on my ear 0 
the film deserves strong kudos for taking this stand for having exceptional acting from its mostly lesserknown cast and for the superintelligent script that doesnt insult the audience or take the easy way out when it comes to white racism 1 
i love the look and feel of samsung flipphones 1 
i gave it 5 stars because of the sound quality 1 
restaurant is always full but never a wait 1 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
definitely worth checking out 1 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
great phone 1 
bad characters bad story and bad acting 0 
just does not work 0 
this gets a 1 out of 10 simply because theres nothing lower 0 
always a great time at dos gringos 1 
the story itself is just predictable and lazy 0 
i just saw this film and i recommend it 1 
the lead man is charismafree 0 
this movie is so awesome 1 
his costars dont fare much better with people like morgan freeman jonah hill and ed helms just wasted 0 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
so anyone near you will hear part of your conversation 0 
very serious spoilers this movie was a huge disappointment 0 
the holster that arrived did not match the photo in the ad 0 
i cannot make calls at certain places 0 
like the other reviewer said you couldnt pay me to eat at this place again 0 
the scripting of the subtle comedy is unmatched by any movie in recent years 1 
definitely worth checking out 1 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
sucked most of the stuff does not work with my phone 0 
and finally after all that we get to an ending that wouldve been great had it been handled by competent people and not jerry falwell 0 
the meat was pretty dry i had the sliced brisket and pulled pork 0 
the decor is nice and the piano music soundtrack is pleasant 1 
and i just love the colors 1 
alexander nevsky is a great film 1 
on the negative its insipid enough to cause regret for another 2 hours of life wasted in front of the screen 0 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
the potato chip order was sad i could probably count how many chips were in that box and it was probably around 12 0 
the servers went back and forth several times not even so much as an are you being helped 0 
always a great time at dos gringos 1 
the building itself seems pretty neat the bathroom is pretty trippy but i wouldnt eat here again 0 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
it is super charged up for use as a small hybrid palmtopcameracellphone and excels in those roles 1 
the acting was bad 0 
conclusion very filling meals 1 
the only consistent thread holding the series together were the amazing performances of leni parker and anita laselva as the two taelons in quiet idealogical conflict 0 
artless camerawork endlessly presents us with the ugliest setting imaginable ie 0 
often the dialogue doesnt really follow from one line to another or fit the surroundings 0 
this place is not worth your time let alone vegas 0 
i think that it is a must see older john wayne film 1 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
babie bop is very cute 1 
works well 1 
also were served hot bread and butter and home made potato chips with bacon bits on topvery original and very good 1 
unfortunately it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees 0 
great steak great sides great wine amazing desserts 1 
it is an insane game 1 
i am very impressed with the job that motorola did on the sturdiness of this phone 1 
great place to eat reminds me of the little mom and pop shops in the san francisco bay area 1 
about 30 minutes of footage is wasted to show mediocre elderly actors awkwardly babbling overwrought pseudosatanic gibberish corny enough to make a teen goth blush almost always in olde english and sometimes in latin that may or may not be made up words 0 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
the food was very good 1 
worst thai ever 0 
if you love authentic mexican food and want a whole bunch of interesting yet delicious meats to choose from you need to try this place 1 
it showed exactly how the government and the scientist argued for humanity and the reasons of the gadget 1 
it shouldnt take 30 min for pancakes and eggs 0 
first of all there are enough racial stereotypes and racial jokes to offend everyone 0 
but kevin spacey is an excellent verbal tsunami as buddy ackerman  and totally believable because he is a great actor 1 
the price was very good and with the free shipping and all it was a good purchase 1 
it is a joy to use 1 
this is just a great movie 1 
not a good item it worked for a while then started having problems in my auto reverse tape player 0 
but when i check voice mail at night the keypad backlight turns off a few seconds into the first message and then im lost 0 
i would have casted her in that role after ready the script 1 
this gets a 1 out of 10 simply because theres nothing lower 0 
does not work 0 
either way it sucks 0 
no one at the table thought the food was above average or worth the wait that we had for it 0 
it was absolutely amazing 1 
1 hour 54 minutes of sheer tedium melodrama and horrible acting a mess of a script and a sinking feeling of good lord what were they thinking 0 
this is not moviemaking 0 
a great touch 1 
there was hardly any meat 0 
dont buy this product 0 
you cant beat the price on these 1 
it defeats the purpose of a bluetooth headset 0 
at no point in the proceedings does it look remotely like america 0 
if you dont find it too bad as again the unit comes with one earpad onlyi would not recommend this to anyone 0 
the instructions didnt explain that a microphone jack could be used 0 
simply beautiful 1 
im not eating here 0 
it was clear that she had the range and ability to pull off this part 1 
there were too many close ups 0 
no plot whatsoever 0 
the volume for the ringer is real good you have choices how loud 1 
reasonably priced also 1 
but i definitely would not eat here again 0 
the best place in vegas for breakfast just check out a sat or sun 1 
only pros large seating area nice bar area great simple drink menu the best brick oven pizza with homemade dough 1 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
and those baby owls were adorable 1 
excellent sound battery life and inconspicuous to boot 1 
just reading on the specs alone makes you say wow 1 
i own a jabra earset and was very happy with it but the sound quality especially outgoing on this is better 1 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
my boyfriend and i came here for the first time on a recent trip to vegas and could not have been more pleased with the quality of food and service 1 
you wont regret it 1 
great food and awesome service 1 
i am a fan of his this movie sucked really bad 0 
the chips that came out were dripping with grease and mostly not edible 0 
the staff is great the food is delish and they have an incredible beer selection 1 
great product for the price 1 
its a mediocre miserable hollow laughable and predictable piece of garbage 0 
everything captain howdy says is either laughable or just plain stupid 0 
people couldnt hear me talk and i had to pull out the earphone and talk on the phone 0 
i have purchased these for both family and friends and all enjoy their clarity and ease of use 1 
dont waste your money 0 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
its reception is very very poor 0 
for sushi on the strip this is the place to go 1 
i loved it 1 
there are the usual hitchcock logic flaws 0 
no additional ear gels provided and no instructions whatsoever 0 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
this movie has a cutting edge to it 1 
it is cheap and it feel and look just as cheap 0 
now the pizza itself was good the peanut sauce was very tasty 1 
took an hour to get our food only 4 tables in restaurant my food was luke warm our sever was running around like he was totally overwhelmed 0 
but it does get better reception and clarity than any phone ive had before 1 
but when i check voice mail at night the keypad backlight turns off a few seconds into the first message and then im lost 0 
not recommended 0 
ive missed numerous calls because of this reason 0 
product is exactly as described 1 
we wont be going back 0 
tom wilkinson broke my heart at the end and everyone elses judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike 1 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
but the premise of the film was so ridiculous that the president of the us 0 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
go rent it 1 
everything about this product is wrongfirst 0 
the bathroom is just next door and very nice 1 
ray charles life provided excellent biographical material for the film which goes well beyond being just another movie about a musician 1 
im pleased 1 
rating 1 out of 10 0 
everyone is treated equally special 1 
its just adorable seeing mickey playing turkey in the straw in a highly imaginative if occasionally cruel way 1 
the waitresses are very friendly 1 
actually the graphics were good at the time 1 
as for the service im a fan because its quick and youre being served by some nice folks 1 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
1010 1 
what a waste 0 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
excellent starter wireless headset 0 
but then they came back cold 0 
it lasts less than 3o minutes if i actually try to use the phonemy wife has the same phone with the same problem 0 
these were so good we ordered them twice 1 
fantastic buy and will get again for whatever my next phone is 1 
good servicecheck 1 
excellent product for the price 1 
the food was outstanding and the prices were very reasonable 1 
thus far have only visited twice and the food was absolutely delicious each time 1 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
it is just the sort of pap that is screened in the afternoon to punish the unemployed for not having jobs 0 
it shouldnt take 30 min for pancakes and eggs 0 
but whatever it was that cost them so much it didnt translate to quality thats for sure 0 
better than expected 1 
this place is overpriced not consistent with their boba and it really is overpriced 0 
by far the best cheesecurds we have ever had 1 
the food amazing 1 
you cant beat that 1 
will go back next trip out 1 
the ngage is still lacking in earbuds 0 
phone falls out easily 0 
the only suspense i was feeling was the frustration at just how retarded the girls were 0 
this totally unfunny movie is so over the top and pathetic and unrealistic that throughout the whole 90 minutes of utter torture i probably looked at my watch about 70000 times 0 
i believe that this place is a great stop for those with a huge belly and hankering for sushi 1 
delicious and i will absolutely be back 1 
the writer gorman bechard undoubtedly did his homework because all references are industry and characterage appropriate 1 
the volume for the ringer is real good you have choices how loud 1 
excellent product for the price 1 
this is a very average phone with bad battery life that operates on a weak network 0 
none of the new ones have ever quite worked properly 0 
generally it just lacked imagination 0 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
the waitresses are very friendly 1 
this fixes all the problems 1 
we had 7 at our table and the service was pretty fast 1 
definitely worth checking out 1 
it will drive you barking mad 0 
the cast of veteran actors are more than just a nostalgia trip 1 
you learn a lot about the real inside emotions of people in this movie and a lot about the movie business itself 1 
it had some average acting from the main person and it was a low budget as you clearly can see 0 
great software for motorolas 1 
i totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is 1 
the characters are interesting even if a bit predictable 1 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
waaaaaayyyyyyyyyy over rated is all i am saying 0 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
overall i wasnt very impressed with noca 0 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
you get extra minutes so that you can carry out the call and not get cut off 1 
if you love death and decay and shakespears lyrics this is the one 1 
the handsfree part works fine but then the car tries to download the address book and the treo rebootsoverall i still rate this device high 1 
the delivery was on time 1 
a world better than 95 of the garbage in the theatres today 1 
delicious 1 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
this is a great little item 1 
and then tragedy struck 0 
does not work for listening to music with the cingular 8125 0 
i like design and look of jabra behing the ear headsets and 5020 is pretty comfortible to wear 24 hours a day without pain in the ear 1 
i have to use the smallest earpieces provided but it stays on pretty well 1 
extremely tasty 1 
hitchcock is a great director 1 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
truly awful 0 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
but it wasnt anything at all just one big yawn 0 
one of the best mexican movies ever and one of the less understood even by mexican themselves no matter how identified the should have felt with it 1 
youll love it 1 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
this phone might well be the worst ive ever had in any brand 0 
great place to relax and have an awesome burger and beer 1 
very disappointing 0 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
shrimp when i unwrapped it i live only 12 a mile from brushfire it was literally ice cold 0 
the biggest complaint i have is the battery drains superfast 0 
i put the latest os on it v115g and it now likes to slow to a crawl and lock up every once in a while 0 
ive never been more insulted or felt disrespected 0 
it was probably dirt 0 
there was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters 0 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
i love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it 1 
on the ground right next to our table was a large smeared beensteppedinandtrackedeverywhere pile of green bird poop 0 
highly recommended 1 
the owner used to work at nobu so this place is really similar for half the price 1 
the service was extremely slow 0 
ive also had problems with the phone reading the memory card in which i always turn it on and then off again 0 
good protection and does not make phone too bulky 1 
after 20 minutes wait i got a table 0 
unfortunately this is a bad movie that is just plain bad 0 
dont go here 0 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
the phone gets extremely hot 0 
as a courtroom drama its compelling as an indictment on the american justice system its frightening 1 
just really good so far probably the best bt headset i have ever had 1 
clear crisp sound 1 
very clear quality sound and you dont have to mess with the sound on your ipod since you have the sound buttons on the headset 1 
overall i was not impressed and would not go back 0 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
excellent product for the price 1 
anyways the food was definitely not filling at all and for the price you pay you should expect more 0 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
in fact im going to round up to 4 stars just because she was so awesome 1 
i didnt realize how wonderful the short really is until the last two scenes 1 
to be honest with you this is unbelievable nonsense and very foolish 0 
some great music and terrific scenery 1 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
meredith m was better than all right 1 
best of luck to the rude and noncustomer service focused new management 0 
i would advise to not purchase this item it never worked very well 0 
spoilers whatever else can or cant be said about it surface is superbly crafted 1 
we were promptly greeted and seated 1 
stopped by during the late may bank holiday off rick steve recommendation and loved it 1 
all of the tapas dishes were delicious 1 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
my brother in law who works at the mall ate here same day and guess what he was sick all night too 0 
it is just the sort of pap that is screened in the afternoon to punish the unemployed for not having jobs 0 
star trek v the final frontier is the worst in the series 0 
i cannot make calls at certain places 0 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
in summary this was a largely disappointing dining experience 0 
friends pasta also bad he barely touched it 0 
this game rocks 1 
its a fresh subtle and rather sublime effect 1 
often the dialogue doesnt really follow from one line to another or fit the surroundings 0 
they do not last forever but is not overly expensive to replaceeasy to operate and the sound is much better than others i have tried 1 
great brunch spot 1 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
the best place to go for a tasty bowl of pho 1 
probably never coming back and wouldnt recommend it 0 
server did a great job handling our large rowdy table 1 
that being said for a phone the camera is very nice many cool effects to play with and video is decent as well 1 
love the margaritas too 1 
tom wilkinson broke my heart at the end and everyone elses judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike 1 
the meat was pretty dry i had the sliced brisket and pulled pork 0 
my drink was never empty and he made some really great menu suggestions 1 
the tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu 0 
hackneyed writing certainly but made even worse by the bad directing 0 
no im going to eat the potato that i found some strangers hair in it 0 
the majority of the logitech earbud headsets failed 0 
but the service was beyond bad 0 
awful service 0 
in conclusion i will not bother with this movie because a volcano in los angeles is nothing but nonsense 0 
terrible phone holder 0 
what a waste of money and time 0 
cant upload ringtones from a third party 0 
battery chargelife is quite long 1 
it makes very strange ticking noises before it ends the call 0 
the pleather case doesnt fit 0 
summary the witticisms werent witty 0 
as a sushi lover avoid this place by all means 0 
nice spicy and tender 1 
not much dialogue not much music the whole film was shot as elaborately and aesthetically like a sculpture 1 
this totally unfunny movie is so over the top and pathetic and unrealistic that throughout the whole 90 minutes of utter torture i probably looked at my watch about 70000 times 0 
i really liked that 1 
ps the only scene in the movie that was cool is when the central character finds her room blown up 1 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
nice spicy and tender 1 
its the one movie that never ceases to interest me simply because it keeps me alert as i try to attempt to decipher its meanings 1 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
the secondary plot line is incomprehensible and its relation to the primary plot line is mystifying 0 
the movie is not completely perfect but titta di girolamo will stay with you for a long time after the vision of the movie 1 
i love lane but ive never seen her in a movie this lousy 0 
this movie suffered because of the writing it needed more suspense 0 
product is useless since it does not have enough charging current to charge the 2 cellphones i was planning to use it with 0 
i did not expect this to be so good 1 
one character is totally annoying with a voice that gives me the feeling of fingernails on a chalkboard 0 
often the dialogue doesnt really follow from one line to another or fit the surroundings 0 
the movie showed a lot of florida at its best made it look very appealing 1 
the salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop which was perfectly cooked 1 
i cannot believe that the actors agreed to do this film 0 
the handsfree part works fine but then the car tries to download the address book and the treo rebootsoverall i still rate this device high 1 
dont waste your money 0 
ordered burger rare came in well done 0 
these are certainly very comfortable and functionality is decent 1 
last time buying from you 0 
she carries the movie well 1 
and the beans and rice were mediocre at best 0 
back to good bbq lighter fare reasonable pricing and tell the public they are back to the old ways 1 
if you dont find it too bad as again the unit comes with one earpad onlyi would not recommend this to anyone 0 
voice recognition is tremendous 1 
the chips and salsa were really good the salsa was very fresh 1 
wed definitely go back here again 1 
fantastic service here 1 
great service and food 1 
this particular model would not work with my motorola q smartphone 0 
do not buy for d807wrongly advertised for d807 0 
even when the women finally show up there is no sign of improvement the most expected things happen and by the time the film is over you might be far asleep 0 
there are many continuity errors one other user commented on different cars in the garage joes glassesthe one that got to me the most was the fact joes facial hair configuration seemed to change from scene to scene 0 
the best place in vegas for breakfast just check out a sat or sun 1 
theres also enough hypocrisy in this film to make me vomit 0 
not recommended 0 
works fine 1 
nonlinear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well 1 
third the cheese on my friends burger was cold 0 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
there still are good actors around 1 
however after seeing the short again after about 25 years i was amazed at how timeless the film actually is 1 
her role was played well 1 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
the plot simply rumbles on like a machine desperately depending on the addition of new scenes 0 
the characters are interesting even if a bit predictable 1 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
if you hate earbugs avoid this phone by all means 0 
the screen does get smudged easily because it touches your ear and face 0 
but what really made it unwatchable was the direction 0 
the best example of how dumb the writing is when its established that you can turn the zombiestudents back into humans by removing a necklace containing a piece of the meteorite 0 
the screen does get smudged easily because it touches your ear and face 0 
see it 1 
this is an extraordinary film 1 
this pair of headphones is the worst that i have ever had soundwise 0 
excellent performance 1 
the shower area is outside so you can only rinse not take a full shower unless you dont mind being nude for everyone to see 0 
after charging overnight these batteries work great 1 
awful service 0 
once you get inside youll be impressed with the place 1 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
also great directing and photography 1 
what happened next was prettyoff putting 0 
it has everything i need and i couldnt ask for more 1 
great place to relax and have an awesome burger and beer 1 
is it possible for a movie to get any worse than this 0 
youll love how thin it is 1 
fans of the genre will be in heaven 1 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
john garfield ann revere lilli plmer william conrad canada leeand filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screenjames wong howe 1 
soyo technology sucks 0 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
definitely worth checking out 1 
the characters are fleshed out surprisingly well particularly grimes and blake and all the actors deliver their sharply scripted lines with just the right amount of deadpan tongue in cheek to make the dialogue both hilarious and realistic 1 
the service was a bit lacking 0 
in addition it feels amp looks as if the phone is all lightweight cheap plastic 0 
dont make the same mistake i did 0 
the aerial scenes were welldone 1 
waste of 13 bucks 0 
but whatever it was that cost them so much it didnt translate to quality thats for sure 0 
service is friendly and inviting 1 
as always the evening was wonderful and the food delicious 1 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
there is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again 0 
great hands free device 1 
it has everything i need and i couldnt ask for more 1 
i will never forget it now 1 
its welldesigned and very sharp the blue is a very nice color 1 
the cast was great 1 
i dont think there are any redeeming qualities in this remake 0 
dont buy it 0 
an hour and a half i wish i could bring back 0 
the steak was amazingrge fillet relleno was the best seafood plate i have ever had 1 
i recently had problems where i could not stay connected for more than 10 minutes before being disconnected 0 
is pretty funny 1 
best service and food ever maria our server was so good and friendly she made our day 1 
excellent product for the price 1 
that one didnt work either 0 
the warm beer didnt help 0 
i love this place 1 
considering the relations off screen between taylor and stanwyck it was surprising how little chemistry there was on screen between the two of them 0 
on the up side their cafe serves really good food 1 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
it plays louder than any other speaker of this size the price is so low that most would think the quality is lacking however its not 1 
excellent product for the price 1 
and generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode 0 
that company is a joke 0 
the atmosphere was great with a lovely duo of violinists playing songs we requested 1 
i am not a filmmaker nor am i a director but i would hide my head in the sand if id spent whatever amount of money and time on this movie 0 
very good food great atmosphere1 1 
i gave it 5 stars because of the sound quality 1 
shrimp when i unwrapped it i live only 12 a mile from brushfire it was literally ice cold 0 
spoilers whatever else can or cant be said about it surface is superbly crafted 1 
the sound quality is good and functionality is awesome 1 
the pairing of the two devices was so easy it barely took a couple minutes before i started making calls with the voice dialing feature 1 
its been my choice headset for yearsgreat sound good volume good noise cancellation 1 
the macarons here are insanely good 1 
a bit predictable 0 
regrettably the film fails 0 
definitely worth seeing its the sort of thought provoking film that forces you to question your own threshold of loneliness 1 
the stories were powerful explorations of the nature of man and of art 1 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
i can say that the desserts were yummy 1 
nothing new there 0 
however the keypads are so tinny that i sometimes reach the wrong buttons 0 
favorite place in town for shawarrrrrrma 1 
the delivery was on time 1 
the charger arrived within the promised timeframe but it did not work 0 
then theres the plot holes 0 
weird vibe from owners 0 
helen baxendale is a very credible lady macbeth who can be very cheerfull at times and sometimes she just looks like a naughty girl but deadly in her taste for blood and evil 1 
the story line is totally predictable 0 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
too politically correct 0 
he really didnt seem to want to be hosting his voiceovers were monotonous didnt get involved with the guests 0 
i am also very happy with the price 1 
this was my first time and i cant wait until the next 1 
we will not be coming back 0 
our server was super nice and checked on us many times 1 
linksys should have some way to exchange a bad phone for a refurb unit or something 0 
the poor actors 0 
i waited and waited 0 
every element of this story was so over the top excessively phony and contrived that it was painful to sit through 0 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
battery is holding up well 1 
i vomited in the bathroom mid lunch 0 
both rickman and stowe play their roles to the hilt in this tale of a childrens book writer who maybe has written a subversive tract 1 
there is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again 0 
we got the food and apparently they have never heard of salt and the batter on the fish was chewy 0 
we waited an hour for what was a breakfast i could have done 100 times better at home 0 
we have gotten a lot of compliments on it 1 
works great 1 
but this movie is not funny considering the ridiculousness of it 0 
best tater tots in the southwest 1 
do not make the same mistake as me 0 
that company is a joke 0 
he was terrible 0 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
it will drive you barking mad 0 
the burger had absolutely no flavor the meat itself was totally bland the burger was overcooked and there was no charcoal flavor 0 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
i mean this in a terrible way 0 
very satisifed with that 1 
youd have to have the iq of particularly stupid mollusk not to see that one coming 0 
the film deserves strong kudos for taking this stand for having exceptional acting from its mostly lesserknown cast and for the superintelligent script that doesnt insult the audience or take the easy way out when it comes to white racism 1 
the real killer is the volume and of course it breaking 0 
the characters are interesting and you want to find out more about them the longer the movie goes on and i think people will be surprised by who does and doesnt make it 1 
very disappointing 0 
these were so good we ordered them twice 1 
kind of flops around 0 
there were several moments in the movie that just didnt need to be there and were excruciatingly slow moving 0 
if good intentions made a film great then this film might be one of the greatest films ever made 1 
a good time 1 
the service was poor and thats being nice 0 
the company shipped my product very promptly and it works well 1 
the sound quality for the device is unacceptableunless you are in a really quiet area you almost hear nothing 0 
tied to charger for conversations lasting more than 45 minutesmajor problems 0 
john wayne did an incredible job for being so young in the movie industry 1 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
they were goldencrispy and delicious 1 
headset works great was packaged nicely to avoid any damage 1 
this is high adventure at its best 1 
this was one of the worst films i have ever seen 0 
the phone is sturdy and waterproof 1 
they were goldencrispy and delicious 1 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
i great reception all the time 1 
if that bug never showed up i would have given a 4 for sure but on the other side of the wall where this bug was climbing was the kitchen 0 
the buffet at bellagio was far from what i anticipated 0 
the cast is good 1 
damn good steak 1 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
will be back again 1 
a cheap and cheerless heist movie with poor characterisation lots of underbite style stoic emoting think chow yun fat in a better tomorrow and some cheesy clichés thrown into an abandoned factory ready for a few poorly executed flying judo rolls a la john woo 0 
great charger 1 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
the sound quality is excellent as well 1 
the lighting is just dark enough to set the mood 1 
it had some average acting from the main person and it was a low budget as you clearly can see 0 
i got home to see the driest damn wings ever 0 
brilliant 1 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
owners are really great people 1 
extremely tasty 1 
i gave it 5 stars because of the sound quality 1 
the lead man is charismafree 0 
this frog phone charm is adorable and very eye catching 1 
i ordered the voodoo pasta and it was the first time id had really excellent pasta since going gluten free several years ago 1 
unfortunately inexperience of direction meant that scene after scene passed with little in the way of dramatic tension or conflict 0 
if you have not seen this movie i definitely recommend it 1 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
great phone 1 
i left the theater with a lilt in my step joy in my heart and hope for the human race 1 
this totally unfunny movie is so over the top and pathetic and unrealistic that throughout the whole 90 minutes of utter torture i probably looked at my watch about 70000 times 0 
this movie is so awesome 1 
and it was way to expensive 0 
which are small and not worth the price 0 
amazon sucks 0 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
i loved their mussels cooked in this wine reduction the duck was tender and their potato dishes were delicious 1 
thats how id describe this painfully dreary timewaster of a film 0 
unreliable im giving up 0 
perabo has a nice energy level and is obviously very comfortable in front of a camera 1 
i would recommend purchasing the jabra jx10 series 2 which works flawlessly with my moto q go figure 1 
if you stay in vegas you must get breakfast here at least once 1 
the steaks are all well trimmed and also perfectly cooked 1 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
phenomenal food service and ambiance 1 
on the negative its insipid enough to cause regret for another 2 hours of life wasted in front of the screen 0 
and then tragedy struck 0 
things that went wrong they burned the saganaki 0 
the food was terrible 0 
the menu had so much good stuff on it i could not decide 1 
very disappointed in accessoryone 0 
good audio quality 1 
these are the central themes of the film and they are handled ineptly stereotypically and with no depth of imagination 0 
not only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic but it also managed to give away the entire movie and im not exaggerating every moment every plot point every joke is told in the trailer 0 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
its reception is very very poor 0 
and the accents are absolutely abysmal 0 
dee snider just plain sucks 0 
that one didnt work either 0 
really good product 1 
the only downside is the service 0 
my sister has one also and she loves it 1 
i was bored throughout the whole damn thing 0 
their menu is diverse and reasonably priced 1 
the nachos are a must have 1 
good show samsung 1 
waited 2 hours never got either of our pizzas as many other around us who came in later did 0 
i wouldnt return 0 
i just dont know how this place managed to served the blandest food i have ever eaten when they are preparing indian cuisine 0 
if you dont find it too bad as again the unit comes with one earpad onlyi would not recommend this to anyone 0 
perabo has a nice energy level and is obviously very comfortable in front of a camera 1 
i hate movies like that 0 
the movie is terribly boring in places 0 
not impressed 0 
wow very spicy but delicious 1 
this place deserves no stars 0 
i wasnt really impressed with strip steak 0 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
the sets especially designed to work with the camera are amazingstylized beautiful and effective 1 
this phone is pretty sturdy and ive never had any large problems with it 1 
it came free with a dvd player i bought but i still turned the thing off halfway through because i was embarrassed for howell 0 
this is just a great movie 1 
i ordered the voodoo pasta and it was the first time id had really excellent pasta since going gluten free several years ago 1 
helen baxendale is a very credible lady macbeth who can be very cheerfull at times and sometimes she just looks like a naughty girl but deadly in her taste for blood and evil 1 
it lasts less than 3o minutes if i actually try to use the phonemy wife has the same phone with the same problem 0 
i loved their mussels cooked in this wine reduction the duck was tender and their potato dishes were delicious 1 
the bus boy on the other hand was so rude 0 
the noise shield is incrediable 1 
awesome device 1 
phenomenal food service and ambiance 1 
by this time our side of the restaurant was almost empty so there was no excuse 0 
id love to go back 1 
unfortunately it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees 0 
there was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth but it didnt really work into the rest of the plot 0 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
im really disappointed all i have now is a charger that doesnt work 0 
restaurant is always full but never a wait 1 
a very charming film with wonderful sentiment and heart 1 
service was good and the company was better 1 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
this one is simply a disappointment 0 
i am so tired of clichés that is just lazy writing and here they come in thick and fast 0 
this is one of the best movies out there that shows such strong sibling bond for each other 1 
this movie is so awesome 1 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
i might have gotten a defect but i would not risk buying it again because of the built quality alone 0 
this is cool because most cases are just open there allowing the screen to get all scratched up 1 
this game rocks 1 
thanks again to amazon for having the things i need for a good price 1 
cant store anything but phone numbers to sim 0 
bad reception 0 
i let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this bad idea we both hated it 0 
another note about this phones appearance is that it really looks rather bland especially in the all black model 0 
i swung in to give them a try but was deeply disappointed 0 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
made very sturdy 1 
its like a really sexy party in your mouth where youre outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party 1 
i just cant explain this movie more than romanticcharminghilariousand adorablethe junkyard scenes are funnyall the junkyard dogs have something specialtoo funny i laughedkids will love itbuy it when it comes outit has new features 1 
i love the look and feel of samsung flipphones 1 
this movie creates its own universe and is fascinating in every way 1 
everything about this film is simply incredible 1 
this is my new fav vegas buffet spot 1 
just reading on the specs alone makes you say wow 1 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
weve have gotten a much better service from the pizza place next door than the services we received from this restaurant 0 
on the up side their cafe serves really good food 1 
voice quality signal strength dropped calls 0 
the selection on the menu was great and so were the prices 1 
1 hour 54 minutes of sheer tedium melodrama and horrible acting a mess of a script and a sinking feeling of good lord what were they thinking 0 
the fried rice was dry as well 0 
saw the movie today and thought it was a good effort good messages for kids 1 
great food 1 
this is a stunning movie 1 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
personally i think it shows that people should learn to find a compromise them self without involving other people into issue 1 
i received my orders well within the shipping timeframe everything was in good working order and overall i am very excited to have this source 1 
nice case feels good in your hands 1 
not loud enough and doesnt turn on like it should 0 
everything about it is just bad 0 
the ripped banana was not only ripped but petrified and tasteless 0 
the file browser offers all the options that one needshandsfree is great 1 
im still trying to get over how bad it was 0 
nice spicy and tender 1 
worst service to boot but that is the least of their worries 0 
and the beans and rice were mediocre at best 0 
it was that year however that reminded us that huston was still at the top of his game as evinced by his faithful adaptation of james joyces acclaimed novella the dead 1 
that was done in the second movie 0 
every thing on phone work perfectly she like it 1 
still waiting im sure this item would work well if i ever recieve it 0 
up there with the best of melville 1 
save your money ive had this item for 11 months now 0 
this movie is excellentangel is beautiful and scamp is adorablehis little yelps when hes scaredand the funniest parts are whenscamp is caught under the curtain and when angel and scamp are singing ive never had this feeling beforei totally recommend this movieits coming out on special edition on june 20the cover has scamp on a garbage can and angel underneath the lid 1 
it plays louder than any other speaker of this size the price is so low that most would think the quality is lacking however its not 1 
painful on the ear 0 
the concert sequences just sucked 0 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
the acting is terrible and the writing is worse 0 
i think that it is a must see older john wayne film 1 
they will customize your order any way youd like my usual is eggplant with green bean stir fry love it 1 
i advise you to look out for it 1 
plus it was wellpaced and suited its relatively short run time 1 
beware this is not a trashy cult movie this is trash period 0 
will be back again 1 
it finds my cell phone right away when i enter the car 1 
ive never been treated so bad 0 
i saw this short film on hbo the other day and absolutely loved it 1 
i will continue to come here on ladies night andddd date night highly recommend this place to anyone who is in the area 1 
great phone 1 
ray charles is legendary 1 
ive seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie 0 
i really enjoyed eating here 1 
im a big fan of this series mostly due to anne rices style sensitivities and treatments 1 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
this is a great phone 1 
doesnt last long 0 
the microphone also works well but according to people i have called it applifies everything 1 
i wasnt expecting oscar material but this 0 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
reasonably priced also 1 
this was reflected not only in the cast but also in the belowpar script which borrowed much from the earlier classic 0 
the movie was so boring that i sometimes found myself occupied peaking in the paper instead of watching never happened during a columbo movie before 0 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
ive had this bluetoooth headset for some time now and still not comfortable with the way it fits on the ear 0 
restaurant is always full but never a wait 1 
every thing on phone work perfectly she like it 1 
the aerial scenes were welldone 1 
but then they came back cold 0 
the story which was told so eloquently by francis ford coppola 25 years earlier really unfolds gradually and leaves room for the characters to develop 1 
he came running after us when he realized my husband had left his sunglasses on the table 1 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
the fish is badly made and some of its underwater shots are repeated a thousand times in the film 0 
much more interesting more action more suspense and less of the unneeded controversy 1 
strike 2 who wants to be rushed 0 
the speaker is of low quality so as making the ring tones sound very cheap 0 
i probably would not go here again 0 
i am a fan of his this movie sucked really bad 0 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
very poor service 0 
however after finally watching this film i realized that not only had i had a closed mind to the brilliance it depicts i also found myself watching it over and over again 1 
bland and flavorless is a good way of describing the barely tepid meat 0 
a good time 1 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
integrated seamlessly with the motorola razr phone 1 
the decor is nice and the piano music soundtrack is pleasant 1 
during several different 2 minute calls i experienced 5 drops and it was in an area that had 5 bars 0 
the real disappointment was our waiter 0 
reception is terrible and full of static 0 
here in the wind and the lion we see a wonderful rendering of americas own imperial age 1 
those burgers were amazing 1 
there is so much good food in vegas that i feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to rice and company 0 
hell no will i go back 0 
she carries the movie well 1 
the eargels channel the sound directly into your ear and seem to increase the sound volume and clarity 1 
please dont waste your money 0 
dont waste your money 0 
it was pretty gross 0 
cumbersome design 0 
considering the relations off screen between taylor and stanwyck it was surprising how little chemistry there was on screen between the two of them 0 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
lasted one day and then blew up 0 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
ive had this for nearly 2 years and it has worked great for me 1 
horrible horrible protector 0 
of all the dishes the salmon was the best but all were great 1 
seller shipped quickly and much cheaper than the competitors 1 
works great when my cat attacked the phone he scratched the protective strip instead of destroying the screen 1 
doesnt last long 0 
i liked the patio and the service was outstanding 1 
the attention given to every character and complex psychological portrayals detailing loyalty treachery love and hope are tremendous 1 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
they could be used as exemplars for any set designer 1 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
they do not last forever but is not overly expensive to replaceeasy to operate and the sound is much better than others i have tried 1 
conclusion very filling meals 1 
the service was great even the manager came and helped with our table 1 
the burger had absolutely no flavor the meat itself was totally bland the burger was overcooked and there was no charcoal flavor 0 
before i go in to why i gave a 1 star rating please know that this was my third time eating at bachi burger before writing a review 0 
i felt as though her going to ireland did absolutely nothing whatsoever 0 
rude inconsiderate management 0 
i did not bother contacting the company for few dollar product but i learned the lesson that i should not have bought this form online anyway 0 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
no shifting no bubbling no peeling not even a scratch nothingi couldnt be more happier with my new one for the droid 1 
however i needed some better instructions 0 
my drink was never empty and he made some really great menu suggestions 1 
excellent dualpurpose headset 1 
arrived quickly and much less expensive than others being sold 1 
the flair bartenders are absolutely amazing 1 
we enjoy their pizza and brunch 1 
the hockey scenes are terrible defensemen playing like theyre 5 years old goalies diving at shots that are 10 feet wide of the net etc 0 
perfect for the ps3 1 
jawbone era is awesome too 1 
good food good service 1 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
thank you for wasting my money 0 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
go and see it 1 
we waited for thirty minutes to be seated although there were 8 vacant tables and we were the only folks waiting 0 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
product was excellent and works better than the verizon one and boy was it cheaper 1 
reception is terrible and full of static 0 
dont buy it 0 
the lighting is awful 0 
however i recently watched the whole thing again on dvd and i was completely struck by how extremely stupid the storyline was how it contained holes inconsistencies and frankly a whole lot of crap and how horrid the dancing was 0 
worst customer service 0 
i dont have to be an accountant to know im getting screwed 0 
now the burgers arent as good the pizza which used to be amazing is doughy and flavorless 0 
come hungry leave happy and stuffed 1 
looks great and is strong 1 
the plantains were the worst ive ever tasted 0 
from here on the widmark character turns unintentionally comical 0 
barney is definitely super de duper 1 
definitely will come back here again 1 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
the transfers are very good 1 
thank you for such great service 1 
it was either too cold not enough flavor or just bad 0 
the only thing i did like was the prime rib and dessert section 1 
not even good for camp value 0 
the loudspeaker option is great the bumpers with the lights is very appealing 0 
this is an unbelievable bargain 1 
very friendly staff 1 
always a great time at dos gringos 1 
the owner used to work at nobu so this place is really similar for half the price 1 
excellent performance 1 
now the pizza itself was good the peanut sauce was very tasty 1 
i love that they put their food in nice plastic containers as opposed to cramming it in little paper takeout boxes 1 
i thought errol flynn was brilliant as custer and has since become my favourite actor 1 
its this pandering to the audience that sabotages most of his films 0 
i came over from verizon because cingulair has nicer cell phones the first thing i noticed was the really bad service 0 
its a shame to see good actors like thomerson and james make a living in a mess like this 0 
i saw mirrormask last night and it was an unsatisfactory experience 0 
battery chargelife is quite long 1 
the lines the cuts the audio everything is wrong 0 
really really good rice all the time 1 
not too screamy not to masculine but just right 1 
omg the food was delicioso 1 
needless to say we will never be back here again 0 
full of unconvincing cardboard characters it is blandly written by edward chodorov who also produced and is surprisingly directed by jean negulesco from whom one would expect a great deal more 0 
the two main characters may be two of the most believable children i ever saw put on screen 1 
great audio 1 
the story line is just awful 0 
in summary this was a largely disappointing dining experience 0 
works great 1 
disappointing accessory from a good manufacturer 0 
design flaw 0 
the price was very good and with the free shipping and all it was a good purchase 1 
the writers were smack on and i think the best actors and actresses were a bonus to the showthese characters were so real 1 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
i as well wouldve given godfathers zero stars if possible 0 
waiter was a jerk 0 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
the cashier was friendly and even brought the food out to me 1 
the food is rich so order accordingly 1 
even in my bmw 3 series which is fairly quiet i have trouble hearing what the other person is saying 0 
nevertheless yet another wonderful film from the great masters stable 1 
oh yeah and the storyline was pathetic too 0 
the food was excellent and service was very good 1 
i dont understand how this garbage got on the shelves of the movie store its not even a real movie 0 
not good when wearing a hat or sunglasses 0 
the mic there is a joke and the volume is quite low 0 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
the phone crashed completely and now i have to get it replaced 0 
i highly recommend this case 1 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
linked to my phone without effort 1 
very very sad 0 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
good value works fine power via usb car or wall outlet 1 
he is one of my favourite directors and one of the most talented directors in the history of cinema 1 
if there was ever an indication of a writer and a directors ability to meld two highly volatile temperaments into a seamless union of creativity then this is it 1 
everything captain howdy says is either laughable or just plain stupid 0 
phenomenal food service and ambiance 1 
i was shocked because no signs indicate cash only 0 
ive never been more insulted or felt disrespected 0 
everything was fresh and delicious 1 
jabra ear gels r the best 1 
although i very much liked the look and sound of this place the actual experience was a bit disappointing 0 
the acting is terrible and the writing is worse 0 
delicious 1 
i believe that pitch black was done well 1 
excellent product for the price 1 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
this is an excellent tool especially when paired with your phones autoanswer 1 
and then tragedy struck 0 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
if you want a real scare rent this one 1 
the acting is fantastic the stories are seamlessly woven together and the dogs are splendid a must rent view or see 1 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
i was not impressed by this product 0 
this movie totally grates on my nerves 0 
alexander nevsky is a great film 1 
when achille and philippa beautifully sing a duet from don giovanni that perfectly describes their situation in the movie you appreciate the subtle layers of this excellent film 1 
pretty piece of junk 0 
i saw mirrormask last night and it was an unsatisfactory experience 0 
awsome device works great 1 
great pocket pc phone combination 1 
about ten minutes into this film i started having second thoughts 0 
hands down my favorite italian restaurant 1 
in addition to having one of the most lovely songs ever written french cancan also boasts one of the cutest leading ladies ever to grace the screen 1 
i wont be back 0 
one of my favorite purchases ever 1 
its the one movie that never ceases to interest me simply because it keeps me alert as i try to attempt to decipher its meanings 1 
i did not bother contacting the company for few dollar product but i learned the lesson that i should not have bought this form online anyway 0 
the majority of the logitech earbud headsets failed 0 
i like armand assante my cable companys summary sounded interesting so i watched it twice already and probably will again 1 
it had some average acting from the main person and it was a low budget as you clearly can see 0 
it didnt charge for me 0 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
just as good as when i had it more than a year ago 1 
i really loved the story line and the poler bear was kinda cutebut if anyone has a question about fort steele just ask away 1 
this movie creates its own universe and is fascinating in every way 1 
the lines the cuts the audio everything is wrong 0 
barney is definitely super de duper 1 
the bose noise cancelling is amazing which is very important for a nyc commuter 1 
but now that it is out of warranty the same problems reoccurebottom line put your money somewhere else cingular will not support it 0 
very disappointed 0 
the loudspeaker option is great the bumpers with the lights is very appealing 0 
the movie is not completely perfect but titta di girolamo will stay with you for a long time after the vision of the movie 1 
sauce was tasteless 0 
he really didnt seem to want to be hosting his voiceovers were monotonous didnt get involved with the guests 0 
she carries the movie well 1 
this is a very average phone with bad battery life that operates on a weak network 0 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
the goat taco didnt skimp on the meat and wow what flavor 1 
the refried beans that came with my meal were dried out and crusty and the food was bland 0 
this is a great phone 1 
highly unprofessional and rude to a loyal patron 0 
this was my first and only vegas buffet and it did not disappoint 1 
krussel always good 1 
lucy bell is so much higher than this crap and for her to sink this low is quite depressing 0 
bt50 battery junk 0 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
that said our mouths and bellies were still quite pleased 1 
why was this film made 0 
perhaps i caught them on an off night judging by the other reviews but im not inspired to go back 0 
nothing at all to recommend 0 
it will drive you barking mad 0 
not only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic but it also managed to give away the entire movie and im not exaggerating every moment every plot point every joke is told in the trailer 0 
50 down the drain 0 
mobile phone tools are a must have 1 
the staff is always super friendly and helpful which is especially cool when you bring two small boys and a baby 1 
the ambiance isnt much better 0 
i like the fact that it rests lightly against your ear rather than inside 1 
if you simply want a small flip phone look elsewhere as the extra bells whistles are mediocre 0 
he was extremely rude and really there are so many other restaurants i would love to dine at during a weekend in vegas 0 
garbo who showed right off the bat that her talents could carry over from the silent era i wanted to see some of her silent work but netflix doesnt seem to be stocking them 1 
the phone crashed completely and now i have to get it replaced 0 
the management is rude 0 
love this place hits the spot when i want something healthy but not lacking in quantity or flavor 1 
not good for the money 0 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
definitely a turn off for me i doubt ill be back unless someone else is buying 0 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
it kept getting worse and worse so now im officially done 0 
the characters are fleshed out surprisingly well particularly grimes and blake and all the actors deliver their sharply scripted lines with just the right amount of deadpan tongue in cheek to make the dialogue both hilarious and realistic 1 
now the pizza itself was good the peanut sauce was very tasty 1 
so in a nutshell 1 the restaraunt smells like a combination of a dirty fish market and a sewer 0 
definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly will return next time im in vegas 1 
doesnt hold charge 0 
crust is not good 0 
your servers suck wait correction our server heimer sucked 0 
at first i thought i was grtting a good deal at 744 until i plugged it into my phone v3c razr 0 
waitress was good though 1 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
i wouldnt see this movie again for free 0 
this is the first phone ive had that has been so cheaply made 0 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
overall the film is interesting and thoughtprovoking 1 
the eargels channel the sound directly into your ear and seem to increase the sound volume and clarity 1 
the real killer is the volume and of course it breaking 0 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
the cast of veteran actors are more than just a nostalgia trip 1 
this gets a 1 out of 10 simply because theres nothing lower 0 
however after seeing the short again after about 25 years i was amazed at how timeless the film actually is 1 
the dialogue is composed of things that make little sense 0 
those phones are working just fine now 1 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
youll love how thin it is 1 
coming here is like experiencing an underwhelming relationship where both parties cant wait for the other person to ask to break up 0 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
this was reflected not only in the cast but also in the belowpar script which borrowed much from the earlier classic 0 
the nokia ca42 usb cable did not work with my phone 0 
headset works great was packaged nicely to avoid any damage 1 
the worst phone from samsungcrap this crappy samsung e715 is the worst i have ever seeen 0 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
shes poised and amazing 1 
the phone is sturdy and waterproof 1 
im trying to return it for a refund 0 
but this movie is definitely a below average rent 0 
this product is clearly not ready for prime time i dont care how cool it looks if you cant tell a call is coming in its worthless 0 
the chicken i got was definitely reheated and was only ok the wedges were cold and soggy 0 
they have a really nice atmosphere 1 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
after 20 minutes wait i got a table 0 
my order was not correct 0 
the pancake was also really good and pretty large at that 1 
the food was terrible 0 
and the chef was generous with his time even came around twice so we can take pictures with him 1 
maybe its just their vegetarian fare but ive been twice and i thought it was average at best 0 
this movie is a good and humorous comment on life in 2006 1 
its extremely slow and takes forever to do anything with it 0 
there were several moments in the movie that just didnt need to be there and were excruciatingly slow moving 0 
del taco is pretty nasty and should be avoided if possible 0 
big disappointment with calendar sync 0 
comfortable in my hand 1 
by this time our side of the restaurant was almost empty so there was no excuse 0 
heres where the movie really pied me off 0 
avoid at any and all costs 0 
whatever the producer was going for he missed entirely 0 
i guess that nobody at the network that aired this dribble watched it before putting it on 0 
i gave it 5 stars then and im giving it 5 stars now 1 
this movie does an excellent job of revealing the complexity of the task and the incredible challenges facing south africa 1 
this blueant supertooth handsfree phone speaker is awesome 1 
hard to judge whether these sides were good because we were grossed out by the melted styrofoam and didnt want to eat it for fear of getting sick 0 
is it possible for a movie to get any worse than this 0 
the staff is friendly and the joint is always clean 1 
we will not be coming back 0 
i wasnt expecting oscar material but this 0 
i struggle to find anything bad to say about it 1 
great product and price 1 
battery lasts only a few hours 0 
this pair of headphones is the worst that i have ever had soundwise 0 
my rating just 3 out of 10 0 
didnt laugh or even smile once 0 
this is an outstanding little restaurant with some of the best food i have ever tasted 1 
this is a great product sure beats using your fingers 1 
i hate writing bad reviews about films especially those in which i really like the star but this film is so bad i dont believe for one second that anyone could have been proud of it 0 
she ordered a toasted english muffin that came out untoasted 0 
the sound quality is good and functionality is awesome 1 
actually the graphics were good at the time 1 
easily none other cartoon made me laugh in a tender way before getting into dark sitcoms oriented for teenagers 1 
woa talk about awful 0 
and sometimes it was so embarrassing that i had to look away 0 
i got it because it was so small and adorable 1 
i mean really how do you get so famous for your fish and chips when its so terrible 0 
as for the killer dont expect anything original or even remotely frightening 0 
its pretty easy 1 
however i recently watched the whole thing again on dvd and i was completely struck by how extremely stupid the storyline was how it contained holes inconsistencies and frankly a whole lot of crap and how horrid the dancing was 0 
the death row scenes were entirely unmoving 0 
ill definitely be in soon again 1 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
this game rocks 1 
id advise anyone to go and see it 1 
it showed exactly how the government and the scientist argued for humanity and the reasons of the gadget 1 
stay away from this store be careful 0 
not good for the money 0 
it was pretty gross 0 
very poor service 0 
but above all the exquisite visual composition of each moment with inventive and elegant use of closeup camera angle and lighting including pointillistic faux home movie footage is a wonder and joy to behold 1 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
we got the food and apparently they have never heard of salt and the batter on the fish was chewy 0 
the service was poor and thats being nice 0 
that was funny 1 
the service was outshining i definitely recommend the halibut 1 
then our food came out disappointment ensued 0 
in the summer you can dine in a charming outdoor patio so very delightful 1 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
it dit not work most of the time with my nokia 5320 0 
i have never had such bland food which surprised me considering the article we read focused so much on their spices and flavor 0 
i have never had such bland food which surprised me considering the article we read focused so much on their spices and flavor 0 
what a waste of money and time 0 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
this game rocks 1 
i wasnt really impressed with strip steak 0 
it was not good 0 
everyone is very attentive providing excellent customer service 1 
they have horrible attitudes towards customers and talk down to each one when customers dont enjoy their food 0 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
all this movie does is make you sick watching all these slackers make excuses for their stupid actions for 90 minutes 0 
it was delicious 1 
i advise you to look out for it 1 
its a sad movie but very good 1 
not good by any stretch of the imagination 0 
it is light has plenty of battery capacity and is very confortable to wear for somewhat extended periods of time 1 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
not sure who was more lost the flat characters or the audience nearly half of whom walked out 0 
horrible had to switch 3 times 0 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
still i do like this movie for its empowerment of women theres not enough movies out there like this one 1 
however i recently watched the whole thing again on dvd and i was completely struck by how extremely stupid the storyline was how it contained holes inconsistencies and frankly a whole lot of crap and how horrid the dancing was 0 
it is worth the drive 1 
your servers suck wait correction our server heimer sucked 0 
to call this movie a drama is ridiculous 0 
one of the best mexican movies ever and one of the less understood even by mexican themselves no matter how identified the should have felt with it 1 
piece of junk 0 
this is probably one of the least effective and utterly unoriginal films i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
i immediately said i wanted to talk to the manager but i did not want to talk to the guy who was doing shots of fireball behind the bar 0 
lightweight and works well 1 
also difficult to put onid recommend avoiding this product 0 
do not buy for d807wrongly advertised for d807 0 
it was horrible 0 
this place lacked style 0 
waitress was sweet and funny 1 
overall i rate this movie a 10 out of a 110 scale 1 
it is light has plenty of battery capacity and is very confortable to wear for somewhat extended periods of time 1 
sending it back 0 
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
there were several moments in the movie that just didnt need to be there and were excruciatingly slow moving 0 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
avoid avoid avoid 0 
product is useless since it does not have enough charging current to charge the 2 cellphones i was planning to use it with 0 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
car charger as well as ac charger are included to make sure you never run out of juicehighy recommended 1 
both films are terrible but to the credit of the 1986 version it was watchable 0 
both films are terrible but to the credit of the 1986 version it was watchable 0 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
they are so easy to love but even more easy to identify with 1 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
we also ordered the spinach and avocado salad the ingredients were sad and the dressing literally had zero taste 0 
i have been to very few places to eat that under no circumstances would i ever return to and this tops the list 0 
brilliant 1 
works well 1 
we loved the biscuits 1 
conclusion i loved it 1 
lange had become a great actress 1 
perfect for someone me who only likes beer ice cold or in this case even colder 1 
i really liked that 1 
will never ever go back and have told many people what had happened 0 
makes it easier to keep up with my bluetooth when im not wearing it 0 
i recently had problems where i could not stay connected for more than 10 minutes before being disconnected 0 
so good i am going to have to review this place twice once hereas a tribute to the place and once as a tribute to an event held here last night 1 
and the rest of it just sits there being awful with soldiers singing songs about the masculinity they pledge themselves to hairsplitting about purity the admiration of swords etc 0 
wont ever go here again 0 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
comfortable in my hand 1 
the company shipped my product very promptly and it works well 1 
it was just too horrible 0 
the worst was the salmon sashimi 0 
thats how id describe this painfully dreary timewaster of a film 0 
service sucks 0 
the script is a big flawed mess 0 
the earpiece on this is too large or too heavyit keeps falling out of my ear 0 
they have a really nice atmosphere 1 
the bathroom is just next door and very nice 1 
fantastic buy and will get again for whatever my next phone is 1 
service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is vegas and located inside the crystals shopping mall by aria 1 
brilliance indeed 1 
the vegetables are so fresh and the sauce feels like authentic thai 1 
the pairing of the two devices was so easy it barely took a couple minutes before i started making calls with the voice dialing feature 1 
i still maintain that monkeys shouldnt make headphones we just obviously dont share enough dna to copy the design over to humans 0 
every time he opened his mouth you expect to hear you see kids pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show 0 
i was disgusted because i was pretty sure that was human hair 0 
the construction of the headsets is poor 0 
the only thing that i think could improve is the sound leaks out from the headset 0 
this is a great phone 1 
not good by any stretch of the imagination 0 
i hope this place sticks around 1 
avoid at all costs 0 
i found a six inch long piece of wire in my salsa 0 
id rather eat airline food seriously 0 
what a disappointment 0 
there was no chemistry between ben affleck and sandra bullock in this film and i couldnt understand why he would consider even leaving his wifetobe for this chick that he supposedly was knocked out by 0 
considering the relations off screen between taylor and stanwyck it was surprising how little chemistry there was on screen between the two of them 0 
there are so many problems i dont know where to start 0 
but the movie makes a lot of serious mistakes 0 
i promise they wont disappoint 1 
its welldesigned and very sharp the blue is a very nice color 1 
in my house i was getting dropped coverage upstairs and no coverage in my basement 0 
the server was very negligent of our needs and made us feel very unwelcome i would not suggest this place 0 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
i probably wont be coming back here 0 
nargile i think you are great 1 
hands down my favorite italian restaurant 1 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
the plastic breaks really easy on this clip 0 
the phone is sturdy and waterproof 1 
not what i wanted 0 
i could not understand what kind of idiot would produce this mess in the first place not to mention several season 0 
all the bread is made inhouse 1 
this is a very average phone with bad battery life that operates on a weak network 0 
it felt too light and tinny 0 
the bose noise cancelling is amazing which is very important for a nyc commuter 1 
the only thing that i think could improve is the sound leaks out from the headset 0 
for a self proclaimed coffee cafe i was wildly disappointed 0 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
it has been a winner for us 1 
dont go here 0 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
not much flavor to them and very poorly constructed 0 
i mean really how do you get so famous for your fish and chips when its so terrible 0 
5 stars for the brick oven bread app 1 
highly recommend for any one who has a blue tooth phone 1 
dont waste your money 0 
classywarm atmosphere fun and fresh appetizers succulent steaks baseball steak 1 
all i can do is whine on the internet so here it goesthe more i use the thing the less i like it 0 
all this movie does is make you sick watching all these slackers make excuses for their stupid actions for 90 minutes 0 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
phone falls out easily 0 
to sum the film up breeders is a terrible cheaply made horror movie that should be avoided like the ebola virus 0 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
both do good jobs and are quite amusing 1 
strike 2 who wants to be rushed 0 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
every element of this story was so over the top excessively phony and contrived that it was painful to sit through 0 
join the club and get awesome offers via email 1 
the construction of the headsets is poor 0 
either way it sucks 0 
i wasnt the least bit interested 0 
regardless the film fails on most levels 0 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
crostini that came with the salad was stale 0 
its so stupid to have to keep buying new chargers car chargers cradles headphones and car kits every time a new phone comes out 0 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
wed definitely go back here again 1 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
i was mortified 0 
i can assure you that you wont be disappointed 1 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
oh this is such a thing of beauty this restaurant 1 
the wind and the lion is well written and superbly acted 1 
pricing is a bit of a concern at mellow mushroom 0 
if you want a sandwich just go to any firehouse 1 
this is the first phone ive had that has been so cheaply made 0 
the noise shield is incrediable 1 
i had high hopes for this place since the burgers are cooked over a charcoal grill but unfortunately the taste fell flat way flat 0 
im probably one of the few people to ever go to ians and not like it 0 
used and dirty 0 
it lasts less than 3o minutes if i actually try to use the phonemy wife has the same phone with the same problem 0 
i was very excited to get this headset because i thought it was really cute 1 
this phone tries very hard to do everything but fails at its very ability to be a phone 0 
id rather eat airline food seriously 0 
is it possible for a movie to get any worse than this 0 
service was very prompt 1 
everyone is very attentive providing excellent customer service 1 
characters are onedimensional even the good guys and especially the bad guys 0 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
we walked away stuffed and happy about our first vegas buffet experience 1 
hated it 0 
stopped by during the late may bank holiday off rick steve recommendation and loved it 1 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
i bought this phone as a replacement for my startac and have regretted it since 0 
this item is great installed it let it charged up overnite and it has been working good every since with no problems 1 
i enjoyed reading this book to my children when they were little 1 
this one wants to surf on the small wave of space movies in 1998 deep impact and armageddon and this one fails everywhere 0 
it sure does beat the nachos at the movies but i would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant 0 
it didnt make me scared horrified or make me sympathetic towards the characters it was simply annoying 0 
we have gotten a lot of compliments on it 1 
steve martin delivers a really funny performance of a middleaged upper class uptight white guy 1 
it quit working after id used it for about 18 months so i just purchased another one because this is the best headset ive ever owned 1 
id rather eat airline food seriously 0 
good food good service 1 
each day of the week they have a different deal and its all so delicious 1 
the buttons for on and off are bad 0 
horrible dont waste your time and money 0 
thank you for wasting my money 0 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
the chips that came out were dripping with grease and mostly not edible 0 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
the sangria was about half of a glass wine full and was 12 ridiculous 0 
poor voice clarity 0 
they are so cool 1 
i was very pleased to see that i could replace my well travled swivel holster for my blackberry flip 1 
ive missed numerous calls because of this reason 0 
its worth driving up from tucson 1 
i really loved the story line and the poler bear was kinda cutebut if anyone has a question about fort steele just ask away 1 
the death row scenes were entirely unmoving 0 
we waited for forty five minutes in vain 0 
excellent sound quality 1 
the manager was the worst 0 
seller shipped quickly and much cheaper than the competitors 1 
very good lunch spot 1 
judith light is one of my favorite actresses and i think she does a superb job in this film 1 
this movie suffered because of the writing it needed more suspense 0 
bought mainly for the charger which broke soon after purchasing 0 
at first glance it is a lovely bakery cafe nice ambiance clean friendly staff 1 
lets start with all the problemsthe acting especially from the lead professor was very very bad 0 
so far so good 1 
dont waste your money and time 0 
lame would be the best way to describe it 0 
the stories were as unbelievable as the actors 0 
i am pairing this with my iphone and i could not be happier with it so far 1 
which are small and not worth the price 0 
i have read others reviews here but i havent had any problem with it 1 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
ive had this bluetoooth headset for some time now and still not comfortable with the way it fits on the ear 0 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
items stated as included from the description are not included 0 
this place is overpriced not consistent with their boba and it really is overpriced 0 
in my house i was getting dropped coverage upstairs and no coverage in my basement 0 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
it has everything i need and i couldnt ask for more 1 
this place receives stars for their appetizers 1 
will not be back 0 
i could care less the interior is just beautiful 1 
arrived quickly and much less expensive than others being sold 1 
the story starts too fast with absolutely no suspense or buildup in the slightest 0 
his use of the colours of the french flag in the three films was nothing short of incredible every shot every scene was like a work of art 1 
the food came out at a good pace 1 
we waited for thirty minutes to be seated although there were 8 vacant tables and we were the only folks waiting 0 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
judith light is one of my favorite actresses and i think she does a superb job in this film 1 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
after arguing with verizon regarding the dropped calls we returned the phones after two days 0 
this place is good 1 
the service was great even the manager came and helped with our table 1 
the burger had absolutely no flavor the meat itself was totally bland the burger was overcooked and there was no charcoal flavor 0 
the cinematographyif it can be called thatsucked 0 
and generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode 0 
i keep watching it over and over 1 
finally after three or four times the spring of the latch broke and i could not use it any longer on the visor 0 
i know this is not like the other restaurants at all something is very off here 0 
after 3 months screen just went black all of a sudden 0 
2 thumbs up 1 
i gave it 5 stars because of the sound quality 1 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
the best example of how dumb the writing is when its established that you can turn the zombiestudents back into humans by removing a necklace containing a piece of the meteorite 0 
the point is the journey a journey that touches every member of the family 1 
this is one of peter watkins most accessible films 1 
i contacted the company and they told me that although the unit was still under warranty if i couldnt produce my receipt i was out of luck 0 
i work in the hospitality industry in paradise valley and have refrained from recommending cibo any longer 0 
looks great and is strong 1 
i would recommend saving room for this 1 
the chefs were friendly and did a good job 1 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
now this dish was quite flavourful 1 
every thing on phone work perfectly she like it 1 
almost all of the songs in cover girl are oldfashioned and not very tuneful 0 
awful service 0 
this place is good 1 
the bose noise cancelling is amazing which is very important for a nyc commuter 1 
i do love sushi but i found kabuki to be overpriced overhip and underservices 0 
but in any case the best part is you can download these pictures to your laptop using ir or even send pictures from your laptop to the phone 1 
very disappointed 0 
it was a waste of my money 0 
the two main characters may be two of the most believable children i ever saw put on screen 1 
best headset ever 1 
but kevin spacey is an excellent verbal tsunami as buddy ackerman  and totally believable because he is a great actor 1 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
the story which was told so eloquently by francis ford coppola 25 years earlier really unfolds gradually and leaves room for the characters to develop 1 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
in conclusion i will not bother with this movie because a volcano in los angeles is nothing but nonsense 0 
the acting by the whole cast could be put on a scale and balanced perfectly between overacting and underacting 0 
worthwhile 1 
but this movie is not funny considering the ridiculousness of it 0 
i dont know what the big deal is about this place but i wont be back yaall 0 
pricing is a bit of a concern at mellow mushroom 0 
it was a riot to see hugo weaving play a sexobsessed gay real estate salesman who uses his clients houses for his trysts with the flaming darren tom hollander 1 
waste of 13 bucks 0 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
food was delicious 1 
the service here is fair at best 0 
i just cant explain this movie more than romanticcharminghilariousand adorablethe junkyard scenes are funnyall the junkyard dogs have something specialtoo funny i laughedkids will love itbuy it when it comes outit has new features 1 
light weight i hardly notice it is there 1 
the spaghetti is nothing special whatsoever 0 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
this wonderful experience made this place a muststop whenever we are in town again 1 
i put the latest os on it v115g and it now likes to slow to a crawl and lock up every once in a while 0 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
poor quality and service 0 
why was this film made 0 
the screen size is big key pad lit well enough and the camera quality is excellent for a camera phone 1 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
everything about it is just bad 0 
overall a delight 1 
the text messaging feature is really tricky to use 0 
product is exactly as described 1 
secondly hitchcock pretty much perfected the thriller and chase movie 1 
this does not fit the palm tungsten e2 and it broke the first time i tried to plug it in 0 
i am so pleased to know such a modern day genius is out there letting is passion for art drive him and taking us as an audience with him 1 
improper description i had to return it 0 
waste of money 0 
same evening him and i are both drastically sick 0 
overall i wasnt very impressed with noca 0 
camera color balance is awful 0 
this was my first time and i cant wait until the next 1 
the cg opening sequence in space looked like it could have been created on microsoft slideshow for gods sake 0 
weve tried to like this place but after 10 times i think were done with them 0 
either way it sucks 0 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
this was a poor remake of my best friends wedding 0 
awesome service and food 1 
we waited for thirty minutes to be seated although there were 8 vacant tables and we were the only folks waiting 0 
plus it was wellpaced and suited its relatively short run time 1 
you wont forget this movie 1 
i dont think it would hold it too securly on your belt 0 
great for the jawbone 1 
this blueant supertooth handsfree phone speaker is awesome 1 
the chips that came out were dripping with grease and mostly not edible 0 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
every element of this story was so over the top excessively phony and contrived that it was painful to sit through 0 
macbeth jason connery moved me to tears with his final monolog out brief candle outhe gave the sphere of moral decay and dark forces a human face which makes it the more interesting 1 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
they never brought a salad we asked for 0 
for people who are first timers in film making i think they did an excellent job 1 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
favorite place in town for shawarrrrrrma 1 
check it out 1 
very comfortable 1 
better than expected 1 
ive dropped my phone more times than i can say even on concrete and my phone is still great knock on wood 1 
there are massive levels massive unlockable characters its just a massive game 1 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
back to good bbq lighter fare reasonable pricing and tell the public they are back to the old ways 1 
you need two hands to operate the screenthis software interface is decade old and cannot compete with new software designs 0 
i highly recommend this case 1 
these are the nicest restaurant owners ive ever come across 1 
by this time our side of the restaurant was almost empty so there was no excuse 0 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
this item worked great but it broke after 6 months of use 0 
the acting is fantastic the stories are seamlessly woven together and the dogs are splendid a must rent view or see 1 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
that just screams legit in my booksomethats also pretty rare here in vegas 1 
the meat was pretty dry i had the sliced brisket and pulled pork 0 
ive never been treated so bad 0 
this case seems well made 1 
the characters are interesting and you really care for them 1 
i like armand assante my cable companys summary sounded interesting so i watched it twice already and probably will again 1 
wonderful lil tapas and the ambience made me feel all warm and fuzzy inside 1 
i was shocked because no signs indicate cash only 0 
this is high adventure at its best 1 
in addition to having one of the most lovely songs ever written french cancan also boasts one of the cutest leading ladies ever to grace the screen 1 
regrettably the film fails 0 
this place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver 0 
it lasts less than 3o minutes if i actually try to use the phonemy wife has the same phone with the same problem 0 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
arrived quickly and much less expensive than others being sold 1 
disappointing accessory from a good manufacturer 0 
there was a warm feeling with the service and i felt like their guest for a special treat 1 
there is really nothing for me at postinos hope your experience is better 0 
the tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu 0 
we made the drive all the way from north scottsdale and i was not one bit disappointed 1 
my 810 score is mostly for the plot 1 
waited and waited and waited 0 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
the warmth it generates is in contrast to its austere backdrop 1 
good value great food great service 1 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
it looked like a wonderful story 1 
the selection of food was not the best 0 
worst service to boot but that is the least of their worries 0 
we had so much to say about the place before we walked in that he expected it to be amazing but was quickly disappointed 0 
i immediately said i wanted to talk to the manager but i did not want to talk to the guy who was doing shots of fireball behind the bar 0 
it is worth the drive 1 
i definitly recommend 1 
a good film by a great director 1 
her role was played well 1 
it is unusable in a moving car at freeway speed 0 
by far the best cheesecurds we have ever had 1 
its kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly its embarrassing how childlike the company is 0 
works good 1 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
i put the latest os on it v115g and it now likes to slow to a crawl and lock up every once in a while 0 
insults profound deuchebaggery and had to go outside for a smoke break while serving just to solidify it 0 
very very sad 0 
helen baxendale is a very credible lady macbeth who can be very cheerfull at times and sometimes she just looks like a naughty girl but deadly in her taste for blood and evil 1 
the soundtrack wasnt terrible either 1 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
im pleased 1 
highly recommended 1 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
its a feelgood film and thats how i felt when i came out of the cinema 1 
the point is the journey a journey that touches every member of the family 1 
i had heard good things about this place but it exceeding every hope i could have dreamed of 1 
gets the job done 1 
at no point in the proceedings does it look remotely like america 0 
i struggle to find anything bad to say about it 1 
and i just love the colors 1 
all in all ha long bay was a bit of a flop 0 
it is a joy to use 1 
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
it was a long time that i didnt see a so charismatic actor on screen 1 
i own 2 of these cases and would order another 1 
tried to go here for lunch and it was a madhouse 0 
awesome device 1 
phone is sturdy as all nokia bar phones are 1 
as a courtroom drama its compelling as an indictment on the american justice system its frightening 1 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
i really dont see how anyone could enjoy this movie 0 
this is a disgrace 0 
the presentation of the food was awful 0 
there are so many problems i dont know where to start 0 
their steaks are 100 recommended 1 
there is no plot or storyline 0 
rude inconsiderate management 0 
i like the fact that it rests lightly against your ear rather than inside 1 
a happy wonderful feel good ending 1 
i cant believe theres even a sequel to this 0 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
nice ambiance 1 
the lead man is charismafree 0 
the phone loads super 1 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
if i take a picture the battery drops a bar and starts beeping letting me know its dieing 0 
the plot is nonsense that doesnt interest in the slightest way or have any uniqueness to it 0 
hes a national treasure 1 
i will continue to come here on ladies night andddd date night highly recommend this place to anyone who is in the area 1 
did not like at all 0 
no shifting no bubbling no peeling not even a scratch nothingi couldnt be more happier with my new one for the droid 1 
that was done in the second movie 0 
i am pairing this with my iphone and i could not be happier with it so far 1 
it didnt charge for me 0 
im very disappointed with my decision 0 
nice design and quality 1 
the film is way too long 0 
it is shameful 0 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
steamboat willie is an amazingly important film to our cinema history 1 
great pork sandwich 1 
the problem was the script 0 
the bose noise cancelling is amazing which is very important for a nyc commuter 1 
and then tragedy struck 0 
works like a charm it work the same as the one i got with the phone 1 
it is a true classic 1 
i will never forget it now 1 
thanks again to amazon for having the things i need for a good price 1 
truly awful 0 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
it has all the features i want 1 
the opening sequence of this gem is a classic and the cat n mouse games that follow are a delight to watch 1 
weve tried to like this place but after 10 times i think were done with them 0 
i cant tell you how disappointed i was 0 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
overall i am psyched to have a phone which has all my appointments and contacts in and gets great reception 1 
after trying many many handsfree gadgets this is the one that finally works well 1 
i would avoid this place if you are staying in the mirage 0 
it was quite comfortable in the ear 1 
with the originality and freshness of the first movie now spent this remake had little else to offer 0 
the cinematographyif it can be called thatsucked 0 
this is was due to the fact that it took 20 minutes to be acknowledged then another 35 minutes to get our foodand they kept forgetting things 0 
truly awful 0 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
the point is the journey a journey that touches every member of the family 1 
i understand that its supposed to be a cheap popcorn comedy but that doesnt mean that it has to completely insult our intelligence and have writing so incredibly hackneyed that it borders on offensive 0 
i was mortified 0 
it plays louder than any other speaker of this size the price is so low that most would think the quality is lacking however its not 1 
i totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is 1 
after two i felt disgusting 0 
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1 
appears to actually outperform the original battery from china that came with my v325i 1 
after a year the battery went completely dead on my headset 0 
ive never been more insulted or felt disrespected 0 
we made the drive all the way from north scottsdale and i was not one bit disappointed 1 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
it is perfect for a sitdown family meal or get together with a few friends 1 
my girlfriends veal was very bad 0 
great bluetooth 1 
if you stay in vegas you must get breakfast here at least once 1 
plug was the wrong size 0 
the camera really likes her in this movie 1 
i like design and look of jabra behing the ear headsets and 5020 is pretty comfortible to wear 24 hours a day without pain in the ear 1 
artless camerawork endlessly presents us with the ugliest setting imaginable ie 0 
appears to actually outperform the original battery from china that came with my v325i 1 
an interesting premise and billy drago is always good as a dangerous nutbag side note id love to see drago stephen mchattie and lance hendrikson in a flick together talk about raging cheekbones 1 
will order from them again 1 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
happy so far 1 
thank you for such great service 1 
first time there and might just be the last 0 
the waitress and manager are so friendly 1 
there are the usual hitchcock logic flaws 0 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
it was so bad i had lost the heart to finish it 0 
best headset ever 1 
fantastic service here 1 
the characters are interesting and you really care for them 1 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
this place is pretty good nice little vibe in the restaurant 1 
good case 1 
if you want a real scare rent this one 1 
secondly hitchcock pretty much perfected the thriller and chase movie 1 
strike 2 who wants to be rushed 0 
great service and food 1 
i am not a filmmaker nor am i a director but i would hide my head in the sand if id spent whatever amount of money and time on this movie 0 
lot of holes in the plot theres nothing about how he became the emperor nothing about where he spend 20 years between his childhood and mature age 0 
it is simple to use and i like it 1 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
it is shameful 0 
the battery runs down quickly 0 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
each track commands sentiment actually contributing to the scenes and characters 1 
anne heche was utterly convincing 1 
highquality chicken on the chicken caesar salad 1 
but despite these few flaws this case is of exceptional quality and well worth the additional costs of owning an official oem product 1 
this is one of the best movies out there that shows such strong sibling bond for each other 1 
2 times very bad customer service 0 
freezes frequently4 0 
we ordered some old classics and some new dishes after going there a few times and were sorely disappointed with everything 0 
great product and price 1 
otherwise easy to install and use clear sound 1 
no ear loop needed its tiny and the sound is great 1 
fast service 1 
simple lightweight and great fit 1 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
i mean this in a terrible way 0 
conclusion i loved it 1 
waitress was sweet and funny 1 
the malta settings are as dry and as barren as the dialogue 0 
excellent dualpurpose headset 1 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
after watching this film i wanted to learn more about the works of this artist 1 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
the acting is fantastic the stories are seamlessly woven together and the dogs are splendid a must rent view or see 1 
you wont be disappointed 1 
if it was to turn my good day feeling into a night of disturbing memories than i guess he succeeded 0 
it ranks highly as a great noircrimedrama incredible performances by belmondo and lino ventura 1 
a very charming film with wonderful sentiment and heart 1 
i loved it it was really scary 1 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
this is a great little item 1 
yes this film does require a rather significant amount of puzzlesolving but the pieces fit together to create a beautiful picture 1 
ive had this bluetoooth headset for some time now and still not comfortable with the way it fits on the ear 0 
i particularly remember my senses being assaulted by strident cords of music that would blare out with very little warning and even less meaning 0 
theres barely a boring moment in the film and there are plenty of humorous parts 1 
the films sole bright spot was jonah hill who will look almost unrecognizable to fans of the recent superbad due to the amount of weight he lost in the interim 1 
overall the film is interesting and thoughtprovoking 1 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
the movie showed a lot of florida at its best made it look very appealing 1 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
this movie creates its own universe and is fascinating in every way 1 
thank you for such great service 1 
but it wasnt anything at all just one big yawn 0 
the pizza tasted old super chewy in not a good way 0 
2 thumbs up to this seller 1 
i dont each much pasta but i love the homemade hand made pastas and thin pizzas here 1 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
i would advise to not purchase this item it never worked very well 0 
overall the film is interesting and thoughtprovoking 1 
the pairing of the two devices was so easy it barely took a couple minutes before i started making calls with the voice dialing feature 1 
lot of holes in the plot theres nothing about how he became the emperor nothing about where he spend 20 years between his childhood and mature age 0 
now the burgers arent as good the pizza which used to be amazing is doughy and flavorless 0 
i dont each much pasta but i love the homemade hand made pastas and thin pizzas here 1 
pretty good beer selection too 1 
this wonderful experience made this place a muststop whenever we are in town again 1 
this is a beautiful phone 1 
john wayne did an incredible job for being so young in the movie industry 1 
nice leather 1 
one of the best mexican movies ever and one of the less understood even by mexican themselves no matter how identified the should have felt with it 1 
not what i wanted 0 
i dont think you will be disappointed 1 
bad fit way too big 0 
i mean really how do you get so famous for your fish and chips when its so terrible 0 
the fries were great too 1 
the file browser offers all the options that one needshandsfree is great 1 
the pancake was also really good and pretty large at that 1 
there is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again 0 
i love the camera its really pretty good quality 1 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
im big fan of rpg games too but this movie its a disgrace to any selfrespecting rpger there is 0 
motorola finally got the voice quality of a bluetooth headset right 1 
went in for happy hour great list of wines 1 
i get absolutely horrible reception in my apartment where with other phones i have not had this problem 0 
i like the fact that it rests lightly against your ear rather than inside 1 
great brunch spot 1 
it looks very nice 1 
easily none other cartoon made me laugh in a tender way before getting into dark sitcoms oriented for teenagers 1 
all in all ha long bay was a bit of a flop 0 
better than expected 1 
there is a brilliant twist ending 1 
i recently tried caballeros and i have been back every week since 1 
i received my headset in good time and was happy with it 1 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
not good for the money 0 
great steak great sides great wine amazing desserts 1 
i dont recommend unless your car breaks down in front of it and you are starving 0 
not much flavor to them and very poorly constructed 0 
too bad cause i know its family owned i really wanted to like this place 0 
john wayne did an incredible job for being so young in the movie industry 1 
i found a six inch long piece of wire in my salsa 0 
the problem was the script 0 
it didnt make me scared horrified or make me sympathetic towards the characters it was simply annoying 0 
the croutons also taste homemade which is an extra plus 1 
it was a drive to get there 0 
i didnt want the clip going over the top of my ear causing discomfort 0 
too politically correct 0 
there was hardly any meat 0 
the movie is terribly boring in places 0 
crostini that came with the salad was stale 0 
jamie foxx absolutely is ray charles 1 
very very fun chef 1 
this was my first and only vegas buffet and it did not disappoint 1 
the movie lacks visual interest drama expression of feeling and celebration of the very patriotism that underlines the narrative 0 
not only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic but it also managed to give away the entire movie and im not exaggerating every moment every plot point every joke is told in the trailer 0 
the film is way too long 0 
very convenient since we were staying at the mgm 1 
with the originality and freshness of the first movie now spent this remake had little else to offer 0 
the chips and salsa were really good the salsa was very fresh 1 
not nearly as good looking as the amazon picture makes it look 0 
these are fabulous 1 
the handsfree part works fine but then the car tries to download the address book and the treo rebootsoverall i still rate this device high 1 
service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is vegas and located inside the crystals shopping mall by aria 1 
i am so tired of clichés that is just lazy writing and here they come in thick and fast 0 
every thing on phone work perfectly she like it 1 
not impressed 0 
it was either too cold not enough flavor or just bad 0 
babie bop is very cute 1 
the han nan chicken was also very tasty 1 
the phone crashed completely and now i have to get it replaced 0 
see it with your kids if you have a chanceit will open up some amazing dialog about how far race relations have come in the last 50 years 1 
level 5 spicy was perfect where spice didnt overwhelm the soup 1 
star trek v the final frontier is the worst in the series 0 
i great reception all the time 1 
the staff are great the ambiance is great 1 
tried to go here for lunch and it was a madhouse 0 
they never brought a salad we asked for 0 
if she had not rolled the eyes we may have stayed not sure if we will go back and try it again 0 
the concert sequences just sucked 0 
the cinematographyif it can be called thatsucked 0 
macbeth jason connery moved me to tears with his final monolog out brief candle outhe gave the sphere of moral decay and dark forces a human face which makes it the more interesting 1 
to those who find this movie intelligent or even masterful i can only say its your intelligence and your imagination you obviously used to try and make some sense of this pitiful attempt its in our human nature to try and make sense of things 0 
i vomited in the bathroom mid lunch 0 
the keyboard is a nice compromise between a full qwerty and the basic cell phone number keypad 1 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
i wish i could enter negative values admins 0 
how can that bethe audio quality is poor 0 
wont ever go here again 0 
for the price on amazon it is an excellent product which i would highly recommend 1 
this movie contained an allstar cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i havent seen before 1 
this place is awesome if you want something light and healthy during the summer 1 
overall i like there food and the service 1 
seriously flavorful delights folks 1 
considering the relations off screen between taylor and stanwyck it was surprising how little chemistry there was on screen between the two of them 0 
hated it 0 
worked perfectly 1 
i recently tried caballeros and i have been back every week since 1 
this is one of peter watkins most accessible films 1 
it really created a unique feeling though 1 
my boyfriend and i sat at the bar and had a completely delightful experience 1 
it was forced like everything in this movie 0 
the film gives meaning to the phrase never in the history of human conflict has so much been owed by so many to so few 1 
this was my first and only vegas buffet and it did not disappoint 1 
is pretty funny 1 
very displeased 0 
the ambiance isnt much better 0 
horrible dont waste your time and money 0 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
bad day or not i have a very low tolerance for rude customer service people it is your job to be nice and polite wash dishes otherwise 0 
camera color balance is awful 0 
the service was meh 0 
the pizza tasted old super chewy in not a good way 0 
my breakfast was perpared great with a beautiful presentation of 3 giant slices of toast lightly dusted with powdered sugar 1 
poor voice clarity 0 
first time going but i think i will quickly become a regular 1 
definitely not worth the 3 i paid 0 
essentially you can forget microsofts tech support 0 
linksys should have some way to exchange a bad phone for a refurb unit or something 0 
the bathrooms are clean and the place itself is well decorated 1 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
the pizza tasted old super chewy in not a good way 0 
it was delicious 1 
plus its only 8 bucks 1 
best breakfast buffet 1 
but even the talented carrell cant save this 0 
their daily specials are always a hit with my group 1 
very good phone 1 
i wouldnt see this movie again for free 0 
great price too 1 
personally i think it shows that people should learn to find a compromise them self without involving other people into issue 1 
i am also very happy with the price 1 
will go back next trip out 1 
definitely a turn off for me i doubt ill be back unless someone else is buying 0 
each track commands sentiment actually contributing to the scenes and characters 1 
i mean in a realistic world she would never have gotten into that ballet repertory the whole thing was quite pathetic 0 
i received my orders well within the shipping timeframe everything was in good working order and overall i am very excited to have this source 1 
it was just too horrible 0 
he is one of my favourite directors and one of the most talented directors in the history of cinema 1 
but now that it is out of warranty the same problems reoccurebottom line put your money somewhere else cingular will not support it 0 
for that its worth checking out 1 
everything about it is just bad 0 
i have to mention this and it is a huge spoiler i loved the ending how all the characters of the three films were the remaining survivors of the ferry disaster with valentine and the young judge together and the old man watching it on her tv solidifying his happiness over the suffering which he dealt with for those many years 1 
cinematography noteworthy including fine views of barcelona and its famed gaudi towers 1 
just reading on the specs alone makes you say wow 1 
could not get strong enough signal 0 
the concert sequences just sucked 0 
their menu is diverse and reasonably priced 1 
it rocked my world and is certainly a must see for anyone with no social or physical outlets 1 
dont waste your money 0 
this was reflected not only in the cast but also in the belowpar script which borrowed much from the earlier classic 0 
it is a joy to use 1 
it was a long time that i didnt see a so charismatic actor on screen 1 
i get absolutely horrible reception in my apartment where with other phones i have not had this problem 0 
wow what a bad film 0 
if you do go see this movie bring a pillow or a girlfriendboyfriend to keep you occupied through out 0 
during several different 2 minute calls i experienced 5 drops and it was in an area that had 5 bars 0 
both of them were truly unbelievably good and i am so glad we went back 1 
i give it 2 thumbs down 0 
enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film 1 
at a time when it seems that film animation has been dominated by disneypixars cgi masterpieces it is both refreshing and comforting to know that miyazaki is still relying on traditional handdrawn animation to tell his charming and enchanting stories 1 
cant upload ringtones from a third party 0 
basically the service was very bad 0 
what should have been a hilarious yummy christmas eve dinner to remember was the biggest fail of the entire trip for us 0 
i seriously cannot believe that the owner has so many unexperienced employees that all are running around like chickens with their heads cut off 0 
this is was due to the fact that it took 20 minutes to be acknowledged then another 35 minutes to get our foodand they kept forgetting things 0 
fantastic service here 1 
2 times very bad customer service 0 
as always the evening was wonderful and the food delicious 1 
the ri style calamari was a joke 0 
the first time i ever came here i had an amazing experience i still tell people how awesome the duck was 1 
as for the killer dont expect anything original or even remotely frightening 0 
my sashimi was poor quality being soggy and tasteless 0 
there is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again 0 
what a piece of junk i lose more calls on this phone 0 
this would not even be good as a made for tv flick 0 
excellent dualpurpose headset 1 
the crêpe was delicate and thin and moist 1 
it worked very well 1 
cooked to perfection and the service was impeccable 1 
they have great dinners 1 
the poor actors 0 
this phone is very fast with sending any kind of messages and web browsing is significantly faster than previous phones i have used 1 
fantastic service here 1 
fantastic buy and will get again for whatever my next phone is 1 
thats how id describe this painfully dreary timewaster of a film 0 
even in my bmw 3 series which is fairly quiet i have trouble hearing what the other person is saying 0 
crisp and clear 1 
but in terms of the writing its very fresh and bold 1 
over rated 0 
dont bother go to the store 0 
i liked the patio and the service was outstanding 1 
its very slow 0 
i only hear garbage for audio 0 
overall i rate this movie a 10 out of a 110 scale 1 
nicest chinese restaurant ive been in a while 1 
a good film by a great director 1 
this is high adventure at its best 1 
is it possible for a movie to get any worse than this 0 
i would recommend this 1 
the best place in vegas for breakfast just check out a sat or sun 1 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
it is very educational for children 1 to 8 years old 1 
went in for happy hour great list of wines 1 
the films dialogue is natural real to life 1 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
mobile phone tools are a must have 1 
just does not work 0 
and if that isnt enough of a mess of a movie for you the picture is also marred with a constant use of studio sets and indoor exteriors 0 
macbeth jason connery moved me to tears with his final monolog out brief candle outhe gave the sphere of moral decay and dark forces a human face which makes it the more interesting 1 
nonlinear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well 1 
i have never had such bland food which surprised me considering the article we read focused so much on their spices and flavor 0 
the vanilla ice cream was creamy and smooth while the profiterole choux pastry was fresh enough 1 
but its just not funny 0 
i was particularly pleased with the acting ability of dwight schultz 1 
now the burgers arent as good the pizza which used to be amazing is doughy and flavorless 0 
this frog phone charm is adorable and very eye catching 1 
i was amazed at the quick arrival of the two original lg cell phone batteries and and at a fraction of the price 1 
full of unconvincing cardboard characters it is blandly written by edward chodorov who also produced and is surprisingly directed by jean negulesco from whom one would expect a great deal more 0 
i was not happy with this item 0 
they brought a fresh batch of fries and i was thinking yay something warm but no 0 
i kept looking at the time and it had soon become 35 minutes yet still no food 0 
if you havent choked in your own vomit by the end by all the cheap drama and worthless dialogue youve must have bored yourself to death with this waste of time 0 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
but now i was completely grossed out 0 
not recommended 0 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
also if your phone is dropped this case is not going to save it specially when dropped face down 0 
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1 
it will drive you barking mad 0 
on three different occasions i asked for well done or medium well and all three times i got the bloodiest piece of meat on my plate 0 
the cinematographyif it can be called thatsucked 0 
i really dont see how anyone could enjoy this movie 0 
total brunch fail 0 
aailiyah was pretty good as akasha in places compelling her first entrance and mini dance scene 1 
im glad the film didnt go for the most obvious choice as a lesser film certainly would have 1 
four stars for the food the guy in the blue shirt for his great vibe still letting us in to eat 1 
that being said for a phone the camera is very nice many cool effects to play with and video is decent as well 1 
nothing short of magnificent photographycinematography in this film 1 
both the hot sour the egg flower soups were absolutely 5 stars 1 
his use of the colours of the french flag in the three films was nothing short of incredible every shot every scene was like a work of art 1 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
after all the rave reviews i couldnt wait to eat herewhat a disappointment 0 
the greek dressing was very creamy and flavorful 1 
not good when wearing a hat or sunglasses 0 
however i needed some better instructions 0 
overall i like there food and the service 1 
cinematography noteworthy including fine views of barcelona and its famed gaudi towers 1 
dont waste your money 0 
ambience is perfect 1 
i great reception all the time 1 
other than that the leather is nice and soft the fit is very tight the cut out for the face is a good shape 1 
the design is very good4 1 
the shipping time was also very quick 1 
total brunch fail 0 
it was a long time that i didnt see a so charismatic actor on screen 1 
110 and only because there is no setting for 010 0 
by far the best cheesecurds we have ever had 1 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
people couldnt hear me talk and i had to pull out the earphone and talk on the phone 0 
if there were zero stars i would give it zero stars 0 
not good when wearing a hat or sunglasses 0 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
i hate those things as much as cheap quality black olives 0 
okay i like to consider myself a fair critic so ill give credit where credits duethe creature effects were actually pretty cool 1 
perhaps my phone is defective but people cannot hear me when i use this 0 
the service was a little slow considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace 0 
left very frustrated 0 
hated it 0 
i was not happy with this item 0 
poor sound quality 0 
well just if you keep thinking how bad it is 0 
it is an insane game 1 
it even has its sweet moments 1 
its a feelgood film and thats how i felt when i came out of the cinema 1 
the budget was evidently very limited 0 
my experience was terrible this was my fourth bluetooth headset and while it was much more comfortable than my last jabra which i hated 0 
their research and development division obviously knows what theyre doing 1 
i recently tried caballeros and i have been back every week since 1 
as many people complained i found this headsets microphone was very weak 0 
i would advise to not purchase this item it never worked very well 0 
this place is not worth your time let alone vegas 0 
setup went very smoothly 1 
im happy about this purchase good quality and low price 1 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
but in any case the best part is you can download these pictures to your laptop using ir or even send pictures from your laptop to the phone 1 
i dont think you will be disappointed 1 
thanks good a movie like this was done and released 1 
left very frustrated 0 
the movie is terribly boring in places 0 
okay i like to consider myself a fair critic so ill give credit where credits duethe creature effects were actually pretty cool 1 
we waited for forty five minutes in vain 0 
the plot such as it is is so derivative and predictable that the ending is like a mercy killing 0 
nice docking station for home or work 1 
his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic 1 
this device is great in several situations1 1 
highly recommended for all ages although the younger set will probably not appreciate some of the more subtle references they will certainly appreciate one galley scene in particular 1 
the food was delicious our bartender was attentive and personable and we got a great deal 1 
garbo who showed right off the bat that her talents could carry over from the silent era i wanted to see some of her silent work but netflix doesnt seem to be stocking them 1 
jamie foxx absolutely is ray charles 1 
i got home to see the driest damn wings ever 0 
one of my favorite purchases ever 1 
i could barely stomach the meal but didnt complain because it was a business lunch 0 
these are the central themes of the film and they are handled ineptly stereotypically and with no depth of imagination 0 
service is perfect and the family atmosphere is nice to see 1 
dont buy it 0 
seriously killer hot chai latte 1 
i dont have very many words to say about this place but it does everything pretty well 1 
any ring toneoverall good phone to buy 1 
special mention should be made of the superb music score and sound effects which are an integral element in helping to make this such a memorable and enjoyable cartoon 1 
it isnt even an achievement as a sobaditsgood or sobaditsmemorable movie 0 
and his subtle connections between the three films are awesome 1 
love it great armband 1 
the service was poor and thats being nice 0 
phone is sturdy as all nokia bar phones are 1 
i agree with jessica this movie is pretty bad 0 
if you want a real scare rent this one 1 
after i pulled up my car i waited for another 15 minutes before being acknowledged 0 
the awful dialogue and hopeless overacting by everyone who gets shot top off a real waste of space and time 0 
a truly truly bad film 0 
lange had become a great actress 1 
i have tried these cables with my computer and my ipod and it works just fine 1 
i wear it everyday and it holds up very well 1 
stopped by during the late may bank holiday off rick steve recommendation and loved it 1 
headset works great was packaged nicely to avoid any damage 1 
a piece of junk that broke after being on my phone for 2 days 0 
it was a good thing that the tickets only cost five dollars because i would be mad if id have paid 750 to see this crap 0 
this was my first and only vegas buffet and it did not disappoint 1 
and the chef was generous with his time even came around twice so we can take pictures with him 1 
a piece of cinematic garbage captured on celluloid 0 
small sleek impressive looking practical setup with ample storage in place 1 
dont waste your money 0 
i went to bachi burger on a friends recommendation and was not disappointed 1 
i think this restaurant suffers from not trying hard enough 0 
total brunch fail 0 
definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly will return next time im in vegas 1 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
we wont be returning 0 
i got to enjoy the seafood salad with a fabulous vinegrette 1 
the battery is working well as a replacement for the original that came with the phone over 2 years ago 1 
i love the camera its really pretty good quality 1 
an hour and a half i wish i could bring back 0 
friends pasta also bad he barely touched it 0 
i really do recommend this place you can go wrong with this donut place 1 
an instant classic with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits 1 
i will never go back to this place and will never ever recommended this place to anyone 0 
this product is great it makes working a lot easier i can go to the copier while waiting on hold for something 1 
oh the charger seems to work fine 1 
the chips that came out were dripping with grease and mostly not edible 0 
using all earpieces left or right this thing will not stay on my ear 0 
youll love it 1 
why are these sad little vegetables so overcooked 0 
it presents a idyllic yet serious portrayal of the ups and downs of the characters lives 1 
we wont be returning 0 
one of my favorite purchases ever 1 
it is rare when a filmmaker takes the time to tell a worthy moral tale with care and love that doesnt fall into the trap of being overly syrupy or over indulgent 1 
server did a great job handling our large rowdy table 1 
my gyro was basically lettuce only 0 
maybe there would be a reasonable explanation for this atrocity 0 
rude inconsiderate management 0 
not tasty and the texture was just nasty 0 
the handsfree part works fine but then the car tries to download the address book and the treo rebootsoverall i still rate this device high 1 
this film tries to be a serious and sophisticated thrillerhorror flick and it fails miserably 0 
not loud enough and doesnt turn on like it should 0 
it kept getting worse and worse so now im officially done 0 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
this is a great little item 1 
but now i was completely grossed out 0 
the real killer is the volume and of course it breaking 0 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
camera color balance is awful 0 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
the malta settings are as dry and as barren as the dialogue 0 
i will never forget it now 1 
definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly will return next time im in vegas 1 
this is the first phone ive had that has been so cheaply made 0 
worst martini ever 0 
i have had tmobile service for 2 or 3 years now and i am pretty happy with it 1 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
the microphone also works well but according to people i have called it applifies everything 1 
and the beans and rice were mediocre at best 0 
this is probably one of the least effective and utterly unoriginal films i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
comes with a strong light that you can use to light up your camera shots and even flash sos signals seriously 1 
great bluetooth 1 
unless youre just out to visually collect all extant films of austens work you can skip this one 0 
i cant wait to go back 1 
works good 1 
check it out 1 
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 
how can you call yourself a steakhouse if you cant properly cook a steak i dont understand 0 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
shes poised and amazing 1 
it was clear that she had the range and ability to pull off this part 1 
doesnt last long 0 
a disappointment 0 
add betty white and jean smart and you have a great cast everyone played their parts really well 1 
it ranks highly as a great noircrimedrama incredible performances by belmondo and lino ventura 1 
dont waste your money 0 
the pancake was also really good and pretty large at that 1 
the worst phone from samsungcrap this crappy samsung e715 is the worst i have ever seeen 0 
it is indescribably the most annoying and idiotic show i have ever seen 0 
doesnt work at all i bougth it for my l7c and its not working 0 
of all the dishes the salmon was the best but all were great 1 
the tracfonewebsite is user friendly and makes it easy toactivate etc 1 
frankly after cotton club and unfaithful it was kind of embarrassing to watch lane and gere in this film because it is bad 0 
so far so good 1 
using all earpieces left or right this thing will not stay on my ear 0 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
arrived quickly and much less expensive than others being sold 1 
a lot of websites have been rating this a very good phone and so do i 1 
an interesting premise and billy drago is always good as a dangerous nutbag side note id love to see drago stephen mchattie and lance hendrikson in a flick together talk about raging cheekbones 1 
good item low price 1 
the flair bartenders are absolutely amazing 1 
its too bad that everyone else involved didnt share crowes level of dedication to quality for if they did wed have a far better film on our hands than this subpar mess 0 
my fella got the huevos rancheros and they didnt look too appealing 0 
very disappointed 0 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
i love the ownerchef his one authentic japanese cool dude 1 
i have to jiggle the plug to get it to line up right to get decent volume 0 
while i managed to bend the leaf spring back in place the metal now has enough stress that it will break on the next drop 0 
he is an amazing film artist one of the most important whoever lived 1 
i guess that nobody at the network that aired this dribble watched it before putting it on 0 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
the buttons for on and off are bad 0 
the wind and the lion is well written and superbly acted 1 
the cinematography is simply stunning to say the least and the fx are nothing if not stateoftheart 1 
anyway the plot flowed smoothly and the malebonding scenes were a hoot 1 
but other than that the movie seemed to drag and the heroes didnt really work for their freedom 0 
great phone 1 
any ring toneoverall good phone to buy 1 
i was disgusted because i was pretty sure that was human hair 0 
the only thing i did like was the prime rib and dessert section 1 
the pizza tasted old super chewy in not a good way 0 
elias koteasjack palance play good roles angelina is hot and gets nakedbilly drago appears in this and is cool as usual a cameo by sven ole thorsen helps make this a very enjoyable movie with good acting and a decent budget 1 
ray charles is legendary 1 
delicious 1 
good value works fine power via usb car or wall outlet 1 
useless phone simply deaf 0 
great service and food 1 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
nargile i think you are great 1 
however i needed some better instructions 0 
i saw this movie and i thought this is a stupid movie 0 
heres where the movie really pied me off 0 
unfortunately it did not work 0 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
did not like at all 0 
good product good seller 1 
worked great 1 
its the best headset i have used 1 
whatever prompted such a documentary is beyond me 0 
i really dont see how anyone could enjoy this movie 0 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
the menu is always changing food quality is going down service is extremely slow 0 
nice ambiance 1 
i love the ringtones because they are so upbeat 1 
a great way to finish a great 1 
gotta love those closeups of slimy drooling teeth 1 
i have always used corded headsets and the freedom from the wireless is very helpful 1 
this place receives stars for their appetizers 1 
i thought errol flynn was brilliant as custer and has since become my favourite actor 1 
wonderful lil tapas and the ambience made me feel all warm and fuzzy inside 1 
unfortunately cover girl is an example of how hollywood used to exploit women for financial gain 0 
this place is great 1 
the restaurant atmosphere was exquisite 1 
it was attached to a gas station and that is rarely a good sign 0 
great place to eat reminds me of the little mom and pop shops in the san francisco bay area 1 
no im going to eat the potato that i found some strangers hair in it 0 
the warmth it generates is in contrast to its austere backdrop 1 
i did not expect this to be so good 1 
it was pretty gross 0 
its a feelgood film and thats how i felt when i came out of the cinema 1 
i will be back many times soon 1 
the pairing of the two devices was so easy it barely took a couple minutes before i started making calls with the voice dialing feature 1 
best tacos in town by far 1 
the headset fulfills my requirements so i am happy with my purchase 1 
these products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet 0 
enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film 1 
battery life is also great 1 
well im satisfied 1 
i wasnt the least bit interested 0 
the food was terrible 0 
the bottowm lineanother worthless cheap gimmick from sprint 0 
works fine 1 
i would avoid this place if you are staying in the mirage 0 
on the up side their cafe serves really good food 1 
there was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters 0 
waitress was good though 1 
beware this is not a trashy cult movie this is trash period 0 
food was great and so was the serivce 1 
they know how to make them here 1 
very happy with this product 1 
elias koteasjack palance play good roles angelina is hot and gets nakedbilly drago appears in this and is cool as usual a cameo by sven ole thorsen helps make this a very enjoyable movie with good acting and a decent budget 1 
will go back next trip out 1 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
full of unconvincing cardboard characters it is blandly written by edward chodorov who also produced and is surprisingly directed by jean negulesco from whom one would expect a great deal more 0 
it was either too cold not enough flavor or just bad 0 
long whiny and pointless 0 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
so anyone near you will hear part of your conversation 0 
nice headset priced right 1 
worst hour and a half of my lifeoh my gosh 0 
the microphone also works well but according to people i have called it applifies everything 1 
i especially love the long battery life 1 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
i love this place 1 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
regrettably the film fails 0 
but storm trooper is not even bad enough to make it to the list of wonderfully terrible movies 0 
it is rare when a filmmaker takes the time to tell a worthy moral tale with care and love that doesnt fall into the trap of being overly syrupy or over indulgent 1 
easily none other cartoon made me laugh in a tender way before getting into dark sitcoms oriented for teenagers 1 
this place is good 1 
dont waste your money 0 
i found this place by accident and i could not be happier 1 
editing the editing of this film was phenomenal in my opinion 1 
service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is vegas and located inside the crystals shopping mall by aria 1 
same problem as others have mentioned 0 
i own 2 of these cases and would order another 1 
i loved it 1 
those phones are working just fine now 1 
the songs were the best and the muppets were so hilarious 1 
disappointed 0 
unreliable im giving up 0 
star trek v the final frontier is the worst in the series 0 
those burgers were amazing 1 
soyo technology sucks 0 
in my house i was getting dropped coverage upstairs and no coverage in my basement 0 
excellent product for the price 1 
i received my headset in good time and was happy with it 1 
end of days is one of the worst bigbudget action movies ive ever seen 0 
pretty piece of junk 0 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
tied to charger for conversations lasting more than 45 minutesmajor problems 0 
this place is great 1 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
an amazing finale to possibly the best trilogy of all time 1 
special thanks to dylan t for the recommendation on what to order all yummy for my tummy 1 
comfortable fit you need your headset to be comfortable for at least an hour at a time if not for an entire day 1 
again no plot at all 0 
with the originality and freshness of the first movie now spent this remake had little else to offer 0 
totally believable 1 
the ngage is still lacking in earbuds 0 
but its just not funny 0 
i found this place by accident and i could not be happier 1 
what a big waste of time 0 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
this is a really fantastic thai restaurant which is definitely worth a visit 1 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
as an earlier review noted plug in this charger and nothing happens 0 
great price too 1 
everyone is very attentive providing excellent customer service 1 
best fish ive ever had in my life 1 
one character is totally annoying with a voice that gives me the feeling of fingernails on a chalkboard 0 
you wont regret it 1 
but when someone strives for greatness and poetry but delivers a muddled and often ridiculous story a bunch of disparate scenes pretentious dialogue then you get the worst kind of a movie that some other reviewer very accurately defined as pretentious crap 0 
great phone 1 
youll love it 1 
beware this is not a trashy cult movie this is trash period 0 
waited and waited and waited 0 
everyone is treated equally special 1 
but the actingeven that of such professionals as drago and debbie rochonwas terrible the directing worse perhaps contributory to the former the dialog chimplike and the camera work barely tolerable 0 
this item is fantastic and works perfectly 1 
everything about this movie is stupid 0 
stay away from this store be careful 0 
he deserves 5 stars 1 
if you have several dozen or several hundred contacts then imagine the fun of sending each of them one by one 0 
would not reccommend 0 
uncomfortable in the ear dont use with lg vx9900 env 0 
in the summer you can dine in a charming outdoor patio so very delightful 1 
the bottowm lineanother worthless cheap gimmick from sprint 0 
its too bad the food is so damn generic 0 
but the premise of the film was so ridiculous that the president of the us 0 
characters are onedimensional even the good guys and especially the bad guys 0 
great time family dinner on a sunday night 1 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
waitress was a little slow in service 0 
iam very pleased with my purchase 1 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
she ordered a toasted english muffin that came out untoasted 0 
does not fit 0 
by far the best cheesecurds we have ever had 1 
the script is bad very bad  it contains both cheesiness and unethical joke that you normally see in rated r or nc17 movie 0 
poor product 0 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
the battery is working well as a replacement for the original that came with the phone over 2 years ago 1 
freezes frequently4 0 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
its so stupid to have to keep buying new chargers car chargers cradles headphones and car kits every time a new phone comes out 0 
anyways the food was definitely not filling at all and for the price you pay you should expect more 0 
a usable keyboard actually turns a pda into a realworld useful machine instead of just a neat gadget 1 
a good quality bargain i bought this after i bought a cheapy from big lots that sounded awful and people on the other end couldnt hear me 1 
i find this inexcusable and so will probably be returning this phone and perhaps changing carriers 0 
waited 2 hours never got either of our pizzas as many other around us who came in later did 0 
excellent sound quality 1 
i received my orders well within the shipping timeframe everything was in good working order and overall i am very excited to have this source 1 
no real improvement 0 
dont waste your money 0 
i wasnt really impressed with strip steak 0 
the bt headset was such a disapoinment 0 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
great time family dinner on a sunday night 1 
if you do watch it however there are small consolations the actresses playing annes sisters each do a wonderful job with their roles 1 
the buffet at bellagio was far from what i anticipated 0 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
the sound quality for the device is unacceptableunless you are in a really quiet area you almost hear nothing 0 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
fits comfortably came with three sizes of earbud tips 1 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
battery chargelife is quite long 1 
dont make the same mistake that i did and please dont buy this phone 0 
very well made and fits my surefire gx2 perfectly 1 
they brought a fresh batch of fries and i was thinking yay something warm but no 0 
what a waste 0 
this gets a 1 out of 10 simply because theres nothing lower 0 
seriously its not worth wasting your or your kids time on 0 
took an hour to get our food only 4 tables in restaurant my food was luke warm our sever was running around like he was totally overwhelmed 0 
this is a chilly unremarkable movie about an author livingworking in a chilly abstruse culture 0 
this place was such a nice surprise 1 
ill even say it again  this is torture 0 
weird vibe from owners 0 
highly recommended for all ages although the younger set will probably not appreciate some of the more subtle references they will certainly appreciate one galley scene in particular 1 
in other words the content level of this film is enough to easily fill a dozen other films 1 
when i placed my treo into the case not only was it not snug but there was a lot of extra room on the sides 0 
i highly recommend this movie for anyone interested in art poetry theater politics or japanese history 1 
when i opened the sandwich i was impressed but not in a good way 0 
kind of flops around 0 
the selection was probably the worst ive seen in vegasthere was none 0 
walked in and the place smelled like an old grease trap and only 2 others there eating 0 
try them in the airport to experience some tasty food and speedy friendly service 1 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
as for the mains also uninspired 0 
not even a hello we will be right with you 0 
the desserts were a bit strange 0 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
i had heard good things about this place but it exceeding every hope i could have dreamed of 1 
the stories were as unbelievable as the actors 0 
this is some seriously good pizza and im an expertconnisseur on the topic 1 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
i liked the patio and the service was outstanding 1 
im surprised this is a good quality car charger and theres not much reviews about it 1 
good service very clean and inexpensive to boot 1 
i know this is not like the other restaurants at all something is very off here 0 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
it was so bad i had lost the heart to finish it 0 
host staff were for lack of a better word bitches 0 
what the hell kind of crap is that 0 
dont buy this product 0 
seems like a good quick place to grab a bite of some familiar pub food but do yourself a favor and look elsewhere 0 
the biggest complaint i have is the battery drains superfast 0 
the writers were smack on and i think the best actors and actresses were a bonus to the showthese characters were so real 1 
the real killer is the volume and of course it breaking 0 
in fact its hard to remember that the part of ray charles is being acted and not played by the man himself 1 
worked great 1 
unfortunately it was not good 0 
poor quality 0 
highly unprofessional and rude to a loyal patron 0 
seafood was limited to boiled shrimp and crab legs but the crab legs definitely did not taste fresh 0 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
perhaps i caught them on an off night judging by the other reviews but im not inspired to go back 0 
i find this inexcusable and so will probably be returning this phone and perhaps changing carriers 0 
an instant classic with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits 1 
love it great armband 1 
useless phone simply deaf 0 
do not waste your money here 0 
but whatever it was that cost them so much it didnt translate to quality thats for sure 0 
im glad the film didnt go for the most obvious choice as a lesser film certainly would have 1 
the pancake was also really good and pretty large at that 1 
things happen characters personalities change plot twists occur for no real reason other than that script calls for it 0 
as for the mains also uninspired 0 
i hate to disagree with my fellow yelpers but my husband and i were so disappointed with this place 0 
this was my first and only vegas buffet and it did not disappoint 1 
all i have to say is the food was amazing 1 
there was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth but it didnt really work into the rest of the plot 0 
the explosion of the gas tanks at the end was just as awful 0 
love it great armband 1 
really pleased with this product so far 1 
there was hardly any meat 0 
the sound is clear and the people i talk to on it are amazed at the quality too 1 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
i hate those things as much as cheap quality black olives 0 
initially the local sites in the film which was filmed here in buffalo intrigued me 1 
theres really nothing bad i can say about this headset 0 
using all earpieces left or right this thing will not stay on my ear 0 
great pork sandwich 1 
food was so gooodd 1 
ill definitely be in soon again 1 
what a waste of time 0 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
ill definitely be in soon again 1 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
i wasted my little money with this earpiece 0 
i got it because it was so small and adorable 1 
a greasy unhealthy meal 0 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
on three different occasions i asked for well done or medium well and all three times i got the bloodiest piece of meat on my plate 0 
i was amazed at the quick arrival of the two original lg cell phone batteries and and at a fraction of the price 1 
does not fit 0 
the attempts at humor were pitiful and story is so awful it dosent bear thinking about which basically involves a vulcan stealing the enterprise to find god seriously i just didnt care about any of this film and oh not to mention uhura does a belly dance to distract male guards 0 
even worse than ticker 0 
great brunch spot 1 
on the negative its insipid enough to cause regret for another 2 hours of life wasted in front of the screen 0 
for that price i can think of a few place i would have much rather gone 0 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
battery has no life 0 
the steak was amazingrge fillet relleno was the best seafood plate i have ever had 1 
i love this device 1 
i love it 1 
everyone is treated equally special 1 
this is an outstanding little restaurant with some of the best food i have ever tasted 1 
gets the job done 1 
hot dishes are not hot cold dishes are close to room tempi watched staff prepare food with bare hands no gloveseverything is deep fried in oil 0 
i dont recommend unless your car breaks down in front of it and you are starving 0 
this place receives stars for their appetizers 1 
however the keypads are so tinny that i sometimes reach the wrong buttons 0 
nothing new there 0 
no plot whatsoever 0 
the chains which im no fan of beat this place easily 0 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
have been going since 2007 and every meal has been awesome 1 
the chips and salsa were really good the salsa was very fresh 1 
perabo has a nice energy level and is obviously very comfortable in front of a camera 1 
very displeased 0 
just what i wanted 1 
ambience is perfect 1 
sauce was tasteless 0 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
and i really did find them funny 1 
the acting was decidely wooden though no worse than a period universal b movie 0 
otherwise dont even waste your time on this 0 
good quality 1 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
it does everything the description said it would 1 
truly awful 0 
it is worth the drive 1 
the mic there is a joke and the volume is quite low 0 
nice spicy and tender 1 
i would avoid this place if you are staying in the mirage 0 
nice design and quality 1 
very good lunch spot 1 
i love this place 1 
razr battery good buy 1 
just dont know why they were so slow 0 
a great touch 1 
i had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get some relief 0 
this one is simply a disappointment 0 
a good commentary of todays love and undoubtedly a film worth seeing 1 
i like the fact that it rests lightly against your ear rather than inside 1 
lovely little thriller from hitchcock with lots of nice shenanigans surrounding a murdered spy a kidnapped child a nasty church a foreign plot and some random taxidermists 1 
we were promptly greeted and seated 1 
we loved the biscuits 1 
i am so tired of clichés that is just lazy writing and here they come in thick and fast 0 
happy so far 1 
its a shame to see good actors like thomerson and james make a living in a mess like this 0 
the sweet potato tots were good but the onion rings were perfection or as close as i have had 1 
im big fan of rpg games too but this movie its a disgrace to any selfrespecting rpger there is 0 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
that was done in the second movie 0 
i have bought this nokia cell phone a few weeks ago and it was a nightmare 0 
both of them were truly unbelievably good and i am so glad we went back 1 
i found a six inch long piece of wire in my salsa 0 
what a piece of junk i lose more calls on this phone 0 
it doesnt make you look cool 0 
juano hernandez an exceptional actor who played supporting roles in many films of the era is a proud black man who is accused of murdering a white man in the south 1 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
dont go here 0 
his performance as awarded was stunning 1 
prosgood camera very nice pictures also has cool styles like black and white and more 1 
all i have to say is the food was amazing 1 
iam very pleased with my purchase 1 
as for the service i thought it was good 1 
soyo technology sucks 0 
itll be a regular stop on my trips to phoenix 1 
lasted one day and then blew up 0 
it really is impressive that the place hasnt closed down 0 
all in all im quite satisfied with this purchase 1 
the company shipped my product very promptly and it works well 1 
however after about a year the fliptop started to get loose and wobbly and eventually my screen went black and i couldnt receive and place calls 0 
the ri style calamari was a joke 0 
i use this product in a motor control center where there is a lot of high voltage humming from the equipment and it works great 1 
then as if i hadnt wasted enough of my life there they poured salt in the wound by drawing out the time it took to bring the check 0 
its like a bad two hour tv movie 0 
how awful she is 0 
i had heard good things about this place but it exceeding every hope i could have dreamed of 1 
well never go again 0 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
the noise shield is incrediable 1 
this is an extraordinary film 1 
i guess it was supposed to be clever twist then shed some light on the situation but it was just stupid 0 
when it opens the battery connection is broken and the device is turned off 0 
it was equally awful 0 
i highly recommend this device to everyone 1 
i saw it as a child on tv back in 1973 when it was the stranger and i loved it 1 
i promise they wont disappoint 1 
special thanks to dylan t for the recommendation on what to order all yummy for my tummy 1 
nothing short of magnificent photographycinematography in this film 1 
the keyboard is a nice compromise between a full qwerty and the basic cell phone number keypad 1 
the first thing that happened was that the tracking was off 0 
the refried beans that came with my meal were dried out and crusty and the food was bland 0 
despite how hard i rate businesses its actually rare for me to give a 1 star 0 
treo and tmobile refused to replace it again and forced me to buy another phone without any kind of upgrade discount 0 
for a self proclaimed coffee cafe i was wildly disappointed 0 
i guess i liked the details of his dysfunctionhe was believable 1 
the bt headset was such a disapoinment 0 
this was my first time and i cant wait until the next 1 
sounds good reasonably priced and effective its that simple 1 
when a song could explain the emotions of the subjects better such as when jay adams unfortunate life was a subject of talk the song old man by neil young was played which evokes many emotions 1 
the staff is always super friendly and helpful which is especially cool when you bring two small boys and a baby 1 
ray charles is legendary 1 
motorola finally got the voice quality of a bluetooth headset right 1 
waste your money on this game 1 
this is so embarassing and also my ears hurt if i try to push the ear plug into my ear 0 
food was good service was good prices were good 1 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
easy to pair with my samsung cell 1 
there is no real plot 0 
this wonderful experience made this place a muststop whenever we are in town again 1 
nice docking station for home or work 1 
however paul schrader has indeed made a film about mishima that is both superb complex 1 
for the price on amazon it is an excellent product which i would highly recommend 1 
the charger arrived within the promised timeframe but it did not work 0 
the attractive set used throughout most of the film is an eyepleasing gem 1 
i mean this in a terrible way 0 
everyone is very attentive providing excellent customer service 1 
things that went wrong they burned the saganaki 0 
this short film certainly pulls no punches 0 
cinematography noteworthy including fine views of barcelona and its famed gaudi towers 1 
love this phone 1 
i had a salad with the wings and some ice cream for dessert and left feeling quite satisfied 1 
ray charles life provided excellent biographical material for the film which goes well beyond being just another movie about a musician 1 
the script is a big flawed mess 0 
itll be a regular stop on my trips to phoenix 1 
but in any case the best part is you can download these pictures to your laptop using ir or even send pictures from your laptop to the phone 1 
first of all it doesnt wear well 0 
i also didnt like the on button it felt like it would crack with use 0 
i have had mine for about a year and this christmas i bought some for the rest of the family 1 
there are the usual hitchcock logic flaws 0 
it was either too cold not enough flavor or just bad 0 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
i was left shattered from the experience of watching this film and i took a good two hours to fully recover 0 
sam shepards portrayal of a gung ho marine was sobering 1 
i want to first say our server was great and we had perfect service 1 
there were several moments in the movie that just didnt need to be there and were excruciatingly slow moving 0 
it was just not a fun experience 1 
if you havent gone here go now 1 
you cant go wrong with any of the food here 1 
then theres the plot holes 0 
both do good jobs and are quite amusing 1 
the fact is this film is a wonderful heartwarming tale about two people chasing their dreams 1 
from here on the widmark character turns unintentionally comical 0 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
i had the chicken pho and it tasted very bland 0 
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
i dont understand how this garbage got on the shelves of the movie store its not even a real movie 0 
great charger 1 
friends pasta also bad he barely touched it 0
