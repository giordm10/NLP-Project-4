i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
its a piece of crap 0 
then as if i hadnt wasted enough of my life there they poured salt in the wound by drawing out the time it took to bring the check 0 
the vanilla ice cream was creamy and smooth while the profiterole choux pastry was fresh enough 1 
this was utterly confusing at first which caused me to lose a couple of very very important contacts 0 
it was not good 0 
worst ever 0 
for 40 bucks a head i really expect better food 0 
the secondary plot line is incomprehensible and its relation to the primary plot line is mystifying 0 
worst hour and a half of my lifeoh my gosh 0 
what this film lacks is a convincing script 0 
i did not expect this to be so good 1 
the earpiece on this is too large or too heavyit keeps falling out of my ear 0 
its the one movie that never ceases to interest me simply because it keeps me alert as i try to attempt to decipher its meanings 1 
love it great armband 1 
i would highly recommend this 1 
overall i was not impressed and would not go back 0 
special thanks to dylan t for the recommendation on what to order all yummy for my tummy 1 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
they do not care about the consumer one bit 0 
this is an unbelievable bargain 1 
2 times very bad customer service 0 
unfortunately it did not work 0 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
very disappointed 0 
will be back again 1 
it was so bad i had lost the heart to finish it 0 
this hole in the wall has great mexican street tacos and friendly staff 1 
someone shouldve invented this sooner 1 
the pleather case doesnt fit 0 
it is so small and you dont even realize that it is there after a while of getting used to it 1 
all the actors give a wonderful performance especially jennifer rubin as jamie harris who changes from the nervous starlet in the beginning through the strange events she is part of to the cool star 1 
the bt headset was such a disapoinment 0 
this product is great it makes working a lot easier i can go to the copier while waiting on hold for something 1 
its a case of so bad it is laughable 0 
amazon sucks 0 
otherwise easy to install and use clear sound 1 
feelings thoughtsgabriels discomfort during the danceall these intangibles leap to life and come within the viewers grasp in hustons portrayal 1 
sending it back 0 
if you see it you should probably just leave it on the shelf 0 
an awesome new look for fall 2000 1 
the real disappointment was our waiter 0 
the food was terrible 0 
it has a great camera thats 2mp and the pics are nice and clear with great picture quality 1 
they do not last forever but is not overly expensive to replaceeasy to operate and the sound is much better than others i have tried 1 
bt50 battery junk 0 
their onscreen chemistry critical to the entire film is genuine 1 
i received it quickly and it works great 1 
it is not good 0 
i think this restaurant suffers from not trying hard enough 0 
this results in the phone being either stuck at max volume or mute 0 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
best breakfast buffet 1 
excellent starter wireless headset 0 
after my phone got to be about a year old its been slowly breaking despite much care on my part 0 
my husband and i ate lunch here and were very disappointed with the food and service 0 
dont waste your money and time 0 
great phone 1 
loved itfriendly servers great food wonderful and imaginative menu 1 
maybe there would be a reasonable explanation for this atrocity 0 
after the disappointing dinner we went elsewhere for dessert 0 
the cast is always entertaining as usual 1 
service stinks here 0 
crash is a depressing little nothing that provokes emotion but teaches you nothing if you already know racism and prejudice are bad things 0 
i highly recommend this movie for anyone interested in art poetry theater politics or japanese history 1 
a standout scene 1 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
thanks again to amazon for having the things i need for a good price 1 
both of them were truly unbelievably good and i am so glad we went back 1 
this fixes all the problems 1 
the poor actors 0 
im in az all the time and now have my new spot 1 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
which are small and not worth the price 0 
the pairing of the two devices was so easy it barely took a couple minutes before i started making calls with the voice dialing feature 1 
good case excellent value 1 
interesting decor 1 
even in my bmw 3 series which is fairly quiet i have trouble hearing what the other person is saying 0 
an awesome new look for fall 2000 1 
we arent ones to make a scene at restaurants but i just dont get itdefinitely lost the love after this one 0 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
a very very very slowmoving aimless movie about a distressed drifting young man 0 
battery life is also great 1 
this is the first phone ive had that has been so cheaply made 0 
funny clever hip just like prays previous film hype 1 
walked in and the place smelled like an old grease trap and only 2 others there eating 0 
what did bother me was the slow service 0 
the kids are annoying 0 
no im going to eat the potato that i found some strangers hair in it 0 
the use of slowmotion needlessly repeats itself throughout the movie but is well backed up by bad acting and bad is a kind word here no continuity scenes that are thrown in for no reason whatsoever vehicles that looked like they were made from a corn flakes box and a directorial style that bordered on stupidity 0 
much less than the jawbone i was going to replace it with 1 
much less than the jawbone i was going to replace it with 1 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
that just screams legit in my booksomethats also pretty rare here in vegas 1 
this is an excellent film 1 
but its just not funny 0 
highly recommend for any one who has a blue tooth phone 1 
it wasnt busy at all and now we know why 0 
it is indescribably the most annoying and idiotic show i have ever seen 0 
nice case feels good in your hands 1 
basically the service was very bad 0 
her lines seem to have been written by a fifteen year old though they are trying oh so so hard to sound like how a fifteen year old would really um you know well talk 0 
the burrittos blah 0 
im not really sure how joeys was voted best hot dog in the valley by readers of phoenix magazine 0 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
however after finally watching this film i realized that not only had i had a closed mind to the brilliance it depicts i also found myself watching it over and over again 1 
after arguing with verizon regarding the dropped calls we returned the phones after two days 0 
the movie lacks visual interest drama expression of feeling and celebration of the very patriotism that underlines the narrative 0 
this was a poor remake of my best friends wedding 0 
the bus boy on the other hand was so rude 0 
the only consistent thread holding the series together were the amazing performances of leni parker and anita laselva as the two taelons in quiet idealogical conflict 0 
the aerial scenes were welldone 1 
i had about two bites and refused to eat anymore 0 
just as good as when i had it more than a year ago 1 
its aggravating 0 
i want my money back 0 
it had some average acting from the main person and it was a low budget as you clearly can see 0 
the movie is littered with overt racial slurs towards the black cast members and in return the whites are depicted as morons and boobs 0 
the hockey scenes are terrible defensemen playing like theyre 5 years old goalies diving at shots that are 10 feet wide of the net etc 0 
talk about great customer service of course we will be back 1 
i especially love the long battery life 1 
amazon sucks 0 
the sweet potato tots were good but the onion rings were perfection or as close as i have had 1 
while i managed to bend the leaf spring back in place the metal now has enough stress that it will break on the next drop 0 
rude inconsiderate management 0 
all of the main players are mesmerising 1 
the owners are super friendly and the staff is courteous 1 
the dining space is tiny but elegantly decorated and comfortable 1 
we started with the tuna sashimi which was brownish in color and obviously wasnt fresh 0 
appears to actually outperform the original battery from china that came with my v325i 1 
enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film 1 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
crust is not good 0 
great case and price 1 
we wont be going back 0 
10 out of 10 for both the movie and trilogy 1 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
lately they have been extremely nice and helpful on the phone 1 
i highly recommend this modest priced cellular phone 1 
there are the usual hitchcock logic flaws 0 
i go to far too many places and ive never seen any restaurant that serves a 1 egg breakfast especially for 400 0 
funny clever hip just like prays previous film hype 1 
nevertheless yet another wonderful film from the great masters stable 1 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
no plot whatsoever 0 
excellent sound battery life and inconspicuous to boot 1 
whatever prompted such a documentary is beyond me 0 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
so flavorful and has just the perfect amount of heat 1 
i dont think you will be disappointed 1 
that one didnt work either 0 
service is quick and even to go orders are just like we like it 1 
constantine gives everything the right intensity and seems to have a good understanding of the underlying psychological motivations 1 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
good case excellent value 1 
not a good item it worked for a while then started having problems in my auto reverse tape player 0 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
paolo sorrentino has written a wonderful story about loneliness and tony has built one of the most unforgettable characters seen in movies in recent years 1 
terrible management 0 
so good i am going to have to review this place twice once hereas a tribute to the place and once as a tribute to an event held here last night 1 
summary the witticisms werent witty 0 
otherwise easy to install and use clear sound 1 
they have a really nice atmosphere 1 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
they have horrible attitudes towards customers and talk down to each one when customers dont enjoy their food 0 
this is was due to the fact that it took 20 minutes to be acknowledged then another 35 minutes to get our foodand they kept forgetting things 0 
the bathrooms are clean and the place itself is well decorated 1 
the price is reasonable and the service is great 1 
my boyfriend tried the mediterranean chicken salad and fell in love 1 
also great directing and photography 1 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
as i said abovepretty useless 0 
the characters are interesting and you really care for them 1 
we will not be coming back 0 
this is probably one of the least effective and utterly unoriginal films i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
started watching this but didnt believe in any of the characters 0 
i have had tmobile service for 2 or 3 years now and i am pretty happy with it 1 
if it was to turn my good day feeling into a night of disturbing memories than i guess he succeeded 0 
what on earth is irons doing in this film 0 
perhaps i caught them on an off night judging by the other reviews but im not inspired to go back 0 
i think this restaurant suffers from not trying hard enough 0 
poorly contstruct hinge 0 
i have bought this nokia cell phone a few weeks ago and it was a nightmare 0 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
phone now holds charge like it did when it was new 1 
the only suspense i was feeling was the frustration at just how retarded the girls were 0 
itll be a regular stop on my trips to phoenix 1 
piece of junk 0 
go rent it 1 
the battery life is highly unacceptable 0 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
unfortunately it was not good 0 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
i tried talking real loud but shouting on the telephone gets old and i was still told it wasnt great 0 
its a campy sort of film thats a joy to watch 1 
you cant beat the price on these 1 
we wont be returning 0 
portable and it works 1 
its very slow 0 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
the characters are fleshed out surprisingly well particularly grimes and blake and all the actors deliver their sharply scripted lines with just the right amount of deadpan tongue in cheek to make the dialogue both hilarious and realistic 1 
this is a beautiful phone 1 
worst thai ever 0 
a cheap and cheerless heist movie with poor characterisation lots of underbite style stoic emoting think chow yun fat in a better tomorrow and some cheesy clichés thrown into an abandoned factory ready for a few poorly executed flying judo rolls a la john woo 0 
im returning them 0 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
made very sturdy 1 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
this was one of the worst films i have ever seen 0 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
this phone works great 1 
garbo who showed right off the bat that her talents could carry over from the silent era i wanted to see some of her silent work but netflix doesnt seem to be stocking them 1 
they have great dinners 1 
the loudspeaker option is great the bumpers with the lights is very appealing 0 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
i have had tmobile service for 2 or 3 years now and i am pretty happy with it 1 
we arent ones to make a scene at restaurants but i just dont get itdefinitely lost the love after this one 0 
will order from them again 1 
these are the nicest restaurant owners ive ever come across 1 
thanks good a movie like this was done and released 1 
victor mclaglen was even bad and brian donlevy was almost unrecognizable 0 
macbeth jason connery moved me to tears with his final monolog out brief candle outhe gave the sphere of moral decay and dark forces a human face which makes it the more interesting 1 
i would give this television series a 10 plus if i could 1 
food was really boring 0 
id advise anyone to go and see it 1 
i have to jiggle the plug to get it to line up right to get decent volume 0 
the decor is nice and the piano music soundtrack is pleasant 1 
del taco is pretty nasty and should be avoided if possible 0 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
buyerbe very careful 0 
crisp and clear 1 
these are certainly very comfortable and functionality is decent 1 
the food is about on par with dennys which is to say not good at all 0 
there is however some pretty good acting at least for this type of film 1 
once you get inside youll be impressed with the place 1 
the foreigner is not worth one second of your time 0 
the lines the cuts the audio everything is wrong 0 
this place was such a nice surprise 1 
the flair bartenders are absolutely amazing 1 
the guys all had steaks and our steak loving son who has had steak at the best and worst places said it was the best steak hes ever eaten 1 
after charging overnight these batteries work great 1 
everything captain howdy says is either laughable or just plain stupid 0 
i own 2 of these cases and would order another 1 
what the hell kind of crap is that 0 
the loudspeaker option is great the bumpers with the lights is very appealing 0 
my friend did not like his bloody mary 0 
i was left shattered from the experience of watching this film and i took a good two hours to fully recover 0 
it felt too light and tinny 0 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
the steaks are all well trimmed and also perfectly cooked 1 
the soundtrack wasnt terrible either 1 
i have purchased these for both family and friends and all enjoy their clarity and ease of use 1 
delicious nyc bagels good selections of cream cheese real lox with capers even 1 
it fits so securely that the ear hook does not even need to be used and the sound is better directed through your ear canal 1 
very good product well made 1 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
what a mistake 0 
another thing i didnt really like is when a character got punched in the face a gallon of blood would spew forth soon after 0 
the writers were smack on and i think the best actors and actresses were a bonus to the showthese characters were so real 1 
having to humour him just to get by and get through the day was so apt 1 
excellent cast story line performances 1 
echo problemvery unsatisfactory 0 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
voice recognition is tremendous 1 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
steve martin delivers a really funny performance of a middleaged upper class uptight white guy 1 
you could only take 2 videos at a time and the quality was very poor 0 
no complaints 1 
i rather enjoyed it 1 
dont waste your time here 0 
i purcashed this for the car charger and it does not work 0 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
they are so easy to love but even more easy to identify with 1 
phone now holds charge like it did when it was new 1 
regardless the film fails on most levels 0 
wont ever go here again 0 
awesome service and food 1 
this fixes all the problems 1 
i did not bother contacting the company for few dollar product but i learned the lesson that i should not have bought this form online anyway 0 
though the wind and the lion is told largely through the eyes of the son every member of the family can identify with one of the characters whether it be sean connerys noble brigand candace bergens feisty heroine john hustons wily john hay or steve kanalys spiffy radiant ruthless cando lieutenant roosevelts big stick 1 
i love this cable it allows me to connect any miniusb device to my pc 1 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
the visual effects were awful 0 
will never ever go back 0 
as for the mains also uninspired 0 
he surely doesnt know how to make a coherent action movie from the screenwriter of air force one who was only obliged to write the script just for a big sum of money 0 
the acting was bad 0 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
i left the theater with a lilt in my step joy in my heart and hope for the human race 1 
the songs were the best and the muppets were so hilarious 1 
long whiny and pointless 0 
food was average at best 0 
bland not a liking this place for a number of reasons and i dont want to waste time on bad reviewing ill leave it at that 0 
the lighting is awful 0 
its hard not to fall headoverheels in love with that girl 1 
this is simply the best bluetooth headset for sound quality 1 
there is so much good food in vegas that i feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to rice and company 0 
product was excellent and works better than the verizon one and boy was it cheaper 1 
we got the food and apparently they have never heard of salt and the batter on the fish was chewy 0 
i liked the patio and the service was outstanding 1 
it works 1 
case was more or less an extra that i originally put on but later discarded because it scratched my ear 0 
not as good as i had hoped 0 
nice headphones for the price and they work great 1 
worst martini ever 0 
i saw it as a child on tv back in 1973 when it was the stranger and i loved it 1 
there are the usual hitchcock logic flaws 0 
i wasnt really impressed with strip steak 0 
if you check the directors filmography on this site you will see why this film didnt have a chance 0 
so good i am going to have to review this place twice once hereas a tribute to the place and once as a tribute to an event held here last night 1 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
we literally sat there for 20 minutes with no one asking to take our order 0 
i heart this place 1 
the plot has more holes than a pair of fishnet stockings and the direction and editing is astonishingly ham fisted 0 
insults profound deuchebaggery and had to go outside for a smoke break while serving just to solidify it 0 
my husband and i ate lunch here and were very disappointed with the food and service 0 
great place to relax and have an awesome burger and beer 1 
after one bite i was hooked 1 
her lines seem to have been written by a fifteen year old though they are trying oh so so hard to sound like how a fifteen year old would really um you know well talk 0 
dessert panna cotta was amazing 1 
nice docking station for home or work 1 
not only did the software do a great job of this i could also make my own ringtones form my existing cds without an internet connection 1 
when i opened the sandwich i was impressed but not in a good way 0 
setup went very smoothly 1 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
i really like this product over the motorola because it is allot clearer on the ear piece and the mic 1 
the only consistent thread holding the series together were the amazing performances of leni parker and anita laselva as the two taelons in quiet idealogical conflict 0 
the plot simply rumbles on like a machine desperately depending on the addition of new scenes 0 
in summary this was a largely disappointing dining experience 0 
great for ipods too 1 
items stated as included from the description are not included 0 
it is well made easy to access the phone and has a handy detachable belt clip 1 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
the sound quality is good and functionality is awesome 1 
not much seafood and like 5 strings of pasta at the bottom 0 
worth every penny 1 
i love this device 1 
you get incredibly fresh fish prepared with care 1 
an interesting premise and billy drago is always good as a dangerous nutbag side note id love to see drago stephen mchattie and lance hendrikson in a flick together talk about raging cheekbones 1 
no complaints 1 
their daily specials are always a hit with my group 1 
i left with a stomach ache and felt sick the rest of the day 0 
i just cant explain this movie more than romanticcharminghilariousand adorablethe junkyard scenes are funnyall the junkyard dogs have something specialtoo funny i laughedkids will love itbuy it when it comes outit has new features 1 
was not happy 0 
it always cuts out and makes a beep beep beep sound then says signal failed 0 
the voice recognition thru the handset is excellent 1 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
i love their fries and their beans 1 
highly recommended 1 
all i can do is whine on the internet so here it goesthe more i use the thing the less i like it 0 
the construction of the headsets is poor 0 
this is a chilly unremarkable movie about an author livingworking in a chilly abstruse culture 0 
would come back again if i had a sushi craving while in vegas 1 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
uncomfortable in the ear dont use with lg vx9900 env 0 
it is very comfortable to wear as well which is probably the most important aspect about using a case 1 
ordered burger rare came in well done 0 
the film is way too long 0 
my first visit to hiro was a delight 1 
but despite these few flaws this case is of exceptional quality and well worth the additional costs of owning an official oem product 1 
really good product 1 
the worst sappiest dialogue i could go on and on 0 
i had to go to a store and bought a new nokia phone which is working great 1 
very unreliable service from tmobile 0 
easy to pair with my samsung cell 1 
come hungry leave happy and stuffed 1 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
damian is so talented and versatile in so many ways of writing and portraying different characters on screen 1 
it was clear that she had the range and ability to pull off this part 1 
wow loved this place 1 
left very frustrated 0 
the management is rude 0 
predictable but not a bad watch 1 
this is the kind of money that is wasted properly 1 
one more thing i can tolerate political incorrectness very well im all for artistic freedom and suspension of disbelief but the slavic female character was just too much 0 
buyer beware you could flush money right down the toilet 0 
during several different 2 minute calls i experienced 5 drops and it was in an area that had 5 bars 0 
poor construction 0 
if there was ever a movie that needed wordofmouth to promote this is it 1 
now this dish was quite flavourful 1 
i love it 1 
the movie is not completely perfect but titta di girolamo will stay with you for a long time after the vision of the movie 1 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
do not buy do not buyit sucks 0 
i dont think it would hold it too securly on your belt 0 
friends pasta also bad he barely touched it 0 
the greek dressing was very creamy and flavorful 1 
del taco is pretty nasty and should be avoided if possible 0 
overall i was not impressed and would not go back 0 
it rocked my world and is certainly a must see for anyone with no social or physical outlets 1 
we also ordered the spinach and avocado salad the ingredients were sad and the dressing literally had zero taste 0 
i rate this movie 910 1 
the writers were smack on and i think the best actors and actresses were a bonus to the showthese characters were so real 1 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
yes its shiny on front side and i love it 1 
i sat riveted to the tv screen 1 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
i might have gotten a defect but i would not risk buying it again because of the built quality alone 0 
the first time i ever came here i had an amazing experience i still tell people how awesome the duck was 1 
juano hernandez an exceptional actor who played supporting roles in many films of the era is a proud black man who is accused of murdering a white man in the south 1 
the very idea of it was lame take a minor character from a mediocre pg13 film and make a complete nonsequel while changing its tone to a pgrated family movie 0 
it has kept up very well 1 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
it fits so securely that the ear hook does not even need to be used and the sound is better directed through your ear canal 1 
really really good rice all the time 1 
we walked away stuffed and happy about our first vegas buffet experience 1 
the hockey scenes are terrible defensemen playing like theyre 5 years old goalies diving at shots that are 10 feet wide of the net etc 0 
the staff is friendly and the joint is always clean 1 
speaking of the music it is unbearably predictably and kitchy 0 
i keep watching it over and over 1 
steer clear of this product and go with the genuine palm replacementr pens which come in a threepack 0 
i do think tom hanks is a good actor 1 
it was so boring 0 
i could barely stomach the meal but didnt complain because it was a business lunch 0 
i especially love the long battery life 1 
but it wasnt until i watched this film that i realised how great he actually was 1 
i love this phone it is very handy and has a lot of features 1 
not good for the money 0 
i was bored throughout the whole damn thing 0 
if that bug never showed up i would have given a 4 for sure but on the other side of the wall where this bug was climbing was the kitchen 0 
you need at least 3 mins to get to your phone book from the time you first turn on the phonebattery life is short 0 
their daily specials are always a hit with my group 1 
audio quality is poor very poor 0 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
both the hot sour the egg flower soups were absolutely 5 stars 1 
the cashier had no care what so ever on what i had to say it still ended up being wayyy overpriced 0 
lots of holes in the script 0 
i liked this movie way too much 1 
im surprised this is a good quality car charger and theres not much reviews about it 1 
five star plus plus 1 
this film tries to be a serious and sophisticated thrillerhorror flick and it fails miserably 0 
fantastic service here 1 
but i thought his acting was skilled 1 
it is light easy to use and has very clear reception and transmission 1 
will not be back 0 
everything was fresh and delicious 1 
my 810 score is mostly for the plot 1 
the fried rice was dry as well 0 
i was so insulted 0 
howeverthe riingtones are not the best and neither are the games 0 
there was hardly any meat 0 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
i love this place 1 
overall i wasnt very impressed with noca 0 
the fried rice was dry as well 0 
it is wonderful and inspiring to watch and i hope that it gets released again on to video or dvd 1 
well im satisfied 1 
10 out of 10 stars 1 
i believe that this place is a great stop for those with a huge belly and hankering for sushi 1 
excellent product for the price 1 
they have a really nice atmosphere 1 
youll love it 1 
i rate this movie 910 1 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
great phone 1 
i highly recommend this modest priced cellular phone 1 
gets a signal when other verizon phones wont 1 
the worst one of the series 0 
works like a charm it work the same as the one i got with the phone 1 
the mic is great 1 
no actress has been worse used that june allison in this movie 0 
it kept getting worse and worse so now im officially done 0 
and i just love the colors 1 
not impressed 0 
definitely worth seeing its the sort of thought provoking film that forces you to question your own threshold of loneliness 1 
it was so boring 0 
i was shocked because no signs indicate cash only 0 
cool phone 1 
just whatever you do avoid groove as its the antithesis of all that is good about human traffic 0 
their rotating beers on tap is also a highlight of this place 1 
the eargels channel the sound directly into your ear and seem to increase the sound volume and clarity 1 
everything is appalling 0 
not good enough for the price 0 
it is very comfortable to wear as well which is probably the most important aspect about using a case 1 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
do not buy do not buyit sucks 0 
i wont spoil it but the ending in pretty amazing 1 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
does not work 0 
i went on motorolas website and followed all directions but could not get it to pair again 0 
the sound quality is good and functionality is awesome 1 
im super pissd 0 
i dont know what the big deal is about this place but i wont be back yaall 0 
the story itself is just predictable and lazy 0 
the seller is very understanding and patient i would definitely buy from them again 1 
a week later after i activated it it suddenly died 0 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
dont waste your on this one 0 
it did not work in my cell phone plug i am very up set with the charger 0 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
this gets a 1 out of 10 simply because theres nothing lower 0 
because both ears are occupied background is not distracting at all 1 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
i particularly remember my senses being assaulted by strident cords of music that would blare out with very little warning and even less meaning 0 
lovely little thriller from hitchcock with lots of nice shenanigans surrounding a murdered spy a kidnapped child a nasty church a foreign plot and some random taxidermists 1 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
excellent hands free tool 1 
definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly will return next time im in vegas 1 
you share general loewenhielms exquisite joy in his partaking of the cailles en sarcophage even though you are just watching a movie but you do wish for just a small sample to savor 1 
this film highlights the fundamental flaws of the legal process that its not about discovering guilt or innocence but rather is about who presents better in court 1 
they work about 2 weeks then break 0 
the scenes with the ohsomature neighbourgirl are a misplace 0 
i could not recommend these more 0 
dont buy it 0 
great brunch spot 1 
actually the graphics were good at the time 1 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
steamboat willie is an amazingly important film to our cinema history 1 
rip off over charge shipping 0 
would not recommend to others 0 
i go to far too many places and ive never seen any restaurant that serves a 1 egg breakfast especially for 400 0 
my ribeye steak was cooked perfectly and had great mesquite flavor 1 
food was really good and i got full petty fast 1 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
we also ordered the spinach and avocado salad the ingredients were sad and the dressing literally had zero taste 0 
i received it quickly and it works great 1 
in particular the relationship between the bakery assistant and the waitress just didnt work for me at all 0 
this battery is an excellent bargain 1 
terrible phone holder 0 
the sound quality is good and functionality is awesome 1 
we waited for thirty minutes to be seated although there were 8 vacant tables and we were the only folks waiting 0 
terrible product and waste of money 0 
i was shocked because no signs indicate cash only 0 
as an earlier review noted plug in this charger and nothing happens 0 
youll love how thin it is 1 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
ray charles life provided excellent biographical material for the film which goes well beyond being just another movie about a musician 1 
if you check the directors filmography on this site you will see why this film didnt have a chance 0 
the acting sucks the music sucks the script sucks the pacing sucks the special fx suck the directing sucks basically this movie sucks 0 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
i can think of no other film where something vitally important occurs every other minute 1 
highly recommend for any one who has a blue tooth phone 1 
the pairing of the two devices was so easy it barely took a couple minutes before i started making calls with the voice dialing feature 1 
now imagine that every single one of those decisions was made wrong 0 
the attempts at humor were pitiful and story is so awful it dosent bear thinking about which basically involves a vulcan stealing the enterprise to find god seriously i just didnt care about any of this film and oh not to mention uhura does a belly dance to distract male guards 0 
its a feelgood film and thats how i felt when i came out of the cinema 1 
its just painful 0 
love this product 1 
funny clever hip just like prays previous film hype 1 
the characters are interesting and you really care for them 1 
the servers are not pleasant to deal with and they dont always honor pizza hut coupons 0 
seems like a good quick place to grab a bite of some familiar pub food but do yourself a favor and look elsewhere 0 
some may say this buffet is pricey but i think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot 1 
i will never forget it now 1 
this phone is pretty sturdy and ive never had any large problems with it 1 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
talk about useless customer service 0 
you can even take self portraits with the outside exterior display very cool 1 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
the phone loads super 1 
food was really good and i got full petty fast 1 
overall the film is interesting and thoughtprovoking 1 
the kids are annoying 0 
no complaints 1 
the warm beer didnt help 0 
all in all i give this one a resounding 9 out of 10 1 
i wont be back 0 
nice quality build unlike some cheap s out there 1 
when achille and philippa beautifully sing a duet from don giovanni that perfectly describes their situation in the movie you appreciate the subtle layers of this excellent film 1 
excellent phone 1 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
terrible my car will not accept this cassette 0 
terrible phone holder 0 
i bought this phone as a replacement for my startac and have regretted it since 0 
coming here is like experiencing an underwhelming relationship where both parties cant wait for the other person to ask to break up 0 
this is a chilly unremarkable movie about an author livingworking in a chilly abstruse culture 0 
the warmth it generates is in contrast to its austere backdrop 1 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
this place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver 0 
see it 1 
i believe the screenwriter did a good job of tying up the loose ends 1 
they do not last forever but is not overly expensive to replaceeasy to operate and the sound is much better than others i have tried 1 
yes its shiny on front side and i love it 1 
lange had become a great actress 1 
bluetooth range is good a few days ago i left my phone in the trunk got a call and carried the conversation without a hitch 1 
i loved it it was really scary 1 
bad script bad direction and horrible acting make this one plain bad 0 
all in all its an insult to ones intelligence and a huge waste of money 0 
macbeth jason connery moved me to tears with his final monolog out brief candle outhe gave the sphere of moral decay and dark forces a human face which makes it the more interesting 1 
please dont waste your money 0 
i rate this movie 910 1 
kind of hard to mess up a steak but they did 0 
nice spicy and tender 1 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
its a campy sort of film thats a joy to watch 1 
only pros large seating area nice bar area great simple drink menu the best brick oven pizza with homemade dough 1 
bt50 battery junk 0 
i dont each much pasta but i love the homemade hand made pastas and thin pizzas here 1 
strike 2 who wants to be rushed 0 
lousy product 0 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
excellent sound battery life and inconspicuous to boot 1 
hayao miyazakis latest and eighth film for studio ghibili gake no ue no ponyo ponyo on the cliff by the sea is a wonderfully fun and imaginative look at childhood 1 
however my girl was complain that some time the phone doesnt wake up like normal phone does 0 
product is useless since it does not have enough charging current to charge the 2 cellphones i was planning to use it with 0 
all in all i think it was a good investment 1 
the performances are real and gripping the crocdodile is extremely well done indeed if the black water website is to be believed thats because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous 1 
the good cinematography also makes her and monica bellucci look very beautiful 1 
by the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant i was bored and didnt care what happened next and so i switched off 0 
went in for happy hour great list of wines 1 
but whatever it was that cost them so much it didnt translate to quality thats for sure 0 
now this is a movie i really dislike 0 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
putting the race card aside lets look at the major flaw in the film they destroy latifas character 0 
worst customer service ever 0 
seriously flavorful delights folks 1 
as for the killer dont expect anything original or even remotely frightening 0 
it deserves strong love 1 
but other than that the movie seemed to drag and the heroes didnt really work for their freedom 0 
this is the place where i first had pho and it was amazing 1 
loved itfriendly servers great food wonderful and imaginative menu 1 
as always the evening was wonderful and the food delicious 1 
waiter was a jerk 0 
the waitresses are very friendly 1 
its not what it says it is 0 
the writer gorman bechard undoubtedly did his homework because all references are industry and characterage appropriate 1 
when im on this side of town this will definitely be a spot ill hit up again 1 
i mean in a realistic world she would never have gotten into that ballet repertory the whole thing was quite pathetic 0 
i kept catching the cable on the seat and i had to pull the phone out to turn it on an off 0 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
it was so funny 1 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
i got the aluminum case for my new palm vx and it worked really wellit has protected my handheld perfectly so far 1 
he really didnt seem to want to be hosting his voiceovers were monotonous didnt get involved with the guests 0 
pricing is a bit of a concern at mellow mushroom 0 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
it is a joy to use 1 
audio quality is poor very poor 0 
how can that bethe audio quality is poor 0 
my only problem is i thought the actor playing the villain was a low rent michael ironside 0 
the bose noise cancelling is amazing which is very important for a nyc commuter 1 
i ate there twice on my last visit and especially enjoyed the salmon salad 1 
yet plantronincs continues to use the same flawed charger design 0 
they really want to make your experience a good one 1 
delicious and i will absolutely be back 1 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
worked very well paired with a treo 700w and as a skype headset on my pc using a usb bluetooth transceiver 1 
you cant go wrong with any of the food here 1 
it never condescends all the characters have good genuine hearts and believable problems 1 
i also didnt like the on button it felt like it would crack with use 0 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
i dont like this nokia either 0 
i cant use this case because the smell is disgusting 0 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
bad reception 0 
things that went wrong they burned the saganaki 0 
great food 1 
as many people complained i found this headsets microphone was very weak 0 
very cheap plastic creaks like an old wooden floor 0 
my experience was terrible this was my fourth bluetooth headset and while it was much more comfortable than my last jabra which i hated 0 
treo and tmobile refused to replace it again and forced me to buy another phone without any kind of upgrade discount 0 
im glad i found this product on amazon it is hard to find it wasnt high priced 1 
shrimp when i unwrapped it i live only 12 a mile from brushfire it was literally ice cold 0 
bought mainly for the charger which broke soon after purchasing 0 
just whatever you do avoid groove as its the antithesis of all that is good about human traffic 0 
while i managed to bend the leaf spring back in place the metal now has enough stress that it will break on the next drop 0 
i took back my money and got outta there 0 
considering the relations off screen between taylor and stanwyck it was surprising how little chemistry there was on screen between the two of them 0 
reception is terrible and full of static 0 
i wont be back 0 
i would have given no star if i was able 0 
the sweet potato tots were good but the onion rings were perfection or as close as i have had 1 
shes poised and amazing 1 
service was good and the company was better 1 
there is really nothing for me at postinos hope your experience is better 0 
this short film certainly pulls no punches 0 
i guess that nobody at the network that aired this dribble watched it before putting it on 0 
its a fresh subtle and rather sublime effect 1 
wow what a bad film 0 
but the actingeven that of such professionals as drago and debbie rochonwas terrible the directing worse perhaps contributory to the former the dialog chimplike and the camera work barely tolerable 0 
jawbone era is awesome too 1 
he was very impressed when going from the original battery to the extended battery 1 
that just screams legit in my booksomethats also pretty rare here in vegas 1 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
the macarons here are insanely good 1 
the service was great even the manager came and helped with our table 1 
the acting was bad 0 
not easy to watch 0 
if there was ever an indication of a writer and a directors ability to meld two highly volatile temperaments into a seamless union of creativity then this is it 1 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
third the cheese on my friends burger was cold 0 
total letdown i would much rather just go to the camelback flower shop and cartel coffee 0 
he is almost unbearable to watch on screen he has little to no charisma and terrible comedic timing 0 
this device is great in several situations1 1 
the film is way too long 0 
everything was good and tasty 1 
im using it with an iriver spinn with case and it fits fine 1 
the battery runs down quickly 0 
in addition it feels amp looks as if the phone is all lightweight cheap plastic 0 
they made this case too small and is very difficult to install 0 
it also took her forever to bring us the check when we asked for it 0 
hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in 0 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
i saw it as a child on tv back in 1973 when it was the stranger and i loved it 1 
updatewent back for a second time and it was still just as amazing 1 
i think this restaurant suffers from not trying hard enough 0 
constantine gives everything the right intensity and seems to have a good understanding of the underlying psychological motivations 1 
these headphones were a great find and i think they are perhaps the best purchase ive made in the last several years seriously 1 
so far it has worked like a charm 1 
the acting was bad 0 
the worst piece of crap ever along with the verizon customer service 0 
what should have been a hilarious yummy christmas eve dinner to remember was the biggest fail of the entire trip for us 0 
this phone is pretty sturdy and ive never had any large problems with it 1 
now this dish was quite flavourful 1 
they really want to make your experience a good one 1 
the movie in movie situations in the beginning and through the game that is played with her by the acting coach are fascinating 1 
im pleased 1 
the camera really likes her in this movie 1 
then our food came out disappointment ensued 0 
bland not a liking this place for a number of reasons and i dont want to waste time on bad reviewing ill leave it at that 0 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
we waited for thirty minutes to be seated although there were 8 vacant tables and we were the only folks waiting 0 
the keyboard is a nice compromise between a full qwerty and the basic cell phone number keypad 1 
my boyfriend tried the mediterranean chicken salad and fell in love 1 
only had this a month but its worked flawlessly so far 1 
cinematography noteworthy including fine views of barcelona and its famed gaudi towers 1 
artless camerawork endlessly presents us with the ugliest setting imaginable ie 0 
much less than the jawbone i was going to replace it with 1 
i dressed up to be treated so rudely 0 
it always cuts out and makes a beep beep beep sound then says signal failed 0 
you get incredibly fresh fish prepared with care 1 
they never brought a salad we asked for 0 
if you have not seen this movie i definitely recommend it 1 
the movie is full of wonderful dancing hence the title 1 
the manager was the worst 0 
cant say enough good things about this place 1 
plug was the wrong size 0 
but now that it is out of warranty the same problems reoccurebottom line put your money somewhere else cingular will not support it 0 
beautiful styling though 1 
its been my choice headset for yearsgreat sound good volume good noise cancellation 1 
yet i enjoy watching it 1 
doesnt work 0 
it works 1 
this is the first phone ive had that has been so cheaply made 0 
i have only had it for a few weeks but so far so good 1 
the sweet potato tots were good but the onion rings were perfection or as close as i have had 1 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
and the chef was generous with his time even came around twice so we can take pictures with him 1 
yes i am simplifying things here for the sake of brevity for this really is at the core of the problems with this film it has too much going on without any real fulfilling explanation 0 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
the staff is great the food is delish and they have an incredible beer selection 1 
it never condescends all the characters have good genuine hearts and believable problems 1 
dont waste your time 0 
totally believable 1 
lange had become a great actress 1 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
works great 1 
his performance as awarded was stunning 1 
the best part about nurse betty is its unpredictability 1 
i understand that its supposed to be a cheap popcorn comedy but that doesnt mean that it has to completely insult our intelligence and have writing so incredibly hackneyed that it borders on offensive 0 
its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
it showed exactly how the government and the scientist argued for humanity and the reasons of the gadget 1 
an excellent new restaurant by an experienced frenchman 1 
my headset works just peachykeen 1 
great software for motorolas 1 
it is light easy to use and has very clear reception and transmission 1 
piece of junk 0 
all the actors give a wonderful performance especially jennifer rubin as jamie harris who changes from the nervous starlet in the beginning through the strange events she is part of to the cool star 1 
all in all im quite satisfied with this purchase 1 
leopard print is wonderfully wild 1 
bad characters bad story and bad acting 0 
the roast beef sandwich tasted really good 1 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
the instructions didnt explain that a microphone jack could be used 0 
the staff is great the food is delish and they have an incredible beer selection 1 
this is definitely a cult classic well worth viewing and sharing with others 1 
it is zillion times away from reality 0 
beautiful styling though 1 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
seriously flavorful delights folks 1 
plus its only 8 bucks 1 
i dont think well be going back anytime soon 0 
you wont regret it 1 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
it is well made easy to access the phone and has a handy detachable belt clip 1 
oh this is such a thing of beauty this restaurant 1 
this blueant supertooth handsfree phone speaker is awesome 1 
very pleased with this headset 1 
rating 1 out of 10 0 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
very clear quality sound and you dont have to mess with the sound on your ipod since you have the sound buttons on the headset 1 
i know he was a contract player with little control over his scripts but the acting was as bad as the script 0 
i only hear garbage for audio 0 
i would highly recommend this product 1 
if good intentions made a film great then this film might be one of the greatest films ever made 1 
the eargels channel the sound directly into your ear and seem to increase the sound volume and clarity 1 
it really created a unique feeling though 1 
this movie is so awesome 1 
i work in the hospitality industry in paradise valley and have refrained from recommending cibo any longer 0 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
it is not good 0 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
he is one of my favourite directors and one of the most talented directors in the history of cinema 1 
mediocre food 0 
that said our mouths and bellies were still quite pleased 1 
this is by far the worst purchase ive made on amazon 0 
great phone 1 
the charger worked for about a week and then completely stopped charging my phone 0 
absolutel junk 0 
terrible phone holder 0 
the fish is badly made and some of its underwater shots are repeated a thousand times in the film 0 
the food is good 1 
he was very impressed when going from the original battery to the extended battery 1 
there is so much good food in vegas that i feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to rice and company 0 
i didnt know pulled pork could be soooo delicious 1 
the ri style calamari was a joke 0 
i didnt know pulled pork could be soooo delicious 1 
awesome selection of beer 1 
my sanyo has survived dozens of drops on blacktop without ill effect 1 
i waited and waited 0 
you cant beat that 1 
this isnt a small family restaurant this is a fine dining establishment 1 
its pretty easy 1 
to call this movie a drama is ridiculous 0 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
it was an inexpensive piece but i would still have expected better quality 0 
i also decided not to send it back because our waitress looked like she was on the verge of having a heart attack 0 
no im going to eat the potato that i found some strangers hair in it 0 
say bye bye to your tip lady 0 
the movie is terribly boring in places 0 
the warmth it generates is in contrast to its austere backdrop 1 
both of them were truly unbelievably good and i am so glad we went back 1 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
this results in the phone being either stuck at max volume or mute 0 
doesnt work 0 
woa talk about awful 0 
there is simply no excuse for something this poorly done 0 
this is a great restaurant at the mandalay bay 1 
wow what a bad film 0 
i really wanted the plantronics 510 to be the right one but it has too many issues for methe good 0 
it is unusable in a moving car at freeway speed 0 
the service was terrible though 0 
and the accents are absolutely abysmal 0 
battery chargelife is quite long 1 
great charger 1 
very slow at seating even with reservation 0 
headset works great was packaged nicely to avoid any damage 1 
comfortable in my hand 1 
and sometimes it was so embarrassing that i had to look away 0 
oh the charger seems to work fine 1 
the price was very good and with the free shipping and all it was a good purchase 1 
i got to enjoy the seafood salad with a fabulous vinegrette 1 
i ordered albondigas soup which was just warm and tasted like tomato soup with frozen meatballs 0 
i love lane but ive never seen her in a movie this lousy 0 
i love this bluetooth 1 
waitress was a little slow in service 0 
i keep watching it over and over 1 
the ear buds only play music in one ear 0 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
i had to wait over 30 minutes to get my drink and longer to get 2 arepas 0 
i will not be eating there again 0 
battery has no life 0 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
the football scenes at the end were perplexing 0 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
if you stay in vegas you must get breakfast here at least once 1 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
this movie contained an allstar cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i havent seen before 1 
why are these sad little vegetables so overcooked 0 
excellent starter wireless headset 0 
what a piece of junk i lose more calls on this phone 0 
everything was gross 0 
it is light easy to use and has very clear reception and transmission 1 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
ive also had problems with the phone reading the memory card in which i always turn it on and then off again 0 
its not hard to make a decent hamburger 0 
avoid at all cost 0 
tonight i had the elk filet specialand it sucked 0 
this was my first time and i cant wait until the next 1 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
though the wind and the lion is told largely through the eyes of the son every member of the family can identify with one of the characters whether it be sean connerys noble brigand candace bergens feisty heroine john hustons wily john hay or steve kanalys spiffy radiant ruthless cando lieutenant roosevelts big stick 1 
they are so cool 1 
trumbull on i love lucy 1 
this movie is also revealing 1 
really ugly 0 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
the art style has the appearance of crayonpencil drawings and is wonderfully colorful and fanciful 1 
alexander nevsky is a great film 1 
for service i give them no stars 0 
i gave it 5 stars then and im giving it 5 stars now 1 
uncomfortable in the ear dont use with lg vx9900 env 0 
dont waste your money 0 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
the management is rude 0 
the writers were smack on and i think the best actors and actresses were a bonus to the showthese characters were so real 1 
almost everyone involved must be return to school acting is utterly predictable and bad script is pile of garbage all round 0 
small sleek impressive looking practical setup with ample storage in place 1 
terrible my car will not accept this cassette 0 
also the area where my unit broke im not too fond of the magnetic strap 0 
down the drain because of a weak snap 0 
good protection and does not make phone too bulky 1 
good food good service 1 
the entire audience applauded at the conclusion of the film 1 
trouble is the writing and directing make it impossible to establish those things that make a movie watchable like character story theme and so on 0 
clever and a real crowdpleaserthis film still ranks among mickeys best films even after 80 wonderful years 1 
this is the phone to get for 2005 i just bought my s710a and all i can say is wow 1 
but what really made it unwatchable was the direction 0 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
i love it 1 
not good when wearing a hat or sunglasses 0 
the cg opening sequence in space looked like it could have been created on microsoft slideshow for gods sake 0 
i like armand assante my cable companys summary sounded interesting so i watched it twice already and probably will again 1 
poor quality and service 0 
i didnt want the clip going over the top of my ear causing discomfort 0 
they will customize your order any way youd like my usual is eggplant with green bean stir fry love it 1 
its a fresh subtle and rather sublime effect 1 
great movie 1 
our server was very nice and even though he looked a little overwhelmed with all of our needs he stayed professional and friendly until the end 1 
what makes this story different are the terrific production values faultless photography composition and editing the terrific casting the underappreciated brian keith playing a bully teddy and vivid history 1 
this little device has transformed my organizational capability and made my life a whole lot easier 1 
thats how id describe this painfully dreary timewaster of a film 0 
gotta love those closeups of slimy drooling teeth 1 
service was good and the company was better 1 
this is cool because most cases are just open there allowing the screen to get all scratched up 1 
if you have not seen this movie i definitely recommend it 1 
my only problem is i thought the actor playing the villain was a low rent michael ironside 0 
some applause should be given to the prelude however 1 
10 out of 10 for both the movie and trilogy 1 
regardless the film fails on most levels 0 
today was my first taste of a buldogis gourmet hot dog and i have to tell you it was more than i ever thought possible 1 
they work about 2 weeks then break 0 
i love the camera its really pretty good quality 1 
would not reccommend 0 
imdb ratings only go as low 1 for awful its time to get some negative numbers in there for cases such as these 0 
the chicken dishes are ok the beef is like shoe leather 0 
great for ipods too 1 
omg the food was delicioso 1 
you can find better movies at youtube 0 
the management is rude 0 
seller shipped quickly and much cheaper than the competitors 1 
the mic there is a joke and the volume is quite low 0 
i cannot make calls at certain places 0 
the food amazing 1 
mediocre food 0 
i kept looking at the time and it had soon become 35 minutes yet still no food 0 
the chips and salsa were really good the salsa was very fresh 1 
i cannot make calls at certain places 0 
this is a stunning movie 1 
but this movie is definitely a below average rent 0 
both of them were truly unbelievably good and i am so glad we went back 1 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
the performances are not improved by improvisation because the actors now have twice as much to worry about not only whether theyre delivering the line well but whether the line itself is any good 0 
i have read others reviews here but i havent had any problem with it 1 
i am glad i purchased it 1 
this movie contained an allstar cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i havent seen before 1 
because both ears are occupied background is not distracting at all 1 
much more interesting more action more suspense and less of the unneeded controversy 1 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
gave up trying to eat any of the crust teeth still sore 0 
disappointing 0 
the only thing that i think could improve is the sound leaks out from the headset 0 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
i gave it 5 stars then and im giving it 5 stars now 1 
its an empty hollow shell of a movie 0 
this wonderful experience made this place a muststop whenever we are in town again 1 
great phone 1 
great food 1 
the croutons also taste homemade which is an extra plus 1 
first of all there are enough racial stereotypes and racial jokes to offend everyone 0 
only like 3 or 4 buildings used a couple of locations maybe poor hummh 0 
watching washing machine twirling around wouldnt hurt your eyes as much as this show 0 
this is an excellent film 1 
the tracfonewebsite is user friendly and makes it easy toactivate etc 1 
however after seeing the short again after about 25 years i was amazed at how timeless the film actually is 1 
the bt headset was such a disapoinment 0 
both rickman and stowe play their roles to the hilt in this tale of a childrens book writer who maybe has written a subversive tract 1 
it quit working after id used it for about 18 months so i just purchased another one because this is the best headset ive ever owned 1 
camera color balance is awful 0 
also its slim enough to fit into my alarm clock docking station without removing the case 1 
the eargels channel the sound directly into your ear and seem to increase the sound volume and clarity 1 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
the phone is sturdy and waterproof 1 
but storm trooper is not even bad enough to make it to the list of wonderfully terrible movies 0 
third the cheese on my friends burger was cold 0 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
characters are onedimensional even the good guys and especially the bad guys 0 
i also decided not to send it back because our waitress looked like she was on the verge of having a heart attack 0 
by the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant i was bored and didnt care what happened next and so i switched off 0 
i wear glasses and it fits fine with them 1 
this is essentially a communications tool that does not communicate 0 
thanks again to amazon for having the things i need for a good price 1 
doesnt work 0 
i have had tmobile service for 2 or 3 years now and i am pretty happy with it 1 
it was a great phone 1 
damian is so talented and versatile in so many ways of writing and portraying different characters on screen 1 
very very fun chef 1 
this was a poor remake of my best friends wedding 0 
reception is terrible and full of static 0 
otherwise dont even waste your time on this 0 
it was too predictable even for a chick flick 0 
the sergeant pepper beef sandwich with auju sauce is an excellent sandwich as well 1 
beautiful styling though 1 
the use of slowmotion needlessly repeats itself throughout the movie but is well backed up by bad acting and bad is a kind word here no continuity scenes that are thrown in for no reason whatsoever vehicles that looked like they were made from a corn flakes box and a directorial style that bordered on stupidity 0 
muddy low quality sound and the casing around the wires insert was poorly super glued and slid off 0 
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1 
awesome selection of beer 1 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
you learn a lot about the real inside emotions of people in this movie and a lot about the movie business itself 1 
the characters are interesting and you really care for them 1 
i was not impressed by this product 0 
howeverthe riingtones are not the best and neither are the games 0 
awesome service and food 1 
the reception has been generally good 1 
couldnt use the unit with sunglasses not good in texas 0 
i bought this battery with a coupon from amazon and im very happy with my purchase 1 
i dont each much pasta but i love the homemade hand made pastas and thin pizzas here 1 
everything was gross 0 
it didnt charge for me 0 
i love this phone 1 
i gave it 5 stars then and im giving it 5 stars now 1 
a standout scene 1 
secondly hitchcock pretty much perfected the thriller and chase movie 1 
just what i wanted 1 
i can take a little bad service but the food sucks 0 
juano hernandez an exceptional actor who played supporting roles in many films of the era is a proud black man who is accused of murdering a white man in the south 1 
the warm beer didnt help 0 
del taco is pretty nasty and should be avoided if possible 0 
and those baby owls were adorable 1 
camerawork again bad 0 
i think i was one of the people who found this another one of roths pearls 1 
this if the first movie ive given a 10 to in years 1 
the script is bad very bad  it contains both cheesiness and unethical joke that you normally see in rated r or nc17 movie 0 
i had to go to a store and bought a new nokia phone which is working great 1 
bela lugosi was totally extraneous intoning odd lines 0 
did not like at all 0 
i was very disappointed in the movie 0 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
the awful dialogue and hopeless overacting by everyone who gets shot top off a real waste of space and time 0 
the only thing i did like was the prime rib and dessert section 1 
the staff are also very friendly and efficient 1 
think it over when you plan to own this onethis sure is the last moto phone for me 0 
did not like at all 0 
customer service was terrible 0 
it didnt make me scared horrified or make me sympathetic towards the characters it was simply annoying 0 
it worked very well 1 
my husband and i ate lunch here and were very disappointed with the food and service 0 
i felt as though her going to ireland did absolutely nothing whatsoever 0 
fantastic food 1 
price is good too 1 
it was so boring 0 
i hate writing bad reviews about films especially those in which i really like the star but this film is so bad i dont believe for one second that anyone could have been proud of it 0 
at any rate this film stinks its not funny and fulci should have stayed with giallo and supernatural zombie movies 0 
a cheap and cheerless heist movie with poor characterisation lots of underbite style stoic emoting think chow yun fat in a better tomorrow and some cheesy clichés thrown into an abandoned factory ready for a few poorly executed flying judo rolls a la john woo 0 
i will continue to come here on ladies night andddd date night highly recommend this place to anyone who is in the area 1 
absolutely great 1 
on the ground right next to our table was a large smeared beensteppedinandtrackedeverywhere pile of green bird poop 0 
mishima is extremely uninteresting 0 
the restaurant atmosphere was exquisite 1 
exactly what i wanted 1 
would not go back 0 
i highly recommend this device to everyone 1 
also if your phone is dropped this case is not going to save it specially when dropped face down 0 
performed awful muffled tinny incoming sound and severe echo for those on the other end of the call 0 
i was shocked because no signs indicate cash only 0 
just reading on the specs alone makes you say wow 1 
then our food came out disappointment ensued 0 
id advise anyone to go and see it 1 
the best phone in market 1 
it had some average acting from the main person and it was a low budget as you clearly can see 0 
i believe every one should see this movie as i think few people outside of south africa understand its past and what is being attempted in the truth and reconciliation process 1 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
the only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port irda 0 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
worth every penny 1 
things that went wrong they burned the saganaki 0 
the only thing worse than taylors acting was stanwycks singing 0 
fantastic food 1 
the accompanied software is almost brilliant 1 
this is simply the best bluetooth headset for sound quality 1 
the restaurant atmosphere was exquisite 1 
as many people complained i found this headsets microphone was very weak 0 
i wont say any more i dont like spoilers so i dont want to be one but i believe this film is worth your time 1 
it works 1 
im so sorry but i really cant recommend it to anyone 0 
to those who find this movie intelligent or even masterful i can only say its your intelligence and your imagination you obviously used to try and make some sense of this pitiful attempt its in our human nature to try and make sense of things 0 
i wasnt really impressed with strip steak 0 
what a disappointment 0 
freezes frequently4 0 
before i go in to why i gave a 1 star rating please know that this was my third time eating at bachi burger before writing a review 0 
oh yeah and the storyline was pathetic too 0 
1010 1 
i had absolutely no problem with this headset linking to my 8530 blackberry curve 1 
an absolute must visit 1 
it has kept up very well 1 
with great sound effects and impressive special effects i cant recommend this movie enough 1 
i came over from verizon because cingulair has nicer cell phones the first thing i noticed was the really bad service 0 
the desserts were a bit strange 0 
we had fantastic service and were pleased by the atmosphere 1 
the results well are a shame 0 
their daily specials are always a hit with my group 1 
i found a six inch long piece of wire in my salsa 0 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
i came back today since they relocated and still not impressed 0 
superb phone on a great network 1 
we thought youd have to venture further away to get good sushi but this place really hit the spot that night 1 
headset works great was packaged nicely to avoid any damage 1 
what happened next was prettyoff putting 0 
the cinematographyif it can be called thatsucked 0 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
this is a great place to eat 1 
my only problem is i thought the actor playing the villain was a low rent michael ironside 0 
the screen size is big key pad lit well enough and the camera quality is excellent for a camera phone 1 
they could serve it with just the vinaigrette and it may make for a better overall dish but it was still very good 1 
dont waste your money 0 
i believe that pitch black was done well 1 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
my 810 score is mostly for the plot 1 
i would recommend this 1 
im translating movies for a living and this is the first movie in my 5year working experience that i found offensive to my intelligence 0 
shes poised and amazing 1 
i loved it 1 
i can assure you that you wont be disappointed 1 
could not get strong enough signal 0 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
nice solid keyboard 1 
the worst piece of crap ever along with the verizon customer service 0 
that was done in the second movie 0 
waitress was good though 1 
i know he was a contract player with little control over his scripts but the acting was as bad as the script 0 
kind of flops around 0 
first of all there are enough racial stereotypes and racial jokes to offend everyone 0 
worst phone ever 0 
there is however some pretty good acting at least for this type of film 1 
this movie is also revealing 1 
i could barely stomach the meal but didnt complain because it was a business lunch 0 
this is cool because most cases are just open there allowing the screen to get all scratched up 1 
the acting is fantastic the stories are seamlessly woven together and the dogs are splendid a must rent view or see 1 
very disappointed and wondered how it could be in the oscar shortlist 0 
it isnt even an achievement as a sobaditsgood or sobaditsmemorable movie 0 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
they keep getting better and better this is my third one and ive had numerous palms too 1 
it was a long time that i didnt see a so charismatic actor on screen 1 
nice design and quality 1 
love this product 1 
i guess it was supposed to be clever twist then shed some light on the situation but it was just stupid 0 
at a time when it seems that film animation has been dominated by disneypixars cgi masterpieces it is both refreshing and comforting to know that miyazaki is still relying on traditional handdrawn animation to tell his charming and enchanting stories 1 
there is a brilliant twist ending 1 
not worth it 0 
truly awful 0 
overall a great experience 1 
i checked out this place a couple years ago and was not impressed 0 
the good cinematography also makes her and monica bellucci look very beautiful 1 
so there is no way for me to plug it in here in the us unless i go by a converter 0 
i rather enjoyed it 1 
excellent starter wireless headset 0 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
the tracfonewebsite is user friendly and makes it easy toactivate etc 1 
also the area where my unit broke im not too fond of the magnetic strap 0 
for a product that costs as much as this one does i expect it to work far better and with greater ease than this thing does 0 
i gave it 5 stars then and im giving it 5 stars now 1 
the service was outshining i definitely recommend the halibut 1 
even worse than ticker 0 
the bartender was also nice 1 
i didnt want the clip going over the top of my ear causing discomfort 0 
the food was excellent and service was very good 1 
once your food arrives its meh 0 
unfortunately the ability to actually know you are receiving a call is a rather important feature and this phone is pitiful in that respect 0 
talk about useless customer service 0 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
what a disappointment 0 
it felt like a very gripping intelligent stage play but without the overly theatrical feeling one actually gets from watching people on a stage which plays on everyones terror of a white lie escalating to monstrous consequences 1 
the only very disappointing thing was there was no speakerphone 0 
okay i like to consider myself a fair critic so ill give credit where credits duethe creature effects were actually pretty cool 1 
they are so cool 1 
left very frustrated 0 
del taco is pretty nasty and should be avoided if possible 0 
i give it 2 thumbs down 0 
for a self proclaimed coffee cafe i was wildly disappointed 0 
all i can do is whine on the internet so here it goesthe more i use the thing the less i like it 0 
sound quality on both end is excellent i use headset to call my wife and ask my wife to use headset to call me 2 1 
but when someone strives for greatness and poetry but delivers a muddled and often ridiculous story a bunch of disparate scenes pretentious dialogue then you get the worst kind of a movie that some other reviewer very accurately defined as pretentious crap 0 
cant get the software to work with my computer 0 
in particular the relationship between the bakery assistant and the waitress just didnt work for me at all 0 
5 stars for the brick oven bread app 1 
it is a really good show to watch 1 
the movie in movie situations in the beginning and through the game that is played with her by the acting coach are fascinating 1 
the block was amazing 1 
dont waste your money 0 
this place is amazing 1 
dont waste your money 0 
my 5year old nokia 2160 from tracfone holds the charge a lot better than this 0 
i waited and waited 0 
awful service 0 
the battery is completely useless to me 0 
lot of holes in the plot theres nothing about how he became the emperor nothing about where he spend 20 years between his childhood and mature age 0 
i guess maybe we went on an off night but it was disgraceful 0 
its a long time since i was so entertained by a movie 1 
i took back my money and got outta there 0 
this is a good battery and it got here really fast 1 
works great 1 
this place is overpriced not consistent with their boba and it really is overpriced 0 
i struggle to find anything bad to say about it 1 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
another note about this phones appearance is that it really looks rather bland especially in the all black model 0 
it was way over fried 0 
in the span of an hour i had two people exclaim whoa is that the new phone on tv 1 
the plot such as it is is so derivative and predictable that the ending is like a mercy killing 0 
i immediately said i wanted to talk to the manager but i did not want to talk to the guy who was doing shots of fireball behind the bar 0 
excellent hands free tool 1 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
i dont think ill be running back to carlys anytime soon for food 0 
that just screams legit in my booksomethats also pretty rare here in vegas 1 
i wouldnt return 0 
awful 0 
nothing new there 0 
my friend did not like his bloody mary 0 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
seems like a good quick place to grab a bite of some familiar pub food but do yourself a favor and look elsewhere 0 
disapointing results 0 
very disappointed 0 
he is almost unbearable to watch on screen he has little to no charisma and terrible comedic timing 0 
very very sad 0 
makes it easier to keep up with my bluetooth when im not wearing it 0 
these are fabulous 1 
i have recommended it to friends 1 
i as well wouldve given godfathers zero stars if possible 0 
the acting is like watching wooden puppets moving around and reading from a book thats how bad it is 0 
i find this inexcusable and so will probably be returning this phone and perhaps changing carriers 0 
just what i wanted 1 
i really do recommend this place you can go wrong with this donut place 1 
youll love it 1 
we loved the biscuits 1 
excellent performance 1 
fantastic earphones 1 
would come back again if i had a sushi craving while in vegas 1 
it was a riot to see hugo weaving play a sexobsessed gay real estate salesman who uses his clients houses for his trysts with the flaming darren tom hollander 1 
avoid avoid avoid 0 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
battery is holding up well 1 
the food was terrible 0 
total waste of time 0 
best tacos in town by far 1 
what this film lacks is a convincing script 0 
that company is a joke 0 
when achille and philippa beautifully sing a duet from don giovanni that perfectly describes their situation in the movie you appreciate the subtle layers of this excellent film 1 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
lovely little thriller from hitchcock with lots of nice shenanigans surrounding a murdered spy a kidnapped child a nasty church a foreign plot and some random taxidermists 1 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
i started this review with two stars but im editing it to give it only one 0 
not good for the money 0 
otherwise easy to install and use clear sound 1 
this movie is a good and humorous comment on life in 2006 1 
i enjoyed it 1 
ray charles life provided excellent biographical material for the film which goes well beyond being just another movie about a musician 1 
i love this bluetooth 1 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
good quality 1 
i wasnt expecting oscar material but this 0 
worst service to boot but that is the least of their worries 0 
the cocktails are all handmade and delicious 1 
the burger i got the gold standard a 17 burger and was kind of disappointed 0 
awful 0 
i swung in to give them a try but was deeply disappointed 0 
what a mistake that was 0 
i am a fan of his this movie sucked really bad 0 
ive had this bluetoooth headset for some time now and still not comfortable with the way it fits on the ear 0 
plantronics bluetooth excelent buy 1 
after charging overnight these batteries work great 1 
overall a delight 1 
the phone crashed completely and now i have to get it replaced 0 
i love this bluetooth 1 
cooked to perfection and the service was impeccable 1 
they were goldencrispy and delicious 1 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
i dont think i will be back for a very long time 0 
for a product that costs as much as this one does i expect it to work far better and with greater ease than this thing does 0 
i felt asleep the first time i watched it so i can recommend it for insomniacs 0 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
phone falls out easily 0 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
disappointing 0 
good food good service 1 
ive had better not only from dedicated boba tea spots but even from jenni pho 0 
i got the car charger and not even after a week the charger was brokeni went to plug it in and it started smoking 0 
a usable keyboard actually turns a pda into a realworld useful machine instead of just a neat gadget 1 
i love this phone 1 
funny clever hip just like prays previous film hype 1 
great for ipods too 1 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
these are the central themes of the film and they are handled ineptly stereotypically and with no depth of imagination 0 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
we are so glad we found this place 1 
great steak great sides great wine amazing desserts 1 
go and see it 1 
none of the three sizes they sent with the headset would stay in my ears 0 
highly recommended a 1 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
uncomfortable in the ear dont use with lg vx9900 env 0 
damn good steak 1 
the acting by the whole cast could be put on a scale and balanced perfectly between overacting and underacting 0 
the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach 0 
but when i check voice mail at night the keypad backlight turns off a few seconds into the first message and then im lost 0 
just spicy enough perfect actually 1 
hands down my favorite italian restaurant 1 
on the good side the staff was genuinely pleasant and enthusiastic a real treat 1 
it defeats the purpose of a bluetooth headset 0 
same evening him and i are both drastically sick 0 
you get incredibly fresh fish prepared with care 1 
it also had a new problem 0 
i know this is not like the other restaurants at all something is very off here 0 
magical help 1 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
if you havent gone here go now 1 
the tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu 0 
the scenery that the two daughters paint and photograph are beautiful 1 
okay i like to consider myself a fair critic so ill give credit where credits duethe creature effects were actually pretty cool 1 
great earpiece 1 
very windresistant 1 
this movie now joins revenge of the boogeyman and zombiez as part of the hellish trinity of horror films 0 
i ordered albondigas soup which was just warm and tasted like tomato soup with frozen meatballs 0 
love it great armband 1 
the cast is good 1 
despite the pans of reviewers i liked this movie 1 
i particularly remember my senses being assaulted by strident cords of music that would blare out with very little warning and even less meaning 0 
this is one of the better buffets that i have been to 1 
it was probably dirt 0 
the sangria was about half of a glass wine full and was 12 ridiculous 0 
considering the relations off screen between taylor and stanwyck it was surprising how little chemistry there was on screen between the two of them 0 
the screen size is big key pad lit well enough and the camera quality is excellent for a camera phone 1 
delete this film from your mind 0 
the jamaican mojitos are delicious 1 
this fixes all the problems 1 
i hate writing bad reviews about films especially those in which i really like the star but this film is so bad i dont believe for one second that anyone could have been proud of it 0 
and if that isnt enough of a mess of a movie for you the picture is also marred with a constant use of studio sets and indoor exteriors 0 
simple lightweight and great fit 1 
that just screams legit in my booksomethats also pretty rare here in vegas 1 
this was such an awesome movie that i bought it off of ebay 1 
these were so good we ordered them twice 1 
alexander nevsky is a great film 1 
i received my supposedly new motorola 375 and apparently there was not a match between the phone and the charger 0 
i saw it as a child on tv back in 1973 when it was the stranger and i loved it 1 
i had the mac salad and it was pretty bland so i will not be getting that again 0 
jabra ear gels r the best 1 
its too bad the food is so damn generic 0 
judith light is one of my favorite actresses and i think she does a superb job in this film 1 
and i just love the colors 1 
highly unprofessional and rude to a loyal patron 0 
im pleased 1 
great earpiece 1 
this place receives stars for their appetizers 1 
the dining space is tiny but elegantly decorated and comfortable 1 
i wasnt expecting oscar material but this 0 
cumbersome design 0 
love it great armband 1 
very good phone 1 
i do love sushi but i found kabuki to be overpriced overhip and underservices 0 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
this place is awesome if you want something light and healthy during the summer 1 
1 hour 54 minutes of sheer tedium melodrama and horrible acting a mess of a script and a sinking feeling of good lord what were they thinking 0 
by this time our side of the restaurant was almost empty so there was no excuse 0 
headset works great was packaged nicely to avoid any damage 1 
the acting helps the writing along very well maybe the idiotsavant sister could have been played better and it is a real joy to watch 1 
the performances are not improved by improvisation because the actors now have twice as much to worry about not only whether theyre delivering the line well but whether the line itself is any good 0 
freezes frequently4 0 
level 5 spicy was perfect where spice didnt overwhelm the soup 1 
i would recommend purchasing the jabra jx10 series 2 which works flawlessly with my moto q go figure 1 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
the worst was the salmon sashimi 0 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
considering the relations off screen between taylor and stanwyck it was surprising how little chemistry there was on screen between the two of them 0 
all of the tapas dishes were delicious 1 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
im surprised this is a good quality car charger and theres not much reviews about it 1 
the whole experience was underwhelming and i think well just go to ninja sushi next time 0 
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
all in all its an insult to ones intelligence and a huge waste of money 0 
yes this film does require a rather significant amount of puzzlesolving but the pieces fit together to create a beautiful picture 1 
you will leave the theater wanting to go out and dance under the stars 1 
disappointed with battery 0 
rating 010 grade z note the show is so bad that even mother of the cast pull her daughter out of the show 0 
i think not again 0 
you can even take self portraits with the outside exterior display very cool 1 
battery is holding up well 1 
his losing his marbles so early in the proceedings is totally implausible and unconvincing 0 
i will not be eating there again 0 
im trying to return it for a refund 0 
this review is long overdue since i consider a tale of two sisters to be the single greatest film ever made 1 
cant get the software to work with my computer 0 
also great directing and photography 1 
recommend with confidence 1 
i immediately said i wanted to talk to the manager but i did not want to talk to the guy who was doing shots of fireball behind the bar 0 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
clever and a real crowdpleaserthis film still ranks among mickeys best films even after 80 wonderful years 1 
terrible product and waste of money 0 
i was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar not only because the quality is great but the service is fast and the food impeccable 1 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
you get extra minutes so that you can carry out the call and not get cut off 1 
horrible 0 
this is a great product sure beats using your fingers 1 
the problem was the script 0 
the earpiece on this is too large or too heavyit keeps falling out of my ear 0 
at any rate this film stinks its not funny and fulci should have stayed with giallo and supernatural zombie movies 0 
i could care less the interior is just beautiful 1 
i can take a little bad service but the food sucks 0 
friends pasta also bad he barely touched it 0 
nice ambiance 1 
this is an extraordinary film 1 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
it is practically useless and did not add any kind of boost to my reception after i bought it 0 
i think this restaurant suffers from not trying hard enough 0 
come hungry leave happy and stuffed 1 
the accompanied software is almost brilliant 1 
best breakfast buffet 1 
the warm beer didnt help 0 
to sum the film up breeders is a terrible cheaply made horror movie that should be avoided like the ebola virus 0 
stay away from the q 0 
punishment park is a brilliant piece of cinema 1 
good food good service 1 
this is essentially a communications tool that does not communicate 0 
this movie does an excellent job of revealing the complexity of the task and the incredible challenges facing south africa 1 
the menu is always changing food quality is going down service is extremely slow 0 
i recently had problems where i could not stay connected for more than 10 minutes before being disconnected 0 
in summary this was a largely disappointing dining experience 0 
the nano stated itmy son was dissapointed 0 
i definitly recommend 1 
this place is amazing 1 
artless camerawork endlessly presents us with the ugliest setting imaginable ie 0 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
the turkey and roast beef were bland 0 
id like to return it 0 
good product good seller 1 
the desserts were a bit strange 0 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
every time he opened his mouth you expect to hear you see kids pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show 0 
very serious spoilers this movie was a huge disappointment 0 
the food wasnt good 0 
their steaks are 100 recommended 1 
does everything it should and more 1 
nothing at all to recommend 0 
this one is simply a disappointment 0 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
however paul schrader has indeed made a film about mishima that is both superb complex 1 
excellent bluetooth headset 1 
really awful 0 
if she had not rolled the eyes we may have stayed not sure if we will go back and try it again 0 
this review is long overdue since i consider a tale of two sisters to be the single greatest film ever made 1 
i wish i could return the unit and get back my money 0 
i believe the screenwriter did a good job of tying up the loose ends 1 
after one bite i was hooked 1 
the last 15 minutes of movie are also not bad as well 1 
if there was ever a movie that needed wordofmouth to promote this is it 1 
i have eaten here multiple times and each time the food was delicious 1 
we also ordered the spinach and avocado salad the ingredients were sad and the dressing literally had zero taste 0 
it was an inexpensive piece but i would still have expected better quality 0 
the accompanied software is almost brilliant 1 
ill be looking for a new earpiece 0 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
the script is bad very bad  it contains both cheesiness and unethical joke that you normally see in rated r or nc17 movie 0 
feelings thoughtsgabriels discomfort during the danceall these intangibles leap to life and come within the viewers grasp in hustons portrayal 1 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
the turkey and roast beef were bland 0 
clear skype calls long battery life long range 1 
this is a bad film with bad writing and good actorsan ugly cartoon crafted by paul haggis for people who cant handle anything but the bold strokes in storytellinga picture painted with crayons 0 
is it possible for a movie to get any worse than this 0 
it has a very good plot it holds your complete attention the acting is superb tom wilkinson was fantastic and emily watson was also very good 1 
for that price i can think of a few place i would have much rather gone 0 
nargile i think you are great 1 
highly unprofessional and rude to a loyal patron 0 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
the incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film 1 
the food was delicious our bartender was attentive and personable and we got a great deal 1 
i could not stand to even watch it for very long for fear of losing iq 0 
clever and a real crowdpleaserthis film still ranks among mickeys best films even after 80 wonderful years 1 
but it wasnt anything at all just one big yawn 0 
after a year the battery went completely dead on my headset 0 
their chow mein is so good 1 
you wont regret it 1 
see it 1 
an excellent new restaurant by an experienced frenchman 1 
fantastic earphones 1 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
i started this review with two stars but im editing it to give it only one 0 
i rate this movie 910 1 
this is cool because most cases are just open there allowing the screen to get all scratched up 1 
terrible my car will not accept this cassette 0 
jamie foxx absolutely is ray charles 1 
fantastic buy and will get again for whatever my next phone is 1 
owners are really great people 1 
we asked for the bill to leave without eating and they didnt bring that either 0 
i like the fact that it rests lightly against your ear rather than inside 1 
it is perfect for a sitdown family meal or get together with a few friends 1 
great phone 1 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
i wear it everyday and it holds up very well 1 
i can assure you that you wont be disappointed 1 
dont waste your money and time 0 
he cant act one of the least scary villains i have ever seen he cant write did he write this damn movie in his sleep 0 
i loved it it was really scary 1 
the food was barely lukewarm so it must have been sitting waiting for the server to bring it out to us 0 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
works great 1 
and the beans and rice were mediocre at best 0 
it sure does beat the nachos at the movies but i would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant 0 
just what i wanted 1 
everyone is treated equally special 1 
about 30 minutes of footage is wasted to show mediocre elderly actors awkwardly babbling overwrought pseudosatanic gibberish corny enough to make a teen goth blush almost always in olde english and sometimes in latin that may or may not be made up words 0 
dont waste your time here 0 
ive had better not only from dedicated boba tea spots but even from jenni pho 0 
i dont like this nokia either 0 
great phone 1 
its a gloriously fun fast paced and fairly accurate portrayal of the night of a raver 1 
the very idea of it was lame take a minor character from a mediocre pg13 film and make a complete nonsequel while changing its tone to a pgrated family movie 0 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
its a fresh subtle and rather sublime effect 1 
the awful dialogue and hopeless overacting by everyone who gets shot top off a real waste of space and time 0 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
the holster that arrived did not match the photo in the ad 0 
this second appearance of mickey mouse following the silent plane crazy earlier that year is probably his most famous filmmostly because it was so groundbreaking 1 
it defeats the purpose of a bluetooth headset 0 
useless phone simply deaf 0 
the restaurant is very clean and has a family restaurant feel to it 1 
very clear quality sound and you dont have to mess with the sound on your ipod since you have the sound buttons on the headset 1 
bad quality 0 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
but other than that the movie seemed to drag and the heroes didnt really work for their freedom 0 
i consider this theft 0 
the fries were not hot and neither was my burger 0 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
cool phone 1 
highly recommended for all ages although the younger set will probably not appreciate some of the more subtle references they will certainly appreciate one galley scene in particular 1 
if you love authentic mexican food and want a whole bunch of interesting yet delicious meats to choose from you need to try this place 1 
i dont know exactly what it is about this movie but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our familys memories 1 
nine out of ten for a truly lovely film 1 
service sucks 0 
ill be looking for a new earpiece 0 
the service was terrible though 0 
im trying to return it for a refund 0 
the steak and the shrimp are in my opinion the best entrees at gc 1 
what makes this story different are the terrific production values faultless photography composition and editing the terrific casting the underappreciated brian keith playing a bully teddy and vivid history 1 
but then they came back cold 0 
food quality has been horrible 0 
i really like this product over the motorola because it is allot clearer on the ear piece and the mic 1 
i was very disappointed in the movie 0 
i believe every one should see this movie as i think few people outside of south africa understand its past and what is being attempted in the truth and reconciliation process 1 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
that one didnt work either 0 
so flavorful and has just the perfect amount of heat 1 
definitely will come back here again 1 
so there is no way for me to plug it in here in the us unless i go by a converter 0 
so far it has worked like a charm 1 
item arrived quickly and works great with my metro pcs samsung schr450 slider phone and sony premium sound in ear plugs 1 
we had so much to say about the place before we walked in that he expected it to be amazing but was quickly disappointed 0 
john garfield ann revere lilli plmer william conrad canada leeand filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screenjames wong howe 1 
but in any case the best part is you can download these pictures to your laptop using ir or even send pictures from your laptop to the phone 1 
portable and it works 1 
nice sound 1 
i was deeply impressed with the character he played 1 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
restored my phone to like new performance 1 
and the accents are absolutely abysmal 0 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
fits comfortably came with three sizes of earbud tips 1 
very disappointed in accessoryone 0 
i know this is not like the other restaurants at all something is very off here 0 
for that its worth checking out 1 
the live music on fridays totally blows 0 
so in a nutshell 1 the restaraunt smells like a combination of a dirty fish market and a sewer 0 
service was very prompt 1 
must have been an off night at this place 0 
absolutely great 1 
seriously flavorful delights folks 1 
special thanks to dylan t for the recommendation on what to order all yummy for my tummy 1 
then scene where they debated whether or not to sack the trumpeter who falsely was accused for the murder is pure horror really stupid 0 
an awesome new look for fall 2000 1 
this item worked great but it broke after 6 months of use 0 
but its just not funny 0 
ray charles is legendary 1 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
seafood was limited to boiled shrimp and crab legs but the crab legs definitely did not taste fresh 0 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
i totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is 1 
it presents a idyllic yet serious portrayal of the ups and downs of the characters lives 1 
you cant beat that 1 
but the actingeven that of such professionals as drago and debbie rochonwas terrible the directing worse perhaps contributory to the former the dialog chimplike and the camera work barely tolerable 0 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
razr battery good buy 1 
the pleather case doesnt fit 0 
at any rate this film stinks its not funny and fulci should have stayed with giallo and supernatural zombie movies 0 
in the span of an hour i had two people exclaim whoa is that the new phone on tv 1 
i dont think ill be running back to carlys anytime soon for food 0 
his performance as awarded was stunning 1 
bad fit way too big 0 
the phone takes forever to charge like 2 to 5 hours literally 0 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
we got the food and apparently they have never heard of salt and the batter on the fish was chewy 0 
highly unprofessional and rude to a loyal patron 0 
i also decided not to send it back because our waitress looked like she was on the verge of having a heart attack 0 
this movie is greatespecially if you enjoy visual arts 1 
ordered burger rare came in well done 0 
its uncomfortable and the sound quality is quite poor compared with the phone razr or with my previous wired headset that plugged into an lg 0 
a great touch 1 
i love the ringtones because they are so upbeat 1 
thank you for such great service 1 
secondly hitchcock pretty much perfected the thriller and chase movie 1 
they do not last forever but is not overly expensive to replaceeasy to operate and the sound is much better than others i have tried 1 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
go and see it 1 
total letdown i would much rather just go to the camelback flower shop and cartel coffee 0 
easy to pair with my samsung cell 1 
he came running after us when he realized my husband had left his sunglasses on the table 1 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
i left with a stomach ache and felt sick the rest of the day 0 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
the service was a little slow considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace 0 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
nice solid keyboard 1 
okay i like to consider myself a fair critic so ill give credit where credits duethe creature effects were actually pretty cool 1 
i go to far too many places and ive never seen any restaurant that serves a 1 egg breakfast especially for 400 0 
the telephone repair man was really funny and his reactions to the nuts and bitchy boss were truly genuine 1 
the shower area is outside so you can only rinse not take a full shower unless you dont mind being nude for everyone to see 0 
works well 1 
the lead man is charismafree 0 
great pizza and salads 1 
i would highly recommend this 1 
i really hope the team behind this movie makes more movies and that they will continue to do so in their own some kinda weird style 1 
i can say that the desserts were yummy 1 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
disappointed with battery 0 
they know how to make them here 1 
this movie is also revealing 1 
simple lightweight and great fit 1 
what a mistake 0 
headset works great was packaged nicely to avoid any damage 1 
if she had not rolled the eyes we may have stayed not sure if we will go back and try it again 0 
muddy low quality sound and the casing around the wires insert was poorly super glued and slid off 0 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
for sushi on the strip this is the place to go 1 
if there was ever a movie that needed wordofmouth to promote this is it 1 
i received my supposedly new motorola 375 and apparently there was not a match between the phone and the charger 0 
server did a great job handling our large rowdy table 1 
i highly recommend this device to everyone 1 
i love this device 1 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
battery life is real good 1 
very good product well made 1 
its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
if that bug never showed up i would have given a 4 for sure but on the other side of the wall where this bug was climbing was the kitchen 0 
its a fresh subtle and rather sublime effect 1 
sam shepards portrayal of a gung ho marine was sobering 1 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
the service was terrible though 0 
you need two hands to operate the screenthis software interface is decade old and cannot compete with new software designs 0 
this place is horrible and way overpriced 0 
easy to use 1 
great food and service huge portions and they give a military discount 1 
worthless product 0 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
the film deserves strong kudos for taking this stand for having exceptional acting from its mostly lesserknown cast and for the superintelligent script that doesnt insult the audience or take the easy way out when it comes to white racism 1 
defective crap 0 
very friendly staff 1 
portable and it works 1 
good servicecheck 1 
to be honest with you this is unbelievable nonsense and very foolish 0 
i swung in to give them a try but was deeply disappointed 0 
the directing and the cinematography arent quite as good 0 
its a case of so bad it is laughable 0 
not sure who was more lost the flat characters or the audience nearly half of whom walked out 0 
ambience is perfect 1 
i want my money back 0 
a usable keyboard actually turns a pda into a realworld useful machine instead of just a neat gadget 1 
i think not again 0 
very good product well made 1 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
great movie 1 
highly recommend for any one who has a blue tooth phone 1 
the sound quality is good and functionality is awesome 1 
the awful dialogue and hopeless overacting by everyone who gets shot top off a real waste of space and time 0 
50 down the drain 0 
worst thai ever 0 
the food amazing 1 
i wasnt really impressed with strip steak 0 
i loved it it was really scary 1 
the warmth it generates is in contrast to its austere backdrop 1 
she carries the movie well 1 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
avoid avoid avoid 0 
the camera although rated at an impressive 13 megapixels renders images that fall well below expectations of such a relatively high resolution 0 
this movie is a good and humorous comment on life in 2006 1 
there was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters 0 
stay away from the q 0 
they made this case too small and is very difficult to install 0 
for 40 bucks a head i really expect better food 0 
i took back my money and got outta there 0 
nice docking station for home or work 1 
after my phone got to be about a year old its been slowly breaking despite much care on my part 0 
last time buying from you 0 
this short film certainly pulls no punches 0 
this is a great place to eat 1 
definitely a bargain 1 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
im not sure what he was trying to do with this film 0 
terrible my car will not accept this cassette 0 
linksys should have some way to exchange a bad phone for a refurb unit or something 0 
not only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic but it also managed to give away the entire movie and im not exaggerating every moment every plot point every joke is told in the trailer 0 
the only good thing was that it fits comfortably on small ears 1 
the desserts were a bit strange 0 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
i love it 1 
an excellent new restaurant by an experienced frenchman 1 
nice quality build unlike some cheap s out there 1 
waste of 13 bucks 0 
the directing seems too pretentious 0 
and there wasnt a single sour note struck actingwise either some surprisingly solid casting here 1 
not loud enough and doesnt turn on like it should 0 
a good film by a great director 1 
good product good seller 1 
oh and i forgot to also mention the weird color effect it has on your phone 0 
you cant go wrong with any of the food here 1 
their chow mein is so good 1 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
talk about great customer service of course we will be back 1 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
it has everything i need and i couldnt ask for more 1 
and generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode 0 
motorola finally got the voice quality of a bluetooth headset right 1 
i am very impressed with this headset from plantronics 1 
this movie was kind of long in length but i enjoyed every minute of it 1 
he is an amazing film artist one of the most important whoever lived 1 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
all the other cases ive tried normally fall apart after a few months but this one seems to be in for the long haul 1 
this item worked great but it broke after 6 months of use 0 
it is a very well acted and done tv movie 1 
this is the place where i first had pho and it was amazing 1 
i love their fries and their beans 1 
it deserves strong love 1 
the reception has been generally good 1 
the acting was decidely wooden though no worse than a period universal b movie 0 
summary the witticisms werent witty 0 
this isnt a small family restaurant this is a fine dining establishment 1 
the chicken dishes are ok the beef is like shoe leather 0 
ray charles life provided excellent biographical material for the film which goes well beyond being just another movie about a musician 1 
simple lightweight and great fit 1 
please dont waste your money 0 
think of the film being like a dream 1 
doesnt hold charge 0 
using all earpieces left or right this thing will not stay on my ear 0 
initially the local sites in the film which was filmed here in buffalo intrigued me 1 
what a waste 0 
both great 1 
at first i thought i was grtting a good deal at 744 until i plugged it into my phone v3c razr 0 
then as if i hadnt wasted enough of my life there they poured salt in the wound by drawing out the time it took to bring the check 0 
its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
food was good service was good prices were good 1 
i guess i should have known that this place would suck because it is inside of the excalibur but i didnt use my common sense 0 
very serious spoilers this movie was a huge disappointment 0 
great phone 1 
it had some average acting from the main person and it was a low budget as you clearly can see 0 
dont buy it 0 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
though the wind and the lion is told largely through the eyes of the son every member of the family can identify with one of the characters whether it be sean connerys noble brigand candace bergens feisty heroine john hustons wily john hay or steve kanalys spiffy radiant ruthless cando lieutenant roosevelts big stick 1 
but i dont like it 0 
one of the best mexican movies ever and one of the less understood even by mexican themselves no matter how identified the should have felt with it 1 
i love being able to use one headset for both by landline and cell 1 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
avoid this one if you can 0 
while you dont yet hear mickey speak there are tons of sound effects and music throughout the filmsomething we take for granted now but which was a huge crowd pleaser in 1928 1 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
i felt as though her going to ireland did absolutely nothing whatsoever 0 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
that was done in the second movie 0 
this movie is a good and humorous comment on life in 2006 1 
this place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver 0 
on the ground right next to our table was a large smeared beensteppedinandtrackedeverywhere pile of green bird poop 0 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
the owner used to work at nobu so this place is really similar for half the price 1 
you wont regret it 1 
its been my choice headset for yearsgreat sound good volume good noise cancellation 1 
plus it was wellpaced and suited its relatively short run time 1 
great product fast shipping 1 
this second appearance of mickey mouse following the silent plane crazy earlier that year is probably his most famous filmmostly because it was so groundbreaking 1 
the 12 mega pixel camera being a part of a phone is reasonably good7 1 
the good cinematography also makes her and monica bellucci look very beautiful 1 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
i would recommend saving room for this 1 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
the only place good for this film is in the garbage 0 
one character is totally annoying with a voice that gives me the feeling of fingernails on a chalkboard 0 
i wasnt expecting oscar material but this 0 
but storm trooper is not even bad enough to make it to the list of wonderfully terrible movies 0 
i advise you to look out for it 1 
heres where the movie really pied me off 0 
so badwellits just bad 0 
this phone tries very hard to do everything but fails at its very ability to be a phone 0 
john garfield ann revere lilli plmer william conrad canada leeand filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screenjames wong howe 1 
also great directing and photography 1 
but what really made it unwatchable was the direction 0 
hayao miyazakis latest and eighth film for studio ghibili gake no ue no ponyo ponyo on the cliff by the sea is a wonderfully fun and imaginative look at childhood 1 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
and i really did find them funny 1 
the sound quality is excellent as well 1 
i was bored throughout the whole damn thing 0 
how can anyone in their right mind ask for anything more from a movie than this 1 
it plays louder than any other speaker of this size the price is so low that most would think the quality is lacking however its not 1 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
its so bad its actually worth seeing just for that reason 0 
im glad i found this product on amazon it is hard to find it wasnt high priced 1 
terrible phone holder 0 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
ive had this bluetoooth headset for some time now and still not comfortable with the way it fits on the ear 0 
simply beautiful 1 
at a time when it seems that film animation has been dominated by disneypixars cgi masterpieces it is both refreshing and comforting to know that miyazaki is still relying on traditional handdrawn animation to tell his charming and enchanting stories 1 
fits comfortably came with three sizes of earbud tips 1 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
not loud enough and doesnt turn on like it should 0 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
see both films if you can 1 
the feel of the dining room was more college cooking course than high class dining and the service was slow at best 0 
what makes this story different are the terrific production values faultless photography composition and editing the terrific casting the underappreciated brian keith playing a bully teddy and vivid history 1 
im not eating here 0 
i enjoyed reading this book to my children when they were little 1 
disappointing experience 0 
an absolute must visit 1 
my wife had the lobster bisque soup which was lukewarm 0 
really ugly 0 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
not recommended 0 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
i saw this movie and i thought this is a stupid movie 0 
if you are razr owneryou must have this 1 
great bluetooth 1 
i give wirefly 1 stari will contact cingularatt and inform them of this practice 0 
this may be the only bad film he ever made 0 
i have yet to run this new battery below two bars and thats three days without charging 1 
the service was meh 0 
a must study for anyone interested in the worst sins of industrial design 0 
i immediately said i wanted to talk to the manager but i did not want to talk to the guy who was doing shots of fireball behind the bar 0 
i always order from the vegetarian menu during dinner which has a wide array of options to choose from 1 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
again lame 0 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
it is the best charger i have seen on the market yet 1 
i love my 350 headset my jabra350 bluetooth headset is great the reception is very good and the ear piece is a comfortable fit 1 
the food was very good 1 
in conclusion i will not bother with this movie because a volcano in los angeles is nothing but nonsense 0 
omit watching this 0 
its hard not to fall headoverheels in love with that girl 1 
this is an excellent tool especially when paired with your phones autoanswer 1 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
this is a bad film with bad writing and good actorsan ugly cartoon crafted by paul haggis for people who cant handle anything but the bold strokes in storytellinga picture painted with crayons 0 
i think that it is a must see older john wayne film 1 
the servers went back and forth several times not even so much as an are you being helped 0 
of course the acting is blah 0 
poorly contstruct hinge 0 
i have bought this nokia cell phone a few weeks ago and it was a nightmare 0 
i have had tmobile service for 2 or 3 years now and i am pretty happy with it 1 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
when my order arrived one of the gyros was missing 0 
also its slim enough to fit into my alarm clock docking station without removing the case 1 
like the other reviewer said you couldnt pay me to eat at this place again 0 
restored my phone to like new performance 1 
my 5year old nokia 2160 from tracfone holds the charge a lot better than this 0 
i saw it as a child on tv back in 1973 when it was the stranger and i loved it 1 
his costars dont fare much better with people like morgan freeman jonah hill and ed helms just wasted 0 
some great music and terrific scenery 1 
we recently witnessed her poor quality of management towards other guests as well 0 
yes this film does require a rather significant amount of puzzlesolving but the pieces fit together to create a beautiful picture 1 
this is a beautiful phone 1 
to sum the film up breeders is a terrible cheaply made horror movie that should be avoided like the ebola virus 0 
of course the footage from the 70s was grainy but that only enhanced the film 1 
i guess i should have known that this place would suck because it is inside of the excalibur but i didnt use my common sense 0 
seriously killer hot chai latte 1 
the movie is littered with overt racial slurs towards the black cast members and in return the whites are depicted as morons and boobs 0 
there is a brilliant twist ending 1 
it kept getting worse and worse so now im officially done 0 
never got it 0 
waitress was good though 1 
i believe that pitch black was done well 1 
cumbersome design 0 
it is shameful 0 
will order from them again 1 
this is cool because most cases are just open there allowing the screen to get all scratched up 1 
the movie in movie situations in the beginning and through the game that is played with her by the acting coach are fascinating 1 
come hungry leave happy and stuffed 1 
bought mainly for the charger which broke soon after purchasing 0 
this is probably the most irritating show i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
does not fit 0 
too bad you have to pay up to a month for the service 0 
during several different 2 minute calls i experienced 5 drops and it was in an area that had 5 bars 0 
i really like this product over the motorola because it is allot clearer on the ear piece and the mic 1 
overall a great experience 1 
the restaurant is very clean and has a family restaurant feel to it 1 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
but in terms of the writing its very fresh and bold 1 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
none of the three sizes they sent with the headset would stay in my ears 0 
it definitely was not as good as my s11 1 
hands down my favorite italian restaurant 1 
this is an unbelievable bargain 1 
worst service to boot but that is the least of their worries 0 
it was pretty gross 0 
rude inconsiderate management 0 
these are the central themes of the film and they are handled ineptly stereotypically and with no depth of imagination 0 
i could not recommend these more 0 
the block was amazing 1 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
timely shipment and quality product 1 
never again will i be dining at this place 0 
doesnt work at all i bougth it for my l7c and its not working 0 
the potatoes were like rubber and you could tell they had been made up ahead of time being kept under a warmer 0 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
the telephone repair man was really funny and his reactions to the nuts and bitchy boss were truly genuine 1 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
perabo has a nice energy level and is obviously very comfortable in front of a camera 1 
no real improvement 0 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
the writer gorman bechard undoubtedly did his homework because all references are industry and characterage appropriate 1 
i let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this bad idea we both hated it 0 
sending it back 0 
we wont be going back 0 
it was delicious 1 
bluetooth range is good a few days ago i left my phone in the trunk got a call and carried the conversation without a hitch 1 
would not recommend to others 0 
i use this product in a motor control center where there is a lot of high voltage humming from the equipment and it works great 1 
the food wasnt good 0 
this is simply the best bluetooth headset for sound quality 1 
the acting is fantastic the stories are seamlessly woven together and the dogs are splendid a must rent view or see 1 
in addition to having one of the most lovely songs ever written french cancan also boasts one of the cutest leading ladies ever to grace the screen 1 
this is a bad film with bad writing and good actorsan ugly cartoon crafted by paul haggis for people who cant handle anything but the bold strokes in storytellinga picture painted with crayons 0 
wont ever go here again 0 
i really loved the story line and the poler bear was kinda cutebut if anyone has a question about fort steele just ask away 1 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
ive missed numerous calls because of this reason 0 
at no point in the proceedings does it look remotely like america 0 
portable and it works 1 
i did not bother contacting the company for few dollar product but i learned the lesson that i should not have bought this form online anyway 0 
50 down the drain 0 
i really recommend this faceplates since it looks very nice elegant and cool 1 
i have two more years left in this contract and i hate this phone 0 
after a year the battery went completely dead on my headset 0 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
if you are razr owneryou must have this 1 
you cant beat the price on these 1 
it is a joy to use 1 
this movie is terrible 0 
does not work 0 
the keyboard is a nice compromise between a full qwerty and the basic cell phone number keypad 1 
great phone 1 
this short film certainly pulls no punches 0 
thats how id describe this painfully dreary timewaster of a film 0 
the characters are interesting even if a bit predictable 1 
elias koteasjack palance play good roles angelina is hot and gets nakedbilly drago appears in this and is cool as usual a cameo by sven ole thorsen helps make this a very enjoyable movie with good acting and a decent budget 1 
nice docking station for home or work 1 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
i got the car charger and not even after a week the charger was brokeni went to plug it in and it started smoking 0 
the worst piece of crap ever along with the verizon customer service 0 
aside from its terrible lead this film has loads of other debits 0 
it is a really good show to watch 1 
del taco is pretty nasty and should be avoided if possible 0 
clear crisp sound 1 
the pleather case doesnt fit 0 
the worst sappiest dialogue i could go on and on 0 
what i really like there is the crepe station 1 
definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly will return next time im in vegas 1 
i was left shattered from the experience of watching this film and i took a good two hours to fully recover 0 
magical help 1 
this place is handsdown one of the best places to eat in the phoenix metro area 1 
i would not recommend this place 0 
piece of junk 0 
to summarize the food was incredible nay transcendant but nothing brings me joy quite like the memory of the pneumatic condiment dispenser 1 
food is way overpriced and portions are fucking small 0 
food was so gooodd 1 
wed definitely go back here again 1 
nice docking station for home or work 1 
the headset fulfills my requirements so i am happy with my purchase 1 
it is unusable in a moving car at freeway speed 0 
ive also had problems with the phone reading the memory card in which i always turn it on and then off again 0 
friends pasta also bad he barely touched it 0 
we recently witnessed her poor quality of management towards other guests as well 0 
i could care less the interior is just beautiful 1 
im trying to return it for a refund 0 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
i love this thing 1 
the attempts at humor were pitiful and story is so awful it dosent bear thinking about which basically involves a vulcan stealing the enterprise to find god seriously i just didnt care about any of this film and oh not to mention uhura does a belly dance to distract male guards 0 
i am so tired of clichés that is just lazy writing and here they come in thick and fast 0 
the nano stated itmy son was dissapointed 0 
this phone might well be the worst ive ever had in any brand 0 
this film tries to be a serious and sophisticated thrillerhorror flick and it fails miserably 0 
horrible phone 0 
everything about this product is wrongfirst 0 
so they performed 1 
i gave it 5 stars because of the sound quality 1 
by this time our side of the restaurant was almost empty so there was no excuse 0 
bad purchase 0 
these were so good we ordered them twice 1 
the greek dressing was very creamy and flavorful 1 
omit watching this 0 
enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film 1 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
the cinematography is simply stunning to say the least and the fx are nothing if not stateoftheart 1 
none of them are engaging or exciting 0 
aside from its terrible lead this film has loads of other debits 0 
the service was extremely slow 0 
dont buy it 0 
reasonably priced also 1 
both actors truly understand and become their particular character delivering a convincing sincere performance 1 
just what i wanted 1 
unfortunately it did not work 0 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
as many people complained i found this headsets microphone was very weak 0 
i have had this phone for over a year now and i will tell you its not that great 0 
waste your money on this game 1 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
i will never go back to this place and will never ever recommended this place to anyone 0 
i am so pleased to know such a modern day genius is out there letting is passion for art drive him and taking us as an audience with him 1 
despite the pans of reviewers i liked this movie 1 
the movie in movie situations in the beginning and through the game that is played with her by the acting coach are fascinating 1 
it will drive you barking mad 0 
for that its worth checking out 1 
the waitresses are very friendly 1 
they keep getting better and better this is my third one and ive had numerous palms too 1 
disappointed 0 
the food is rich so order accordingly 1 
your brain will attempt to shutdown as part of a primal impulse of selfpreservation 0 
i wouldnt see this movie again for free 0 
in conclusion i will not bother with this movie because a volcano in los angeles is nothing but nonsense 0 
i took back my money and got outta there 0 
highly unprofessional and rude to a loyal patron 0 
bad script bad direction and horrible acting make this one plain bad 0 
small sleek impressive looking practical setup with ample storage in place 1 
worst thai ever 0 
worth every penny 1 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
its not what it says it is 0 
is pretty funny 1 
this greedy corporation will never see another dime from me 0 
trouble is the writing and directing make it impossible to establish those things that make a movie watchable like character story theme and so on 0 
only had this a month but its worked flawlessly so far 1 
the service here is fair at best 0 
this film offers many delights and surprises 1 
warning stay away 0 
phone falls out easily 0 
its this pandering to the audience that sabotages most of his films 0 
it was quite comfortable in the ear 1 
the cinematography is simply stunning to say the least and the fx are nothing if not stateoftheart 1 
the chips and sals a here is amazing 1 
it defeats the purpose of a bluetooth headset 0 
poorly contstruct hinge 0 
what possesed me to get this junk i have no idea 0 
the food came out at a good pace 1 
camera color balance is awful 0 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
also the story and acting were weak 0 
disappointed with battery 0 
its an empty hollow shell of a movie 0 
the acting as youd expect from this cast is top notch 1 
the wind and the lion is well written and superbly acted 1 
i wasnt expecting oscar material but this 0 
bad quality 0 
tried to go here for lunch and it was a madhouse 0 
i highly recommend this case 1 
the plot is nonsense that doesnt interest in the slightest way or have any uniqueness to it 0 
ive had this bluetoooth headset for some time now and still not comfortable with the way it fits on the ear 0 
what makes this story different are the terrific production values faultless photography composition and editing the terrific casting the underappreciated brian keith playing a bully teddy and vivid history 1 
good servicecheck 1 
also its slim enough to fit into my alarm clock docking station without removing the case 1 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
this is a good joint 1 
definitely a bargain 1 
this is an unbelievable bargain 1 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
much better than the other ayce sushi place i went to in vegas 1 
the problem was the script 0 
not worth it 0 
the worst phone ive ever had only had it for a few months 0 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
for a product that costs as much as this one does i expect it to work far better and with greater ease than this thing does 0 
i definitly recommend 1 
having trouble with volume 0 
the ear buds only play music in one ear 0 
it showed exactly how the government and the scientist argued for humanity and the reasons of the gadget 1 
very poor service 0 
watching washing machine twirling around wouldnt hurt your eyes as much as this show 0 
but i dont like it 0 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
the casting is also horrible cause all you see is a really really bad actors period 0 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
poorly contstruct hinge 0 
go rent it 1 
our server was very nice and even though he looked a little overwhelmed with all of our needs he stayed professional and friendly until the end 1 
this phone might well be the worst ive ever had in any brand 0 
when my mom and i got home she immediately got sick and she only had a few bites of salad 0 
doesnt last long 0 
schrader has made a resume full of lousy amateurish films 0 
this pda rocks 1 
we had so much to say about the place before we walked in that he expected it to be amazing but was quickly disappointed 0 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
similarly the delivery man did not say a word of apology when our food was 45 minutes late 0 
i have had tmobile service for 2 or 3 years now and i am pretty happy with it 1 
was not happy 0 
service is also cute 1 
the chefs were friendly and did a good job 1 
battery is terrible 0 
the chefs were friendly and did a good job 1 
i searched the internet and found this one to be the best value 1 
to call this movie a drama is ridiculous 0 
terrible service 0 
the scallop dish is quite appalling for value as well 0 
this gets a 1 out of 10 simply because theres nothing lower 0 
great brunch spot 1 
the plastic breaks really easy on this clip 0 
clever and a real crowdpleaserthis film still ranks among mickeys best films even after 80 wonderful years 1 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
i seriously cannot believe that the owner has so many unexperienced employees that all are running around like chickens with their heads cut off 0 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
omg the food was delicioso 1 
highly recommended for all ages although the younger set will probably not appreciate some of the more subtle references they will certainly appreciate one galley scene in particular 1 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
avoid this establishment 0 
this wonderful experience made this place a muststop whenever we are in town again 1 
what possesed me to get this junk i have no idea 0 
customer service was terrible 0 
the sound quality for the device is unacceptableunless you are in a really quiet area you almost hear nothing 0 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
on the up side their cafe serves really good food 1 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
i got the car charger and not even after a week the charger was brokeni went to plug it in and it started smoking 0 
nice docking station for home or work 1 
the performances are not improved by improvisation because the actors now have twice as much to worry about not only whether theyre delivering the line well but whether the line itself is any good 0 
i literally vomited while watching this film 0 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
very good quality though 1 
the real disappointment was our waiter 0 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
service stinks here 0 
doesnt work at all i bougth it for my l7c and its not working 0 
the story line is just awful 0 
im not sure how long we stood there but it was long enough for me to begin to feel awkwardly out of place 0 
i dont each much pasta but i love the homemade hand made pastas and thin pizzas here 1 
comfort for our whole family 1 
exactly what i wanted 1 
i love my 350 headset my jabra350 bluetooth headset is great the reception is very good and the ear piece is a comfortable fit 1 
i use this product in a motor control center where there is a lot of high voltage humming from the equipment and it works great 1 
this was like the final blow 0 
the plot has more holes than a pair of fishnet stockings and the direction and editing is astonishingly ham fisted 0 
i love that they put their food in nice plastic containers as opposed to cramming it in little paper takeout boxes 1 
this is a great restaurant at the mandalay bay 1 
but when i check voice mail at night the keypad backlight turns off a few seconds into the first message and then im lost 0 
all this movie does is make you sick watching all these slackers make excuses for their stupid actions for 90 minutes 0 
small sleek impressive looking practical setup with ample storage in place 1 
terrible management 0 
20th century foxs road house 1948 is not only quite a silly noir but is an implausible unmitigated bore of a movie 0 
for people who are first timers in film making i think they did an excellent job 1 
the turkey and roast beef were bland 0 
after one bite i was hooked 1 
great software for motorolas 1 
this phone might well be the worst ive ever had in any brand 0 
the food wasnt good 0 
good product incredible value 1 
i could care less the interior is just beautiful 1 
my gyro was basically lettuce only 0 
i found this place by accident and i could not be happier 1 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
punishment park is a brilliant piece of cinema 1 
it was not good 0 
generally it just lacked imagination 0 
best breakfast buffet 1 
great place fo take out or eat in 1 
fantastic earphones 1 
join the club and get awesome offers via email 1 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
at no point in the proceedings does it look remotely like america 0 
this pda rocks 1 
but the convoluted plot just didnt convince me and much of the film was watched with a weird questioning glance 0 
the worst phone ive ever had only had it for a few months 0 
terrible management 0 
i bought this to use with my kindle fire and absolutely loved it 1 
would not recommend to others 0 
all in all its an insult to ones intelligence and a huge waste of money 0 
everything about this film is simply incredible 1 
cinematography the film was shot in an interesting way 1 
cinematography noteworthy including fine views of barcelona and its famed gaudi towers 1 
do not make the same mistake as me 0 
thats how id describe this painfully dreary timewaster of a film 0 
five star plus plus 1 
the sound quality is good and functionality is awesome 1 
if you see it you should probably just leave it on the shelf 0 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
easy to pair with my samsung cell 1 
when a song could explain the emotions of the subjects better such as when jay adams unfortunate life was a subject of talk the song old man by neil young was played which evokes many emotions 1 
im big fan of rpg games too but this movie its a disgrace to any selfrespecting rpger there is 0 
its not hard to make a decent hamburger 0 
needless to say we will never be back here again 0 
maybe its just their vegetarian fare but ive been twice and i thought it was average at best 0 
the cast was great 1 
enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film 1 
worst service to boot but that is the least of their worries 0 
yes this film does require a rather significant amount of puzzlesolving but the pieces fit together to create a beautiful picture 1 
if there was ever an indication of a writer and a directors ability to meld two highly volatile temperaments into a seamless union of creativity then this is it 1 
their onscreen chemistry critical to the entire film is genuine 1 
the chicken i got was definitely reheated and was only ok the wedges were cold and soggy 0 
you can watch them preparing the delicious food 1 
if she had not rolled the eyes we may have stayed not sure if we will go back and try it again 0 
all this movie does is make you sick watching all these slackers make excuses for their stupid actions for 90 minutes 0 
any ring toneoverall good phone to buy 1 
i felt insulted and disrespected how could you talk and judge another human being like that 0 
this movie is greatespecially if you enjoy visual arts 1 
all i can do is whine on the internet so here it goesthe more i use the thing the less i like it 0 
this is a good joint 1 
im super pissd 0 
will never ever go back 0 
i totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is 1 
i have had this phone for over a year now and i will tell you its not that great 0 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
not a good bargain 0 
the portion was huge 1 
everything was fresh and delicious 1 
if that bug never showed up i would have given a 4 for sure but on the other side of the wall where this bug was climbing was the kitchen 0 
the point is the journey a journey that touches every member of the family 1 
the movie is littered with overt racial slurs towards the black cast members and in return the whites are depicted as morons and boobs 0 
the hockey scenes are terrible defensemen playing like theyre 5 years old goalies diving at shots that are 10 feet wide of the net etc 0 
it was so funny 1 
its not what it says it is 0 
frankly after cotton club and unfaithful it was kind of embarrassing to watch lane and gere in this film because it is bad 0 
just what i wanted 1 
editing the editing of this film was phenomenal in my opinion 1 
pricing is a bit of a concern at mellow mushroom 0 
i hate those things as much as cheap quality black olives 0 
it was equally awful 0 
it is zillion times away from reality 0 
i believe the screenwriter did a good job of tying up the loose ends 1 
the best phone in market 1 
in the span of an hour i had two people exclaim whoa is that the new phone on tv 1 
battery lasts only a few hours 0 
very much disappointed with this company 0 
this if the first movie ive given a 10 to in years 1 
the sets especially designed to work with the camera are amazingstylized beautiful and effective 1 
frozen pucks of disgust with some of the worst people behind the register 0 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
absolutel junk 0 
my breakfast was perpared great with a beautiful presentation of 3 giant slices of toast lightly dusted with powdered sugar 1 
her lines seem to have been written by a fifteen year old though they are trying oh so so hard to sound like how a fifteen year old would really um you know well talk 0 
i dont know exactly what it is about this movie but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our familys memories 1 
victor mclaglen was even bad and brian donlevy was almost unrecognizable 0 
its a great item 1 
youll love it 1 
i left the theater with a lilt in my step joy in my heart and hope for the human race 1 
this totally unfunny movie is so over the top and pathetic and unrealistic that throughout the whole 90 minutes of utter torture i probably looked at my watch about 70000 times 0 
i love the ringtones because they are so upbeat 1 
the loudspeaker option is great the bumpers with the lights is very appealing 0 
we made the drive all the way from north scottsdale and i was not one bit disappointed 1 
the vanilla ice cream was creamy and smooth while the profiterole choux pastry was fresh enough 1 
be sure to order dessert even if you need to pack it togo the tiramisu and cannoli are both to die for 1 
this film highlights the fundamental flaws of the legal process that its not about discovering guilt or innocence but rather is about who presents better in court 1 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
ive owned this phone for 7 months now and can say that its the best mobile phone ive had 1 
works good 1 
works great 1 
i understand that its supposed to be a cheap popcorn comedy but that doesnt mean that it has to completely insult our intelligence and have writing so incredibly hackneyed that it borders on offensive 0 
this item worked great but it broke after 6 months of use 0 
the film deserves strong kudos for taking this stand for having exceptional acting from its mostly lesserknown cast and for the superintelligent script that doesnt insult the audience or take the easy way out when it comes to white racism 1 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
seller shipped quickly and much cheaper than the competitors 1 
this phone works great 1 
worked very well paired with a treo 700w and as a skype headset on my pc using a usb bluetooth transceiver 1 
however after about a year the fliptop started to get loose and wobbly and eventually my screen went black and i couldnt receive and place calls 0 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
good prices 1 
ive bought 5 wired headphones that sound better than these 0 
i left the theater with a lilt in my step joy in my heart and hope for the human race 1 
and finally after all that we get to an ending that wouldve been great had it been handled by competent people and not jerry falwell 0 
the movie seemed a little slow at first 0 
its just lame 0 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
if you are looking for a good quality motorola headset keep looking this isnt it 0 
i hate writing bad reviews about films especially those in which i really like the star but this film is so bad i dont believe for one second that anyone could have been proud of it 0 
i am also very happy with the price 1 
they do not care about the consumer one bit 0 
i am very impressed with this headset from plantronics 1 
i wear it everyday and it holds up very well 1 
itll be a regular stop on my trips to phoenix 1 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
saggy floppy piece of junk 0 
seller shipped quickly and much cheaper than the competitors 1 
bluetooth does not work phone locks up screens just flash up and now it just makes calls randomly while in my pocket locked 0 
its extremely slow and takes forever to do anything with it 0 
all the other cases ive tried normally fall apart after a few months but this one seems to be in for the long haul 1 
do not buy if you want to use the holster 0 
its a gloriously fun fast paced and fairly accurate portrayal of the night of a raver 1 
if it were possible to give them zero stars theyd have it 0 
that was nice 1 
i loved it 1 
if you look for authentic thai food go else where 0 
i probably wont be coming back here 0 
wed definitely go back here again 1 
but when i check voice mail at night the keypad backlight turns off a few seconds into the first message and then im lost 0 
the cinematographyif it can be called thatsucked 0 
total letdown i would much rather just go to the camelback flower shop and cartel coffee 0 
it also had a new problem 0 
poor quality 0 
well just if you keep thinking how bad it is 0 
my wife had the lobster bisque soup which was lukewarm 0 
he was extremely rude and really there are so many other restaurants i would love to dine at during a weekend in vegas 0 
the burger had absolutely no flavor the meat itself was totally bland the burger was overcooked and there was no charcoal flavor 0 
it is indescribably the most annoying and idiotic show i have ever seen 0 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
their regular toasted bread was equally satisfying with the occasional pats of butter mmmm 1 
another thing i didnt really like is when a character got punched in the face a gallon of blood would spew forth soon after 0 
perabo has a nice energy level and is obviously very comfortable in front of a camera 1 
we loved the biscuits 1 
i give it 2 thumbs down 0 
there is no plot here to keep you going in the first place 0 
i wasnt expecting oscar material but this 0 
the worst was the salmon sashimi 0 
the earpiece on this is too large or too heavyit keeps falling out of my ear 0 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
love it great armband 1 
this hole in the wall has great mexican street tacos and friendly staff 1 
freezes frequently4 0 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
what the hell kind of crap is that 0 
the best place in vegas for breakfast just check out a sat or sun 1 
it is shameful 0 
the han nan chicken was also very tasty 1 
good price 1 
nice leather 1 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
del taco is pretty nasty and should be avoided if possible 0 
comes with a strong light that you can use to light up your camera shots and even flash sos signals seriously 1 
worked very well paired with a treo 700w and as a skype headset on my pc using a usb bluetooth transceiver 1 
one of the most disappointing aspects is the lack of notable gore 0 
for that its worth checking out 1 
it is light easy to use and has very clear reception and transmission 1 
the story is also both funny and poignant at times 1 
the lead man is charismafree 0 
only had this a month but its worked flawlessly so far 1 
my phone doesnt slide around my car now and the grip prevents my phone from slipping out of my hand 1 
yet plantronincs continues to use the same flawed charger design 0 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
instead we got a bore fest about a whiny spoiled brat babysitting 0 
it was forced like everything in this movie 0 
they never brought a salad we asked for 0 
this was reflected not only in the cast but also in the belowpar script which borrowed much from the earlier classic 0 
product is useless since it does not have enough charging current to charge the 2 cellphones i was planning to use it with 0 
none of them are engaging or exciting 0 
so i bought about 10 of these and saved alot of money 1 
and if that isnt enough of a mess of a movie for you the picture is also marred with a constant use of studio sets and indoor exteriors 0 
the greek dressing was very creamy and flavorful 1 
the battery works great 1 
that one didnt work either 0 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
i had a seriously solid breakfast here 1 
this is a great deal 1 
i would not recommend this place 0 
the staff are also very friendly and efficient 1 
this is an unbelievable bargain 1 
its just lame 0 
this movie is terrible 0 
leopard print is wonderfully wild 1 
but the duet between the astronaut and his doctor at the beginning of the movie is a perfect exchange if one considers that this movie was made well into the cold war and the astronauts biggest fear is that he has crashed in the ussr 1 
this is infuriating 0 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
im super pissd 0 
recommend with confidence 1 
beware this is not a trashy cult movie this is trash period 0 
i ended up sliding it on the edge of my pants or back pockets instead 1 
battery is holding up well 1 
service sucks 0 
it didnt make me scared horrified or make me sympathetic towards the characters it was simply annoying 0 
we got the food and apparently they have never heard of salt and the batter on the fish was chewy 0 
waaaaaayyyyyyyyyy over rated is all i am saying 0 
all in all im quite satisfied with this purchase 1 
the seasonal fruit was fresh white peach puree 1 
when my mom and i got home she immediately got sick and she only had a few bites of salad 0 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
when achille and philippa beautifully sing a duet from don giovanni that perfectly describes their situation in the movie you appreciate the subtle layers of this excellent film 1 
we loved the biscuits 1 
what a mistake 0 
well just if you keep thinking how bad it is 0 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
also the area where my unit broke im not too fond of the magnetic strap 0 
very clear quality sound and you dont have to mess with the sound on your ipod since you have the sound buttons on the headset 1 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
this is a great little item 1 
i put the latest os on it v115g and it now likes to slow to a crawl and lock up every once in a while 0 
the steaks are all well trimmed and also perfectly cooked 1 
just reading on the specs alone makes you say wow 1 
overall the film is interesting and thoughtprovoking 1 
really bad 0 
very happy with this product 1 
none of them are engaging or exciting 0 
it was not good 0 
it fits so securely that the ear hook does not even need to be used and the sound is better directed through your ear canal 1 
easily none other cartoon made me laugh in a tender way before getting into dark sitcoms oriented for teenagers 1 
lot of holes in the plot theres nothing about how he became the emperor nothing about where he spend 20 years between his childhood and mature age 0 
your servers suck wait correction our server heimer sucked 0 
the bartender was also nice 1 
better than expected 1 
its a mediocre miserable hollow laughable and predictable piece of garbage 0 
the lighting is just dark enough to set the mood 1 
im really disappointed all i have now is a charger that doesnt work 0 
it was equally awful 0 
your staff spends more time talking to themselves than me 0 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
i love this device 1 
the cinematographyif it can be called thatsucked 0 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
my first visit to hiro was a delight 1 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
think it over when you plan to own this onethis sure is the last moto phone for me 0 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
the food sucked which we expected but it sucked more than we could have imagined 0 
i didnt realize how wonderful the short really is until the last two scenes 1 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
all the bread is made inhouse 1 
the only thing i wasnt too crazy about was their guacamole as i dont like it puréed 0 
simply beautiful 1 
it was a drive to get there 0 
its the one movie that never ceases to interest me simply because it keeps me alert as i try to attempt to decipher its meanings 1 
stay away from the q 0 
but now that it is out of warranty the same problems reoccurebottom line put your money somewhere else cingular will not support it 0 
everything about this movie is stupid 0 
i purcashed this for the car charger and it does not work 0 
well packaged arrived on time and works as intended 1 
we wont be returning 0 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
amazon sucks 0 
great phone 1 
total letdown i would much rather just go to the camelback flower shop and cartel coffee 0 
im translating movies for a living and this is the first movie in my 5year working experience that i found offensive to my intelligence 0 
i am pairing this with my iphone and i could not be happier with it so far 1 
the aerial scenes were welldone 1 
hot dishes are not hot cold dishes are close to room tempi watched staff prepare food with bare hands no gloveseverything is deep fried in oil 0 
but this movie really got to me 1 
service stinks here 0 
the plastic breaks really easy on this clip 0 
ill be looking for a new earpiece 0 
the vegetables are so fresh and the sauce feels like authentic thai 1 
i have never had such bland food which surprised me considering the article we read focused so much on their spices and flavor 0 
they could be used as exemplars for any set designer 1 
the warm beer didnt help 0 
we would recommend these to others 1 
nothing new there 0 
i have always used corded headsets and the freedom from the wireless is very helpful 1 
highly unprofessional and rude to a loyal patron 0 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
i think not again 0 
a great touch 1 
the block was amazing 1 
item arrived quickly and works great with my metro pcs samsung schr450 slider phone and sony premium sound in ear plugs 1 
trumbull on i love lucy 1 
in fact its hard to remember that the part of ray charles is being acted and not played by the man himself 1 
he was terrible 0 
the acting is fantastic the stories are seamlessly woven together and the dogs are splendid a must rent view or see 1 
its a feelgood film and thats how i felt when i came out of the cinema 1 
new battery works great in phone 1 
i liked it 1 
dont buy it 0 
their regular toasted bread was equally satisfying with the occasional pats of butter mmmm 1 
there arent death scenes like in previous movies and the fx are terrible 0 
but kevin spacey is an excellent verbal tsunami as buddy ackerman  and totally believable because he is a great actor 1 
see it with your kids if you have a chanceit will open up some amazing dialog about how far race relations have come in the last 50 years 1 
the movie had you on the edge of your seat and made you somewhat afraid to go to your car at the end of the night 1 
the plastic breaks really easy on this clip 0 
now you know why i gave it a 10 1 
bad quality 0 
extremely tasty 1 
oh this is such a thing of beauty this restaurant 1 
i have two more years left in this contract and i hate this phone 0 
main thing i didnt enjoy is that the crowd is of older crowd around mid 30s and up 0 
as many people complained i found this headsets microphone was very weak 0 
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 
i saw this film over christmas and what a great film it was 1 
clever and a real crowdpleaserthis film still ranks among mickeys best films even after 80 wonderful years 1 
someone shouldve invented this sooner 1 
i will not return 0 
my side greek salad with the greek dressing was so tasty and the pita and hummus was very refreshing 1 
poor product 0 
the use of slowmotion needlessly repeats itself throughout the movie but is well backed up by bad acting and bad is a kind word here no continuity scenes that are thrown in for no reason whatsoever vehicles that looked like they were made from a corn flakes box and a directorial style that bordered on stupidity 0 
i even dropped this phone into a stream and it was submerged for 15 seconds and it still works great 1 
great phone 1 
this was my first and only vegas buffet and it did not disappoint 1 
but it is great i would really recommend it 1 
none of the three sizes they sent with the headset would stay in my ears 0 
wont ever go here again 0 
give this one a look 1 
battery lasts only a few hours 0 
this place deserves one star and 90 has to do with the food 0 
the movie was very interesting from beginning to the end 1 
1010 1 
i started this review with two stars but im editing it to give it only one 0 
the script is bad very bad  it contains both cheesiness and unethical joke that you normally see in rated r or nc17 movie 0 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
sam shepards portrayal of a gung ho marine was sobering 1 
this was like the final blow 0 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
oh and i forgot to also mention the weird color effect it has on your phone 0 
the cast is always entertaining as usual 1 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
pricing is a bit of a concern at mellow mushroom 0 
i really like this product over the motorola because it is allot clearer on the ear piece and the mic 1 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
item arrived quickly and works great with my metro pcs samsung schr450 slider phone and sony premium sound in ear plugs 1 
not as good as i had hoped 0 
and it was way to expensive 0 
all the bread is made inhouse 1 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
the fries were great too 1 
total waste of time 0 
so good i am going to have to review this place twice once hereas a tribute to the place and once as a tribute to an event held here last night 1 
to my disbelief each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods i have ever tasted 0 
food was really boring 0 
i bought this battery with a coupon from amazon and im very happy with my purchase 1 
i recommend this for everyone who loves film movies anythinga work of art 1 
the crêpe was delicate and thin and moist 1 
funny clever hip just like prays previous film hype 1 
this movie was kind of long in length but i enjoyed every minute of it 1 
do not buy do not buyit sucks 0 
so far it has worked like a charm 1 
it probably would have been better if the director hadnt spent most of the movie showcasing his own art work which really isnt that noteworthy 0 
howeverthe riingtones are not the best and neither are the games 0 
it quit working after id used it for about 18 months so i just purchased another one because this is the best headset ive ever owned 1 
thanks again to amazon for having the things i need for a good price 1 
also its a real treat to see anthony quinn playing crazy horse 1 
the chips that came out were dripping with grease and mostly not edible 0 
but it picked up speed and got right to the point 1 
buyerbe very careful 0 
i would recommend saving room for this 1 
i have never had such bland food which surprised me considering the article we read focused so much on their spices and flavor 0 
case was more or less an extra that i originally put on but later discarded because it scratched my ear 0 
excellent hands free tool 1 
it was a great phone 1 
what makes this story different are the terrific production values faultless photography composition and editing the terrific casting the underappreciated brian keith playing a bully teddy and vivid history 1 
worst ever 0 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
the last 15 minutes of movie are also not bad as well 1 
for that price i can think of a few place i would have much rather gone 0 
the lighting is awful 0 
mark my words this is one of those cult films like evil dead 2 or phantasm that people will still be discovering and falling in love with 20 30 40 years down the line 1 
awful service 0 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
the staff is friendly and the joint is always clean 1 
freezes frequently4 0 
if you have not seen this movie i definitely recommend it 1 
i would not recommend this place 0 
everyone is very attentive providing excellent customer service 1 
judith light is one of my favorite actresses and i think she does a superb job in this film 1 
everything was perfect the night we were in 1 
it doesnt work in europe or asia 0 
the food was great as always compliments to the chef 1 
there are so many problems i dont know where to start 0 
treo and tmobile refused to replace it again and forced me to buy another phone without any kind of upgrade discount 0 
macbeth jason connery moved me to tears with his final monolog out brief candle outhe gave the sphere of moral decay and dark forces a human face which makes it the more interesting 1 
id like to return it 0 
but when i check voice mail at night the keypad backlight turns off a few seconds into the first message and then im lost 0 
his performance is simply genius 1 
worst customer service 0 
funny clever hip just like prays previous film hype 1 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
very good stuff for the price 1 
i had absolutely no problem with this headset linking to my 8530 blackberry curve 1 
overall i am psyched to have a phone which has all my appointments and contacts in and gets great reception 1 
but it is great i would really recommend it 1 
the holster that arrived did not match the photo in the ad 0 
a cheap and cheerless heist movie with poor characterisation lots of underbite style stoic emoting think chow yun fat in a better tomorrow and some cheesy clichés thrown into an abandoned factory ready for a few poorly executed flying judo rolls a la john woo 0 
in fact im going to round up to 4 stars just because she was so awesome 1 
feelings thoughtsgabriels discomfort during the danceall these intangibles leap to life and come within the viewers grasp in hustons portrayal 1 
another thing i didnt really like is when a character got punched in the face a gallon of blood would spew forth soon after 0 
plug was the wrong size 0 
if only someone involved with it knew how to string together narrative 0 
the phone is sturdy and waterproof 1 
horrible horrible protector 0 
worst service to boot but that is the least of their worries 0 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
only like 3 or 4 buildings used a couple of locations maybe poor hummh 0 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
this is simply the best bluetooth headset for sound quality 1 
i had to go to a store and bought a new nokia phone which is working great 1 
it presents a idyllic yet serious portrayal of the ups and downs of the characters lives 1 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1
