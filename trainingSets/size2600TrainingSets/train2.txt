thanks good a movie like this was done and released 1 
youll love how thin it is 1 
i can barely ever hear on it and am constantly saying what 0 
i went on motorolas website and followed all directions but could not get it to pair again 0 
doesnt do the job 0 
great it was new packaged nice works good no problems and it came in less time then i expected 1 
i work in the hospitality industry in paradise valley and have refrained from recommending cibo any longer 0 
other than that the leather is nice and soft the fit is very tight the cut out for the face is a good shape 1 
i went on motorolas website and followed all directions but could not get it to pair again 0 
but kevin spacey is an excellent verbal tsunami as buddy ackerman  and totally believable because he is a great actor 1 
dont waste your time here 0 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
the bartender was also nice 1 
i will not be eating there again 0 
i tried talking real loud but shouting on the telephone gets old and i was still told it wasnt great 0 
the acting by the whole cast could be put on a scale and balanced perfectly between overacting and underacting 0 
at no point in the proceedings does it look remotely like america 0 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
i still maintain that monkeys shouldnt make headphones we just obviously dont share enough dna to copy the design over to humans 0 
they could be used as exemplars for any set designer 1 
last night was my second time dining here and i was so happy i decided to go back 1 
this is one of the best italian thrillers of the early 70s 1 
i really hope the team behind this movie makes more movies and that they will continue to do so in their own some kinda weird style 1 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
easily none other cartoon made me laugh in a tender way before getting into dark sitcoms oriented for teenagers 1 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
the cast was great 1 
absolutel junk 0 
thats how id describe this painfully dreary timewaster of a film 0 
i especially liked the noncliche choices with the parents in other movies i could predict the dialog verbatim but the writing in this movie made better selections 1 
this is not moviemaking 0 
the goat taco didnt skimp on the meat and wow what flavor 1 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
chinese forgeries abound 0 
go and see it 1 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
best service and food ever maria our server was so good and friendly she made our day 1 
i could barely stomach the meal but didnt complain because it was a business lunch 0 
sound quality on both end is excellent i use headset to call my wife and ask my wife to use headset to call me 2 1 
if you have not seen this movie i definitely recommend it 1 
the buffet at bellagio was far from what i anticipated 0 
it deserves strong love 1 
plantronics bluetooth excelent buy 1 
i got the aluminum case for my new palm vx and it worked really wellit has protected my handheld perfectly so far 1 
this item is great installed it let it charged up overnite and it has been working good every since with no problems 1 
but this movie really got to me 1 
i sat riveted to the tv screen 1 
think of the film being like a dream 1 
see it 1 
the igo chargers and tips are really great 1 
any ring toneoverall good phone to buy 1 
headset works great was packaged nicely to avoid any damage 1 
worst martini ever 0 
these headphones were a great find and i think they are perhaps the best purchase ive made in the last several years seriously 1 
the noise shield is incrediable 1 
we loved the place 1 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
this review is long overdue since i consider a tale of two sisters to be the single greatest film ever made 1 
at first glance it is a lovely bakery cafe nice ambiance clean friendly staff 1 
the selection on the menu was great and so were the prices 1 
the burger i got the gold standard a 17 burger and was kind of disappointed 0 
this is an excellent tool especially when paired with your phones autoanswer 1 
nothing short of magnificent photographycinematography in this film 1 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
the decor is nice and the piano music soundtrack is pleasant 1 
i love this cable it allows me to connect any miniusb device to my pc 1 
this is a witty and delightful adaptation of the dr seuss book brilliantly animated by upas finest and thoroughly deserving of its academy award 1 
really good product 1 
works fine 1 
his performance as awarded was stunning 1 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
of course the footage from the 70s was grainy but that only enhanced the film 1 
i guess maybe we went on an off night but it was disgraceful 0 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
how stupid is that 0 
the plot doesnt hang together at all and the acting is absolutely appalling 0 
the update procedure is difficult and cumbersome 0 
this is my new fav vegas buffet spot 1 
same evening him and i are both drastically sick 0 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
i wish i could return the unit and get back my money 0 
very good phone 1 
battery is terrible 0 
it is the best charger i have seen on the market yet 1 
it seems completely secure both holding on to my belt and keeping the iphone inside 1 
the acting sucked 0 
i would recommend saving room for this 1 
good works fine 1 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
i would give this television series a 10 plus if i could 1 
big disappointment with calendar sync 0 
perfect for someone me who only likes beer ice cold or in this case even colder 1 
you cant go wrong with any of the food here 1 
the vanilla ice cream was creamy and smooth while the profiterole choux pastry was fresh enough 1 
ive owned this phone for 7 months now and can say that its the best mobile phone ive had 1 
this is my new fav vegas buffet spot 1 
cant get the software to work with my computer 0 
i loved it 1 
does not work 0 
at least think to refill my water before i struggle to wave you over for 10 minutes 0 
what a great double cheeseburger 1 
okay i like to consider myself a fair critic so ill give credit where credits duethe creature effects were actually pretty cool 1 
i kept looking at the time and it had soon become 35 minutes yet still no food 0 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
i dont have to be an accountant to know im getting screwed 0 
this is an extraordinary film 1 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
excellent 1 
awful service 0 
we sat another ten minutes and finally gave up and left 0 
the only good thing was that it fits comfortably on small ears 1 
the acting is terrible and the writing is worse 0 
and dont even get me started on the jerky camerawork 0 
this battery is an excellent bargain 1 
i love this place 1 
and the rest of it just sits there being awful with soldiers singing songs about the masculinity they pledge themselves to hairsplitting about purity the admiration of swords etc 0 
everything is appalling 0 
the block was amazing 1 
would come back again if i had a sushi craving while in vegas 1 
this item is fantastic and works perfectly 1 
20th century foxs road house 1948 is not only quite a silly noir but is an implausible unmitigated bore of a movie 0 
looks great and is strong 1 
gotta love those closeups of slimy drooling teeth 1 
lousy product 0 
it plays louder than any other speaker of this size the price is so low that most would think the quality is lacking however its not 1 
paolo sorrentino has written a wonderful story about loneliness and tony has built one of the most unforgettable characters seen in movies in recent years 1 
i swung in to give them a try but was deeply disappointed 0 
if there was ever an indication of a writer and a directors ability to meld two highly volatile temperaments into a seamless union of creativity then this is it 1 
there is nothing privileged about workingeating there 0 
an extensive menu provides lots of options for breakfast 1 
i had a seriously solid breakfast here 1 
arrived quickly and much less expensive than others being sold 1 
theres really nothing bad i can say about this headset 0 
so far so good 1 
i recommend this for everyone who loves film movies anythinga work of art 1 
in a word it is embarrassing 0 
service is quick and even to go orders are just like we like it 1 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
i love that they put their food in nice plastic containers as opposed to cramming it in little paper takeout boxes 1 
crash is a depressing little nothing that provokes emotion but teaches you nothing if you already know racism and prejudice are bad things 0 
will go back next trip out 1 
great sound and service 1 
i left the theater with a lilt in my step joy in my heart and hope for the human race 1 
easy to use 1 
headset works great was packaged nicely to avoid any damage 1 
another note about this phones appearance is that it really looks rather bland especially in the all black model 0 
it will drive you barking mad 0 
first of all it doesnt wear well 0 
yeah the movie pretty much sucked 0 
i dont have to be an accountant to know im getting screwed 0 
this is a witty and delightful adaptation of the dr seuss book brilliantly animated by upas finest and thoroughly deserving of its academy award 1 
im not sure how long we stood there but it was long enough for me to begin to feel awkwardly out of place 0 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
they have a really nice atmosphere 1 
for those that havent seen it dont waste your time 0 
the volume for the ringer is real good you have choices how loud 1 
its one of the movies i need to see whenever it comes on tvnever mind the fact that i already have it memorized 1 
ordered burger rare came in well done 0 
first time there and might just be the last 0 
there is no plot here to keep you going in the first place 0 
they have a really nice atmosphere 1 
lately they have been extremely nice and helpful on the phone 1 
dont make the same mistake that i did and please dont buy this phone 0 
worst customer service 0 
nice sound 1 
useless phone simply deaf 0 
its a campy sort of film thats a joy to watch 1 
i love this cable it allows me to connect any miniusb device to my pc 1 
however after finally watching this film i realized that not only had i had a closed mind to the brilliance it depicts i also found myself watching it over and over again 1 
it doesnt make you look cool 0 
fits comfortably came with three sizes of earbud tips 1 
again no plot at all 0 
they have been around for years and carries the highest quality of antiglare screen protector that i have found to date 1 
the only thing that i think could improve is the sound leaks out from the headset 0 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
the success of the film depends on the casting of sydney greenstreet as the alexander yardley character 1 
aailiyah was pretty good as akasha in places compelling her first entrance and mini dance scene 1 
great hands free device 1 
im pleased 1 
its a little geeky but i think thats its sex on toast and it rocks and oozes sex right down to its battery embedded sleek stylish leather case 1 
i can barely ever hear on it and am constantly saying what 0 
he was extremely rude and really there are so many other restaurants i would love to dine at during a weekend in vegas 0 
i swung in to give them a try but was deeply disappointed 0 
i wont be back 0 
i especially love the long battery life 1 
i received my headset in good time and was happy with it 1 
incredible 1 
disappointing accessory from a good manufacturer 0 
one nice thing was that they added gratuity on the bill since our party was larger than 6 or 8 and they didnt expect more tip than that 1 
these were so good we ordered them twice 1 
i vomited in the bathroom mid lunch 0 
very poor service 0 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
i literally vomited while watching this film 0 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
simple lightweight and great fit 1 
if you are looking for a good quality motorola headset keep looking this isnt it 0 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
i would recommend it 1 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
overall a delight 1 
as for the service i thought it was good 1 
plus it was wellpaced and suited its relatively short run time 1 
all i can do is whine on the internet so here it goesthe more i use the thing the less i like it 0 
excellent service 1 
the cable looks so thin and flimsy it is scary 0 
this movie is also revealing 1 
a truly truly bad film 0 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
this phone is very fast with sending any kind of messages and web browsing is significantly faster than previous phones i have used 1 
its so bad its actually worth seeing just for that reason 0 
the server was very negligent of our needs and made us feel very unwelcome i would not suggest this place 0 
a film not easily forgotten 1 
lastly the mozzarella sticks they were the best thing we ordered 1 
i must say i have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again 1 
it was a long time that i didnt see a so charismatic actor on screen 1 
everything was good and tasty 1 
i had heard good things about this place but it exceeding every hope i could have dreamed of 1 
not as good as i had hoped 0 
before i go in to why i gave a 1 star rating please know that this was my third time eating at bachi burger before writing a review 0 
the stories were as unbelievable as the actors 0 
my boyfriend and i sat at the bar and had a completely delightful experience 1 
battery life is real good 1 
on a positive note our server was very attentive and provided great service 1 
his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic 1 
i wasnt expecting oscar material but this 0 
good price 1 
i could care less the interior is just beautiful 1 
i live in the neighborhood so i am disappointed i wont be back here because it is a convenient location 0 
setup couldnt have been simpler 1 
never got it 0 
they have horrible attitudes towards customers and talk down to each one when customers dont enjoy their food 0 
this product had a strong rubberpetroleum smell that was unbearable after a while and caused me to return it 0 
that being said for a phone the camera is very nice many cool effects to play with and video is decent as well 1 
the performances are real and gripping the crocdodile is extremely well done indeed if the black water website is to be believed thats because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous 1 
i have been very happy with the 510 and have had no complaints from any one regarding my sound quality on their end 1 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
however after finally watching this film i realized that not only had i had a closed mind to the brilliance it depicts i also found myself watching it over and over again 1 
im a bit disappointed 0 
i felt asleep the first time i watched it so i can recommend it for insomniacs 0 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
excellent dualpurpose headset 1 
why are these sad little vegetables so overcooked 0 
the reception has been generally good 1 
the food is good 1 
buttons are too small 0 
not only did the software do a great job of this i could also make my own ringtones form my existing cds without an internet connection 1 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
i cant believe theres even a sequel to this 0 
sending it back 0 
only like 3 or 4 buildings used a couple of locations maybe poor hummh 0 
they do not last forever but is not overly expensive to replaceeasy to operate and the sound is much better than others i have tried 1 
this is the phone to get for 2005 i just bought my s710a and all i can say is wow 1 
talk about great customer service of course we will be back 1 
while you dont yet hear mickey speak there are tons of sound effects and music throughout the filmsomething we take for granted now but which was a huge crowd pleaser in 1928 1 
the camera really likes her in this movie 1 
i have to use the smallest earpieces provided but it stays on pretty well 1 
very pleased with this headset 1 
tasted like dirt 0 
excellent sound battery life and inconspicuous to boot 1 
shes poised and amazing 1 
the only good thing was our waiter he was very helpful and kept the bloddy marys coming 1 
and then tragedy struck 0 
good transmit audio 1 
it finds my cell phone right away when i enter the car 1 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
the staff is great the food is delish and they have an incredible beer selection 1 
i cant wait to go back 1 
there is simply no excuse for something this poorly done 0 
just spicy enough perfect actually 1 
kris kristoffersen is good in this movie and really makes a difference 1 
the best place in vegas for breakfast just check out a sat or sun 1 
i was bored throughout the whole damn thing 0 
i could care less the interior is just beautiful 1 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
the food was delicious our bartender was attentive and personable and we got a great deal 1 
kind of flops around 0 
about 30 minutes of footage is wasted to show mediocre elderly actors awkwardly babbling overwrought pseudosatanic gibberish corny enough to make a teen goth blush almost always in olde english and sometimes in latin that may or may not be made up words 0 
this game rocks 1 
my brother in law who works at the mall ate here same day and guess what he was sick all night too 0 
i saw it as a child on tv back in 1973 when it was the stranger and i loved it 1 
avoid this film at all costs 0 
worth every penny 1 
poorly contstruct hinge 0 
never been to hard rock casino before will never ever step forward in it again 0 
excellent performance 1 
i find this inexcusable and so will probably be returning this phone and perhaps changing carriers 0 
this is probably the most irritating show i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
i give wirefly 1 stari will contact cingularatt and inform them of this practice 0 
very good product well made 1 
the burrittos blah 0 
about ten minutes into this film i started having second thoughts 0 
the fish is badly made and some of its underwater shots are repeated a thousand times in the film 0 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
i cant believe theres even a sequel to this 0 
the last 15 minutes of movie are also not bad as well 1 
this movie contained an allstar cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i havent seen before 1 
they have horrible attitudes towards customers and talk down to each one when customers dont enjoy their food 0 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
its a piece of crap 0 
by the time the film ended i not only disliked it i despised it 0 
this greedy corporation will never see another dime from me 0 
perhaps i caught them on an off night judging by the other reviews but im not inspired to go back 0 
att is not clear sound is very distorted and you have to yell when you talk 0 
i cant believe theres even a sequel to this 0 
about half way through this film i started to dislike it 0 
the best place in vegas for breakfast just check out a sat or sun 1 
the cinematographyif it can be called thatsucked 0 
highly entertaining at all angles 1 
we sat another ten minutes and finally gave up and left 0 
we have gotten a lot of compliments on it 1 
and the sound quality is great 1 
i could barely stomach the meal but didnt complain because it was a business lunch 0 
this is a stunning movie 1 
good item low price 1 
good value works fine power via usb car or wall outlet 1 
the best electronics of the available fm transmitters 1 
i enjoyed reading this book to my children when they were little 1 
dessert panna cotta was amazing 1 
we definately enjoyed ourselves 1 
up there with the best of melville 1 
great for the jawbone 1 
needless to say i wont be going back anytime soon 0 
if you check the directors filmography on this site you will see why this film didnt have a chance 0 
this is a great phone 1 
i was deeply impressed with the character he played 1 
ive never been more insulted or felt disrespected 0 
the food came out at a good pace 1 
the only good thing was our waiter he was very helpful and kept the bloddy marys coming 1 
this was like the final blow 0 
does not work 0 
an absolute must visit 1 
my gyro was basically lettuce only 0 
nonlinear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well 1 
i let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this bad idea we both hated it 0 
both films are terrible but to the credit of the 1986 version it was watchable 0 
food was great and so was the serivce 1 
give this one a look 1 
the movie was very interesting from beginning to the end 1 
delicious and i will absolutely be back 1 
despite the pans of reviewers i liked this movie 1 
the mic there is a joke and the volume is quite low 0 
its a piece of crap 0 
clear crisp sound 1 
he owns the film just as spacek owned coal miners daughter and quaid owned great balls of fire 1 
also makes it easier to hold on to 1 
bad reception 0 
the servers went back and forth several times not even so much as an are you being helped 0 
so they performed 1 
i particularly remember my senses being assaulted by strident cords of music that would blare out with very little warning and even less meaning 0 
not good enough for the price 0 
poor quality and service 0 
however this didnt make up for the fact that overall this was a tremendously boring movie 0 
excellent bluetooth headset 1 
he cant act one of the least scary villains i have ever seen he cant write did he write this damn movie in his sleep 0 
you also cannot take pictures with it in the case because the lense is covered 0 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
some may say this buffet is pricey but i think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot 1 
perfect for someone me who only likes beer ice cold or in this case even colder 1 
third the cheese on my friends burger was cold 0 
everything was good and tasty 1 
cool phone 1 
logitech bluetooth headset is a 10 1 
the calls drop the phone comes on and off at will the screen goes black and the worst of all it stops ringing intermittently 0 
seafood was limited to boiled shrimp and crab legs but the crab legs definitely did not taste fresh 0 
the bottowm lineanother worthless cheap gimmick from sprint 0 
their frozen margaritas are way too sugary for my taste 0 
best tater tots in the southwest 1 
it is indescribably the most annoying and idiotic show i have ever seen 0 
the sides are delish mixed mushrooms yukon gold puree white corn beateous 1 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
cant get the software to work with my computer 0 
we are so glad we found this place 1 
there were too many close ups 0 
i would recommend purchasing the jabra jx10 series 2 which works flawlessly with my moto q go figure 1 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
it was a huge awkward 15lb piece of cow that was 34ths gristle and fat 0 
some applause should be given to the prelude however 1 
there were too many close ups 0 
comfort for our whole family 1 
best tater tots in the southwest 1 
it really is impressive that the place hasnt closed down 0 
i am not a filmmaker nor am i a director but i would hide my head in the sand if id spent whatever amount of money and time on this movie 0 
which is precisely why i am giving it such a bad review 0 
the best scene in the movie was when gerardo is trying to find a song that keeps running through his head 1 
the portion was huge 1 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
secondly hitchcock pretty much perfected the thriller and chase movie 1 
great hands free device 1 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
putting the race card aside lets look at the major flaw in the film they destroy latifas character 0 
it is an hour and half waste of time following a bunch of very pretty high schoolers whine and cry about life 0 
im so happy to be here 1 
would come back again if i had a sushi craving while in vegas 1 
jabra ear gels r the best 1 
so just beware 0 
after watching this film i wanted to learn more about the works of this artist 1 
which are small and not worth the price 0 
keep up the good work amazon 1 
too politically correct 0 
plantronics bluetooth excelent buy 1 
this second appearance of mickey mouse following the silent plane crazy earlier that year is probably his most famous filmmostly because it was so groundbreaking 1 
but its just not funny 0 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
unfortunately it did not work 0 
everything captain howdy says is either laughable or just plain stupid 0 
at any rate this film stinks its not funny and fulci should have stayed with giallo and supernatural zombie movies 0 
great price also 1 
its extremely slow and takes forever to do anything with it 0 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
plus it was wellpaced and suited its relatively short run time 1 
this movie is bad 0 
thank you for wasting my money 0 
it is a joy to use 1 
do not make the same mistake as me 0 
the first thing that happened was that the tracking was off 0 
item does not match picture 0 
the chips that came out were dripping with grease and mostly not edible 0 
last time buying from you 0 
the waiter wasnt helpful or friendly and rarely checked on us 0 
the visual effects were awful 0 
my breakfast was perpared great with a beautiful presentation of 3 giant slices of toast lightly dusted with powdered sugar 1 
its a great tool for entertainment communication and data managementoh be sure to use activesync 42 for optimal data synchronization results 1 
the performances are not improved by improvisation because the actors now have twice as much to worry about not only whether theyre delivering the line well but whether the line itself is any good 0 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
this is high adventure at its best 1 
this was one of the worst films i have ever seen 0 
i had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get some relief 0 
both rickman and stowe play their roles to the hilt in this tale of a childrens book writer who maybe has written a subversive tract 1 
but even the talented carrell cant save this 0 
it doesnt make you look cool 0 
i will continue to come here on ladies night andddd date night highly recommend this place to anyone who is in the area 1 
very friendly staff 1 
i work in the hospitality industry in paradise valley and have refrained from recommending cibo any longer 0 
the only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive 1 
i was amazed at the quick arrival of the two original lg cell phone batteries and and at a fraction of the price 1 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
im not sure how long we stood there but it was long enough for me to begin to feel awkwardly out of place 0 
there is no plot here to keep you going in the first place 0 
for the price this was a great deal 1 
graphics is far from the best part of the game 0 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
at around 4 pm i bought it at around 8pm i started to watch at around 815pm i fast forwarded the remaining film to see if there was anything left watchable for a human being with a brain but there wasnt 0 
the folks at otto always make us feel so welcome and special 1 
this movie was kind of long in length but i enjoyed every minute of it 1 
trying to make a call on these is an exercise in frustration 0 
bad choice 0 
the cast was great 1 
works as described 1 
crash is a depressing little nothing that provokes emotion but teaches you nothing if you already know racism and prejudice are bad things 0 
i contacted the company and they told me that although the unit was still under warranty if i couldnt produce my receipt i was out of luck 0 
the first thing that happened was that the tracking was off 0 
the structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema 1 
very pleased with this headset 1 
the burger had absolutely no flavor the meat itself was totally bland the burger was overcooked and there was no charcoal flavor 0 
a very good film indeed about great and unconditional love 1 
i purcashed this for the car charger and it does not work 0 
tasted like dirt 0 
it was clear that she had the range and ability to pull off this part 1 
we thought youd have to venture further away to get good sushi but this place really hit the spot that night 1 
the classic maine lobster roll was fantastic 1 
the server was very negligent of our needs and made us feel very unwelcome i would not suggest this place 0 
what a waste of time 0 
it is perfect for a sitdown family meal or get together with a few friends 1 
i gave it 5 stars then and im giving it 5 stars now 1 
the acting by the whole cast could be put on a scale and balanced perfectly between overacting and underacting 0 
the burger is good beef cooked just right 1 
they made this case too small and is very difficult to install 0 
the new characters werent all that memorable and i found myself forgetting who was who 0 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
absolutely great 1 
imdb ratings only go as low 1 for awful its time to get some negative numbers in there for cases such as these 0 
im not impressed with the concept or the food 0 
the worst piece of crap ever along with the verizon customer service 0 
i give it 2 thumbs down 0 
its one of the most boring horror movies from the 90s mainly because it starts slow and centers in a boring atmosphere 0 
the acting was bad 0 
well just if you keep thinking how bad it is 0 
the majority of the logitech earbud headsets failed 0 
this case seems well made 1 
the warmth it generates is in contrast to its austere backdrop 1 
we sat another ten minutes and finally gave up and left 0 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
this is a great deal 1 
cheap but hey it works was pleasantly suprised given the low cost of this item 1 
an excellent new restaurant by an experienced frenchman 1 
big disappointment with calendar sync 0 
the greek dressing was very creamy and flavorful 1 
the story is lame not interesting and never really explains the sinister origins of the puppets 0 
they work about 2 weeks then break 0 
after 20 minutes wait i got a table 0 
these products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet 0 
we ordered some old classics and some new dishes after going there a few times and were sorely disappointed with everything 0 
after the disappointing dinner we went elsewhere for dessert 0 
an excellent new restaurant by an experienced frenchman 1 
the acting was decidely wooden though no worse than a period universal b movie 0 
just does not work 0 
the chains which im no fan of beat this place easily 0 
good value great food great service 1 
its not what it says it is 0 
actually the graphics were good at the time 1 
this one works and was priced right 1 
for the price this was a great deal 1 
in an interesting part of town this place is amazing 1 
it came free with a dvd player i bought but i still turned the thing off halfway through because i was embarrassed for howell 0 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
the yellowtail carpaccio was melt in your mouth fresh 1 
dont buy this product 0 
i love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it 1 
i did not bother contacting the company for few dollar product but i learned the lesson that i should not have bought this form online anyway 0 
service is quick and friendly 1 
reaching for the bottom row is uncomfortable and the send and end keys are not where i expect them to be3 0 
extremely tasty 1 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
crostini that came with the salad was stale 0 
my rating just 3 out of 10 0 
the service was extremely slow 0 
sooooo good 1 
if you look for authentic thai food go else where 0 
the service here leaves a lot to be desired 0 
every element of this story was so over the top excessively phony and contrived that it was painful to sit through 0 
best tacos in town by far 1 
aside from its terrible lead this film has loads of other debits 0 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
very disappointed 0 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
worked perfectly 1 
service was exceptional and food was a good as all the reviews 1 
not only did the software do a great job of this i could also make my own ringtones form my existing cds without an internet connection 1 
this film tries to be a serious and sophisticated thrillerhorror flick and it fails miserably 0 
worst customer service 0 
would not reccommend 0 
come hungry leave happy and stuffed 1 
avoid at any and all costs 0 
simple lightweight and great fit 1 
i rather enjoyed it 1 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
the nokia ca42 usb cable did not work with my phone 0 
regrettably the film fails 0 
so absolutley fantastic 1 
poor sound quality 0 
disappointment i hate anything that goes in my ear 0 
if there is a wind it is completely useless 0 
instead we got a bore fest about a whiny spoiled brat babysitting 0 
save your money ive had this item for 11 months now 0 
the headset fulfills my requirements so i am happy with my purchase 1 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
i will continue to come here on ladies night andddd date night highly recommend this place to anyone who is in the area 1 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
great service and food 1 
the acting by the whole cast could be put on a scale and balanced perfectly between overacting and underacting 0 
it clicks into place in a way that makes you wonder how long that mechanism would last 0 
wow very spicy but delicious 1 
battery lasts only a few hours 0 
his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic 1 
the movie had you on the edge of your seat and made you somewhat afraid to go to your car at the end of the night 1 
if that bug never showed up i would have given a 4 for sure but on the other side of the wall where this bug was climbing was the kitchen 0 
i felt asleep the first time i watched it so i can recommend it for insomniacs 0 
the jabra eargels fit my ears very well 1 
tonight i had the elk filet specialand it sucked 0 
ambience is perfect 1 
great charger 1 
so good i am going to have to review this place twice once hereas a tribute to the place and once as a tribute to an event held here last night 1 
i will continue to come here on ladies night andddd date night highly recommend this place to anyone who is in the area 1 
the plot has more holes than a pair of fishnet stockings and the direction and editing is astonishingly ham fisted 0 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
simple lightweight and great fit 1 
in my house i was getting dropped coverage upstairs and no coverage in my basement 0 
a usable keyboard actually turns a pda into a realworld useful machine instead of just a neat gadget 1 
great place to relax and have an awesome burger and beer 1 
none of the three sizes they sent with the headset would stay in my ears 0 
i highly recommend this modest priced cellular phone 1 
the food was great as always compliments to the chef 1 
delicious and i will absolutely be back 1 
what a waste 0 
john garfield ann revere lilli plmer william conrad canada leeand filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screenjames wong howe 1 
for 40 bucks a head i really expect better food 0 
the seller is very understanding and patient i would definitely buy from them again 1 
the chains which im no fan of beat this place easily 0 
tied to charger for conversations lasting more than 45 minutesmajor problems 0 
the cast is good 1 
what a mistake 0 
the service was outshining i definitely recommend the halibut 1 
the film has an ultracheap look to it 0 
they work about 2 weeks then break 0 
and his subtle connections between the three films are awesome 1 
gets a signal when other verizon phones wont 1 
this place is way too overpriced for mediocre food 0 
im not sure what he was trying to do with this film 0 
the atmosphere is modern and hip while maintaining a touch of coziness 1 
i only hear garbage for audio 0 
the burrittos blah 0 
battery chargelife is quite long 1 
o my gosh the best phone i have ever had 1 
left very frustrated 0 
these products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet 0 
i believe that pitch black was done well 1 
this movie has a cutting edge to it 1 
its not what it says it is 0 
the headsets are easy to use and everyone loves them 1 
clever and a real crowdpleaserthis film still ranks among mickeys best films even after 80 wonderful years 1 
every time he opened his mouth you expect to hear you see kids pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show 0 
also the area where my unit broke im not too fond of the magnetic strap 0 
the incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film 1 
over rated 0 
wont work right or atleast for me 0 
cant get the software to work with my computer 0 
the ri style calamari was a joke 0 
the server was very negligent of our needs and made us feel very unwelcome i would not suggest this place 0 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
im super pissd 0 
a great way to finish a great 1 
this movie now joins revenge of the boogeyman and zombiez as part of the hellish trinity of horror films 0 
i gave it a 10 1 
dont bother coming here 0 
trying to make a call on these is an exercise in frustration 0 
thank you for wasting my money 0 
the story itself is just predictable and lazy 0 
excellent sound quality 1 
highly entertaining at all angles 1 
the selection on the menu was great and so were the prices 1 
the pizza tasted old super chewy in not a good way 0 
they have been around for years and carries the highest quality of antiglare screen protector that i have found to date 1 
here in the wind and the lion we see a wonderful rendering of americas own imperial age 1 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
the story is beyond stupid 0 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
works great 1 
they never brought a salad we asked for 0 
lame would be the best way to describe it 0 
im not sure what he was trying to do with this film 0 
car charger as well as ac charger are included to make sure you never run out of juicehighy recommended 1 
it is very educational for children 1 to 8 years old 1 
i am so tired of clichés that is just lazy writing and here they come in thick and fast 0 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
the story starts too fast with absolutely no suspense or buildup in the slightest 0 
all the other cases ive tried normally fall apart after a few months but this one seems to be in for the long haul 1 
the burger had absolutely no flavor the meat itself was totally bland the burger was overcooked and there was no charcoal flavor 0 
it quit working after id used it for about 18 months so i just purchased another one because this is the best headset ive ever owned 1 
the best place to go for a tasty bowl of pho 1 
after all the rave reviews i couldnt wait to eat herewhat a disappointment 0 
it was just not a fun experience 1 
thats how id describe this painfully dreary timewaster of a film 0 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
it was just not a fun experience 1 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
there arent death scenes like in previous movies and the fx are terrible 0 
i have to use the smallest earpieces provided but it stays on pretty well 1 
those phones are working just fine now 1 
people who like european films and art movies will like this movie 1 
very satisifed with that 1 
almost all of the songs in cover girl are oldfashioned and not very tuneful 0 
it was a pale color instead of nice and char and has no flavor 0 
the entire audience applauded at the conclusion of the film 1 
we ordered the duck rare and it was pink and tender on the inside with a nice char on the outside 1 
im happy about this purchase good quality and low price 1 
only had this a month but its worked flawlessly so far 1 
the phone crashed completely and now i have to get it replaced 0 
it looks very nice 1 
nice ambiance 1 
then a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use 0 
his performance as awarded was stunning 1 
if there was ever a movie that needed wordofmouth to promote this is it 1 
lewis blacks considerable talent is wasted here too as he is at his most incendiary when he is unrestrained which the pg13 rating certainly wont allow 0 
the budget was evidently very limited 0 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
i have 23 bars on my cell phone when i am home but you cant not hear anything 0 
it deserves strong love 1 
reversible plug works great 1 
nine out of ten for a truly lovely film 1 
for the price this was a great deal 1 
big disappointment with calendar sync 0 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
it only recognizes the phone as its storage device 0 
you could only take 2 videos at a time and the quality was very poor 0 
i saw this movie and i thought this is a stupid movie 0 
if you have several dozen or several hundred contacts then imagine the fun of sending each of them one by one 0 
best fish ive ever had in my life 1 
it clicks into place in a way that makes you wonder how long that mechanism would last 0 
this was reflected not only in the cast but also in the belowpar script which borrowed much from the earlier classic 0 
this place deserves no stars 0 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
im probably one of the few people to ever go to ians and not like it 0 
its quite simply the highest most superlative form of cinema imaginable 1 
if it was to turn my good day feeling into a night of disturbing memories than i guess he succeeded 0 
things happen characters personalities change plot twists occur for no real reason other than that script calls for it 0 
the explosion of the gas tanks at the end was just as awful 0 
i can say that the desserts were yummy 1 
any ring toneoverall good phone to buy 1 
ive had this for nearly 2 years and it has worked great for me 1 
friends pasta also bad he barely touched it 0 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
what did bother me was the slow service 0 
nine out of ten for a truly lovely film 1 
the food is good 1 
maybe its just their vegetarian fare but ive been twice and i thought it was average at best 0 
in my house i was getting dropped coverage upstairs and no coverage in my basement 0 
i dont think ive ever gone to a movie and disliked it as much 0 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
service is quick and even to go orders are just like we like it 1 
however i needed some better instructions 0 
this case seems well made 1 
great bluetooth 1 
i had high hopes for this place since the burgers are cooked over a charcoal grill but unfortunately the taste fell flat way flat 0 
frozen pucks of disgust with some of the worst people behind the register 0 
great earpiece 1 
i would recommend it 1 
updatewent back for a second time and it was still just as amazing 1 
the cast is good 1 
now the burgers arent as good the pizza which used to be amazing is doughy and flavorless 0 
full of unconvincing cardboard characters it is blandly written by edward chodorov who also produced and is surprisingly directed by jean negulesco from whom one would expect a great deal more 0 
the opening sequence of this gem is a classic and the cat n mouse games that follow are a delight to watch 1 
thank you for wasting my money 0 
i have seen many movies starring jaclyn smith but my god this was one of her best though it came out 12 years ago 1 
probably not in a hurry to go back 0 
this company charge me a restocking fee and still not given me my refund back 0 
excellent bluetooth headset 1 
that one didnt work either 0 
talk about useless customer service 0 
battery is holding up well 1 
the camera although rated at an impressive 13 megapixels renders images that fall well below expectations of such a relatively high resolution 0 
also difficult to put onid recommend avoiding this product 0 
this movie is terrible 0 
not a good item it worked for a while then started having problems in my auto reverse tape player 0 
excellent bluetooth headset 1 
i would give this television series a 10 plus if i could 1 
it did not work in my cell phone plug i am very up set with the charger 0 
the speaker is of low quality so as making the ring tones sound very cheap 0 
the steak was amazingrge fillet relleno was the best seafood plate i have ever had 1 
it was clear that she had the range and ability to pull off this part 1 
the design might be ergonomic in theory but i could not stand having these in my ear 0 
just what i wanted 1 
cant get the software to work with my computer 0 
it was equally awful 0 
the acting from all involved and that includes those like shatner and nimoy is bad and washed out and making them seem as old as they look in real life the special effects are tacky like when spock has to rescue kirk on a jet pack when he falls down from a mountain 0 
i left with a stomach ache and felt sick the rest of the day 0 
it was an inexpensive piece but i would still have expected better quality 0 
there was no chemistry between ben affleck and sandra bullock in this film and i couldnt understand why he would consider even leaving his wifetobe for this chick that he supposedly was knocked out by 0 
the desserts were a bit strange 0 
someone shouldve invented this sooner 1 
this place is pretty good nice little vibe in the restaurant 1 
as a sushi lover avoid this place by all means 0 
my experience was terrible this was my fourth bluetooth headset and while it was much more comfortable than my last jabra which i hated 0 
she carries the movie well 1 
absolutely great 1 
my breakfast was perpared great with a beautiful presentation of 3 giant slices of toast lightly dusted with powdered sugar 1 
the phone gets extremely hot 0 
ordered a double cheeseburger got a single patty that was falling apart picture uploaded yeah still sucks 0 
very funny 1 
good case 1 
i wish i could enter negative values admins 0 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
it has a very good plot it holds your complete attention the acting is superb tom wilkinson was fantastic and emily watson was also very good 1 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
how can you call yourself a steakhouse if you cant properly cook a steak i dont understand 0 
by this time our side of the restaurant was almost empty so there was no excuse 0 
it was so bad i had lost the heart to finish it 0 
highly recommend for any one who has a blue tooth phone 1 
exceptionally bad 0 
okay i like to consider myself a fair critic so ill give credit where credits duethe creature effects were actually pretty cool 1 
those phones are working just fine now 1 
it was a long time that i didnt see a so charismatic actor on screen 1 
see both films if you can 1 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
this movie is a good and humorous comment on life in 2006 1 
the new characters werent all that memorable and i found myself forgetting who was who 0 
i really recommend this faceplates since it looks very nice elegant and cool 1 
utterly without merit on any level this is akin to torture 0 
none of the three sizes they sent with the headset would stay in my ears 0 
its a fresh subtle and rather sublime effect 1 
this place should honestly be blown up 0 
i ordered the lemon raspberry ice cocktail which was also incredible 1 
steamboat willie is an amazingly important film to our cinema history 1 
del taco is pretty nasty and should be avoided if possible 0 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
i felt insulted and disrespected how could you talk and judge another human being like that 0 
wont ever go here again 0 
i went on motorolas website and followed all directions but could not get it to pair again 0 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
there is nothing authentic about this place 0 
sooooo good 1 
i believe the screenwriter did a good job of tying up the loose ends 1 
great sound and service 1 
poor construction 0 
great food and awesome service 1 
i wasnt expecting oscar material but this 0 
comfort for our whole family 1 
i highly recommend this movie for anyone interested in art poetry theater politics or japanese history 1 
but its just not funny 0 
amazon sucks 0 
i love this thing 1 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
alexander nevsky is a great film 1 
woa talk about awful 0 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
the sound quality is good and functionality is awesome 1 
the worst phone from samsungcrap this crappy samsung e715 is the worst i have ever seeen 0 
about half way through this film i started to dislike it 0 
a bit predictable 0 
loved itfriendly servers great food wonderful and imaginative menu 1 
the best example of how dumb the writing is when its established that you can turn the zombiestudents back into humans by removing a necklace containing a piece of the meteorite 0 
at first glance it is a lovely bakery cafe nice ambiance clean friendly staff 1 
nice solid keyboard 1 
kind of flops around 0 
and the chef was generous with his time even came around twice so we can take pictures with him 1 
it was a drive to get there 0 
buttons are too small 0 
the aerial scenes were welldone 1 
not even good for camp value 0 
weve have gotten a much better service from the pizza place next door than the services we received from this restaurant 0 
the dialogue sucked 0 
does not fit 0 
obviously they have a terrible customer service so you get what you pay for 0 
the salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop which was perfectly cooked 1 
and it was way to expensive 0 
very easy to use 1 
they work about 2 weeks then break 0 
the meat was pretty dry i had the sliced brisket and pulled pork 0 
i love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it 1 
i use this product in a motor control center where there is a lot of high voltage humming from the equipment and it works great 1 
avoid at any and all costs 0 
my only problem is i thought the actor playing the villain was a low rent michael ironside 0 
weird vibe from owners 0 
poor quality and service 0 
it had some average acting from the main person and it was a low budget as you clearly can see 0 
putting the race card aside lets look at the major flaw in the film they destroy latifas character 0 
my friend did not like his bloody mary 0 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
conclusion very filling meals 1 
omg i felt like i had never eaten thai food until this dish 1 
their chow mein is so good 1 
a lot of websites have been rating this a very good phone and so do i 1 
penne vodka excellent 1 
doesnt hold charge 0 
awful service 0 
awesome device 1 
the microphone also works well but according to people i have called it applifies everything 1 
no one at the table thought the food was above average or worth the wait that we had for it 0 
i took back my money and got outta there 0 
reasonably priced also 1 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
so for our enjoyment we get to see them run around play games and be dangerous 1 
you share general loewenhielms exquisite joy in his partaking of the cailles en sarcophage even though you are just watching a movie but you do wish for just a small sample to savor 1 
kieslowski never ceases to amaze me 1 
it was just too horrible 0 
awesome device 1 
first of all it doesnt wear well 0 
with the originality and freshness of the first movie now spent this remake had little else to offer 0 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
linked to my phone without effort 1 
characters are onedimensional even the good guys and especially the bad guys 0 
what a waste of time 0 
after two i felt disgusting 0 
the reception has been generally good 1 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
its like a really sexy party in your mouth where youre outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party 1 
im not really sure how joeys was voted best hot dog in the valley by readers of phoenix magazine 0 
it wasnt busy at all and now we know why 0 
phone now holds charge like it did when it was new 1 
the headsets are easy to use and everyone loves them 1 
this is the place where i first had pho and it was amazing 1 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
adapter does not provide enough charging current 0 
join the club and get awesome offers via email 1 
1010 1 
i have been in more than a few bars in vegas and do not ever recall being charged for tap water 0 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
the text messaging feature is really tricky to use 0 
the ripped banana was not only ripped but petrified and tasteless 0 
just dont know why they were so slow 0 
if you want healthy authentic or ethic food try this place 1 
the only suspense i was feeling was the frustration at just how retarded the girls were 0 
my 5year old nokia 2160 from tracfone holds the charge a lot better than this 0 
i have had mine for about a year and this christmas i bought some for the rest of the family 1 
great for the jawbone 1 
youd have to have the iq of particularly stupid mollusk not to see that one coming 0 
its too bad that everyone else involved didnt share crowes level of dedication to quality for if they did wed have a far better film on our hands than this subpar mess 0 
but it does get better reception and clarity than any phone ive had before 1 
bluetooth does not work phone locks up screens just flash up and now it just makes calls randomly while in my pocket locked 0 
the cable looks so thin and flimsy it is scary 0 
this product is great it makes working a lot easier i can go to the copier while waiting on hold for something 1 
i paid the bill but did not tip because i felt the server did a terrible job 0 
utterly without merit on any level this is akin to torture 0 
one of the best mexican movies ever and one of the less understood even by mexican themselves no matter how identified the should have felt with it 1 
he was terrible 0 
we had so much to say about the place before we walked in that he expected it to be amazing but was quickly disappointed 0 
if you havent choked in your own vomit by the end by all the cheap drama and worthless dialogue youve must have bored yourself to death with this waste of time 0 
these are the central themes of the film and they are handled ineptly stereotypically and with no depth of imagination 0 
now the pizza itself was good the peanut sauce was very tasty 1 
1 hour 54 minutes of sheer tedium melodrama and horrible acting a mess of a script and a sinking feeling of good lord what were they thinking 0 
probably never coming back and wouldnt recommend it 0 
watching washing machine twirling around wouldnt hurt your eyes as much as this show 0 
good price 1 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
steve martin delivers a really funny performance of a middleaged upper class uptight white guy 1 
what makes this story different are the terrific production values faultless photography composition and editing the terrific casting the underappreciated brian keith playing a bully teddy and vivid history 1 
sooooo good 1 
its one of the most boring horror movies from the 90s mainly because it starts slow and centers in a boring atmosphere 0 
this is an unbelievable bargain 1 
still i do like this movie for its empowerment of women theres not enough movies out there like this one 1 
they know how to make them here 1 
i was hoping for more 0 
very disappointing 0 
otherwise easy to install and use clear sound 1 
filmiing was less expansive 0 
warning do not buy 0 
the burger had absolutely no flavor the meat itself was totally bland the burger was overcooked and there was no charcoal flavor 0 
you get what you pay for i guess 0 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
i waited and waited 0 
lifetime does not air it enough so if anyone knows what store sells it let me know because this is a musthave 1 
both great 1 
worst foodservice ive had in a while 0 
finally after three or four times the spring of the latch broke and i could not use it any longer on the visor 0 
i dont understand how this garbage got on the shelves of the movie store its not even a real movie 0 
very much disappointed with this company 0 
they do not care about the consumer one bit 0 
for people who are first timers in film making i think they did an excellent job 1 
works great 1 
there are the usual hitchcock logic flaws 0 
if i take a picture the battery drops a bar and starts beeping letting me know its dieing 0 
what a waste of money and time 0 
loved the casting of jimmy buffet as the science teacher 1 
feelings thoughtsgabriels discomfort during the danceall these intangibles leap to life and come within the viewers grasp in hustons portrayal 1 
w810i is just superb 1 
none of it works just dont buy it 0 
the story which was told so eloquently by francis ford coppola 25 years earlier really unfolds gradually and leaves room for the characters to develop 1 
the film deserves strong kudos for taking this stand for having exceptional acting from its mostly lesserknown cast and for the superintelligent script that doesnt insult the audience or take the easy way out when it comes to white racism 1 
they have horrible attitudes towards customers and talk down to each one when customers dont enjoy their food 0 
he is almost unbearable to watch on screen he has little to no charisma and terrible comedic timing 0 
i cant wait to go back 1 
john wayne did an incredible job for being so young in the movie industry 1 
but the convoluted plot just didnt convince me and much of the film was watched with a weird questioning glance 0 
all the other cases ive tried normally fall apart after a few months but this one seems to be in for the long haul 1 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
overall i wasnt very impressed with noca 0 
this is a disgrace 0 
i dont like this nokia either 0 
works for me 1 
the restaurant atmosphere was exquisite 1 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
if you have not seen this movie i definitely recommend it 1 
frankly after cotton club and unfaithful it was kind of embarrassing to watch lane and gere in this film because it is bad 0 
i liked it 1 
the only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive 1 
this phone might well be the worst ive ever had in any brand 0 
however i recently watched the whole thing again on dvd and i was completely struck by how extremely stupid the storyline was how it contained holes inconsistencies and frankly a whole lot of crap and how horrid the dancing was 0 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
im big fan of rpg games too but this movie its a disgrace to any selfrespecting rpger there is 0 
if you want healthy authentic or ethic food try this place 1 
putting the race card aside lets look at the major flaw in the film they destroy latifas character 0 
iam very pleased with my purchase 1 
kieslowski never ceases to amaze me 1 
the malta settings are as dry and as barren as the dialogue 0 
battery is terrible 0 
favorite place in town for shawarrrrrrma 1 
love this place hits the spot when i want something healthy but not lacking in quantity or flavor 1 
the service was extremely slow 0 
20th century foxs road house 1948 is not only quite a silly noir but is an implausible unmitigated bore of a movie 0 
i am so pleased to know such a modern day genius is out there letting is passion for art drive him and taking us as an audience with him 1 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
its practically perfect in all of them  a true masterpiece in a sea of faux masterpieces 1 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
the acting was decidely wooden though no worse than a period universal b movie 0 
there is really nothing for me at postinos hope your experience is better 0 
dont waste your money and time 0 
i love lane but ive never seen her in a movie this lousy 0 
the only thing i did like was the prime rib and dessert section 1 
if she had not rolled the eyes we may have stayed not sure if we will go back and try it again 0 
i am a fan of his this movie sucked really bad 0 
the awful dialogue and hopeless overacting by everyone who gets shot top off a real waste of space and time 0 
the block was amazing 1 
if you are looking for a good quality motorola headset keep looking this isnt it 0 
i ate there twice on my last visit and especially enjoyed the salmon salad 1 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
the foreigner is not worth one second of your time 0 
prosgood camera very nice pictures also has cool styles like black and white and more 1 
echo problemvery unsatisfactory 0 
terrible my car will not accept this cassette 0 
i live in the neighborhood so i am disappointed i wont be back here because it is a convenient location 0 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
this is a very average phone with bad battery life that operates on a weak network 0 
before i go in to why i gave a 1 star rating please know that this was my third time eating at bachi burger before writing a review 0 
i can assure you that you wont be disappointed 1 
mic doesnt work 0 
lewis blacks considerable talent is wasted here too as he is at his most incendiary when he is unrestrained which the pg13 rating certainly wont allow 0 
makes it easier to keep up with my bluetooth when im not wearing it 0 
the acting as youd expect from this cast is top notch 1 
i never walked out of a movie faster 0 
great it was new packaged nice works good no problems and it came in less time then i expected 1 
works great 1 
so just beware 0 
overall the film is interesting and thoughtprovoking 1 
do not waste your money here 0 
the nachos are a must have 1 
this is a great deal 1 
the meat was pretty dry i had the sliced brisket and pulled pork 0 
1010 1 
well packaged arrived on time and works as intended 1 
predictable but not a bad watch 1 
each day of the week they have a different deal and its all so delicious 1 
everything about this product is wrongfirst 0 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
the management is rude 0 
totally different with loads of understatement and black comedy this is a film few get to see but those who do will remember it 1 
to be honest with you this is unbelievable nonsense and very foolish 0 
an amazing finale to possibly the best trilogy of all time 1 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
this was such an awesome movie that i bought it off of ebay 1 
anyways the food was definitely not filling at all and for the price you pay you should expect more 0 
i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
its also great to see that renowned silent screenwriter frances marion hasnt missed a step going from silent to sound 1 
if there was ever an indication of a writer and a directors ability to meld two highly volatile temperaments into a seamless union of creativity then this is it 1 
its a piece of crap 0 
regardless the film fails on most levels 0 
i had high hopes for this place since the burgers are cooked over a charcoal grill but unfortunately the taste fell flat way flat 0 
horrible 0 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
often the dialogue doesnt really follow from one line to another or fit the surroundings 0 
i understand that its supposed to be a cheap popcorn comedy but that doesnt mean that it has to completely insult our intelligence and have writing so incredibly hackneyed that it borders on offensive 0 
it makes very strange ticking noises before it ends the call 0 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
tom wilkinson broke my heart at the end and everyone elses judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike 1 
its a campy sort of film thats a joy to watch 1 
tried to go here for lunch and it was a madhouse 0 
i found this move beautiful enjoyable and uplifting 1 
the service was a little slow considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace 0 
summary the witticisms werent witty 0 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
the movie seemed a little slow at first 0 
its the best headset i have used 1 
i could care less the interior is just beautiful 1 
it is wonderful and inspiring to watch and i hope that it gets released again on to video or dvd 1 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
very disappointed and wondered how it could be in the oscar shortlist 0 
its still wild stuff though and is highly recommended to fans of giallo cinema 1 
i have to mention this and it is a huge spoiler i loved the ending how all the characters of the three films were the remaining survivors of the ferry disaster with valentine and the young judge together and the old man watching it on her tv solidifying his happiness over the suffering which he dealt with for those many years 1 
either way it sucks 0 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
their onscreen chemistry critical to the entire film is genuine 1 
arrived quickly and much less expensive than others being sold 1 
but what really made it unwatchable was the direction 0 
that was done in the second movie 0 
disappointment i hate anything that goes in my ear 0 
i am very happy 1 
and i just love the colors 1 
it works 1 
id rather eat airline food seriously 0 
we are sending it back 0 
the plot has more holes than a pair of fishnet stockings and the direction and editing is astonishingly ham fisted 0 
these products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet 0 
but other than that the movie seemed to drag and the heroes didnt really work for their freedom 0 
everything is appalling 0 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
even in my bmw 3 series which is fairly quiet i have trouble hearing what the other person is saying 0 
att is not clear sound is very distorted and you have to yell when you talk 0 
this case has passed the one year mark and while it shows signs of wear it is 100 functional 1 
the portion was huge 1 
this allows the possibility of double booking for the same date and time after the first 0 
easy to pair with my samsung cell 1 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
delicious nyc bagels good selections of cream cheese real lox with capers even 1 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
the tracfonewebsite is user friendly and makes it easy toactivate etc 1 
bluetooth does not work phone locks up screens just flash up and now it just makes calls randomly while in my pocket locked 0 
the chicken wings contained the driest chicken meat i have ever eaten 0 
the performances are not improved by improvisation because the actors now have twice as much to worry about not only whether theyre delivering the line well but whether the line itself is any good 0 
it feels poorly constructed the menus are difficult to navigate and the buttons are so recessed that it is difficult to push them 0 
ive never been treated so bad 0 
overall the film is interesting and thoughtprovoking 1 
i saw it as a child on tv back in 1973 when it was the stranger and i loved it 1 
once you get inside youll be impressed with the place 1 
cant upload ringtones from a third party 0 
i only hear garbage for audio 0 
i seriously cannot believe that the owner has so many unexperienced employees that all are running around like chickens with their heads cut off 0 
very disappointing 0 
it is well made easy to access the phone and has a handy detachable belt clip 1 
level 5 spicy was perfect where spice didnt overwhelm the soup 1 
its very slow 0 
it was that year however that reminded us that huston was still at the top of his game as evinced by his faithful adaptation of james joyces acclaimed novella the dead 1 
after i pulled up my car i waited for another 15 minutes before being acknowledged 0 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
i had the chicken pho and it tasted very bland 0 
im not sure how long we stood there but it was long enough for me to begin to feel awkwardly out of place 0 
in conclusion i will not bother with this movie because a volcano in los angeles is nothing but nonsense 0 
i ordered the lemon raspberry ice cocktail which was also incredible 1 
the crêpe was delicate and thin and moist 1 
the food was terrible 0 
i got to enjoy the seafood salad with a fabulous vinegrette 1 
the point is the journey a journey that touches every member of the family 1 
why was this film made 0 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
excellent hands free tool 1 
the only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive 1 
someone shouldve invented this sooner 1 
pretty good beer selection too 1 
the eargels channel the sound directly into your ear and seem to increase the sound volume and clarity 1 
hayao miyazakis latest and eighth film for studio ghibili gake no ue no ponyo ponyo on the cliff by the sea is a wonderfully fun and imaginative look at childhood 1 
for people who are first timers in film making i think they did an excellent job 1 
low quality 0 
the goat taco didnt skimp on the meat and wow what flavor 1 
the acting from all involved and that includes those like shatner and nimoy is bad and washed out and making them seem as old as they look in real life the special effects are tacky like when spock has to rescue kirk on a jet pack when he falls down from a mountain 0 
new battery works great in phone 1 
the mic there is a joke and the volume is quite low 0 
love this phone 1 
a fly was in my apple juice a fly 0 
after my phone got to be about a year old its been slowly breaking despite much care on my part 0 
the service was great even the manager came and helped with our table 1 
i cant see how this movie can be an inspiration to anyone to come out or overcome fear and rejection 0 
after a year the battery went completely dead on my headset 0 
main thing i didnt enjoy is that the crowd is of older crowd around mid 30s and up 0 
the handsfree part works fine but then the car tries to download the address book and the treo rebootsoverall i still rate this device high 1 
this mostly routine factbased tv drama gets a boost from the fine performance by cole 1 
they have a really nice atmosphere 1 
it defeats the purpose of a bluetooth headset 0 
dont buy this product 0 
bad characters bad story and bad acting 0 
when a song could explain the emotions of the subjects better such as when jay adams unfortunate life was a subject of talk the song old man by neil young was played which evokes many emotions 1 
the microphone also works well but according to people i have called it applifies everything 1 
these were so good we ordered them twice 1 
i want to first say our server was great and we had perfect service 1 
works great 1 
the black eyed peas and sweet potatoes unreal 1 
excellent starter wireless headset 0 
i would give this television series a 10 plus if i could 1 
20th century foxs road house 1948 is not only quite a silly noir but is an implausible unmitigated bore of a movie 0 
their frozen margaritas are way too sugary for my taste 0 
their menu is diverse and reasonably priced 1 
say bye bye to your tip lady 0 
we asked for the bill to leave without eating and they didnt bring that either 0 
omit watching this 0 
if you look for authentic thai food go else where 0 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
when im on this side of town this will definitely be a spot ill hit up again 1 
the shrimp tender and moist 1 
filmiing was less expansive 0 
in fact this stinker smells like a directtovideo release 0 
if there were zero stars i would give it zero stars 0 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
only like 3 or 4 buildings used a couple of locations maybe poor hummh 0 
im probably one of the few people to ever go to ians and not like it 0 
four stars for the food the guy in the blue shirt for his great vibe still letting us in to eat 1 
we had so much to say about the place before we walked in that he expected it to be amazing but was quickly disappointed 0 
the acting was bad 0 
if you are razr owneryou must have this 1 
brilliant 1 
doesnt work at all i bougth it for my l7c and its not working 0 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
portable and it works 1 
i ate there twice on my last visit and especially enjoyed the salmon salad 1 
it kept getting worse and worse so now im officially done 0 
very disappointing 0 
worthwhile 1 
i had the mac salad and it was pretty bland so i will not be getting that again 0 
excellent 1 
oh yeah and the storyline was pathetic too 0 
the headset fulfills my requirements so i am happy with my purchase 1 
the secondary plot line is incomprehensible and its relation to the primary plot line is mystifying 0 
it sure does beat the nachos at the movies but i would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant 0 
it feels poorly constructed the menus are difficult to navigate and the buttons are so recessed that it is difficult to push them 0 
the color is even prettier than i thought it would be and the graphics are incredibly sharp 1 
one thing i hate is the mode set button at the side 0 
one of the worst shows of all time 0 
i would avoid this place if you are staying in the mirage 0 
design flaw 0 
frankly after cotton club and unfaithful it was kind of embarrassing to watch lane and gere in this film because it is bad 0 
no one at the table thought the food was above average or worth the wait that we had for it 0 
the poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying 0 
the characters are interesting even if a bit predictable 1 
its a sad movie but very good 1 
nice design and quality 1 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
that movie was bad 0 
however after finally watching this film i realized that not only had i had a closed mind to the brilliance it depicts i also found myself watching it over and over again 1 
my gyro was basically lettuce only 0 
the film has an ultracheap look to it 0 
oh and i forgot to also mention the weird color effect it has on your phone 0 
were jerks on the phone 0 
it is indescribably the most annoying and idiotic show i have ever seen 0 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
fantastic earphones 1 
the selection on the menu was great and so were the prices 1 
i was not happy with this item 0 
i kept looking at the time and it had soon become 35 minutes yet still no food 0 
a pretty good product 1 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is vegas and located inside the crystals shopping mall by aria 1 
easy to use 1 
if you are looking for a good quality motorola headset keep looking this isnt it 0 
about half way through this film i started to dislike it 0 
cant get the software to work with my computer 0 
it never condescends all the characters have good genuine hearts and believable problems 1 
call me a nut but i think this is one of the best movies ever 1 
good show samsung 1 
great price also 1 
i will not return 0 
the staff are great the ambiance is great 1 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
motorola finally got the voice quality of a bluetooth headset right 1 
too bad you have to pay up to a month for the service 0 
save your money ive had this item for 11 months now 0 
much better than the other ayce sushi place i went to in vegas 1 
i love the pho and the spring rolls oh so yummy you have to try 1 
this movie is excellentangel is beautiful and scamp is adorablehis little yelps when hes scaredand the funniest parts are whenscamp is caught under the curtain and when angel and scamp are singing ive never had this feeling beforei totally recommend this movieits coming out on special edition on june 20the cover has scamp on a garbage can and angel underneath the lid 1 
i like design and look of jabra behing the ear headsets and 5020 is pretty comfortible to wear 24 hours a day without pain in the ear 1 
the calls drop the phone comes on and off at will the screen goes black and the worst of all it stops ringing intermittently 0 
very easy to use 1 
a pretty good product 1 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
when my order arrived one of the gyros was missing 0 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
too politically correct 0 
the only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive 1 
sounds good reasonably priced and effective its that simple 1 
maybe if they werent cold they would have been somewhat edible 0 
i highly recommend this device to everyone 1 
its not what it says it is 0 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
last night was my second time dining here and i was so happy i decided to go back 1 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
this is an unbelievable bargain 1 
on a positive note our server was very attentive and provided great service 1 
price is good too 1 
disappointing accessory from a good manufacturer 0 
very very disappointed ordered the 35 big bay plater 0 
you wont be disappointed 1 
jamie foxx absolutely is ray charles 1 
the puppets look really cheesy not in a good way like in the puppet master 80s flicks 0 
waiter was a jerk 0 
it has all the features i want 1 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
seems like a good quick place to grab a bite of some familiar pub food but do yourself a favor and look elsewhere 0 
the service here leaves a lot to be desired 0 
unfortunately the ability to actually know you are receiving a call is a rather important feature and this phone is pitiful in that respect 0 
this movie is also revealing 1 
im not sure what he was trying to do with this film 0 
everyone is treated equally special 1 
lousy product 0 
a standout scene 1 
seriously flavorful delights folks 1 
best breakfast buffet 1 
there was a warm feeling with the service and i felt like their guest for a special treat 1 
highly unprofessional and rude to a loyal patron 0 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
bluetooth range is good a few days ago i left my phone in the trunk got a call and carried the conversation without a hitch 1 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
i dont like this nokia either 0 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
plus it was wellpaced and suited its relatively short run time 1 
the film gives meaning to the phrase never in the history of human conflict has so much been owed by so many to so few 1 
personally i think it shows that people should learn to find a compromise them self without involving other people into issue 1 
we wont be returning 0 
i really do recommend this place you can go wrong with this donut place 1 
my 5year old nokia 2160 from tracfone holds the charge a lot better than this 0 
it wasnt busy either also the building was freezing cold 0 
it is not good 0 
i love their fries and their beans 1 
it always cuts out and makes a beep beep beep sound then says signal failed 0 
i as well wouldve given godfathers zero stars if possible 0 
my mother and brother had to do thiswhen i saw robert ryan portraying this type of man it was a very good imitation of this type of individual and i was impressed 1 
yes its that bad 0 
every thing on phone work perfectly she like it 1 
kind of hard to mess up a steak but they did 0 
seriously flavorful delights folks 1 
we made the drive all the way from north scottsdale and i was not one bit disappointed 1 
this place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver 0 
it feels poorly constructed the menus are difficult to navigate and the buttons are so recessed that it is difficult to push them 0 
i wear glasses and it fits fine with them 1 
after charging overnight these batteries work great 1 
a good time 1 
if that bug never showed up i would have given a 4 for sure but on the other side of the wall where this bug was climbing was the kitchen 0 
that being said for a phone the camera is very nice many cool effects to play with and video is decent as well 1 
food was really boring 0 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
id love to go back 1 
honeslty it didnt taste that fresh 0 
graphics is far from the best part of the game 0 
exceptionally bad 0 
my experience was terrible this was my fourth bluetooth headset and while it was much more comfortable than my last jabra which i hated 0 
i love that they put their food in nice plastic containers as opposed to cramming it in little paper takeout boxes 1 
and if that isnt enough of a mess of a movie for you the picture is also marred with a constant use of studio sets and indoor exteriors 0 
fantastic service here 1 
the best place to go for a tasty bowl of pho 1 
one more thing i can tolerate political incorrectness very well im all for artistic freedom and suspension of disbelief but the slavic female character was just too much 0 
the mic is great 1 
appears to actually outperform the original battery from china that came with my v325i 1 
it is indescribably the most annoying and idiotic show i have ever seen 0 
everything captain howdy says is either laughable or just plain stupid 0 
i exchanged the sony ericson z500a for this and im pretty happy with that decision 1 
i exchanged the sony ericson z500a for this and im pretty happy with that decision 1 
i do think tom hanks is a good actor 1 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
my rating just 3 out of 10 0 
the pleather case doesnt fit 0 
everything was fresh and delicious 1 
it fits so securely that the ear hook does not even need to be used and the sound is better directed through your ear canal 1 
needless to say i wont be going back anytime soon 0 
unfortunately cover girl is an example of how hollywood used to exploit women for financial gain 0 
if you stay in vegas you must get breakfast here at least once 1 
very prompt service 1 
very poor service 0 
i great reception all the time 1 
i can barely ever hear on it and am constantly saying what 0 
this is cool because most cases are just open there allowing the screen to get all scratched up 1 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
omelets are to die for 1 
battery has no life 0 
this product had a strong rubberpetroleum smell that was unbearable after a while and caused me to return it 0 
pricing is a bit of a concern at mellow mushroom 0 
bad characters bad story and bad acting 0 
improper description i had to return it 0 
i promise they wont disappoint 1 
this movie contained an allstar cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i havent seen before 1 
its so bad its actually worth seeing just for that reason 0 
barney is definitely super de duper 1 
the malta settings are as dry and as barren as the dialogue 0 
the majority of the logitech earbud headsets failed 0 
he was terrible 0 
yet plantronincs continues to use the same flawed charger design 0 
elias koteasjack palance play good roles angelina is hot and gets nakedbilly drago appears in this and is cool as usual a cameo by sven ole thorsen helps make this a very enjoyable movie with good acting and a decent budget 1 
this scene is very strong and unpleasant 0 
it features an outlandish array of memorable psychotic but lovable nuts 1 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
poor construction 0 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
their rotating beers on tap is also a highlight of this place 1 
this was like the final blow 0 
i exchanged the sony ericson z500a for this and im pretty happy with that decision 1 
this is the place where i first had pho and it was amazing 1 
items stated as included from the description are not included 0 
otherwise dont even waste your time on this 0 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
i have to use the smallest earpieces provided but it stays on pretty well 1 
case was more or less an extra that i originally put on but later discarded because it scratched my ear 0 
keep up the good work amazon 1 
you cant go wrong with any of the food here 1 
it plays louder than any other speaker of this size the price is so low that most would think the quality is lacking however its not 1 
never heard of any of them except cole who was totally unbelievable in the part 0 
theres also enough hypocrisy in this film to make me vomit 0 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
i would recommend purchasing the jabra jx10 series 2 which works flawlessly with my moto q go figure 1 
works for me 1 
worst hour and a half of my lifeoh my gosh 0 
the worst phone ive ever had only had it for a few months 0 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
but its just not funny 0 
gotta love those closeups of slimy drooling teeth 1 
bluetooth range is good a few days ago i left my phone in the trunk got a call and carried the conversation without a hitch 1 
nothing short of magnificent photographycinematography in this film 1 
keep up the good work amazon 1 
although i very much liked the look and sound of this place the actual experience was a bit disappointing 0 
excellent starter wireless headset 0 
the pizza tasted old super chewy in not a good way 0 
it seems completely secure both holding on to my belt and keeping the iphone inside 1 
if you are razr owneryou must have this 1 
i could care less the interior is just beautiful 1 
if there was ever an indication of a writer and a directors ability to meld two highly volatile temperaments into a seamless union of creativity then this is it 1 
now imagine that every single one of those decisions was made wrong 0 
i could not understand what kind of idiot would produce this mess in the first place not to mention several season 0 
its welldesigned and very sharp the blue is a very nice color 1 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
my boyfriend and i came here for the first time on a recent trip to vegas and could not have been more pleased with the quality of food and service 1 
i didnt want the clip going over the top of my ear causing discomfort 0 
the black eyed peas and sweet potatoes unreal 1 
and then tragedy struck 0 
the point is the journey a journey that touches every member of the family 1 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
my mother and brother had to do thiswhen i saw robert ryan portraying this type of man it was a very good imitation of this type of individual and i was impressed 1 
ive owned this phone for 7 months now and can say that its the best mobile phone ive had 1 
the jalapeno bacon is soooo good 1 
i am a fan of his this movie sucked really bad 0 
it was just too horrible 0 
great food and awesome service 1 
it didnt make me scared horrified or make me sympathetic towards the characters it was simply annoying 0 
its just lame 0 
same evening him and i are both drastically sick 0 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
great phone 1 
its very slow 0 
recommend with confidence 1 
the only downside is the service 0 
and considering the two of us left there very full and happy for about 20 you just cant go wrong 1 
service stinks here 0 
very disappointing 0 
no complaints 1 
one of the best mexican movies ever and one of the less understood even by mexican themselves no matter how identified the should have felt with it 1 
to sum the film up breeders is a terrible cheaply made horror movie that should be avoided like the ebola virus 0 
i think this restaurant suffers from not trying hard enough 0 
have been going since 2007 and every meal has been awesome 1 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
their steaks are 100 recommended 1 
avoid at all costs 0 
the show would begin with smart ass ed comments to each other that would be totally off the wall and uncalled for 0 
but the movie makes a lot of serious mistakes 0 
theres really nothing bad i can say about this headset 0 
ordered a double cheeseburger got a single patty that was falling apart picture uploaded yeah still sucks 0 
we asked for the bill to leave without eating and they didnt bring that either 0 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
strike 2 who wants to be rushed 0 
the movie was very interesting from beginning to the end 1 
just really good so far probably the best bt headset i have ever had 1 
great phone 1 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
nice sound 1 
its too bad the food is so damn generic 0 
i am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this 1 
the first thing that happened was that the tracking was off 0 
helen baxendale is a very credible lady macbeth who can be very cheerfull at times and sometimes she just looks like a naughty girl but deadly in her taste for blood and evil 1 
this is a great product sure beats using your fingers 1 
buttons are too small 0 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
not nearly as good looking as the amazon picture makes it look 0 
my rating just 3 out of 10 0 
buyerbe very careful 0 
battery lasts only a few hours 0 
product is useless since it does not have enough charging current to charge the 2 cellphones i was planning to use it with 0 
after a year the battery went completely dead on my headset 0 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
recommend with confidence 1 
the battery is unreliable as well as the service use antena 0 
to my disbelief each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods i have ever tasted 0 
its a feelgood film and thats how i felt when i came out of the cinema 1 
a great touch 1 
it was way over fried 0 
you also cannot take pictures with it in the case because the lense is covered 0 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
my first visit to hiro was a delight 1 
on the up side their cafe serves really good food 1 
everything about this product is wrongfirst 0 
it plays louder than any other speaker of this size the price is so low that most would think the quality is lacking however its not 1 
full of unconvincing cardboard characters it is blandly written by edward chodorov who also produced and is surprisingly directed by jean negulesco from whom one would expect a great deal more 0 
his performance as awarded was stunning 1 
will order from them again 1 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
the kids are very cool too 1 
the only consistent thread holding the series together were the amazing performances of leni parker and anita laselva as the two taelons in quiet idealogical conflict 0 
well never go again 0 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
so just beware 0 
fantastic food 1 
everything was good and tasty 1 
reversible plug works great 1 
tied to charger for conversations lasting more than 45 minutesmajor problems 0 
this place receives stars for their appetizers 1 
heres where the movie really pied me off 0 
nonlinear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well 1 
some highlights great quality nigiri here 1 
i recommend this for everyone who loves film movies anythinga work of art 1 
the waitress was friendly and happy to accomodate for veganveggie options 1 
it really is impressive that the place hasnt closed down 0 
warning stay away 0 
what on earth is irons doing in this film 0 
the ngage is still lacking in earbuds 0 
good quality 1 
their frozen margaritas are way too sugary for my taste 0 
we are sending it back 0 
just what i wanted 1 
i love all the features and form factor 1 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
it was so funny 1 
i believe every one should see this movie as i think few people outside of south africa understand its past and what is being attempted in the truth and reconciliation process 1 
it has all the features i want 1 
this is infuriating 0 
this is an excellent tool especially when paired with your phones autoanswer 1 
also the phone doesnt seem to accept anything except cbr mp3s preferably ripped by windows media player 0 
john wayne did an incredible job for being so young in the movie industry 1 
you cant beat that 1 
you get extra minutes so that you can carry out the call and not get cut off 1 
i love being able to use one headset for both by landline and cell 1 
everyone is very attentive providing excellent customer service 1 
say bye bye to your tip lady 0 
i am not a filmmaker nor am i a director but i would hide my head in the sand if id spent whatever amount of money and time on this movie 0 
it was just not a fun experience 1 
makes it easier to keep up with my bluetooth when im not wearing it 0 
great price also 1 
the problem was the script 0 
couldnt ask for a more satisfying meal 1 
if good intentions made a film great then this film might be one of the greatest films ever made 1 
ample portions and good prices 1 
a very very very slowmoving aimless movie about a distressed drifting young man 0 
it is wonderful and inspiring to watch and i hope that it gets released again on to video or dvd 1 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
still i do like this movie for its empowerment of women theres not enough movies out there like this one 1 
very tough and very short on flavor 0 
this early film from future goremeister lucio fulci is a very good addition to the giallo subgenre 1 
dont buy this product 0 
the burger is good beef cooked just right 1 
on the up side their cafe serves really good food 1 
i wont spoil it but the ending in pretty amazing 1 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
excellent starter wireless headset 0 
this allows the possibility of double booking for the same date and time after the first 0 
sounds good reasonably priced and effective its that simple 1 
the eargels channel the sound directly into your ear and seem to increase the sound volume and clarity 1 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
i recommend this for everyone who loves film movies anythinga work of art 1 
elias koteasjack palance play good roles angelina is hot and gets nakedbilly drago appears in this and is cool as usual a cameo by sven ole thorsen helps make this a very enjoyable movie with good acting and a decent budget 1 
perhaps i caught them on an off night judging by the other reviews but im not inspired to go back 0 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
if i take a picture the battery drops a bar and starts beeping letting me know its dieing 0 
reception is terrible and full of static 0 
headset works great was packaged nicely to avoid any damage 1 
any grandmother can make a roasted chicken better than this one 0 
have been going since 2007 and every meal has been awesome 1 
the writers were smack on and i think the best actors and actresses were a bonus to the showthese characters were so real 1 
i was shocked because no signs indicate cash only 0 
before i go in to why i gave a 1 star rating please know that this was my third time eating at bachi burger before writing a review 0 
better than new 1 
its welldesigned and very sharp the blue is a very nice color 1 
the volume for the ringer is real good you have choices how loud 1 
the construction of the headsets is poor 0 
i guess maybe we went on an off night but it was disgraceful 0 
their menu is diverse and reasonably priced 1 
tom wilkinson broke my heart at the end and everyone elses judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike 1 
its the best headset i have used 1 
wow what a bad film 0 
all in all an excellent restaurant highlighted by great service a unique menu and a beautiful setting 1 
the sides are delish mixed mushrooms yukon gold puree white corn beateous 1 
the cg opening sequence in space looked like it could have been created on microsoft slideshow for gods sake 0 
pretty awesome place 1 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
the cast of veteran actors are more than just a nostalgia trip 1 
its been my choice headset for yearsgreat sound good volume good noise cancellation 1 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
not a good item it worked for a while then started having problems in my auto reverse tape player 0 
you cant beat the price on these 1 
rude inconsiderate management 0 
it was awesome 1 
the best scene in the movie was when gerardo is trying to find a song that keeps running through his head 1 
it was an inexpensive piece but i would still have expected better quality 0 
ordered an appetizer and took 40 minutes and then the pizza another 10 minutes 0 
now imagine that every single one of those decisions was made wrong 0 
it is unusable in a moving car at freeway speed 0 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
the only place good for this film is in the garbage 0 
i just wanted to leave 0 
think of the film being like a dream 1 
good beer drink selection and good food selection 1 
wont ever go here again 0 
however i recently watched the whole thing again on dvd and i was completely struck by how extremely stupid the storyline was how it contained holes inconsistencies and frankly a whole lot of crap and how horrid the dancing was 0 
if you love authentic mexican food and want a whole bunch of interesting yet delicious meats to choose from you need to try this place 1 
and it was boring 0 
battery life is real good 1 
kris kristoffersen is good in this movie and really makes a difference 1 
it fits my ear well and is comfortable on 1 
dont waste your time here 0 
classywarm atmosphere fun and fresh appetizers succulent steaks baseball steak 1 
this is such a fun and funny movie 1 
i tried the cape cod ravoli chickenwith cranberrymmmm 1 
just whatever you do avoid groove as its the antithesis of all that is good about human traffic 0 
worst hour and a half of my lifeoh my gosh 0 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
gets the job done 1 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
great headset very impressed h500 1 
no im going to eat the potato that i found some strangers hair in it 0 
did not like at all 0 
seafood was limited to boiled shrimp and crab legs but the crab legs definitely did not taste fresh 0 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
a usable keyboard actually turns a pda into a realworld useful machine instead of just a neat gadget 1 
personally i think it shows that people should learn to find a compromise them self without involving other people into issue 1 
i cannot make calls at certain places 0 
definitely worth checking out 1 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
not worth it 0 
come hungry leave happy and stuffed 1 
tried to go here for lunch and it was a madhouse 0 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
dont go here 0 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
omit watching this 0 
i want to first say our server was great and we had perfect service 1 
just does not work 0 
the design is very good4 1 
you cant beat that 1 
i bought this battery with a coupon from amazon and im very happy with my purchase 1 
it was packed 0 
bluetooth does not work phone locks up screens just flash up and now it just makes calls randomly while in my pocket locked 0 
an amazing finale to possibly the best trilogy of all time 1 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
barney is definitely super de duper 1 
they have a plethora of salads and sandwiches and everything ive tried gets my seal of approval 1 
i was able to do voice dialing in the car with no problem 1 
my gyro was basically lettuce only 0 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
recommend with confidence 1 
the food was terrible 0 
disappointed 0 
but this movie is not funny considering the ridiculousness of it 0 
it finds my cell phone right away when i enter the car 1 
this is a very average phone with bad battery life that operates on a weak network 0 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
for a product that costs as much as this one does i expect it to work far better and with greater ease than this thing does 0 
this place is amazing 1 
there arent death scenes like in previous movies and the fx are terrible 0 
it is shameful 0 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
the selection on the menu was great and so were the prices 1 
disappointing experience 0 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
ive tried several different earpieces for my cell phone and this jabra one is the first one ive found that fits my ear comfortably 1 
it is a really good show to watch 1 
it is a joy to use 1 
i love all the features and form factor 1 
ive never been more insulted or felt disrespected 0 
almost all of the songs in cover girl are oldfashioned and not very tuneful 0 
its a fresh subtle and rather sublime effect 1 
thank you for wasting my money 0 
that one didnt work either 0 
it plays louder than any other speaker of this size the price is so low that most would think the quality is lacking however its not 1 
i love the pho and the spring rolls oh so yummy you have to try 1 
simply beautiful 1 
a piece of cinematic garbage captured on celluloid 0 
but when i check voice mail at night the keypad backlight turns off a few seconds into the first message and then im lost 0 
for that its worth checking out 1 
but it wasnt until i watched this film that i realised how great he actually was 1 
there still are good actors around 1 
excellent product 1 
trumbull on i love lucy 1 
what a piece of junk i lose more calls on this phone 0 
regrettably the film fails 0 
unfortunately it did not work 0 
this early film from future goremeister lucio fulci is a very good addition to the giallo subgenre 1 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
excellent hands free tool 1 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
the only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive 1 
not good by any stretch of the imagination 0 
also notable is john baileys fine crisp beautifully colored cinematography and the great production design costumes by eiko ishioka who went on to do the memorable costumes for coppolas dracula for which she received a well deserved oscar 1 
delicious and i will absolutely be back 1 
also if your phone is dropped this case is not going to save it specially when dropped face down 0 
sorry i will not be getting food from here anytime soon 0 
it was just too horrible 0 
this film has no redeeming features 0 
unfortunately inexperience of direction meant that scene after scene passed with little in the way of dramatic tension or conflict 0 
im translating movies for a living and this is the first movie in my 5year working experience that i found offensive to my intelligence 0 
absolutely great 1 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
works great 1 
service was exceptional and food was a good as all the reviews 1 
it does everything the description said it would 1 
very very fun chef 1 
the film is way too long 0 
will go back next trip out 1 
the chips and sals a here is amazing 1 
warning do not buy 0 
im returning them 0 
1 hour 54 minutes of sheer tedium melodrama and horrible acting a mess of a script and a sinking feeling of good lord what were they thinking 0 
any grandmother can make a roasted chicken better than this one 0 
a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it 1 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
the grilled chicken was so tender and yellow from the saffron seasoning 1 
this wonderful experience made this place a muststop whenever we are in town again 1 
couldnt ask for a more satisfying meal 1 
i liked this movie way too much 1 
to call this movie a drama is ridiculous 0 
i like armand assante my cable companys summary sounded interesting so i watched it twice already and probably will again 1 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
after all the rave reviews i couldnt wait to eat herewhat a disappointment 0 
interesting decor 1 
their research and development division obviously knows what theyre doing 1 
a truly truly bad film 0 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
i really wanted the plantronics 510 to be the right one but it has too many issues for methe good 0 
bt50 battery junk 0 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
watching washing machine twirling around wouldnt hurt your eyes as much as this show 0 
so badwellits just bad 0 
very very disappointed ordered the 35 big bay plater 0 
secondly hitchcock pretty much perfected the thriller and chase movie 1 
battery chargelife is quite long 1 
ive only had my bluetooth for a few weeks but i really like it 1 
im not sure what he was trying to do with this film 0 
gotta love those closeups of slimy drooling teeth 1 
it is super charged up for use as a small hybrid palmtopcameracellphone and excels in those roles 1 
camera color balance is awful 0 
the movie lacks visual interest drama expression of feeling and celebration of the very patriotism that underlines the narrative 0 
why are these sad little vegetables so overcooked 0 
there was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth but it didnt really work into the rest of the plot 0 
it was attached to a gas station and that is rarely a good sign 0 
the best place in vegas for breakfast just check out a sat or sun 1 
excellent sound battery life and inconspicuous to boot 1 
the fish is badly made and some of its underwater shots are repeated a thousand times in the film 0 
awesome selection of beer 1 
my 5year old nokia 2160 from tracfone holds the charge a lot better than this 0 
finally after three or four times the spring of the latch broke and i could not use it any longer on the visor 0 
very satisifed with that 1 
i am pairing this with my iphone and i could not be happier with it so far 1 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
you never know if you pushed it hard enough or the right number of times for the function you want or not 0 
all in all an excellent restaurant highlighted by great service a unique menu and a beautiful setting 1 
i love that they put their food in nice plastic containers as opposed to cramming it in little paper takeout boxes 1 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
very good though 1 
i have to use the smallest earpieces provided but it stays on pretty well 1 
spend your money elsewhere 0 
the scenes are often funny and occasionally touching as the characters evaluate their lives and where they are going 1 
tied to charger for conversations lasting more than 45 minutesmajor problems 0 
oh this is such a thing of beauty this restaurant 1 
headset works great was packaged nicely to avoid any damage 1 
i also didnt like the on button it felt like it would crack with use 0 
i have only had it for a few weeks but so far so good 1 
that just screams legit in my booksomethats also pretty rare here in vegas 1 
if good intentions made a film great then this film might be one of the greatest films ever made 1 
i hate those things as much as cheap quality black olives 0 
amazon sucks 0 
he was terrible 0 
after the disappointing dinner we went elsewhere for dessert 0 
this is a great product sure beats using your fingers 1 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
i wish i could return the unit and get back my money 0 
ill give this film 10 out of 10 1 
the characters are interesting and you really care for them 1 
this product had a strong rubberpetroleum smell that was unbearable after a while and caused me to return it 0 
ill give this film 10 out of 10 1 
so just beware 0 
this place is like chipotle but better 1 
the buffet at bellagio was far from what i anticipated 0 
i got home to see the driest damn wings ever 0 
phone falls out easily 0 
better than new 1 
we thought youd have to venture further away to get good sushi but this place really hit the spot that night 1 
mic doesnt work 0 
unreliable im giving up 0 
i wish i could return the unit and get back my money 0 
i paid the bill but did not tip because i felt the server did a terrible job 0 
this game rocks 1 
honeslty it didnt taste that fresh 0 
the microphone also works well but according to people i have called it applifies everything 1 
just really good so far probably the best bt headset i have ever had 1 
the burger i got the gold standard a 17 burger and was kind of disappointed 0 
i love that they put their food in nice plastic containers as opposed to cramming it in little paper takeout boxes 1 
the chefs were friendly and did a good job 1 
items stated as included from the description are not included 0 
worth every penny 1 
i think this restaurant suffers from not trying hard enough 0 
loved itfriendly servers great food wonderful and imaginative menu 1 
i guess that nobody at the network that aired this dribble watched it before putting it on 0 
battery chargelife is quite long 1 
its pretty easy 1 
everything was gross 0 
this game rocks 1 
the speaker is of low quality so as making the ring tones sound very cheap 0 
it was clear that she had the range and ability to pull off this part 1 
excellent hands free tool 1 
if you havent gone here go now 1 
the success of the film depends on the casting of sydney greenstreet as the alexander yardley character 1 
but i thought his acting was skilled 1 
friends pasta also bad he barely touched it 0 
a good time 1 
it showed exactly how the government and the scientist argued for humanity and the reasons of the gadget 1 
this movie has a cutting edge to it 1 
appetite instantly gone 0 
the story is beyond stupid 0 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
seller shipped quickly and much cheaper than the competitors 1 
the vegetables are so fresh and the sauce feels like authentic thai 1 
insults profound deuchebaggery and had to go outside for a smoke break while serving just to solidify it 0 
awsome device works great 1 
my order was not correct 0 
i am a fan of his this movie sucked really bad 0 
made very sturdy 1 
wonderful lil tapas and the ambience made me feel all warm and fuzzy inside 1 
join the club and get awesome offers via email 1 
dont bother coming here 0 
not even good for camp value 0 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
my experience was terrible this was my fourth bluetooth headset and while it was much more comfortable than my last jabra which i hated 0 
it was also the right balance of war and love 1 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
i am sorry i made this purchase 0 
battery lasts only a few hours 0 
a good quality bargain i bought this after i bought a cheapy from big lots that sounded awful and people on the other end couldnt hear me 1 
the turkey and roast beef were bland 0 
the worst one of the series 0 
i felt asleep the first time i watched it so i can recommend it for insomniacs 0 
i would give this television series a 10 plus if i could 1 
of course the footage from the 70s was grainy but that only enhanced the film 1 
i have to mention this and it is a huge spoiler i loved the ending how all the characters of the three films were the remaining survivors of the ferry disaster with valentine and the young judge together and the old man watching it on her tv solidifying his happiness over the suffering which he dealt with for those many years 1 
id love to go back 1 
did not like at all 0 
this is one of peter watkins most accessible films 1 
the ngage is still lacking in earbuds 0 
i as well wouldve given godfathers zero stars if possible 0 
performed awful muffled tinny incoming sound and severe echo for those on the other end of the call 0 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
service was very prompt 1 
i have been in more than a few bars in vegas and do not ever recall being charged for tap water 0 
they dropped more than the ball 0 
also the area where my unit broke im not too fond of the magnetic strap 0 
thanks again to amazon for having the things i need for a good price 1 
the worst phone ive ever had only had it for a few months 0 
i liked the patio and the service was outstanding 1 
not much dialogue not much music the whole film was shot as elaborately and aesthetically like a sculpture 1 
raw and sublimely moving 1 
dont bother go to the store 0 
1010 1 
they do not care about the consumer one bit 0 
performed awful muffled tinny incoming sound and severe echo for those on the other end of the call 0 
cheap but hey it works was pleasantly suprised given the low cost of this item 1 
the construction of the headsets is poor 0 
the battery runs down quickly 0 
i wont be back 0 
the story unfolds in 18th century jutland and the use of period music played on period instruments is just one more fine touch 1 
perfect for someone me who only likes beer ice cold or in this case even colder 1 
the show would begin with smart ass ed comments to each other that would be totally off the wall and uncalled for 0 
the handsfree part works fine but then the car tries to download the address book and the treo rebootsoverall i still rate this device high 1 
of all the dishes the salmon was the best but all were great 1 
both do good jobs and are quite amusing 1 
i get absolutely horrible reception in my apartment where with other phones i have not had this problem 0 
this is a great product sure beats using your fingers 1 
the aerial scenes were welldone 1 
the story is beyond stupid 0 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
the greek dressing was very creamy and flavorful 1 
all it took was one drop from about 6 inches above the kitchen counter and it was crackedi am not impressed and i am not laughing 0 
restaurant is always full but never a wait 1 
not good enough for the price 0 
battery has no life 0 
also the phone doesnt seem to accept anything except cbr mp3s preferably ripped by windows media player 0 
avoid this one if you can 0 
people who like european films and art movies will like this movie 1 
better than youd expect 1 
they have horrible attitudes towards customers and talk down to each one when customers dont enjoy their food 0 
the sangria was about half of a glass wine full and was 12 ridiculous 0 
great place to eat reminds me of the little mom and pop shops in the san francisco bay area 1 
the cg opening sequence in space looked like it could have been created on microsoft slideshow for gods sake 0 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
the only thing that i think could improve is the sound leaks out from the headset 0 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
the fact is this film is a wonderful heartwarming tale about two people chasing their dreams 1 
i bought two of them and neither will charge 0 
the battery is completely useless to me 0 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
not what i wanted 0 
to be honest with you this is unbelievable nonsense and very foolish 0 
this is one of the best italian thrillers of the early 70s 1 
absolutely great 1 
this company charge me a restocking fee and still not given me my refund back 0 
worst thai ever 0 
the film is well paced understated and one of the best courtroom documentaries ive seen 1 
theres really nothing bad i can say about this headset 0 
unreliable im giving up 0 
emily watsons character is very strong and she has only to give a quick glance and you understand everything 1 
watching washing machine twirling around wouldnt hurt your eyes as much as this show 0 
its pure brilliance 1 
our server was super nice and checked on us many times 1 
it was just not a fun experience 1 
plug was the wrong size 0 
highly entertaining at all angles 1 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
i will not return 0 
a bit predictable 0 
level 5 spicy was perfect where spice didnt overwhelm the soup 1 
its just painful 0 
why was this film made 0 
worst foodservice ive had in a while 0 
i still maintain that monkeys shouldnt make headphones we just obviously dont share enough dna to copy the design over to humans 0 
the story unfolds in 18th century jutland and the use of period music played on period instruments is just one more fine touch 1 
unfortunately the ability to actually know you are receiving a call is a rather important feature and this phone is pitiful in that respect 0 
my gyro was basically lettuce only 0 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
highquality chicken on the chicken caesar salad 1 
first time there and might just be the last 0 
the interplay between martin and emilio contains the same wonderful chemistry we saw in wall street with martin and charlie 1 
whatever the producer was going for he missed entirely 0 
to be honest with you this is unbelievable nonsense and very foolish 0 
this is a beautiful phone 1 
everything from acting to cinematography was solid 1 
all the pretty pictures in the world cannot make up for a piece of work that is flawed at the core 0 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
i want to first say our server was great and we had perfect service 1 
took an hour to get our food only 4 tables in restaurant my food was luke warm our sever was running around like he was totally overwhelmed 0 
5 stars for the brick oven bread app 1 
this is a great little item 1 
i got to enjoy the seafood salad with a fabulous vinegrette 1 
their menu is diverse and reasonably priced 1 
my boyfriend and i came here for the first time on a recent trip to vegas and could not have been more pleased with the quality of food and service 1 
food was average at best 0 
what makes this story different are the terrific production values faultless photography composition and editing the terrific casting the underappreciated brian keith playing a bully teddy and vivid history 1 
their rotating beers on tap is also a highlight of this place 1 
the only consistent thread holding the series together were the amazing performances of leni parker and anita laselva as the two taelons in quiet idealogical conflict 0 
works great 1 
there is no plot or storyline 0 
too politically correct 0 
very nice and relaxing late night viewing 1 
i mean really how do you get so famous for your fish and chips when its so terrible 0 
yes its that bad 0 
yeah the movie pretty much sucked 0 
it didnt make me scared horrified or make me sympathetic towards the characters it was simply annoying 0 
if you havent gone here go now 1 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
very disappointing 0 
im so happy to be here 1 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
the point is the journey a journey that touches every member of the family 1 
we enjoy their pizza and brunch 1 
we wont be returning 0 
will order from them again 1 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
they know how to make them here 1 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
the kids are annoying 0 
it came free with a dvd player i bought but i still turned the thing off halfway through because i was embarrassed for howell 0 
it was either too cold not enough flavor or just bad 0 
so there is no way for me to plug it in here in the us unless i go by a converter 0 
great phone 1 
it was a drive to get there 0 
also its slim enough to fit into my alarm clock docking station without removing the case 1 
that one didnt work either 0 
if you do go see this movie bring a pillow or a girlfriendboyfriend to keep you occupied through out 0 
highly unprofessional and rude to a loyal patron 0 
so flavorful and has just the perfect amount of heat 1 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
worthless product 0 
i hate those things as much as cheap quality black olives 0 
that was nice 1 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
con spotty service 0 
worth every penny 1 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
love this product 1 
my sanyo has survived dozens of drops on blacktop without ill effect 1 
up there with the best of melville 1 
the cashier had no care what so ever on what i had to say it still ended up being wayyy overpriced 0 
2 thumbs up 1 
the cow tongue and cheek tacos are amazing 1 
only had this a month but its worked flawlessly so far 1 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
the worst piece of crap ever along with the verizon customer service 0 
i wish i could return the unit and get back my money 0 
excellent 1 
we had 7 at our table and the service was pretty fast 1 
it didnt work people can not hear me when i talk 0 
things that went wrong they burned the saganaki 0 
i have recommended it to friends 1 
i definitly recommend 1 
im translating movies for a living and this is the first movie in my 5year working experience that i found offensive to my intelligence 0 
even the squibs look awful 0 
a happy wonderful feel good ending 1 
you wont forget this movie 1 
this battery is an excellent bargain 1 
made very sturdy 1 
this is the phone to get for 2005 i just bought my s710a and all i can say is wow 1 
superb phone on a great network 1 
wow very spicy but delicious 1 
its pure brilliance 1 
in fact this stinker smells like a directtovideo release 0 
say bye bye to your tip lady 0 
just really good so far probably the best bt headset i have ever had 1 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
but the convoluted plot just didnt convince me and much of the film was watched with a weird questioning glance 0 
the story unfolds in 18th century jutland and the use of period music played on period instruments is just one more fine touch 1 
doesnt work at all i bougth it for my l7c and its not working 0 
doesnt last long 0 
easy to pair with my samsung cell 1 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
good price 1 
im not sure how long we stood there but it was long enough for me to begin to feel awkwardly out of place 0 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
works good 1 
the acting from all involved and that includes those like shatner and nimoy is bad and washed out and making them seem as old as they look in real life the special effects are tacky like when spock has to rescue kirk on a jet pack when he falls down from a mountain 0 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
we had 7 at our table and the service was pretty fast 1 
and the sound quality is great 1 
chinese forgeries abound 0 
what should have been a hilarious yummy christmas eve dinner to remember was the biggest fail of the entire trip for us 0 
graphics is far from the best part of the game 0 
i highly recommend this modest priced cellular phone 1 
very convenient since we were staying at the mgm 1 
there was no chemistry between ben affleck and sandra bullock in this film and i couldnt understand why he would consider even leaving his wifetobe for this chick that he supposedly was knocked out by 0 
over rated 0 
it is zillion times away from reality 0 
this is high adventure at its best 1 
but i thought his acting was skilled 1 
at first i thought i was grtting a good deal at 744 until i plugged it into my phone v3c razr 0 
it features an outlandish array of memorable psychotic but lovable nuts 1 
highly entertaining at all angles 1 
the best place in vegas for breakfast just check out a sat or sun 1 
dont make the same mistake that i did and please dont buy this phone 0 
the selection on the menu was great and so were the prices 1 
will order from them again 1 
the film succeeds despite or perhaps because of an obviously meagre budget 1 
the food is good 1 
the films sole bright spot was jonah hill who will look almost unrecognizable to fans of the recent superbad due to the amount of weight he lost in the interim 1 
i was not impressed by this product 0 
same evening him and i are both drastically sick 0 
i found a six inch long piece of wire in my salsa 0 
we have gotten a lot of compliments on it 1 
the plot has more holes than a pair of fishnet stockings and the direction and editing is astonishingly ham fisted 0 
absolutel junk 0 
i have had problems wit hit dropping signal and more 0 
its a shame to see good actors like thomerson and james make a living in a mess like this 0 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
what a disappointment 0 
not much flavor to them and very poorly constructed 0 
not much dialogue not much music the whole film was shot as elaborately and aesthetically like a sculpture 1 
the majority of the logitech earbud headsets failed 0 
i have seen many movies starring jaclyn smith but my god this was one of her best though it came out 12 years ago 1 
best ive found so far ive tried 2 other bluetooths and this one has the best quality for both me and the listener as well as ease of using 1 
hence the whole story lacks a certain energy 0 
this is truly an art movieit actually has a lot of art in it 1 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
its a great item 1 
the story is lame not interesting and never really explains the sinister origins of the puppets 0 
all it took was one drop from about 6 inches above the kitchen counter and it was crackedi am not impressed and i am not laughing 0 
good quality 1 
you wont forget this movie 1 
everything about this film is simply incredible 1 
loved the casting of jimmy buffet as the science teacher 1 
just whatever you do avoid groove as its the antithesis of all that is good about human traffic 0 
spoilers whatever else can or cant be said about it surface is superbly crafted 1 
the whole experience was underwhelming and i think well just go to ninja sushi next time 0 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
fantastic buy and will get again for whatever my next phone is 1 
this product is great it makes working a lot easier i can go to the copier while waiting on hold for something 1 
it was awesome 1 
crust is not good 0 
this is definitely one of the better documentaries i have seen looking at family relationships and marriage 1 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
i even fully charged it before i went to bed and turned off blue tooth and wifi and noticed that it only had 20 left in the morning 0 
four stars for the food the guy in the blue shirt for his great vibe still letting us in to eat 1 
fantastic buy and will get again for whatever my next phone is 1 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
i love this cable it allows me to connect any miniusb device to my pc 1 
i thought it was bad 0 
wonderful lil tapas and the ambience made me feel all warm and fuzzy inside 1 
love it great armband 1 
kind of flops around 0 
comes with a strong light that you can use to light up your camera shots and even flash sos signals seriously 1 
this one works and was priced right 1 
i am so pleased to know such a modern day genius is out there letting is passion for art drive him and taking us as an audience with him 1 
it looks very nice 1 
crust is not good 0 
i hate those things as much as cheap quality black olives 0 
what on earth is irons doing in this film 0 
and the rest of it just sits there being awful with soldiers singing songs about the masculinity they pledge themselves to hairsplitting about purity the admiration of swords etc 0 
the buttons for on and off are bad 0 
my boyfriend tried the mediterranean chicken salad and fell in love 1 
john wayne did an incredible job for being so young in the movie industry 1 
the movie has almost no action scenes in it and very little comedy 0 
for the price this was a great deal 1 
this pda rocks 1 
we watched our waiter pay a lot more attention to other tables and ignore us 0 
verizons bills however are difficult to understand even though their pricing plans are simple 0 
again lame 0 
best tacos in town by far 1 
and the chef was generous with his time even came around twice so we can take pictures with him 1 
appetite instantly gone 0 
perhaps i caught them on an off night judging by the other reviews but im not inspired to go back 0 
the kids are annoying 0 
the bottowm lineanother worthless cheap gimmick from sprint 0 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
i enjoyed reading this book to my children when they were little 1 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
for a product that costs as much as this one does i expect it to work far better and with greater ease than this thing does 0 
this is actually a very smart movie 1 
these are the nicest restaurant owners ive ever come across 1 
the food was terrible 0 
soyo technology sucks 0 
i thought it was bad 0 
the tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu 0 
it only recognizes the phone as its storage device 0 
this is was due to the fact that it took 20 minutes to be acknowledged then another 35 minutes to get our foodand they kept forgetting things 0 
att is not clear sound is very distorted and you have to yell when you talk 0 
wonderful lil tapas and the ambience made me feel all warm and fuzzy inside 1 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
the chips and salsa were really good the salsa was very fresh 1 
director paul matthews who also wrotedirected the weak 1995 monster movie grim clearly doesnt know how to pace his films 0 
it is cheap and it feel and look just as cheap 0 
good works fine 1 
unreliable im giving up 0 
great audio 1 
ive had no trouble accessing the internet downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions 1 
the characters are interesting and you really care for them 1 
it is indescribably the most annoying and idiotic show i have ever seen 0 
but now that it is out of warranty the same problems reoccurebottom line put your money somewhere else cingular will not support it 0 
the bottowm lineanother worthless cheap gimmick from sprint 0 
however bt headsets are currently not good for real time games like firstperson shooters since the audio delay messes me up 0 
beautiful styling though 1 
i am a fan of his this movie sucked really bad 0 
there are the usual hitchcock logic flaws 0 
both rickman and stowe play their roles to the hilt in this tale of a childrens book writer who maybe has written a subversive tract 1 
there were too many close ups 0 
logitech bluetooth headset is a 10 1 
the ending is so so perfect youll shed a tear 1 
i love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it 1 
none of it works just dont buy it 0 
its just painful 0 
with great sound effects and impressive special effects i cant recommend this movie enough 1 
nice case feels good in your hands 1 
their steaks are 100 recommended 1 
however after seeing the short again after about 25 years i was amazed at how timeless the film actually is 1 
works great 1 
the noise shield is incrediable 1 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
also the fries are without a doubt the worst fries ive ever had 0 
this is just a great movie 1 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
one of the best mexican movies ever and one of the less understood even by mexican themselves no matter how identified the should have felt with it 1 
great movie 1 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
too politically correct 0 
both do good jobs and are quite amusing 1 
the turkey and roast beef were bland 0 
what a waste of money and time 0 
awsome device works great 1 
i tried talking real loud but shouting on the telephone gets old and i was still told it wasnt great 0 
not much dialogue not much music the whole film was shot as elaborately and aesthetically like a sculpture 1 
never got it 0 
id say that would be the hardest decision honestly all of ms dishes taste how they are supposed to taste amazing 1 
disappointed with battery 0 
why are these sad little vegetables so overcooked 0 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
by the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant i was bored and didnt care what happened next and so i switched off 0 
kris kristoffersen is good in this movie and really makes a difference 1 
i liked this movie way too much 1 
third the cheese on my friends burger was cold 0 
id advise anyone to go and see it 1 
i dont each much pasta but i love the homemade hand made pastas and thin pizzas here 1 
the fried rice was dry as well 0 
this wonderful experience made this place a muststop whenever we are in town again 1 
the waiter wasnt helpful or friendly and rarely checked on us 0 
i had a pretty satifying experience 1 
the food came out at a good pace 1 
very dissapointing performance 0 
we definately enjoyed ourselves 1 
avoid this film at all costs 0 
no plot whatsoever 0 
however after finally watching this film i realized that not only had i had a closed mind to the brilliance it depicts i also found myself watching it over and over again 1 
i love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it 1 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
the aerial scenes were welldone 1 
highly recommend for any one who has a blue tooth phone 1 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
it is an hour and half waste of time following a bunch of very pretty high schoolers whine and cry about life 0 
you cant go wrong with any of the food here 1 
meredith m was better than all right 1 
i can barely ever hear on it and am constantly saying what 0 
its hard not to fall headoverheels in love with that girl 1 
i enjoyed reading this book to my children when they were little 1 
lately they have been extremely nice and helpful on the phone 1 
yes i am simplifying things here for the sake of brevity for this really is at the core of the problems with this film it has too much going on without any real fulfilling explanation 0 
loved the casting of jimmy buffet as the science teacher 1 
if good intentions made a film great then this film might be one of the greatest films ever made 1 
its too bad the food is so damn generic 0 
theres barely a boring moment in the film and there are plenty of humorous parts 1 
updatewent back for a second time and it was still just as amazing 1 
the battery runs down quickly 0 
it was so funny 1 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
host staff were for lack of a better word bitches 0 
its worth driving up from tucson 1 
i started this review with two stars but im editing it to give it only one 0 
dont buy this product 0 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
i immediately said i wanted to talk to the manager but i did not want to talk to the guy who was doing shots of fireball behind the bar 0 
i gave it 5 stars because of the sound quality 1 
does everything it should and more 1 
save your money ive had this item for 11 months now 0 
the films dialogue is natural real to life 1 
the manager was the worst 0 
meredith m was better than all right 1 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
it has been a winner for us 1 
the microphone also works well but according to people i have called it applifies everything 1 
i have tried these cables with my computer and my ipod and it works just fine 1 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
the fact is this film is a wonderful heartwarming tale about two people chasing their dreams 1 
we also ordered the spinach and avocado salad the ingredients were sad and the dressing literally had zero taste 0 
cinematography noteworthy including fine views of barcelona and its famed gaudi towers 1 
happy so far 1 
items stated as included from the description are not included 0 
a piece of cinematic garbage captured on celluloid 0 
say bye bye to your tip lady 0 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
as many people complained i found this headsets microphone was very weak 0 
mediocre food 0 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
then i had to continue pairing it periodically since it somehow kept dropping 0 
sam shepards portrayal of a gung ho marine was sobering 1 
a great film by a great director 1 
horrible dont waste your time and money 0 
hard to judge whether these sides were good because we were grossed out by the melted styrofoam and didnt want to eat it for fear of getting sick 0 
very bad performance plays angela bennett a computer expert who is at home all the time 0 
the ri style calamari was a joke 0 
i saw it as a child on tv back in 1973 when it was the stranger and i loved it 1 
id like to return it 0 
we had so much to say about the place before we walked in that he expected it to be amazing but was quickly disappointed 0 
i cant use this case because the smell is disgusting 0 
everything about this product is wrongfirst 0 
but it does get better reception and clarity than any phone ive had before 1 
disappointed with battery 0 
a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it 1 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
lasted one day and then blew up 0 
this movie is a good and humorous comment on life in 2006 1 
i started this review with two stars but im editing it to give it only one 0 
dont make the same mistake that i did and please dont buy this phone 0 
waste of money 0 
i will not return 0 
main thing i didnt enjoy is that the crowd is of older crowd around mid 30s and up 0 
waste your money on this game 1 
incredible 1 
setup couldnt have been simpler 1 
their daily specials are always a hit with my group 1 
the menu is always changing food quality is going down service is extremely slow 0 
nargile i think you are great 1 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
not as good as i had hoped 0 
the movie lacks visual interest drama expression of feeling and celebration of the very patriotism that underlines the narrative 0 
it kept getting worse and worse so now im officially done 0 
for a self proclaimed coffee cafe i was wildly disappointed 0 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
i do think tom hanks is a good actor 1 
there was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters 0 
the real disappointment was our waiter 0 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
basically the service was very bad 0 
interesting decor 1 
good item low price 1 
our server was very nice and even though he looked a little overwhelmed with all of our needs he stayed professional and friendly until the end 1 
i will not return 0 
i have two more years left in this contract and i hate this phone 0 
it is not good 0 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
the films dialogue is natural real to life 1 
the seller is very understanding and patient i would definitely buy from them again 1 
this place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver 0 
the food was excellent and service was very good 1 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
it does everything the description said it would 1 
this place is pretty good nice little vibe in the restaurant 1 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
after i pulled up my car i waited for another 15 minutes before being acknowledged 0 
drinks took close to 30 minutes to come out at one point 0 
john garfield ann revere lilli plmer william conrad canada leeand filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screenjames wong howe 1 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
although i very much liked the look and sound of this place the actual experience was a bit disappointing 0 
disappointed 0 
dont waste your money 0 
we watched our waiter pay a lot more attention to other tables and ignore us 0 
waaaaaayyyyyyyyyy over rated is all i am saying 0 
this is an outstanding little restaurant with some of the best food i have ever tasted 1 
ray charles life provided excellent biographical material for the film which goes well beyond being just another movie about a musician 1 
the nachos are a must have 1 
it was way over fried 0 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
love this phone 1 
obviously they have a terrible customer service so you get what you pay for 0 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
editing the editing of this film was phenomenal in my opinion 1 
not worth it 0 
if you hate earbugs avoid this phone by all means 0 
this is infuriating 0 
just spicy enough perfect actually 1 
my sashimi was poor quality being soggy and tasteless 0 
its a great item 1 
if you are razr owneryou must have this 1 
also the phone doesnt seem to accept anything except cbr mp3s preferably ripped by windows media player 0 
some highlights great quality nigiri here 1 
i was deeply impressed with the character he played 1 
friends pasta also bad he barely touched it 0 
it is an hour and half waste of time following a bunch of very pretty high schoolers whine and cry about life 0 
i felt insulted and disrespected how could you talk and judge another human being like that 0 
no real improvement 0 
i can think of no other film where something vitally important occurs every other minute 1 
i really dont see how anyone could enjoy this movie 0 
2 thumbs up to this seller 1 
it is well made easy to access the phone and has a handy detachable belt clip 1 
the fish is badly made and some of its underwater shots are repeated a thousand times in the film 0 
again lame 0 
not enough volume 0 
gets a signal when other verizon phones wont 1 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
i find this inexcusable and so will probably be returning this phone and perhaps changing carriers 0 
this movie is bad 0 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
this is a great deal 1 
the cast was great 1 
good service very clean and inexpensive to boot 1 
very very disappointed ordered the 35 big bay plater 0 
the acting was bad the dialogs were extremely shallow and insincere 0 
very comfortable 1 
i had to wait over 30 minutes to get my drink and longer to get 2 arepas 0 
great atmosphere friendly and fast service 1 
it didnt make me scared horrified or make me sympathetic towards the characters it was simply annoying 0 
i would recommend it 1 
also its a real treat to see anthony quinn playing crazy horse 1 
dont miss it 1 
it felt like a very gripping intelligent stage play but without the overly theatrical feeling one actually gets from watching people on a stage which plays on everyones terror of a white lie escalating to monstrous consequences 1 
if this premise sound stupid thats because it is 0 
we ordered the duck rare and it was pink and tender on the inside with a nice char on the outside 1 
we definately enjoyed ourselves 1 
while i managed to bend the leaf spring back in place the metal now has enough stress that it will break on the next drop 0 
ive bought 5 wired headphones that sound better than these 0 
this is one of the best italian thrillers of the early 70s 1 
the best place to go for a tasty bowl of pho 1 
unfortunately this is a bad movie that is just plain bad 0 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
in my house i was getting dropped coverage upstairs and no coverage in my basement 0 
however i recently watched the whole thing again on dvd and i was completely struck by how extremely stupid the storyline was how it contained holes inconsistencies and frankly a whole lot of crap and how horrid the dancing was 0 
omg the food was delicioso 1 
in the span of an hour i had two people exclaim whoa is that the new phone on tv 1 
we waited an hour for what was a breakfast i could have done 100 times better at home 0 
at no point in the proceedings does it look remotely like america 0 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
w810i is just superb 1 
i was particularly pleased with the acting ability of dwight schultz 1 
the seller is very understanding and patient i would definitely buy from them again 1 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
very poor service 0 
it clicks into place in a way that makes you wonder how long that mechanism would last 0 
the scenes are often funny and occasionally touching as the characters evaluate their lives and where they are going 1 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
at first i thought i was grtting a good deal at 744 until i plugged it into my phone v3c razr 0 
its aggravating 0 
reception is terrible and full of static 0 
it even has its sweet moments 1 
will not be back 0 
if it were possible to give them zero stars theyd have it 0 
item does not match picture 0 
their chow mein is so good 1 
highly recommended a 1 
nothing at all to recommend 0 
he was terrible 0 
good value great food great service 1 
worst customer service ever 0 
the telephone repair man was really funny and his reactions to the nuts and bitchy boss were truly genuine 1 
i am sorry i made this purchase 0 
your brain will attempt to shutdown as part of a primal impulse of selfpreservation 0 
what a waste of time 0 
i love the look and feel of samsung flipphones 1 
also its slim enough to fit into my alarm clock docking station without removing the case 1 
the ambiance was incredible 1 
seriously killer hot chai latte 1 
sorry i will not be getting food from here anytime soon 0 
the script is bad very bad  it contains both cheesiness and unethical joke that you normally see in rated r or nc17 movie 0 
if you hate earbugs avoid this phone by all means 0 
warning stay away 0 
dee snider just plain sucks 0 
the loudspeaker option is great the bumpers with the lights is very appealing 0 
good value great food great service 1 
i found this move beautiful enjoyable and uplifting 1 
ill be looking for a new earpiece 0 
service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is vegas and located inside the crystals shopping mall by aria 1 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
my boyfriend tried the mediterranean chicken salad and fell in love 1 
despite how hard i rate businesses its actually rare for me to give a 1 star 0 
it felt too light and tinny 0 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
no plot whatsoever 0 
anyway the plot flowed smoothly and the malebonding scenes were a hoot 1 
this greedy corporation will never see another dime from me 0 
im still trying to get over how bad it was 0 
food was really boring 0 
this was one of the worst films i have ever seen 0 
the plot has more holes than a pair of fishnet stockings and the direction and editing is astonishingly ham fisted 0 
well never go again 0 
i didnt know pulled pork could be soooo delicious 1 
no ear loop needed its tiny and the sound is great 1 
for a self proclaimed coffee cafe i was wildly disappointed 0 
restored my phone to like new performance 1 
special thanks to dylan t for the recommendation on what to order all yummy for my tummy 1 
this is a witty and delightful adaptation of the dr seuss book brilliantly animated by upas finest and thoroughly deserving of its academy award 1 
then theres the plot holes 0 
best headset ever 1 
the story itself is just predictable and lazy 0 
the jalapeno bacon is soooo good 1 
this is a chilly unremarkable movie about an author livingworking in a chilly abstruse culture 0 
great service and food 1 
its not what it says it is 0 
i had a pretty satifying experience 1 
i rate this movie 910 1 
there is no plot here to keep you going in the first place 0 
was not happy 0 
highly recommended a 1 
they work about 2 weeks then break 0 
an extensive menu provides lots of options for breakfast 1 
really really good rice all the time 1 
its very slow 0 
yet i enjoy watching it 1 
great phone 1 
best tater tots in the southwest 1 
do not make the same mistake as me 0 
very good phone 1 
i will not be eating there again 0 
disapointing results 0 
the explosion of the gas tanks at the end was just as awful 0 
def coming back to bowl next time 1 
it was horrible 0 
the point is the journey a journey that touches every member of the family 1 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
there are massive levels massive unlockable characters its just a massive game 1 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
i came back today since they relocated and still not impressed 0 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
i could eat their bruschetta all day it is devine 1 
everything on the menu is terrific and we were also thrilled that they made amazing accommodations for our vegetarian daughter 1 
o my gosh the best phone i have ever had 1 
so good i am going to have to review this place twice once hereas a tribute to the place and once as a tribute to an event held here last night 1 
poor sound quality 0 
after i pulled up my car i waited for another 15 minutes before being acknowledged 0 
my boyfriend tried the mediterranean chicken salad and fell in love 1 
i couldnt think of a better way to end the film but a smile on my face great way to wrap up an amazing film and trilogy 1 
this particular model would not work with my motorola q smartphone 0 
this is one of the best movies out there that shows such strong sibling bond for each other 1 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
the yellowtail carpaccio was melt in your mouth fresh 1 
omit watching this 0 
first of all there are enough racial stereotypes and racial jokes to offend everyone 0 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
unfortunately we must have hit the bakery on leftover day because everything we ordered was stale 0 
great for the jawbone 1 
for sushi on the strip this is the place to go 1 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
the han nan chicken was also very tasty 1 
krussel always good 1 
this is a good joint 1 
everything about this product is wrongfirst 0 
its extremely slow and takes forever to do anything with it 0 
great place to relax and have an awesome burger and beer 1 
avoid this film at all costs 0 
a greasy unhealthy meal 0 
so flavorful and has just the perfect amount of heat 1 
i use this product in a motor control center where there is a lot of high voltage humming from the equipment and it works great 1 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
regardless the film fails on most levels 0 
ill put this gem up against any movie in terms of screenplay cinematography acting postproduction editing directing or any other aspect of filmmaking 1 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
this is the phone to get for 2005 i just bought my s710a and all i can say is wow 1 
happy so far 1 
excellent hands free tool 1 
this scene is very strong and unpleasant 0 
its a piece of crap 0 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
anyways the food was definitely not filling at all and for the price you pay you should expect more 0 
the warmth it generates is in contrast to its austere backdrop 1 
it fits so securely that the ear hook does not even need to be used and the sound is better directed through your ear canal 1 
i have two more years left in this contract and i hate this phone 0 
i found a six inch long piece of wire in my salsa 0 
great for ipods too 1 
i sat riveted to the tv screen 1 
not sure who was more lost the flat characters or the audience nearly half of whom walked out 0 
as always the evening was wonderful and the food delicious 1 
this early film from future goremeister lucio fulci is a very good addition to the giallo subgenre 1 
very poor service 0 
actually the graphics were good at the time 1 
the characters were all funny and had the peculiarity of not having a true lead character 1 
then a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use 0 
it works 1 
i consider this theft 0 
fantastic food 1 
unfortunately it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees 0 
good show samsung 1 
definitely not worth the 3 i paid 0 
what a great double cheeseburger 1 
it is an insane game 1 
the movie has almost no action scenes in it and very little comedy 0 
jabra ear gels r the best 1 
at no point in the proceedings does it look remotely like america 0 
i definitly recommend 1 
this is a witty and delightful adaptation of the dr seuss book brilliantly animated by upas finest and thoroughly deserving of its academy award 1 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
it has a great camera thats 2mp and the pics are nice and clear with great picture quality 1 
awesome selection of beer 1 
i have seen many movies starring jaclyn smith but my god this was one of her best though it came out 12 years ago 1 
there still are good actors around 1 
every element of this story was so over the top excessively phony and contrived that it was painful to sit through 0 
both films are terrible but to the credit of the 1986 version it was watchable 0 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
there was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters 0 
the results well are a shame 0 
its a great item 1 
the cinematographyif it can be called thatsucked 0 
its an empty hollow shell of a movie 0 
20th century foxs road house 1948 is not only quite a silly noir but is an implausible unmitigated bore of a movie 0 
shes poised and amazing 1 
he really didnt seem to want to be hosting his voiceovers were monotonous didnt get involved with the guests 0 
the cast was great 1 
ive bought 5 wired headphones that sound better than these 0 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
a good film by a great director 1 
the lead man is charismafree 0 
it was packed 0 
the delivery was on time 1 
its the best headset i have used 1 
well packaged arrived on time and works as intended 1 
the food was terrible 0 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
of course the acting is blah 0 
tom wilkinson broke my heart at the end and everyone elses judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike 1 
i bought two of them and neither will charge 0 
as for the service im a fan because its quick and youre being served by some nice folks 1 
i find this inexcusable and so will probably be returning this phone and perhaps changing carriers 0 
keep up the good work amazon 1 
my brother in law who works at the mall ate here same day and guess what he was sick all night too 0 
my boyfriend and i came here for the first time on a recent trip to vegas and could not have been more pleased with the quality of food and service 1 
i got to enjoy the seafood salad with a fabulous vinegrette 1 
great steak great sides great wine amazing desserts 1 
it fits so securely that the ear hook does not even need to be used and the sound is better directed through your ear canal 1 
horrible 0 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
verizon tech support walked my through a few procedures none of which worked and i ended up having to do a hard reset wiping out all my data 0 
this is cool because most cases are just open there allowing the screen to get all scratched up 1 
you could drive a semi truck into these holes 0 
the restaurant atmosphere was exquisite 1 
those phones are working just fine now 1 
the cast was great 1 
it really is impressive that the place hasnt closed down 0 
i just wanted to leave 0 
warning do not buy 0 
this place is awesome if you want something light and healthy during the summer 1 
i saw this short film on hbo the other day and absolutely loved it 1 
highly entertaining at all angles 1 
actually the graphics were good at the time 1 
just really good so far probably the best bt headset i have ever had 1 
nice docking station for home or work 1 
a bit predictable 0 
fantastic service here 1 
the fries were great too 1 
im terribly disappointed that this film would receive so many awards and accolades especially when there are far more deserving works of film out there 0 
very displeased 0 
i came over from verizon because cingulair has nicer cell phones the first thing i noticed was the really bad service 0 
the cg opening sequence in space looked like it could have been created on microsoft slideshow for gods sake 0 
the attempts at humor were pitiful and story is so awful it dosent bear thinking about which basically involves a vulcan stealing the enterprise to find god seriously i just didnt care about any of this film and oh not to mention uhura does a belly dance to distract male guards 0 
it was way over fried 0 
definitely a bargain 1 
also great directing and photography 1 
rude inconsiderate management 0 
total waste of time 0 
best tacos in town by far 1 
great phone 1 
go and see it 1 
the worst was the salmon sashimi 0 
you cant relate with them hell you barely can understand them 0 
characters are onedimensional even the good guys and especially the bad guys 0 
i was not happy with this item 0 
highquality chicken on the chicken caesar salad 1 
both great 1 
no actress has been worse used that june allison in this movie 0 
razr battery good buy 1 
this place has it 1 
i saw this film over christmas and what a great film it was 1 
nicest chinese restaurant ive been in a while 1 
cant say enough good things about this place 1 
the pleather case doesnt fit 0 
main thing i didnt enjoy is that the crowd is of older crowd around mid 30s and up 0 
it crackles with an unpredictable youthful energy but honestly i found it hard to follow and concentrate on it meanders so badly 0 
the cg opening sequence in space looked like it could have been created on microsoft slideshow for gods sake 0 
using all earpieces left or right this thing will not stay on my ear 0 
horrible horrible protector 0 
the flat reenactments dont hold your attention because they are emotionally adrift and stagy 0 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
this greedy corporation will never see another dime from me 0 
best ive found so far ive tried 2 other bluetooths and this one has the best quality for both me and the listener as well as ease of using 1 
a greasy unhealthy meal 0 
lousy product 0 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
the company shipped my product very promptly and it works well 1 
fantastic service here 1 
even when the women finally show up there is no sign of improvement the most expected things happen and by the time the film is over you might be far asleep 0 
the only thing worse than taylors acting was stanwycks singing 0 
he cant act one of the least scary villains i have ever seen he cant write did he write this damn movie in his sleep 0 
everyone is treated equally special 1 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
waited and waited and waited 0 
new battery works great in phone 1 
plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job 1 
i also didnt like the on button it felt like it would crack with use 0 
best headset ever 1 
however bt headsets are currently not good for real time games like firstperson shooters since the audio delay messes me up 0 
it is very educational for children 1 to 8 years old 1
