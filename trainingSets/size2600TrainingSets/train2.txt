the only suspense i was feeling was the frustration at just how retarded the girls were 0 
was not happy 0 
left very frustrated 0 
rating 1 out of 10 0 
i recommend igo to anyone with different brand cell phonesmp3 players in the family 1 
i know that sounds funny but to me it seemed like sketchy technology that wouldnt work wellwell this one works great 1 
this movie contained an allstar cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i havent seen before 1 
id like to return it 0 
one character is totally annoying with a voice that gives me the feeling of fingernails on a chalkboard 0 
wow loved this place 1 
very slow at seating even with reservation 0 
this place is way too overpriced for mediocre food 0 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
razr battery good buy 1 
filmiing was less expansive 0 
i ordered the voodoo pasta and it was the first time id had really excellent pasta since going gluten free several years ago 1 
i just cant explain this movie more than romanticcharminghilariousand adorablethe junkyard scenes are funnyall the junkyard dogs have something specialtoo funny i laughedkids will love itbuy it when it comes outit has new features 1 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
this convention never worked well in the past and certainly doesnt work here 0 
this is a great little item 1 
service was very prompt 1 
have been going since 2007 and every meal has been awesome 1 
the pairing of the two devices was so easy it barely took a couple minutes before i started making calls with the voice dialing feature 1 
babie bop is very cute 1 
the least said about the acting the better 0 
ryans bar is definitely one edinburgh establishment i wont be revisiting 0 
this film highlights the fundamental flaws of the legal process that its not about discovering guilt or innocence but rather is about who presents better in court 1 
this results in the phone being either stuck at max volume or mute 0 
the explosion of the gas tanks at the end was just as awful 0 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
the sergeant pepper beef sandwich with auju sauce is an excellent sandwich as well 1 
service stinks here 0 
i have to mention this and it is a huge spoiler i loved the ending how all the characters of the three films were the remaining survivors of the ferry disaster with valentine and the young judge together and the old man watching it on her tv solidifying his happiness over the suffering which he dealt with for those many years 1 
hell no will i go back 0 
very good product well made 1 
disappointing accessory from a good manufacturer 0 
headset works great was packaged nicely to avoid any damage 1 
the battery life is highly unacceptable 0 
it was way over fried 0 
in a word it is embarrassing 0 
low quality 0 
the flat reenactments dont hold your attention because they are emotionally adrift and stagy 0 
i let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this bad idea we both hated it 0 
works good 1 
the lighting is just dark enough to set the mood 1 
the shower area is outside so you can only rinse not take a full shower unless you dont mind being nude for everyone to see 0 
verizon tech support walked my through a few procedures none of which worked and i ended up having to do a hard reset wiping out all my data 0 
the hockey scenes are terrible defensemen playing like theyre 5 years old goalies diving at shots that are 10 feet wide of the net etc 0 
its too bad that everyone else involved didnt share crowes level of dedication to quality for if they did wed have a far better film on our hands than this subpar mess 0 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
internet is excrutiatingly slow 0 
overall a great experience 1 
how awesome is that 1 
there is really nothing for me at postinos hope your experience is better 0 
has been working great 1 
works for me 1 
however bt headsets are currently not good for real time games like firstperson shooters since the audio delay messes me up 0 
tom wilkinson broke my heart at the end and everyone elses judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike 1 
to sum the film up breeders is a terrible cheaply made horror movie that should be avoided like the ebola virus 0 
woa talk about awful 0 
i took back my money and got outta there 0 
cool phone 1 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
my boyfriend and i sat at the bar and had a completely delightful experience 1 
i ordered albondigas soup which was just warm and tasted like tomato soup with frozen meatballs 0 
its not what it says it is 0 
i think that it is a must see older john wayne film 1 
fans of the genre will be in heaven 1 
does not work for listening to music with the cingular 8125 0 
item arrived quickly and works great with my metro pcs samsung schr450 slider phone and sony premium sound in ear plugs 1 
worth every penny 1 
one of my favorite purchases ever 1 
great movie 1 
never again will i be dining at this place 0 
this gets a 1 out of 10 simply because theres nothing lower 0 
we made the drive all the way from north scottsdale and i was not one bit disappointed 1 
i had to go to a store and bought a new nokia phone which is working great 1 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
i got the car charger and not even after a week the charger was brokeni went to plug it in and it started smoking 0 
here in the wind and the lion we see a wonderful rendering of americas own imperial age 1 
and there wasnt a single sour note struck actingwise either some surprisingly solid casting here 1 
also the area where my unit broke im not too fond of the magnetic strap 0 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
great pizza and salads 1 
the awful dialogue and hopeless overacting by everyone who gets shot top off a real waste of space and time 0 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
always a great time at dos gringos 1 
i went to bachi burger on a friends recommendation and was not disappointed 1 
works fine 1 
it kept getting worse and worse so now im officially done 0 
my ribeye steak was cooked perfectly and had great mesquite flavor 1 
perhaps my phone is defective but people cannot hear me when i use this 0 
this is a great phone 1 
honeslty it didnt taste that fresh 0 
new battery works great in phone 1 
the service was terrible food was mediocre 0 
we had fantastic service and were pleased by the atmosphere 1 
i guess maybe we went on an off night but it was disgraceful 0 
as for the killer dont expect anything original or even remotely frightening 0 
great character actors telly savalas and peter boyle 1 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
i cannot believe that the actors agreed to do this film 0 
always a great time at dos gringos 1 
for 40 bucks a head i really expect better food 0 
if you simply want a small flip phone look elsewhere as the extra bells whistles are mediocre 0 
none of it works just dont buy it 0 
it was a great phone 1 
because both ears are occupied background is not distracting at all 1 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
try them in the airport to experience some tasty food and speedy friendly service 1 
works like a charm it work the same as the one i got with the phone 1 
unfortunately any virtue in this films production work was lost on a regrettable script 0 
one more thing i can tolerate political incorrectness very well im all for artistic freedom and suspension of disbelief but the slavic female character was just too much 0 
shes poised and amazing 1 
characters are onedimensional even the good guys and especially the bad guys 0 
youll love how thin it is 1 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
but it is great i would really recommend it 1 
case was more or less an extra that i originally put on but later discarded because it scratched my ear 0 
speaking of the music it is unbearably predictably and kitchy 0 
crisp and clear 1 
this was my first and only vegas buffet and it did not disappoint 1 
great headset very impressed h500 1 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
that being said for a phone the camera is very nice many cool effects to play with and video is decent as well 1 
the story is beyond stupid 0 
its a gloriously fun fast paced and fairly accurate portrayal of the night of a raver 1 
it is wonderful and inspiring to watch and i hope that it gets released again on to video or dvd 1 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
i got the car charger and not even after a week the charger was brokeni went to plug it in and it started smoking 0 
good show samsung 1 
design flaw 0 
this is a great restaurant at the mandalay bay 1 
nothing at all to recommend 0 
the roast beef sandwich tasted really good 1 
this allows the possibility of double booking for the same date and time after the first 0 
warning do not buy 0 
thats how id describe this painfully dreary timewaster of a film 0 
the scripting of the subtle comedy is unmatched by any movie in recent years 1 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
the ear buds only play music in one ear 0 
i am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this 1 
rating 1 out of 10 0 
the directing and the cinematography arent quite as good 0 
however bt headsets are currently not good for real time games like firstperson shooters since the audio delay messes me up 0 
only like 3 or 4 buildings used a couple of locations maybe poor hummh 0 
very true to shakespear and a must for all shakespear fans 1 
the keyboard is a nice compromise between a full qwerty and the basic cell phone number keypad 1 
we sat another ten minutes and finally gave up and left 0 
really ugly 0 
but this movie really got to me 1 
walked in and the place smelled like an old grease trap and only 2 others there eating 0 
but i dont like it 0 
the directing and the cinematography arent quite as good 0 
this is simply the best bluetooth headset for sound quality 1 
if there is a wind it is completely useless 0 
the design is very odd as the ear clip is not very comfortable at all 0 
both actors truly understand and become their particular character delivering a convincing sincere performance 1 
we waited for thirty minutes to be seated although there were 8 vacant tables and we were the only folks waiting 0 
they never brought a salad we asked for 0 
this is actually a very smart movie 1 
i only hear garbage for audio 0 
after arguing with verizon regarding the dropped calls we returned the phones after two days 0 
but what really made it unwatchable was the direction 0 
the phone crashed completely and now i have to get it replaced 0 
very disappointed and wondered how it could be in the oscar shortlist 0 
the food is about on par with dennys which is to say not good at all 0 
not a good item it worked for a while then started having problems in my auto reverse tape player 0 
not much flavor to them and very poorly constructed 0 
works great 1 
i wear glasses and it fits fine with them 1 
what a waste of money and time 0 
best ive found so far ive tried 2 other bluetooths and this one has the best quality for both me and the listener as well as ease of using 1 
o my gosh the best phone i have ever had 1 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
clear skype calls long battery life long range 1 
i dont know what the big deal is about this place but i wont be back yaall 0 
too bad you have to pay up to a month for the service 0 
i paid the bill but did not tip because i felt the server did a terrible job 0 
the fact is this film is a wonderful heartwarming tale about two people chasing their dreams 1 
i was particularly pleased with the acting ability of dwight schultz 1 
for a product that costs as much as this one does i expect it to work far better and with greater ease than this thing does 0 
just what i wanted 1 
love this product 1 
in a word it is embarrassing 0 
this is a great restaurant at the mandalay bay 1 
there was so much hype over this phone that i assumed it was the best my mistake 0 
however this didnt make up for the fact that overall this was a tremendously boring movie 0 
all the bread is made inhouse 1 
my boyfriend and i sat at the bar and had a completely delightful experience 1 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
we had fantastic service and were pleased by the atmosphere 1 
no additional ear gels provided and no instructions whatsoever 0 
worse theres an incredibly weak subplot thrown in that follows a little band of latterday mansonites as they go after a reporter whos working on a story on the anniversary of the killings 0 
bt50 battery junk 0 
the battery life is highly unacceptable 0 
the phone takes forever to charge like 2 to 5 hours literally 0 
disappointment i hate anything that goes in my ear 0 
if there was ever a movie that needed wordofmouth to promote this is it 1 
while i managed to bend the leaf spring back in place the metal now has enough stress that it will break on the next drop 0 
very good food great atmosphere1 1 
i kept catching the cable on the seat and i had to pull the phone out to turn it on an off 0 
the chains which im no fan of beat this place easily 0 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
they were excellent 1 
it was way over fried 0 
if only someone involved with it knew how to string together narrative 0 
hell no will i go back 0 
point your finger at any item on the menu order it and you wont be disappointed 1 
i ordered albondigas soup which was just warm and tasted like tomato soup with frozen meatballs 0 
i really hope the team behind this movie makes more movies and that they will continue to do so in their own some kinda weird style 1 
this phone is very fast with sending any kind of messages and web browsing is significantly faster than previous phones i have used 1 
never got it 0 
total brunch fail 0 
i kept looking at the time and it had soon become 35 minutes yet still no food 0 
50 down the drain 0 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
this is high adventure at its best 1 
the service was great even the manager came and helped with our table 1 
works great 1 
blue ant is easy to use 1 
the sangria was about half of a glass wine full and was 12 ridiculous 0 
i searched the internet and found this one to be the best value 1 
however after finally watching this film i realized that not only had i had a closed mind to the brilliance it depicts i also found myself watching it over and over again 1 
i wont spoil it but the ending in pretty amazing 1 
which are small and not worth the price 0 
we wont be going back 0 
perhaps i caught them on an off night judging by the other reviews but im not inspired to go back 0 
the warm beer didnt help 0 
will be back again 1 
what a piece of junk i lose more calls on this phone 0 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
i just cant explain this movie more than romanticcharminghilariousand adorablethe junkyard scenes are funnyall the junkyard dogs have something specialtoo funny i laughedkids will love itbuy it when it comes outit has new features 1 
i advise you to look out for it 1 
we ordered some old classics and some new dishes after going there a few times and were sorely disappointed with everything 0 
the reception is excellent 1 
great for the jawbone 1 
they brought a fresh batch of fries and i was thinking yay something warm but no 0 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
after i pulled up my car i waited for another 15 minutes before being acknowledged 0 
works fine 1 
so far it has worked like a charm 1 
main thing i didnt enjoy is that the crowd is of older crowd around mid 30s and up 0 
trumbull on i love lucy 1 
i kept looking at the time and it had soon become 35 minutes yet still no food 0 
babie bop is very cute 1 
very displeased 0 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
excellent hands free tool 1 
a world better than 95 of the garbage in the theatres today 1 
in fact this stinker smells like a directtovideo release 0 
the service was poor and thats being nice 0 
my only complaint is the standard sound volume is a little low even when turned up to 5of 5 0 
thank you for such great service 1 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
i didnt realize how wonderful the short really is until the last two scenes 1 
you will leave the theater wanting to go out and dance under the stars 1 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
i have bought this nokia cell phone a few weeks ago and it was a nightmare 0 
excellent hands free tool 1 
all i can do is whine on the internet so here it goesthe more i use the thing the less i like it 0 
this movie now joins revenge of the boogeyman and zombiez as part of the hellish trinity of horror films 0 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
the art style has the appearance of crayonpencil drawings and is wonderfully colorful and fanciful 1 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
the headsets are easy to use and everyone loves them 1 
i received my headset in good time and was happy with it 1 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
easily none other cartoon made me laugh in a tender way before getting into dark sitcoms oriented for teenagers 1 
if you do go see this movie bring a pillow or a girlfriendboyfriend to keep you occupied through out 0 
its a great tool for entertainment communication and data managementoh be sure to use activesync 42 for optimal data synchronization results 1 
i cant wait to go back 1 
i received my headset in good time and was happy with it 1 
see both films if you can 1 
att is not clear sound is very distorted and you have to yell when you talk 0 
i tried talking real loud but shouting on the telephone gets old and i was still told it wasnt great 0 
it was a huge awkward 15lb piece of cow that was 34ths gristle and fat 0 
overall the film is interesting and thoughtprovoking 1 
also makes it easier to hold on to 1 
i have 23 bars on my cell phone when i am home but you cant not hear anything 0 
they work about 2 weeks then break 0 
very bad experience 0 
not impressed 0 
disappointment i hate anything that goes in my ear 0 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
have been going since 2007 and every meal has been awesome 1 
the sound quality is excellent as well 1 
my only complaint is the standard sound volume is a little low even when turned up to 5of 5 0 
imdb ratings only go as low 1 for awful its time to get some negative numbers in there for cases such as these 0 
an instant classic with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits 1 
artless camerawork endlessly presents us with the ugliest setting imaginable ie 0 
coming here is like experiencing an underwhelming relationship where both parties cant wait for the other person to ask to break up 0 
the ambience is wonderful and there is music playing 1 
works great 1 
its a shame to see good actors like thomerson and james make a living in a mess like this 0 
this is a great deal 1 
too bad cause i know its family owned i really wanted to like this place 0 
definitely will come back here again 1 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
his use of the colours of the french flag in the three films was nothing short of incredible every shot every scene was like a work of art 1 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
waited and waited and waited 0 
i liked this movie way too much 1 
i had to go to a store and bought a new nokia phone which is working great 1 
a drive thru means you do not want to wait around for half an hour for your food but somehow when we end up going here they make us wait and wait 0 
i am a fan of his this movie sucked really bad 0 
the camera really likes her in this movie 1 
beautiful styling though 1 
we loved the biscuits 1 
great movie 1 
this place lacked style 0 
just reading on the specs alone makes you say wow 1 
i highly recommend these and encourage people to give them a try 1 
also difficult to put onid recommend avoiding this product 0 
is it possible for a movie to get any worse than this 0 
would not recommend to others 0 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
the plug did not work very well 0 
great movie 1 
everything on the menu is terrific and we were also thrilled that they made amazing accommodations for our vegetarian daughter 1 
both of them were truly unbelievably good and i am so glad we went back 1 
the best electronics of the available fm transmitters 1 
the first thing that happened was that the tracking was off 0 
they have great dinners 1 
the problem was the script 0 
great price too 1 
the acting by the whole cast could be put on a scale and balanced perfectly between overacting and underacting 0 
however my girl was complain that some time the phone doesnt wake up like normal phone does 0 
worst customer service ever 0 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
does not work 0 
i just wanted to leave 0 
sound quality on both end is excellent i use headset to call my wife and ask my wife to use headset to call me 2 1 
alexander nevsky is a great film 1 
it lasts less than 3o minutes if i actually try to use the phonemy wife has the same phone with the same problem 0 
also great directing and photography 1 
the black eyed peas and sweet potatoes unreal 1 
last time buying from you 0 
i bought this to use with my kindle fire and absolutely loved it 1 
if there is a wind it is completely useless 0 
the tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu 0 
awesome device 1 
if that bug never showed up i would have given a 4 for sure but on the other side of the wall where this bug was climbing was the kitchen 0 
motorola finally got the voice quality of a bluetooth headset right 1 
that company is a joke 0 
good protection and does not make phone too bulky 1 
i highly recommend this modest priced cellular phone 1 
the vegetables are so fresh and the sauce feels like authentic thai 1 
this company charge me a restocking fee and still not given me my refund back 0 
dont waste your money and time 0 
their rotating beers on tap is also a highlight of this place 1 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
penne vodka excellent 1 
ray charles is legendary 1 
i love that they put their food in nice plastic containers as opposed to cramming it in little paper takeout boxes 1 
the fried rice was dry as well 0 
warning do not buy 0 
i agree with jessica this movie is pretty bad 0 
i heart this place 1 
new battery works great in phone 1 
att is not clear sound is very distorted and you have to yell when you talk 0 
i have bought this nokia cell phone a few weeks ago and it was a nightmare 0 
its pretty surprising that this wonderful film was made in 1949 as hollywood generally had its collective heads in the sand concerning black and white issues at that time 1 
food was really good and i got full petty fast 1 
the battery life is highly unacceptable 0 
i gave it a 10 1 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
magical help 1 
the microphone also works well but according to people i have called it applifies everything 1 
stay away from the q 0 
i especially liked the noncliche choices with the parents in other movies i could predict the dialog verbatim but the writing in this movie made better selections 1 
i am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this 1 
the selection was probably the worst ive seen in vegasthere was none 0 
emily watsons character is very strong and she has only to give a quick glance and you understand everything 1 
im still infatuated with this phone 1 
i think i was one of the people who found this another one of roths pearls 1 
really awful 0 
service is perfect and the family atmosphere is nice to see 1 
very prompt service 1 
the staff are also very friendly and efficient 1 
excellent service 1 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
she carries the movie well 1 
the battery is completely useless to me 0 
feelings thoughtsgabriels discomfort during the danceall these intangibles leap to life and come within the viewers grasp in hustons portrayal 1 
20th century foxs road house 1948 is not only quite a silly noir but is an implausible unmitigated bore of a movie 0 
if you simply want a small flip phone look elsewhere as the extra bells whistles are mediocre 0 
cheap but hey it works was pleasantly suprised given the low cost of this item 1 
and finally after all that we get to an ending that wouldve been great had it been handled by competent people and not jerry falwell 0 
people couldnt hear me talk and i had to pull out the earphone and talk on the phone 0 
the text messaging feature is really tricky to use 0 
an extensive menu provides lots of options for breakfast 1 
your servers suck wait correction our server heimer sucked 0 
great food and awesome service 1 
it was an inexpensive piece but i would still have expected better quality 0 
also notable is john baileys fine crisp beautifully colored cinematography and the great production design costumes by eiko ishioka who went on to do the memorable costumes for coppolas dracula for which she received a well deserved oscar 1 
nice docking station for home or work 1 
after arguing with verizon regarding the dropped calls we returned the phones after two days 0 
regrettably the film fails 0 
feelings thoughtsgabriels discomfort during the danceall these intangibles leap to life and come within the viewers grasp in hustons portrayal 1 
people couldnt hear me talk and i had to pull out the earphone and talk on the phone 0 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
the films dialogue is natural real to life 1 
unreliable im giving up 0 
i love the look and feel of samsung flipphones 1 
the fact is this film is a wonderful heartwarming tale about two people chasing their dreams 1 
if youre not familiar check it out 1 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
it was delicious 1 
nice spicy and tender 1 
exactly what i wanted 1 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1 
babie bop is very cute 1 
ill put this gem up against any movie in terms of screenplay cinematography acting postproduction editing directing or any other aspect of filmmaking 1 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
good value great food great service 1 
lets start with all the problemsthe acting especially from the lead professor was very very bad 0 
the kids are very cool too 1 
youd have to have the iq of particularly stupid mollusk not to see that one coming 0 
so flavorful and has just the perfect amount of heat 1 
at around 4 pm i bought it at around 8pm i started to watch at around 815pm i fast forwarded the remaining film to see if there was anything left watchable for a human being with a brain but there wasnt 0 
comes with a strong light that you can use to light up your camera shots and even flash sos signals seriously 1 
due to this happening on every call i was forced to stop using this headset 0 
the films dialogue is natural real to life 1 
case was more or less an extra that i originally put on but later discarded because it scratched my ear 0 
as i said abovepretty useless 0 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
otherwise easy to install and use clear sound 1 
the camera really likes her in this movie 1 
you can watch them preparing the delicious food 1 
duris has a wholesome appearance and gives a fine performance 1 
fans of the genre will be in heaven 1 
the screen size is big key pad lit well enough and the camera quality is excellent for a camera phone 1 
i wont be back 0 
none of the three sizes they sent with the headset would stay in my ears 0 
good value great food great service 1 
im not eating here 0 
you wont regret it 1 
this is actually a very smart movie 1 
obviously they have a terrible customer service so you get what you pay for 0 
we started with the tuna sashimi which was brownish in color and obviously wasnt fresh 0 
woa talk about awful 0 
the ngage is still lacking in earbuds 0 
the noise shield is incrediable 1 
i went on motorolas website and followed all directions but could not get it to pair again 0 
not even good for camp value 0 
but storm trooper is not even bad enough to make it to the list of wonderfully terrible movies 0 
the ambiance was incredible 1 
2 thumbs up to this seller 1 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
there is so much good food in vegas that i feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to rice and company 0 
i came over from verizon because cingulair has nicer cell phones the first thing i noticed was the really bad service 0 
in fact i liked it better than interview with a vampire and i liked this lestat stuart townsend better than cruises attempt 1 
easily none other cartoon made me laugh in a tender way before getting into dark sitcoms oriented for teenagers 1 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
aside from its terrible lead this film has loads of other debits 0 
i would not recommend this place 0 
your staff spends more time talking to themselves than me 0 
at around 4 pm i bought it at around 8pm i started to watch at around 815pm i fast forwarded the remaining film to see if there was anything left watchable for a human being with a brain but there wasnt 0 
hot dishes are not hot cold dishes are close to room tempi watched staff prepare food with bare hands no gloveseverything is deep fried in oil 0 
i guess it was supposed to be clever twist then shed some light on the situation but it was just stupid 0 
it was an inexpensive piece but i would still have expected better quality 0 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
there arent death scenes like in previous movies and the fx are terrible 0 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
spend your money elsewhere 0 
also the phone doesnt seem to accept anything except cbr mp3s preferably ripped by windows media player 0 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
used and dirty 0 
its extremely slow and takes forever to do anything with it 0 
the design is very odd as the ear clip is not very comfortable at all 0 
im big fan of rpg games too but this movie its a disgrace to any selfrespecting rpger there is 0 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
it works fine on my motorola 325 cellphone and a lot better than the wornout battery did 1 
however my girl was complain that some time the phone doesnt wake up like normal phone does 0 
rip off over charge shipping 0 
the basic premise is wasted since it is sidelined by the inexplicable focus on the documentary crew 0 
the feel of the dining room was more college cooking course than high class dining and the service was slow at best 0 
you cant beat the price on these 1 
the phone gets extremely hot 0 
the phone was unusable and was not new 0 
maybe its just their vegetarian fare but ive been twice and i thought it was average at best 0 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
on a positive note our server was very attentive and provided great service 1 
the speaker is of low quality so as making the ring tones sound very cheap 0 
it doesnt make you look cool 0 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
it is super charged up for use as a small hybrid palmtopcameracellphone and excels in those roles 1 
there is really nothing for me at postinos hope your experience is better 0 
great pocket pc phone combination 1 
im still infatuated with this phone 1 
keep up the good work amazon 1 
they know how to make them here 1 
but this movie is definitely a below average rent 0 
i would give this television series a 10 plus if i could 1 
loved the casting of jimmy buffet as the science teacher 1 
very good though 1 
the flat reenactments dont hold your attention because they are emotionally adrift and stagy 0 
this was my first time and i cant wait until the next 1 
in fact im going to round up to 4 stars just because she was so awesome 1 
the ambiance was incredible 1 
the seasonal fruit was fresh white peach puree 1 
i cant use this case because the smell is disgusting 0 
also makes it easier to hold on to 1 
the phone crashed completely and now i have to get it replaced 0 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
if you are reading this please dont go there 0 
verizons bills however are difficult to understand even though their pricing plans are simple 0 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
it was a waste of my money 0 
it is an excellent drama an excellent thriller and an excellent film 1 
i searched the internet and found this one to be the best value 1 
not even a hello we will be right with you 0 
an interesting premise and billy drago is always good as a dangerous nutbag side note id love to see drago stephen mchattie and lance hendrikson in a flick together talk about raging cheekbones 1 
this wonderful experience made this place a muststop whenever we are in town again 1 
my drink was never empty and he made some really great menu suggestions 1 
all the bread is made inhouse 1 
we got the food and apparently they have never heard of salt and the batter on the fish was chewy 0 
the staff are great the ambiance is great 1 
think it over when you plan to own this onethis sure is the last moto phone for me 0 
as for the mains also uninspired 0 
the film gives meaning to the phrase never in the history of human conflict has so much been owed by so many to so few 1 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
excellent bluetooth headset 1 
my only problem is i thought the actor playing the villain was a low rent michael ironside 0 
horrible phone 0 
this is a chilly unremarkable movie about an author livingworking in a chilly abstruse culture 0 
this item is great installed it let it charged up overnite and it has been working good every since with no problems 1 
i dont have to be an accountant to know im getting screwed 0 
the only consistent thread holding the series together were the amazing performances of leni parker and anita laselva as the two taelons in quiet idealogical conflict 0 
great phone 1 
the characters are interesting and you really care for them 1 
i literally vomited while watching this film 0 
i had about two bites and refused to eat anymore 0 
superb phone on a great network 1 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
i bought two of them and neither will charge 0 
i saw this short film on hbo the other day and absolutely loved it 1 
the staff is always super friendly and helpful which is especially cool when you bring two small boys and a baby 1 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
this film and i use that word loosely is an insult to the moviegoing public 0 
an italian reviewer called this a small great film and thats right 1 
everything on the menu is terrific and we were also thrilled that they made amazing accommodations for our vegetarian daughter 1 
overall i rate this movie a 10 out of a 110 scale 1 
the service was terrible food was mediocre 0 
an awesome new look for fall 2000 1 
i purcashed this for the car charger and it does not work 0 
ordered a double cheeseburger got a single patty that was falling apart picture uploaded yeah still sucks 0 
a good time 1 
the acting is beyond abysmal 0 
i want to first say our server was great and we had perfect service 1 
great earpiece 1 
when it opens the battery connection is broken and the device is turned off 0 
the food is about on par with dennys which is to say not good at all 0 
at any rate this film stinks its not funny and fulci should have stayed with giallo and supernatural zombie movies 0 
its just lame 0 
ive had no trouble accessing the internet downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions 1 
it came free with a dvd player i bought but i still turned the thing off halfway through because i was embarrassed for howell 0 
design flaw 0 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
phone is sturdy as all nokia bar phones are 1 
every element of this story was so over the top excessively phony and contrived that it was painful to sit through 0 
this place is great 1 
the only thing i wasnt too crazy about was their guacamole as i dont like it puréed 0 
excellent service 1 
im trying to return it for a refund 0 
its pretty surprising that this wonderful film was made in 1949 as hollywood generally had its collective heads in the sand concerning black and white issues at that time 1 
avoid at all costs 0 
i love this cable it allows me to connect any miniusb device to my pc 1 
it was a bit too sweet not really spicy enough and lacked flavor 0 
im using it with an iriver spinn with case and it fits fine 1 
the only consistent thread holding the series together were the amazing performances of leni parker and anita laselva as the two taelons in quiet idealogical conflict 0 
i used bitpim a free program you can find on the internetto transfer data to the phonethe price of the cable was excellent 1 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
very good product well made 1 
its not what it says it is 0 
now this dish was quite flavourful 1 
they keep getting better and better this is my third one and ive had numerous palms too 1 
i would have casted her in that role after ready the script 1 
one more thing i can tolerate political incorrectness very well im all for artistic freedom and suspension of disbelief but the slavic female character was just too much 0 
i wouldnt return 0 
it was equally awful 0 
the steaks are all well trimmed and also perfectly cooked 1 
restored my phone to like new performance 1 
essentially you can forget microsofts tech support 0 
why are these sad little vegetables so overcooked 0 
the death row scenes were entirely unmoving 0 
what should have been a hilarious yummy christmas eve dinner to remember was the biggest fail of the entire trip for us 0 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
perhaps i caught them on an off night judging by the other reviews but im not inspired to go back 0 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
in summary this was a largely disappointing dining experience 0 
never got it 0 
bt50 battery junk 0 
he came running after us when he realized my husband had left his sunglasses on the table 1 
both of them were truly unbelievably good and i am so glad we went back 1 
w810i is just superb 1 
if this premise sound stupid thats because it is 0 
it is indescribably the most annoying and idiotic show i have ever seen 0 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
unfortunately any virtue in this films production work was lost on a regrettable script 0 
the vegetables are so fresh and the sauce feels like authentic thai 1 
but in any case the best part is you can download these pictures to your laptop using ir or even send pictures from your laptop to the phone 1 
their menu is diverse and reasonably priced 1 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
will order from them again 1 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
my headset works just peachykeen 1 
gave up trying to eat any of the crust teeth still sore 0 
john garfield ann revere lilli plmer william conrad canada leeand filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screenjames wong howe 1 
while you dont yet hear mickey speak there are tons of sound effects and music throughout the filmsomething we take for granted now but which was a huge crowd pleaser in 1928 1 
i had a salad with the wings and some ice cream for dessert and left feeling quite satisfied 1 
thats how id describe this painfully dreary timewaster of a film 0 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
this is the phone to get for 2005 i just bought my s710a and all i can say is wow 1 
i asked multiple times for the wine list and after some time of being ignored i went to the hostess and got one myself 0 
no im going to eat the potato that i found some strangers hair in it 0 
is it possible for a movie to get any worse than this 0 
definitely worth seeing its the sort of thought provoking film that forces you to question your own threshold of loneliness 1 
its a case of so bad it is laughable 0 
good audio quality 1 
i could eat their bruschetta all day it is devine 1 
an excellent new restaurant by an experienced frenchman 1 
i probably would not go here again 0 
1010 1 
service was fantastic 1 
its also great to see that renowned silent screenwriter frances marion hasnt missed a step going from silent to sound 1 
feelings thoughtsgabriels discomfort during the danceall these intangibles leap to life and come within the viewers grasp in hustons portrayal 1 
does not fit 0 
i was seated immediately 1 
i was particularly pleased with the acting ability of dwight schultz 1 
if that bug never showed up i would have given a 4 for sure but on the other side of the wall where this bug was climbing was the kitchen 0 
hackneyed writing certainly but made even worse by the bad directing 0 
heres where the movie really pied me off 0 
if there was ever a movie that needed wordofmouth to promote this is it 1 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
same evening him and i are both drastically sick 0 
the steak and the shrimp are in my opinion the best entrees at gc 1 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
not recommended 0 
if there were zero stars i would give it zero stars 0 
i bought this to use with my kindle fire and absolutely loved it 1 
their frozen margaritas are way too sugary for my taste 0 
wow loved this place 1 
they do not last forever but is not overly expensive to replaceeasy to operate and the sound is much better than others i have tried 1 
overall a great experience 1 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
we loved the biscuits 1 
hard to judge whether these sides were good because we were grossed out by the melted styrofoam and didnt want to eat it for fear of getting sick 0 
it is perfect for a sitdown family meal or get together with a few friends 1 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
schrader has made a resume full of lousy amateurish films 0 
great time family dinner on a sunday night 1 
the only good thing was that it fits comfortably on small ears 1 
this place is horrible and way overpriced 0 
this is a really fantastic thai restaurant which is definitely worth a visit 1 
i left with a stomach ache and felt sick the rest of the day 0 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
food was below average 0 
we asked for the bill to leave without eating and they didnt bring that either 0 
overall a delight 1 
the plot is nonsense that doesnt interest in the slightest way or have any uniqueness to it 0 
the scenery that the two daughters paint and photograph are beautiful 1 
your staff spends more time talking to themselves than me 0 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
terrible management 0 
ryans bar is definitely one edinburgh establishment i wont be revisiting 0 
i love it 1 
black water is a thriller that manages to completely transcend its limitations its an indie flick by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience 1 
their rotating beers on tap is also a highlight of this place 1 
the problem i have is that they charge 1199 for a sandwich that is no bigger than a subway sub which offers better and more amount of vegetables 0 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
the service was a little slow considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace 0 
this product is great it makes working a lot easier i can go to the copier while waiting on hold for something 1 
this movie has a cutting edge to it 1 
everything was fresh and delicious 1 
the instruction manual is lacking 0 
another thing i didnt really like is when a character got punched in the face a gallon of blood would spew forth soon after 0 
the burrittos blah 0 
it was a riot to see hugo weaving play a sexobsessed gay real estate salesman who uses his clients houses for his trysts with the flaming darren tom hollander 1 
not even good for camp value 0 
the only very disappointing thing was there was no speakerphone 0 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
after charging overnight these batteries work great 1 
you cant go wrong with any of the food here 1 
i have to jiggle the plug to get it to line up right to get decent volume 0 
as for the service i thought it was good 1 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
it was so boring 0 
love this product 1 
the selection was probably the worst ive seen in vegasthere was none 0 
audio quality is poor very poor 0 
this place is like chipotle but better 1 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
the food was terrible 0 
i guess i should have known that this place would suck because it is inside of the excalibur but i didnt use my common sense 0 
you can find better movies at youtube 0 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
all i can do is whine on the internet so here it goesthe more i use the thing the less i like it 0 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
and considering the two of us left there very full and happy for about 20 you just cant go wrong 1 
must have been an off night at this place 0 
not as good as i had hoped 0 
great phone 1 
bad fit way too big 0 
is pretty funny 1 
not what i wanted 0 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
i believe that this place is a great stop for those with a huge belly and hankering for sushi 1 
the only possible way this movie could be redeemed would be as mst3k fodder 0 
check it out 1 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
wonderful lil tapas and the ambience made me feel all warm and fuzzy inside 1 
the script is horrendously stupid 0 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
im still infatuated with this phone 1 
the black eyed peas and sweet potatoes unreal 1 
i do love sushi but i found kabuki to be overpriced overhip and underservices 0 
i thought it was bad 0 
the ri style calamari was a joke 0 
and dont even get me started on the jerky camerawork 0 
it is rare when a filmmaker takes the time to tell a worthy moral tale with care and love that doesnt fall into the trap of being overly syrupy or over indulgent 1 
disapointing results 0 
this case seems well made 1 
i ordered the voodoo pasta and it was the first time id had really excellent pasta since going gluten free several years ago 1 
also the area where my unit broke im not too fond of the magnetic strap 0 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
after the first charge kept going dead after 12 minutes 0 
the plot such as it is is so derivative and predictable that the ending is like a mercy killing 0 
you wont regret it 1 
not as good as i had hoped 0 
i like armand assante my cable companys summary sounded interesting so i watched it twice already and probably will again 1 
even if you love bad movies do not watch this movie 0 
i great reception all the time 1 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
this place is overpriced not consistent with their boba and it really is overpriced 0 
a world better than 95 of the garbage in the theatres today 1 
cooked to perfection and the service was impeccable 1 
worst martini ever 0 
the story line is just awful 0 
there arent death scenes like in previous movies and the fx are terrible 0 
you cant beat the price on these 1 
it looked like a wonderful story 1 
this was my first time and i cant wait until the next 1 
stay away from the q 0 
i really liked that 1 
to sum the film up breeders is a terrible cheaply made horror movie that should be avoided like the ebola virus 0 
but the duet between the astronaut and his doctor at the beginning of the movie is a perfect exchange if one considers that this movie was made well into the cold war and the astronauts biggest fear is that he has crashed in the ussr 1 
i have to jiggle the plug to get it to line up right to get decent volume 0 
not easy to watch 0 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
this was reflected not only in the cast but also in the belowpar script which borrowed much from the earlier classic 0 
at a time when it seems that film animation has been dominated by disneypixars cgi masterpieces it is both refreshing and comforting to know that miyazaki is still relying on traditional handdrawn animation to tell his charming and enchanting stories 1 
omg i felt like i had never eaten thai food until this dish 1 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
after i pulled up my car i waited for another 15 minutes before being acknowledged 0 
only like 3 or 4 buildings used a couple of locations maybe poor hummh 0 
the seasonal fruit was fresh white peach puree 1 
the restaurant atmosphere was exquisite 1 
also were served hot bread and butter and home made potato chips with bacon bits on topvery original and very good 1 
only had this a month but its worked flawlessly so far 1 
the inside is really quite nice and very clean 1 
service stinks here 0 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
very dissapointing performance 0 
this item is great installed it let it charged up overnite and it has been working good every since with no problems 1 
how awful she is 0 
this allows the possibility of double booking for the same date and time after the first 0 
useless phone simply deaf 0 
in conclusion i will not bother with this movie because a volcano in los angeles is nothing but nonsense 0 
great phone 1 
i liked this movie way too much 1 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
the plot is nonsense that doesnt interest in the slightest way or have any uniqueness to it 0 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
made very sturdy 1 
but the convoluted plot just didnt convince me and much of the film was watched with a weird questioning glance 0 
pretty cool i would say 1 
but whatever it was that cost them so much it didnt translate to quality thats for sure 0 
star trek v the final frontier is the worst in the series 0 
used and dirty 0 
level 5 spicy was perfect where spice didnt overwhelm the soup 1 
definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly will return next time im in vegas 1 
1010 1 
well packaged arrived on time and works as intended 1 
plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job 1 
in other words the content level of this film is enough to easily fill a dozen other films 1 
but this movie really got to me 1 
also its slim enough to fit into my alarm clock docking station without removing the case 1 
never heard of any of them except cole who was totally unbelievable in the part 0 
earbud piece breaks easily 0 
if you simply want a small flip phone look elsewhere as the extra bells whistles are mediocre 0 
kind of hard to mess up a steak but they did 0 
it was that loudglad to say that the plantronics 510 maintains a flawless connection to my cell and with no static during normal use 1 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
in summary this was a largely disappointing dining experience 0 
it was horrendous 0 
the first time i ever came here i had an amazing experience i still tell people how awesome the duck was 1 
both of the egg rolls were fantastic 1 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
the grilled chicken was so tender and yellow from the saffron seasoning 1 
poor voice clarity 0 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
avoid this one if you can 0 
i own a jabra earset and was very happy with it but the sound quality especially outgoing on this is better 1 
no ear loop needed its tiny and the sound is great 1 
always a great time at dos gringos 1 
this place lacked style 0 
the calls drop the phone comes on and off at will the screen goes black and the worst of all it stops ringing intermittently 0 
this was my first and only vegas buffet and it did not disappoint 1 
if you are razr owneryou must have this 1 
it will drive you barking mad 0 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
utter crap sound quality is terrible 0 
this place is like chipotle but better 1 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
i have yet to run this new battery below two bars and thats three days without charging 1 
i just saw this film and i recommend it 1 
in the summer you can dine in a charming outdoor patio so very delightful 1 
this is probably one of the least effective and utterly unoriginal films i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
also the area where my unit broke im not too fond of the magnetic strap 0 
the service here is fair at best 0 
the chefs were friendly and did a good job 1 
i love this cable it allows me to connect any miniusb device to my pc 1 
paolo sorrentino has written a wonderful story about loneliness and tony has built one of the most unforgettable characters seen in movies in recent years 1 
i have been very happy with the 510 and have had no complaints from any one regarding my sound quality on their end 1 
the servers are not pleasant to deal with and they dont always honor pizza hut coupons 0 
the movie showed a lot of florida at its best made it look very appealing 1 
top line dont waste your time and money on this one its as bad as it comes 0 
i guess maybe we went on an off night but it was disgraceful 0 
it was a drive to get there 0 
you could only take 2 videos at a time and the quality was very poor 0 
some applause should be given to the prelude however 1 
actually the graphics were good at the time 1 
the cast is always entertaining as usual 1 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
great phone 1 
buttons are too small 0 
great steak great sides great wine amazing desserts 1 
the story is also both funny and poignant at times 1 
one character is totally annoying with a voice that gives me the feeling of fingernails on a chalkboard 0 
this is a disgrace 0 
maybe there would be a reasonable explanation for this atrocity 0 
dont waste your time watching this rubbish nonresearched film 0 
but i thought his acting was skilled 1 
trying to make a call on these is an exercise in frustration 0 
hell no will i go back 0 
my headset works just peachykeen 1 
we recently witnessed her poor quality of management towards other guests as well 0 
the headsets are easy to use and everyone loves them 1 
third the cheese on my friends burger was cold 0 
50 down the drain 0 
i think this restaurant suffers from not trying hard enough 0 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
very serious spoilers this movie was a huge disappointment 0 
the characters are interesting and you really care for them 1 
talk about great customer service of course we will be back 1 
you wont forget this movie 1 
my breakfast was perpared great with a beautiful presentation of 3 giant slices of toast lightly dusted with powdered sugar 1 
i vomited in the bathroom mid lunch 0 
i wear it everyday and it holds up very well 1 
incredible 1 
i loved their mussels cooked in this wine reduction the duck was tender and their potato dishes were delicious 1 
the poor actors 0 
there are the usual hitchcock logic flaws 0 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
its just adorable seeing mickey playing turkey in the straw in a highly imaginative if occasionally cruel way 1 
great sound and service 1 
it features an outlandish array of memorable psychotic but lovable nuts 1 
this is one of peter watkins most accessible films 1 
it wasnt busy at all and now we know why 0 
brilliance indeed 1 
im so happy to be here 1 
there is nothing privileged about workingeating there 0 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
i keep watching it over and over 1 
not only did the software do a great job of this i could also make my own ringtones form my existing cds without an internet connection 1 
the food was outstanding and the prices were very reasonable 1 
comes with a strong light that you can use to light up your camera shots and even flash sos signals seriously 1 
it fits so securely that the ear hook does not even need to be used and the sound is better directed through your ear canal 1 
the explosion of the gas tanks at the end was just as awful 0 
the food wasnt good 0 
the film deserves strong kudos for taking this stand for having exceptional acting from its mostly lesserknown cast and for the superintelligent script that doesnt insult the audience or take the easy way out when it comes to white racism 1 
so far it has worked like a charm 1 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
i love the ringtones because they are so upbeat 1 
i saw this short film on hbo the other day and absolutely loved it 1 
to sum the film up breeders is a terrible cheaply made horror movie that should be avoided like the ebola virus 0 
we wont be going back 0 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
i contacted the company and they told me that although the unit was still under warranty if i couldnt produce my receipt i was out of luck 0 
this is the place where i first had pho and it was amazing 1 
instead we got a bore fest about a whiny spoiled brat babysitting 0 
hayao miyazakis latest and eighth film for studio ghibili gake no ue no ponyo ponyo on the cliff by the sea is a wonderfully fun and imaginative look at childhood 1 
the film gives meaning to the phrase never in the history of human conflict has so much been owed by so many to so few 1 
if you have not seen this movie i definitely recommend it 1 
this phone is pretty sturdy and ive never had any large problems with it 1 
the best electronics of the available fm transmitters 1 
none of the three sizes they sent with the headset would stay in my ears 0 
as a courtroom drama its compelling as an indictment on the american justice system its frightening 1 
so flavorful and has just the perfect amount of heat 1 
the selection of food was not the best 0 
tonight i had the elk filet specialand it sucked 0 
the buttons for on and off are bad 0 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
poor product 0 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
so just beware 0 
i was very disappointed 0 
the plot well i said id let that one go 0 
small sleek impressive looking practical setup with ample storage in place 1 
the problem i have is that they charge 1199 for a sandwich that is no bigger than a subway sub which offers better and more amount of vegetables 0 
the battery is completely useless to me 0 
worst martini ever 0 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
the script is a big flawed mess 0 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
also were served hot bread and butter and home made potato chips with bacon bits on topvery original and very good 1 
this phone is pretty sturdy and ive never had any large problems with it 1 
buttons are too small 0 
seriously flavorful delights folks 1 
a piece of cinematic garbage captured on celluloid 0 
the hockey scenes are terrible defensemen playing like theyre 5 years old goalies diving at shots that are 10 feet wide of the net etc 0 
you need two hands to operate the screenthis software interface is decade old and cannot compete with new software designs 0 
it is a really good show to watch 1 
see it with your kids if you have a chanceit will open up some amazing dialog about how far race relations have come in the last 50 years 1 
so i bought about 10 of these and saved alot of money 1 
it never condescends all the characters have good genuine hearts and believable problems 1 
its not what it says it is 0 
there were several moments in the movie that just didnt need to be there and were excruciatingly slow moving 0 
top line dont waste your time and money on this one its as bad as it comes 0 
i use this product in a motor control center where there is a lot of high voltage humming from the equipment and it works great 1 
this phone works great 1 
they refuse to refund or replace 0 
conclusion i loved it 1 
nice sound 1 
the descriptions said yum yum sauce and another said eel sauce yet another said spicy mayowell none of the rolls had sauces on them 0 
gave up trying to eat any of the crust teeth still sore 0 
very nice and relaxing late night viewing 1 
will definitely be back 1 
the entire audience applauded at the conclusion of the film 1 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
it rocked my world and is certainly a must see for anyone with no social or physical outlets 1 
brilliant 1 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
if this premise sound stupid thats because it is 0 
its a great item 1 
i gave it a 10 1 
im not sure what he was trying to do with this film 0 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
every thing on phone work perfectly she like it 1 
trouble is the writing and directing make it impossible to establish those things that make a movie watchable like character story theme and so on 0 
i wouldnt return 0 
this fixes all the problems 1 
it kept getting worse and worse so now im officially done 0 
i received my headset in good time and was happy with it 1 
i think that it is a must see older john wayne film 1 
if you simply want a small flip phone look elsewhere as the extra bells whistles are mediocre 0 
i guess that nobody at the network that aired this dribble watched it before putting it on 0 
the most annoying thing about cover girl is the way in which rita hayworth is put up on a pedestal 0 
perhaps i caught them on an off night judging by the other reviews but im not inspired to go back 0 
excellent starter wireless headset 0 
not much dialogue not much music the whole film was shot as elaborately and aesthetically like a sculpture 1 
very very sad 0 
favorite place in town for shawarrrrrrma 1 
the design is very odd as the ear clip is not very comfortable at all 0 
still i do like this movie for its empowerment of women theres not enough movies out there like this one 1 
perhaps my phone is defective but people cannot hear me when i use this 0 
overall i wasnt very impressed with noca 0 
it had some average acting from the main person and it was a low budget as you clearly can see 0 
the story itself is just predictable and lazy 0 
aside from its terrible lead this film has loads of other debits 0 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
in fact im going to round up to 4 stars just because she was so awesome 1 
i guess i liked the details of his dysfunctionhe was believable 1 
the food was great as always compliments to the chef 1 
this second appearance of mickey mouse following the silent plane crazy earlier that year is probably his most famous filmmostly because it was so groundbreaking 1 
it was just too horrible 0 
this is a great place to eat 1 
it works fine on my motorola 325 cellphone and a lot better than the wornout battery did 1 
great headset very impressed h500 1 
it was attached to a gas station and that is rarely a good sign 0 
all in all i think it was a good investment 1 
a fly was in my apple juice a fly 0 
wont ever go here again 0 
this item is fantastic and works perfectly 1 
works well 1 
he came running after us when he realized my husband had left his sunglasses on the table 1 
i would have given no star if i was able 0 
i believe that this place is a great stop for those with a huge belly and hankering for sushi 1 
im translating movies for a living and this is the first movie in my 5year working experience that i found offensive to my intelligence 0 
to summarize the food was incredible nay transcendant but nothing brings me joy quite like the memory of the pneumatic condiment dispenser 1 
that company is a joke 0 
i kept catching the cable on the seat and i had to pull the phone out to turn it on an off 0 
so absolutley fantastic 1 
great pork sandwich 1 
its also great to see that renowned silent screenwriter frances marion hasnt missed a step going from silent to sound 1 
the plot simply rumbles on like a machine desperately depending on the addition of new scenes 0 
nobody identifies with these characters because theyre all cardboard cutouts and stereotypes or predictably reversestereotypes 0 
dont waste your money 0 
the restaurant is very clean and has a family restaurant feel to it 1 
total brunch fail 0 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
great time family dinner on a sunday night 1 
insults profound deuchebaggery and had to go outside for a smoke break while serving just to solidify it 0 
i have been to very few places to eat that under no circumstances would i ever return to and this tops the list 0 
this phone is pretty sturdy and ive never had any large problems with it 1 
from what my dinner companions told meeverything was very fresh with nice texture and taste 1 
it will drive you barking mad 0 
would not go back 0 
very funny 1 
talk about great customer service of course we will be back 1 
very convenient since we were staying at the mgm 1 
i saw this short film on hbo the other day and absolutely loved it 1 
special thanks to dylan t for the recommendation on what to order all yummy for my tummy 1 
do not buy for d807wrongly advertised for d807 0 
the plot is nonsense that doesnt interest in the slightest way or have any uniqueness to it 0 
both actors truly understand and become their particular character delivering a convincing sincere performance 1 
dont buy this product it fails 0 
the writer gorman bechard undoubtedly did his homework because all references are industry and characterage appropriate 1 
frankly after cotton club and unfaithful it was kind of embarrassing to watch lane and gere in this film because it is bad 0 
to those who find this movie intelligent or even masterful i can only say its your intelligence and your imagination you obviously used to try and make some sense of this pitiful attempt its in our human nature to try and make sense of things 0 
a good time 1 
i hate to disagree with my fellow yelpers but my husband and i were so disappointed with this place 0 
disapointing results 0 
hell no will i go back 0 
this was a poor remake of my best friends wedding 0 
lastly the mozzarella sticks they were the best thing we ordered 1 
which has more depth and character than the man underneath it 0 
the problem i have is that they charge 1199 for a sandwich that is no bigger than a subway sub which offers better and more amount of vegetables 0 
battery is holding up well 1 
you cant beat that 1 
the attempts at humor were pitiful and story is so awful it dosent bear thinking about which basically involves a vulcan stealing the enterprise to find god seriously i just didnt care about any of this film and oh not to mention uhura does a belly dance to distract male guards 0 
i can take a little bad service but the food sucks 0 
bought mainly for the charger which broke soon after purchasing 0 
the black eyed peas and sweet potatoes unreal 1 
thats how id describe this painfully dreary timewaster of a film 0 
great value 1 
im not sure what he was trying to do with this film 0 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
still waiting im sure this item would work well if i ever recieve it 0 
i asked multiple times for the wine list and after some time of being ignored i went to the hostess and got one myself 0 
the volume for the ringer is real good you have choices how loud 1 
it was just too horrible 0 
the battery is completely useless to me 0 
the warmth it generates is in contrast to its austere backdrop 1 
i dont like this nokia either 0 
its a little geeky but i think thats its sex on toast and it rocks and oozes sex right down to its battery embedded sleek stylish leather case 1 
if that bug never showed up i would have given a 4 for sure but on the other side of the wall where this bug was climbing was the kitchen 0 
i do think tom hanks is a good actor 1 
restored my phone to like new performance 1 
terrible my car will not accept this cassette 0 
soyo technology sucks 0 
have been going since 2007 and every meal has been awesome 1 
same evening him and i are both drastically sick 0 
this is the place where i first had pho and it was amazing 1 
the death row scenes were entirely unmoving 0 
i ordered the lemon raspberry ice cocktail which was also incredible 1 
everything about it is just bad 0 
and i just love the colors 1 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
this is an unbelievable bargain 1 
this mostly routine factbased tv drama gets a boost from the fine performance by cole 1 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
what on earth is irons doing in this film 0 
none of it works just dont buy it 0 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
waiter was a jerk 0 
what a waste 0 
i love it 1 
first off the reception sucks i have never had more than 2 bars ever 0 
excellent bluetooth headset 1 
totally believable 1 
i seriously cannot believe that the owner has so many unexperienced employees that all are running around like chickens with their heads cut off 0 
love the margaritas too 1 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
the vegetables are so fresh and the sauce feels like authentic thai 1 
the burger had absolutely no flavor the meat itself was totally bland the burger was overcooked and there was no charcoal flavor 0 
the soundtrack wasnt terrible either 1 
they do not last forever but is not overly expensive to replaceeasy to operate and the sound is much better than others i have tried 1 
and i really did find them funny 1 
it failed to convey the broad sweep of landscapes that were a great part of the original 0 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
why was this film made 0 
avoid this film at all costs 0 
i must say i have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again 1 
i bought this phone as a replacement for my startac and have regretted it since 0 
after the first charge kept going dead after 12 minutes 0 
i highly recommend this case 1 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
that was done in the second movie 0 
it always cuts out and makes a beep beep beep sound then says signal failed 0 
i hope this place sticks around 1 
this movie does an excellent job of revealing the complexity of the task and the incredible challenges facing south africa 1 
very very disappointed ordered the 35 big bay plater 0 
my rating just 3 out of 10 0 
my mother and brother had to do thiswhen i saw robert ryan portraying this type of man it was a very good imitation of this type of individual and i was impressed 1 
if you want a sandwich just go to any firehouse 1 
hes a national treasure 1 
i want my money back 0 
we watched our waiter pay a lot more attention to other tables and ignore us 0 
very bad experience 0 
tasted like dirt 0 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
good product good seller 1 
con spotty service 0 
do not buy if you want to use the holster 0 
the movie is terribly boring in places 0 
ryans bar is definitely one edinburgh establishment i wont be revisiting 0 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
works for me 1 
wow loved this place 1 
it was way over fried 0 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
everything was gross 0 
their chow mein is so good 1 
when i opened the sandwich i was impressed but not in a good way 0 
utterly without merit on any level this is akin to torture 0 
how this piece of trash was ever released is beyond me the acting the story the characters the supposedly special effects etcits all wrong 0 
i would recommend saving room for this 1 
i recently tried caballeros and i have been back every week since 1 
very convenient since we were staying at the mgm 1 
highly entertaining at all angles 1 
i would recommend purchasing the jabra jx10 series 2 which works flawlessly with my moto q go figure 1 
this is an excellent film 1 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
the building itself seems pretty neat the bathroom is pretty trippy but i wouldnt eat here again 0 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
the bt headset was such a disapoinment 0 
the story line is just awful 0 
utterly without merit on any level this is akin to torture 0 
integrated seamlessly with the motorola razr phone 1 
the success of the film depends on the casting of sydney greenstreet as the alexander yardley character 1 
however the keypads are so tinny that i sometimes reach the wrong buttons 0 
waited and waited and waited 0 
end of days is one of the worst bigbudget action movies ive ever seen 0 
this is the phone to get for 2005 i just bought my s710a and all i can say is wow 1 
i would recommend this 1 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
were jerks on the phone 0 
while you dont yet hear mickey speak there are tons of sound effects and music throughout the filmsomething we take for granted now but which was a huge crowd pleaser in 1928 1 
the phone crashed completely and now i have to get it replaced 0 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
no im going to eat the potato that i found some strangers hair in it 0 
sending it back 0 
highly recommend for any one who has a blue tooth phone 1 
their chow mein is so good 1 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
cant upload ringtones from a third party 0 
does not work for listening to music with the cingular 8125 0 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
raw and sublimely moving 1 
not to mention the combination of pears almonds and bacon is a big winner 1 
you share general loewenhielms exquisite joy in his partaking of the cailles en sarcophage even though you are just watching a movie but you do wish for just a small sample to savor 1 
horrible dont waste your time and money 0 
food was good service was good prices were good 1 
everything about it is fine and reasonable for the price ie 1 
to be honest with you this is unbelievable nonsense and very foolish 0 
on three different occasions i asked for well done or medium well and all three times i got the bloodiest piece of meat on my plate 0 
this phone is slim and light and the display is beautiful 1 
did not like at all 0 
his losing his marbles so early in the proceedings is totally implausible and unconvincing 0 
now this dish was quite flavourful 1 
up there with the best of melville 1 
on the negative its insipid enough to cause regret for another 2 hours of life wasted in front of the screen 0 
the food was outstanding and the prices were very reasonable 1 
good protection and does not make phone too bulky 1 
waitress was good though 1 
bluetooth range is good a few days ago i left my phone in the trunk got a call and carried the conversation without a hitch 1 
you wont forget this movie 1 
sending it back 0 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
simply beautiful 1 
this place is horrible and way overpriced 0 
hands down my favorite italian restaurant 1 
this is one of the worst sandra bullock movie since speed 2 but not quite that bad 0 
the burrittos blah 0 
the film gives meaning to the phrase never in the history of human conflict has so much been owed by so many to so few 1 
everything about it is fine and reasonable for the price ie 1 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
the movie in movie situations in the beginning and through the game that is played with her by the acting coach are fascinating 1 
everything on the menu is terrific and we were also thrilled that they made amazing accommodations for our vegetarian daughter 1 
it looses connection to the phone even when it is within a couple feet between the two 0 
if you hate earbugs avoid this phone by all means 0 
both great 1 
this case has passed the one year mark and while it shows signs of wear it is 100 functional 1 
nevertheless yet another wonderful film from the great masters stable 1 
the kids are very cool too 1 
very good stuff for the price 1 
did not like at all 0 
they are so easy to love but even more easy to identify with 1 
bad purchase 0 
this game rocks 1 
crisp and clear 1 
if youre not familiar check it out 1 
i recommend igo to anyone with different brand cell phonesmp3 players in the family 1 
the chips and sals a here is amazing 1 
i love this place 1 
if you havent gone here go now 1 
this is a witty and delightful adaptation of the dr seuss book brilliantly animated by upas finest and thoroughly deserving of its academy award 1 
we waited for forty five minutes in vain 0 
weve tried to like this place but after 10 times i think were done with them 0 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
nonlinear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well 1 
worse theres an incredibly weak subplot thrown in that follows a little band of latterday mansonites as they go after a reporter whos working on a story on the anniversary of the killings 0 
the seasonal fruit was fresh white peach puree 1 
the burger i got the gold standard a 17 burger and was kind of disappointed 0 
hackneyed writing certainly but made even worse by the bad directing 0 
nice spicy and tender 1 
not only did the software do a great job of this i could also make my own ringtones form my existing cds without an internet connection 1 
those phones are working just fine now 1 
good show samsung 1 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
it came free with a dvd player i bought but i still turned the thing off halfway through because i was embarrassed for howell 0 
this is by far the worst purchase ive made on amazon 0 
the crêpe was delicate and thin and moist 1 
good servicecheck 1 
waited and waited and waited 0 
this is one of the best italian thrillers of the early 70s 1 
very funny 1 
this company charge me a restocking fee and still not given me my refund back 0 
this place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver 0 
lousy product 0 
none of the three sizes they sent with the headset would stay in my ears 0 
penne vodka excellent 1 
the food is good 1 
cumbersome design 0 
all the bread is made inhouse 1 
i love this place 1 
you get what you pay for i guess 0 
at no point in the proceedings does it look remotely like america 0 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
it only recognizes the phone as its storage device 0 
but this movie is not funny considering the ridiculousness of it 0 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
small sleek impressive looking practical setup with ample storage in place 1 
i found the product to be easy to set up and use 1 
i have 23 bars on my cell phone when i am home but you cant not hear anything 0 
not loud enough and doesnt turn on like it should 0 
this is infuriating 0 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
today the graphics are crap 0 
the instruction manual is lacking 0 
you could only take 2 videos at a time and the quality was very poor 0 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
if you havent gone here go now 1 
disappointed 0 
plus its only 8 bucks 1 
worst service to boot but that is the least of their worries 0 
her lines seem to have been written by a fifteen year old though they are trying oh so so hard to sound like how a fifteen year old would really um you know well talk 0 
this second appearance of mickey mouse following the silent plane crazy earlier that year is probably his most famous filmmostly because it was so groundbreaking 1 
this particular model would not work with my motorola q smartphone 0 
i got this phone on reccomendation from a relative and im glad i did 1 
the poor actors 0 
penne vodka excellent 1 
i think this restaurant suffers from not trying hard enough 0 
their frozen margaritas are way too sugary for my taste 0 
nice headphones for the price and they work great 1 
which are small and not worth the price 0 
it was so boring 0 
this is a great little item 1 
theres also enough hypocrisy in this film to make me vomit 0 
pretty good beer selection too 1 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
my rating just 3 out of 10 0 
damn good steak 1 
i know he was a contract player with little control over his scripts but the acting was as bad as the script 0 
the death row scenes were entirely unmoving 0 
i got this phone on reccomendation from a relative and im glad i did 1 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
the steak and the shrimp are in my opinion the best entrees at gc 1 
only like 3 or 4 buildings used a couple of locations maybe poor hummh 0 
it features an outlandish array of memorable psychotic but lovable nuts 1 
so absolutley fantastic 1 
i purchased this and within 2 days it was no longer working 0 
it was too predictable even for a chick flick 0 
total waste of time 0 
cute quaint simple honest 1 
furthermore you cant even find hours of operation on the website 0 
the staff is always super friendly and helpful which is especially cool when you bring two small boys and a baby 1 
watching washing machine twirling around wouldnt hurt your eyes as much as this show 0 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
at any rate this film stinks its not funny and fulci should have stayed with giallo and supernatural zombie movies 0 
the script is a big flawed mess 0 
does not work for listening to music with the cingular 8125 0 
i purcashed this for the car charger and it does not work 0 
i ended up sliding it on the edge of my pants or back pockets instead 1 
service is friendly and inviting 1 
i definitly recommend 1 
everything is appalling 0 
come hungry leave happy and stuffed 1 
to summarize the food was incredible nay transcendant but nothing brings me joy quite like the memory of the pneumatic condiment dispenser 1 
they never brought a salad we asked for 0 
i loved their mussels cooked in this wine reduction the duck was tender and their potato dishes were delicious 1 
the company shipped my product very promptly and it works well 1 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
i got this phone on reccomendation from a relative and im glad i did 1 
your staff spends more time talking to themselves than me 0 
we had a group of 70 when we claimed we would only have 40 and they handled us beautifully 1 
ive had better not only from dedicated boba tea spots but even from jenni pho 0 
you could only take 2 videos at a time and the quality was very poor 0 
i really recommend this faceplates since it looks very nice elegant and cool 1 
the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach 0 
the only place good for this film is in the garbage 0 
ryans bar is definitely one edinburgh establishment i wont be revisiting 0 
excellent hands free tool 1 
my 810 score is mostly for the plot 1 
very good stuff for the price 1 
tonight i had the elk filet specialand it sucked 0 
reversible plug works great 1 
im not impressed with the concept or the food 0 
the chefs were friendly and did a good job 1 
verizon tech support walked my through a few procedures none of which worked and i ended up having to do a hard reset wiping out all my data 0 
my rating just 3 out of 10 0 
reasonably priced also 1 
it is an excellent drama an excellent thriller and an excellent film 1 
hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in 0 
i had ordered a motorola data cable got a very well finished and working product 1 
the movie has almost no action scenes in it and very little comedy 0 
gotta love those closeups of slimy drooling teeth 1 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
the chips and salsa were really good the salsa was very fresh 1 
perhaps my phone is defective but people cannot hear me when i use this 0 
the best scene in the movie was when gerardo is trying to find a song that keeps running through his head 1 
for 40 bucks a head i really expect better food 0 
my husband said she was very rude did not even apologize for the bad food or anything 0 
i dont know what kind it is but they have the best iced tea 1 
this wonderful experience made this place a muststop whenever we are in town again 1 
these are the nicest restaurant owners ive ever come across 1 
the entire audience applauded at the conclusion of the film 1 
great product 1 
logitech bluetooth headset is a 10 1 
the flat reenactments dont hold your attention because they are emotionally adrift and stagy 0 
i cant see how this movie can be an inspiration to anyone to come out or overcome fear and rejection 0 
its really easy 1 
it is not good 0 
youll love how thin it is 1 
the story starts too fast with absolutely no suspense or buildup in the slightest 0 
generous portions and great taste 1 
food was average at best 0 
excellent product for the price 1 
the basic premise is wasted since it is sidelined by the inexplicable focus on the documentary crew 0 
if you want a sandwich just go to any firehouse 1 
some applause should be given to the prelude however 1 
cant store anything but phone numbers to sim 0 
but when i check voice mail at night the keypad backlight turns off a few seconds into the first message and then im lost 0 
it wasnt busy either also the building was freezing cold 0 
seafood was limited to boiled shrimp and crab legs but the crab legs definitely did not taste fresh 0 
if you look for authentic thai food go else where 0 
we got sitting fairly fast but ended up waiting 40 minutes just to place our order another 30 minutes before the food arrived 0 
this place is handsdown one of the best places to eat in the phoenix metro area 1 
useless phone simply deaf 0 
the scallop dish is quite appalling for value as well 0 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
to those who find this movie intelligent or even masterful i can only say its your intelligence and your imagination you obviously used to try and make some sense of this pitiful attempt its in our human nature to try and make sense of things 0 
which has more depth and character than the man underneath it 0 
the goat taco didnt skimp on the meat and wow what flavor 1 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
but she is still a bad actress repeating her robotic face moves in each of her pictures 0 
restored my phone to like new performance 1 
here in the wind and the lion we see a wonderful rendering of americas own imperial age 1 
hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in 0 
simple lightweight and great fit 1 
a piece of cinematic garbage captured on celluloid 0 
its been my choice headset for yearsgreat sound good volume good noise cancellation 1 
great headset very impressed h500 1 
absolutely great 1 
the food was delicious our bartender was attentive and personable and we got a great deal 1 
the only thing really worth watching was the scenery and the house because it is beautiful 1 
the vegetables are so fresh and the sauce feels like authentic thai 1 
the plot doesnt hang together at all and the acting is absolutely appalling 0 
at a time when it seems that film animation has been dominated by disneypixars cgi masterpieces it is both refreshing and comforting to know that miyazaki is still relying on traditional handdrawn animation to tell his charming and enchanting stories 1 
doesnt work at all i bougth it for my l7c and its not working 0 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
wont work right or atleast for me 0 
filmiing was less expansive 0 
i think this restaurant suffers from not trying hard enough 0 
this movie has a cutting edge to it 1 
its just painful 0 
terrible my car will not accept this cassette 0 
i wont spoil it but the ending in pretty amazing 1 
battery is terrible 0 
the film has an ultracheap look to it 0 
using all earpieces left or right this thing will not stay on my ear 0 
i probably wont be coming back here 0 
went for lunch service was slow 0 
the lighting is awful 0 
the price was very good and with the free shipping and all it was a good purchase 1 
love the margaritas too 1 
i had to wait over 30 minutes to get my drink and longer to get 2 arepas 0 
we ordered some old classics and some new dishes after going there a few times and were sorely disappointed with everything 0 
do not waste your time 0 
i might have gotten a defect but i would not risk buying it again because of the built quality alone 0 
a great film by a great director 1 
both actors truly understand and become their particular character delivering a convincing sincere performance 1 
this is a great deal 1 
the story line is totally predictable 0 
there were too many close ups 0 
so just beware 0 
they never brought a salad we asked for 0 
good case 1 
i wasted my little money with this earpiece 0 
lousy product 0 
the plug did not work very well 0 
this case seems well made 1 
definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly will return next time im in vegas 1 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
sooooo good 1 
total brunch fail 0 
i have seen many movies starring jaclyn smith but my god this was one of her best though it came out 12 years ago 1 
a greasy unhealthy meal 0 
this is one of the better buffets that i have been to 1 
i love this phone 1 
the food is not tasty at all not to say its real traditional hunan style 0 
great price also 1 
great phone 1 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
they really want to make your experience a good one 1 
poor reliability 0 
at first glance it is a lovely bakery cafe nice ambiance clean friendly staff 1 
the burger had absolutely no flavor the meat itself was totally bland the burger was overcooked and there was no charcoal flavor 0 
theres also enough hypocrisy in this film to make me vomit 0 
all in all id expected a better consumer experience from motorola 0 
this game rocks 1 
not to mention the combination of pears almonds and bacon is a big winner 1 
everything was perfect the night we were in 1 
yes its shiny on front side and i love it 1 
yet plantronincs continues to use the same flawed charger design 0 
awesome device 1 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
bacon is hella salty 1 
there is a totally unnecessary trainroller coaster scene 0 
if you are looking for a good quality motorola headset keep looking this isnt it 0 
the fried rice was dry as well 0 
loved itfriendly servers great food wonderful and imaginative menu 1 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
yes its that bad 0 
i have to mention this and it is a huge spoiler i loved the ending how all the characters of the three films were the remaining survivors of the ferry disaster with valentine and the young judge together and the old man watching it on her tv solidifying his happiness over the suffering which he dealt with for those many years 1 
its not what it says it is 0 
however the ear pads come off easily and after only one week i lost one 0 
often the dialogue doesnt really follow from one line to another or fit the surroundings 0 
to my disbelief each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods i have ever tasted 0 
i had to go to a store and bought a new nokia phone which is working great 1 
the story which was told so eloquently by francis ford coppola 25 years earlier really unfolds gradually and leaves room for the characters to develop 1 
even the squibs look awful 0 
the warmth it generates is in contrast to its austere backdrop 1 
it crackles with an unpredictable youthful energy but honestly i found it hard to follow and concentrate on it meanders so badly 0 
his losing his marbles so early in the proceedings is totally implausible and unconvincing 0 
appears to actually outperform the original battery from china that came with my v325i 1 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
i agree with jessica this movie is pretty bad 0 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
i love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it 1 
it does everything the description said it would 1 
today was my first taste of a buldogis gourmet hot dog and i have to tell you it was more than i ever thought possible 1 
unfortunately the ability to actually know you are receiving a call is a rather important feature and this phone is pitiful in that respect 0 
aside from its terrible lead this film has loads of other debits 0 
great pizza and salads 1 
their regular toasted bread was equally satisfying with the occasional pats of butter mmmm 1 
it defeats the purpose of a bluetooth headset 0 
a truly truly bad film 0 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
special thanks to dylan t for the recommendation on what to order all yummy for my tummy 1 
good price 1 
on three different occasions i asked for well done or medium well and all three times i got the bloodiest piece of meat on my plate 0 
the hockey scenes are terrible defensemen playing like theyre 5 years old goalies diving at shots that are 10 feet wide of the net etc 0 
doesnt work at all i bougth it for my l7c and its not working 0 
there were too many close ups 0 
the design might be ergonomic in theory but i could not stand having these in my ear 0 
however the ear pads come off easily and after only one week i lost one 0 
hackneyed writing certainly but made even worse by the bad directing 0 
the characters are interesting and you want to find out more about them the longer the movie goes on and i think people will be surprised by who does and doesnt make it 1 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
would not reccommend 0 
poor sound quality 0 
the pleather case doesnt fit 0 
waited and waited and waited 0 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
it isnt even an achievement as a sobaditsgood or sobaditsmemorable movie 0 
this film and i use that word loosely is an insult to the moviegoing public 0 
the flat reenactments dont hold your attention because they are emotionally adrift and stagy 0 
new battery works great in phone 1 
frankly after cotton club and unfaithful it was kind of embarrassing to watch lane and gere in this film because it is bad 0 
i hate to disagree with my fellow yelpers but my husband and i were so disappointed with this place 0 
i have two more years left in this contract and i hate this phone 0 
has been working great 1 
omg i felt like i had never eaten thai food until this dish 1 
its a piece of crap 0 
the ambiance isnt much better 0 
good audio quality 1 
i swung in to give them a try but was deeply disappointed 0 
i was very disappointed in the movie 0 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
love this headset 1 
its very attractive and appears to be of good quality 1 
they keep getting better and better this is my third one and ive had numerous palms too 1 
in a word it is embarrassing 0 
i great reception all the time 1 
the interplay between martin and emilio contains the same wonderful chemistry we saw in wall street with martin and charlie 1 
not good by any stretch of the imagination 0 
what did bother me was the slow service 0 
just dont know why they were so slow 0 
point your finger at any item on the menu order it and you wont be disappointed 1 
buyer beware you could flush money right down the toilet 0 
these products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet 0 
50 down the drain 0 
very good though 1 
i received my supposedly new motorola 375 and apparently there was not a match between the phone and the charger 0 
i gave it 5 stars because of the sound quality 1 
works great 1 
these are certainly very comfortable and functionality is decent 1 
very disappointing 0 
the script is bad very bad  it contains both cheesiness and unethical joke that you normally see in rated r or nc17 movie 0 
speaking of the music it is unbearably predictably and kitchy 0 
i will never forget it now 1 
graphics is far from the best part of the game 0 
regardless the film fails on most levels 0 
also its slim enough to fit into my alarm clock docking station without removing the case 1 
i love my 350 headset my jabra350 bluetooth headset is great the reception is very good and the ear piece is a comfortable fit 1 
if it were possible to give them zero stars theyd have it 0 
i cant see how this movie can be an inspiration to anyone to come out or overcome fear and rejection 0 
the charger arrived within the promised timeframe but it did not work 0 
good food good service 1 
i recommend this for everyone who loves film movies anythinga work of art 1 
i might have gotten a defect but i would not risk buying it again because of the built quality alone 0 
an extensive menu provides lots of options for breakfast 1 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
if you look for authentic thai food go else where 0 
i liked it 1 
damn good steak 1 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
if you do watch it however there are small consolations the actresses playing annes sisters each do a wonderful job with their roles 1 
all i can do is whine on the internet so here it goesthe more i use the thing the less i like it 0 
in other words the content level of this film is enough to easily fill a dozen other films 1 
this place is horrible and way overpriced 0 
this place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver 0 
there were several moments in the movie that just didnt need to be there and were excruciatingly slow moving 0 
the lighting is awful 0 
for a product that costs as much as this one does i expect it to work far better and with greater ease than this thing does 0 
and i just love the colors 1 
wont work right or atleast for me 0 
i love the ownerchef his one authentic japanese cool dude 1 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
disappointing 0 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
w810i is just superb 1 
for that price i can think of a few place i would have much rather gone 0 
the service here is fair at best 0 
if there was ever an indication of a writer and a directors ability to meld two highly volatile temperaments into a seamless union of creativity then this is it 1 
im surprised this is a good quality car charger and theres not much reviews about it 1 
we ordered some old classics and some new dishes after going there a few times and were sorely disappointed with everything 0 
i love my 350 headset my jabra350 bluetooth headset is great the reception is very good and the ear piece is a comfortable fit 1 
yet i enjoy watching it 1 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
heres where the movie really pied me off 0 
i swung in to give them a try but was deeply disappointed 0 
the best scene in the movie was when gerardo is trying to find a song that keeps running through his head 1 
the service was extremely slow 0 
the ending is so so perfect youll shed a tear 1 
it had some average acting from the main person and it was a low budget as you clearly can see 0 
i love lane but ive never seen her in a movie this lousy 0 
avoid at all costs 0 
this is a great phone 1 
i will not return 0 
its pretty easy 1 
so far it has worked like a charm 1 
best breakfast buffet 1 
the steaks are all well trimmed and also perfectly cooked 1 
their daily specials are always a hit with my group 1 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
i saw this film over christmas and what a great film it was 1 
on the up side their cafe serves really good food 1 
the acting is like watching wooden puppets moving around and reading from a book thats how bad it is 0 
love the margaritas too 1 
its a fresh subtle and rather sublime effect 1 
i would highly recommend this product 1 
the worst was the salmon sashimi 0 
piece of trash 0 
earbud piece breaks easily 0 
even in my bmw 3 series which is fairly quiet i have trouble hearing what the other person is saying 0 
basically the service was very bad 0 
characters are onedimensional even the good guys and especially the bad guys 0 
then the film just dropped the ball 0 
not to mention the combination of pears almonds and bacon is a big winner 1 
lasted one day and then blew up 0 
seriously its not worth wasting your or your kids time on 0 
we loved the biscuits 1 
wed definitely go back here again 1 
this is a good joint 1 
heres where the movie really pied me off 0 
steer clear of this product and go with the genuine palm replacementr pens which come in a threepack 0 
great food 1 
the reception is excellent 1 
the only downside is the service 0 
the keyboard is a nice compromise between a full qwerty and the basic cell phone number keypad 1 
i was mortified 0 
a happy wonderful feel good ending 1 
however bt headsets are currently not good for real time games like firstperson shooters since the audio delay messes me up 0 
i went on motorolas website and followed all directions but could not get it to pair again 0 
the scripting of the subtle comedy is unmatched by any movie in recent years 1 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
for those that havent seen it dont waste your time 0 
the plot well i said id let that one go 0 
an italian reviewer called this a small great film and thats right 1 
i am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this 1 
its just lame 0 
soggy and not good 0 
i have purchased these for both family and friends and all enjoy their clarity and ease of use 1 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
the only place good for this film is in the garbage 0 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
the best place to go for a tasty bowl of pho 1 
my mother and brother had to do thiswhen i saw robert ryan portraying this type of man it was a very good imitation of this type of individual and i was impressed 1 
then theres the plot holes 0 
sooooo good 1 
my 810 score is mostly for the plot 1 
i saw this film over christmas and what a great film it was 1 
pretty cool i would say 1 
the fried rice was dry as well 0 
i think the most wonderful parts literally full of wonder are the excerpts from his works 1 
on the good side the staff was genuinely pleasant and enthusiastic a real treat 1 
i loved it 1 
waste of money 0 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
elias koteasjack palance play good roles angelina is hot and gets nakedbilly drago appears in this and is cool as usual a cameo by sven ole thorsen helps make this a very enjoyable movie with good acting and a decent budget 1 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
try them in the airport to experience some tasty food and speedy friendly service 1 
its just adorable seeing mickey playing turkey in the straw in a highly imaginative if occasionally cruel way 1 
john wayne did an incredible job for being so young in the movie industry 1 
his performance as awarded was stunning 1 
seller shipped quickly and much cheaper than the competitors 1 
damn good steak 1 
it was delicious 1 
you wont regret it 1 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
i went to bachi burger on a friends recommendation and was not disappointed 1 
first off the reception sucks i have never had more than 2 bars ever 0 
hayao miyazakis latest and eighth film for studio ghibili gake no ue no ponyo ponyo on the cliff by the sea is a wonderfully fun and imaginative look at childhood 1 
i had a pretty satifying experience 1 
waste your money on this game 1 
the lighting is just dark enough to set the mood 1 
great case and price 1 
when i saw it in the theater i thought i was going to be sick 0 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
the majority of the logitech earbud headsets failed 0 
that was done in the second movie 0 
for the price this was a great deal 1 
the owners really really need to quit being soooooo cheap let them wrap my freaking sandwich in two papers not one 0 
the worst piece of crap ever along with the verizon customer service 0 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
hackneyed writing certainly but made even worse by the bad directing 0 
great character actors telly savalas and peter boyle 1 
to my disbelief each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods i have ever tasted 0 
we had a group of 70 when we claimed we would only have 40 and they handled us beautifully 1 
ill definitely be in soon again 1 
i can take a little bad service but the food sucks 0 
best headset ever 1 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
lots of holes in the script 0 
comfortable nice range good battery life 1 
the movie seemed a little slow at first 0 
i got the aluminum case for my new palm vx and it worked really wellit has protected my handheld perfectly so far 1 
i searched the internet and found this one to be the best value 1 
the last 15 minutes of movie are also not bad as well 1 
it worked very well 1 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
if you plan to use this in a car forget about it 0 
very bad performance plays angela bennett a computer expert who is at home all the time 0 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
insults profound deuchebaggery and had to go outside for a smoke break while serving just to solidify it 0 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
but i thought his acting was skilled 1 
i believe that pitch black was done well 1 
the accompanied software is almost brilliant 1 
the service was not up to par either 0 
its like a bad two hour tv movie 0 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
small sleek impressive looking practical setup with ample storage in place 1 
then i exchanged for the same phone even that had the same problem 0 
this was a different cut than the piece the other day but still wonderful and tender s well as well flavored 1 
shrimp when i unwrapped it i live only 12 a mile from brushfire it was literally ice cold 0 
it had some average acting from the main person and it was a low budget as you clearly can see 0 
and it was way to expensive 0 
hard to judge whether these sides were good because we were grossed out by the melted styrofoam and didnt want to eat it for fear of getting sick 0 
unfortunately any virtue in this films production work was lost on a regrettable script 0 
not impressed 0 
this battery is an excellent bargain 1 
excellent product for the price 1 
talk about useless customer service 0 
small sleek impressive looking practical setup with ample storage in place 1 
and the chef was generous with his time even came around twice so we can take pictures with him 1 
good servicecheck 1 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
do not waste your time 0 
lange had become a great actress 1 
i paid the bill but did not tip because i felt the server did a terrible job 0 
this is a really fantastic thai restaurant which is definitely worth a visit 1 
i would recommend this 1 
after arguing with verizon regarding the dropped calls we returned the phones after two days 0 
the igo chargers and tips are really great 1 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
great phone 1 
not good for the money 0 
still i do like this movie for its empowerment of women theres not enough movies out there like this one 1 
i think this restaurant suffers from not trying hard enough 0 
i had a salad with the wings and some ice cream for dessert and left feeling quite satisfied 1 
it also had a new problem 0 
this place deserves one star and 90 has to do with the food 0 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
ill give this film 10 out of 10 1 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
i was deeply impressed with the character he played 1 
so good i am going to have to review this place twice once hereas a tribute to the place and once as a tribute to an event held here last night 1 
there is simply no excuse for something this poorly done 0 
rating 1 out of 10 0 
the cinematography is simply stunning to say the least and the fx are nothing if not stateoftheart 1 
we got the food and apparently they have never heard of salt and the batter on the fish was chewy 0 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
when i received my pita it was huge it did have a lot of meat in it so thumbs up there 1 
our server was very nice and even though he looked a little overwhelmed with all of our needs he stayed professional and friendly until the end 1 
hayao miyazakis latest and eighth film for studio ghibili gake no ue no ponyo ponyo on the cliff by the sea is a wonderfully fun and imaginative look at childhood 1 
omit watching this 0 
the scenery that the two daughters paint and photograph are beautiful 1 
disappointing 0 
it dit not work most of the time with my nokia 5320 0 
i have 23 bars on my cell phone when i am home but you cant not hear anything 0 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
good product incredible value 1 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
does everything it should and more 1 
he surely doesnt know how to make a coherent action movie from the screenwriter of air force one who was only obliged to write the script just for a big sum of money 0 
it is a very well acted and done tv movie 1 
how can you call yourself a steakhouse if you cant properly cook a steak i dont understand 0 
a good film by a great director 1 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
my wife had the lobster bisque soup which was lukewarm 0 
i believe that this place is a great stop for those with a huge belly and hankering for sushi 1 
the keyboard is a nice compromise between a full qwerty and the basic cell phone number keypad 1 
waited 2 hours never got either of our pizzas as many other around us who came in later did 0 
was not happy 0 
does everything it should and more 1 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
great food 1 
there are many continuity errors one other user commented on different cars in the garage joes glassesthe one that got to me the most was the fact joes facial hair configuration seemed to change from scene to scene 0 
you could drive a semi truck into these holes 0 
he is an amazing film artist one of the most important whoever lived 1 
today was my first taste of a buldogis gourmet hot dog and i have to tell you it was more than i ever thought possible 1 
the bt headset was such a disapoinment 0 
it has been a winner for us 1 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
as always the evening was wonderful and the food delicious 1 
damn good steak 1 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
in fact im going to round up to 4 stars just because she was so awesome 1 
the incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film 1 
this really is how vegas fine dining used to be right down to the menus handed to the ladies that have no prices listed 1 
does not fit 0 
there still are good actors around 1 
its pure brilliance 1 
you also cannot take pictures with it in the case because the lense is covered 0 
its quite simply the highest most superlative form of cinema imaginable 1 
his costars dont fare much better with people like morgan freeman jonah hill and ed helms just wasted 0 
very unreliable service from tmobile 0 
who in their right mind is gonna buy this battery 0 
often the dialogue doesnt really follow from one line to another or fit the surroundings 0 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
paolo sorrentino has written a wonderful story about loneliness and tony has built one of the most unforgettable characters seen in movies in recent years 1 
they really want to make your experience a good one 1 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
his performance is simply genius 1 
this place is way too overpriced for mediocre food 0 
this is a great deal 1 
all of the tapas dishes were delicious 1 
i have yet to run this new battery below two bars and thats three days without charging 1 
this one is simply a disappointment 0 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
the scripting of the subtle comedy is unmatched by any movie in recent years 1 
basically the service was very bad 0 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
i bought two of them and neither will charge 0 
if it was to turn my good day feeling into a night of disturbing memories than i guess he succeeded 0 
about ten minutes into this film i started having second thoughts 0 
what makes this story different are the terrific production values faultless photography composition and editing the terrific casting the underappreciated brian keith playing a bully teddy and vivid history 1 
awful 0 
couldnt use the unit with sunglasses not good in texas 0 
waited and waited and waited 0 
the worst was the salmon sashimi 0 
my sanyo has survived dozens of drops on blacktop without ill effect 1 
i was able to do voice dialing in the car with no problem 1 
im pleased 1 
my headset works just peachykeen 1 
design flaw 0 
why was this film made 0 
great product for the price 1 
i highly recommend this case 1 
i dont have to be an accountant to know im getting screwed 0 
unfortunately cover girl is an example of how hollywood used to exploit women for financial gain 0 
but it is great i would really recommend it 1 
this is hands down the best phone ive ever had 1 
i great reception all the time 1 
if you love death and decay and shakespears lyrics this is the one 1 
you get incredibly fresh fish prepared with care 1 
works great 1 
works great 1 
the descriptions said yum yum sauce and another said eel sauce yet another said spicy mayowell none of the rolls had sauces on them 0 
the performances are not improved by improvisation because the actors now have twice as much to worry about not only whether theyre delivering the line well but whether the line itself is any good 0 
another thing i didnt really like is when a character got punched in the face a gallon of blood would spew forth soon after 0 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
ps the only scene in the movie that was cool is when the central character finds her room blown up 1 
it was also the right balance of war and love 1 
an hour seriously 0 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
watching washing machine twirling around wouldnt hurt your eyes as much as this show 0 
you cant go wrong with any of the food here 1 
the worst phone ive ever had only had it for a few months 0 
the pizza tasted old super chewy in not a good way 0 
definitely a turn off for me i doubt ill be back unless someone else is buying 0 
omit watching this 0 
beautiful styling though 1 
waste your money on this game 1 
both great 1 
as a sushi lover avoid this place by all means 0 
cooked to perfection and the service was impeccable 1 
it even has its sweet moments 1 
if you want a real scare rent this one 1 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
the goat taco didnt skimp on the meat and wow what flavor 1 
there is a brilliant twist ending 1 
would not reccommend 0 
give this one a look 1 
weve have gotten a much better service from the pizza place next door than the services we received from this restaurant 0 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
dont waste your money 0 
i am glad i purchased it 1 
the story line is totally predictable 0 
amazon sucks 0 
an interesting premise and billy drago is always good as a dangerous nutbag side note id love to see drago stephen mchattie and lance hendrikson in a flick together talk about raging cheekbones 1 
this fixes all the problems 1 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job 1 
these were so good we ordered them twice 1 
reception is terrible and full of static 0 
it is light has plenty of battery capacity and is very confortable to wear for somewhat extended periods of time 1 
overall i am psyched to have a phone which has all my appointments and contacts in and gets great reception 1 
dont do it 0 
perhaps my phone is defective but people cannot hear me when i use this 0 
all in all id expected a better consumer experience from motorola 0 
my breakfast was perpared great with a beautiful presentation of 3 giant slices of toast lightly dusted with powdered sugar 1 
ambience is perfect 1 
the film deserves strong kudos for taking this stand for having exceptional acting from its mostly lesserknown cast and for the superintelligent script that doesnt insult the audience or take the easy way out when it comes to white racism 1 
but storm trooper is not even bad enough to make it to the list of wonderfully terrible movies 0 
i dont know what the big deal is about this place but i wont be back yaall 0 
the menu had so much good stuff on it i could not decide 1 
unfortunately it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees 0 
superb phone on a great network 1 
and i really did find them funny 1 
i purcashed this for the car charger and it does not work 0 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
nothing new there 0 
im trying to return it for a refund 0 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
i literally vomited while watching this film 0 
lame would be the best way to describe it 0 
my sister has one also and she loves it 1 
the films dialogue is natural real to life 1 
if you are looking for a good quality motorola headset keep looking this isnt it 0 
i love this phone it is very handy and has a lot of features 1 
i love this place 1 
i kept looking at the time and it had soon become 35 minutes yet still no food 0 
great brunch spot 1 
this is the phone to get for 2005 i just bought my s710a and all i can say is wow 1 
im using it with an iriver spinn with case and it fits fine 1 
awsome device works great 1 
con spotty service 0 
it sure does beat the nachos at the movies but i would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant 0 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
there are massive levels massive unlockable characters its just a massive game 1 
all in all i think it was a good investment 1 
ive seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie 0 
would recommend this item 1 
i know this is not like the other restaurants at all something is very off here 0 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
setup went very smoothly 1 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
and his subtle connections between the three films are awesome 1 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
recommend with confidence 1 
there was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters 0 
they do not last forever but is not overly expensive to replaceeasy to operate and the sound is much better than others i have tried 1 
it was forced like everything in this movie 0 
however this didnt make up for the fact that overall this was a tremendously boring movie 0 
the best scene in the movie was when gerardo is trying to find a song that keeps running through his head 1 
the desserts were a bit strange 0 
never been to hard rock casino before will never ever step forward in it again 0 
not even a hello we will be right with you 0 
it really created a unique feeling though 1 
cooked to perfection and the service was impeccable 1 
just dont know why they were so slow 0 
wed definitely go back here again 1 
during several different 2 minute calls i experienced 5 drops and it was in an area that had 5 bars 0 
the story is lame not interesting and never really explains the sinister origins of the puppets 0 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
reversible plug works great 1 
the plantains were the worst ive ever tasted 0 
we had so much to say about the place before we walked in that he expected it to be amazing but was quickly disappointed 0 
for a self proclaimed coffee cafe i was wildly disappointed 0 
we got the food and apparently they have never heard of salt and the batter on the fish was chewy 0 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
then our food came out disappointment ensued 0 
the lighting is just dark enough to set the mood 1 
cooked to perfection and the service was impeccable 1 
for 40 bucks a head i really expect better food 0 
everyone is very attentive providing excellent customer service 1 
poor voice clarity 0 
there were several moments in the movie that just didnt need to be there and were excruciatingly slow moving 0 
do not waste your time 0 
the presentation of the food was awful 0 
one more thing i can tolerate political incorrectness very well im all for artistic freedom and suspension of disbelief but the slavic female character was just too much 0 
go to place for gyros 1 
i am so pleased to know such a modern day genius is out there letting is passion for art drive him and taking us as an audience with him 1 
this movie is terrible 0 
constantine gives everything the right intensity and seems to have a good understanding of the underlying psychological motivations 1 
the result is a powerhouse achievement made more timely now perhaps because of our cultures disturbing fascination with celebrity and its distorted interpretations of fame 1 
the turkey and roast beef were bland 0 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
it will drive you barking mad 0 
best tater tots in the southwest 1 
piece of trash 0 
i kept catching the cable on the seat and i had to pull the phone out to turn it on an off 0 
i always order from the vegetarian menu during dinner which has a wide array of options to choose from 1 
so absolutley fantastic 1 
hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in 0 
it was an inexpensive piece but i would still have expected better quality 0 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
the keyboard is a nice compromise between a full qwerty and the basic cell phone number keypad 1 
doesnt work at all i bougth it for my l7c and its not working 0 
i guess that nobody at the network that aired this dribble watched it before putting it on 0 
recommend with confidence 1 
its an empty hollow shell of a movie 0 
not as good as i had hoped 0 
very disappointed and wondered how it could be in the oscar shortlist 0 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
waiter was a jerk 0 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
i love the ownerchef his one authentic japanese cool dude 1 
the ripped banana was not only ripped but petrified and tasteless 0 
dont buy this product 0 
cant store anything but phone numbers to sim 0 
in fact its hard to remember that the part of ray charles is being acted and not played by the man himself 1 
it is just the sort of pap that is screened in the afternoon to punish the unemployed for not having jobs 0 
it is the best charger i have seen on the market yet 1 
1010 1 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
weird vibe from owners 0 
i found this move beautiful enjoyable and uplifting 1 
the loudspeaker option is great the bumpers with the lights is very appealing 0 
not impressed 0 
finally after three or four times the spring of the latch broke and i could not use it any longer on the visor 0 
all the characters in this film are tremendously well played 1 
still waiting im sure this item would work well if i ever recieve it 0 
definitely worth checking out 1 
i cant see how this movie can be an inspiration to anyone to come out or overcome fear and rejection 0 
wonderful lil tapas and the ambience made me feel all warm and fuzzy inside 1 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
as for the service im a fan because its quick and youre being served by some nice folks 1 
brilliance indeed 1 
i had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get some relief 0 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
this item is fantastic and works perfectly 1 
this place is not worth your time let alone vegas 0 
we watched our waiter pay a lot more attention to other tables and ignore us 0 
very satisifed with that 1 
excellent service 1 
this movie is greatespecially if you enjoy visual arts 1 
hell no will i go back 0 
the ambiance was incredible 1 
disapointing results 0 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
dessert panna cotta was amazing 1 
on the ground right next to our table was a large smeared beensteppedinandtrackedeverywhere pile of green bird poop 0 
so in a nutshell 1 the restaraunt smells like a combination of a dirty fish market and a sewer 0 
even if you love bad movies do not watch this movie 0 
if i take a picture the battery drops a bar and starts beeping letting me know its dieing 0 
an absolute must visit 1 
it has been a winner for us 1 
very good product well made 1 
good food good service 1 
friends pasta also bad he barely touched it 0 
left very frustrated 0 
i will come back here every time im in vegas 1 
i mean really how do you get so famous for your fish and chips when its so terrible 0 
however after finally watching this film i realized that not only had i had a closed mind to the brilliance it depicts i also found myself watching it over and over again 1 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
the management is rude 0 
voice recognition is tremendous 1 
great hands free device 1 
razr battery good buy 1 
yes this film does require a rather significant amount of puzzlesolving but the pieces fit together to create a beautiful picture 1 
o my gosh the best phone i have ever had 1 
i dont like this nokia either 0 
the ending is so so perfect youll shed a tear 1 
absolutely great 1 
a good time 1 
rip off over charge shipping 0 
it wasnt busy at all and now we know why 0 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
before i go in to why i gave a 1 star rating please know that this was my third time eating at bachi burger before writing a review 0 
the last 15 minutes of movie are also not bad as well 1 
the film is way too long 0 
tied to charger for conversations lasting more than 45 minutesmajor problems 0 
youll love how thin it is 1 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
works well 1 
bought mainly for the charger which broke soon after purchasing 0 
would come back again if i had a sushi craving while in vegas 1 
this isnt a small family restaurant this is a fine dining establishment 1 
i like design and look of jabra behing the ear headsets and 5020 is pretty comfortible to wear 24 hours a day without pain in the ear 1 
call me a nut but i think this is one of the best movies ever 1 
great value 1 
i especially liked the noncliche choices with the parents in other movies i could predict the dialog verbatim but the writing in this movie made better selections 1 
to my disbelief each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods i have ever tasted 0 
jawbone era is awesome too 1 
the seasonal fruit was fresh white peach puree 1 
disappointed 0 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
my phone doesnt slide around my car now and the grip prevents my phone from slipping out of my hand 1 
overall i wasnt very impressed with noca 0 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
i had ordered a motorola data cable got a very well finished and working product 1 
once you get inside youll be impressed with the place 1 
terrible phone holder 0 
the directing seems too pretentious 0 
sam shepards portrayal of a gung ho marine was sobering 1 
this really is how vegas fine dining used to be right down to the menus handed to the ladies that have no prices listed 1 
the voice recognition thru the handset is excellent 1 
piece of junk 0 
try them in the airport to experience some tasty food and speedy friendly service 1 
this phone is slim and light and the display is beautiful 1 
the owners really really need to quit being soooooo cheap let them wrap my freaking sandwich in two papers not one 0 
its reception is very very poor 0 
this movie totally grates on my nerves 0 
rating 010 grade z note the show is so bad that even mother of the cast pull her daughter out of the show 0 
there was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters 0 
this product is great it makes working a lot easier i can go to the copier while waiting on hold for something 1 
kind of flops around 0 
it also had a new problem 0 
there is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again 0 
the ri style calamari was a joke 0 
i seriously cannot believe that the owner has so many unexperienced employees that all are running around like chickens with their heads cut off 0 
i have to mention this and it is a huge spoiler i loved the ending how all the characters of the three films were the remaining survivors of the ferry disaster with valentine and the young judge together and the old man watching it on her tv solidifying his happiness over the suffering which he dealt with for those many years 1 
to sum the film up breeders is a terrible cheaply made horror movie that should be avoided like the ebola virus 0 
the cashew cream sauce was bland and the vegetables were undercooked 0 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
nicest chinese restaurant ive been in a while 1 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
krussel always good 1 
needless to say we will never be back here again 0 
the servers went back and forth several times not even so much as an are you being helped 0 
if that bug never showed up i would have given a 4 for sure but on the other side of the wall where this bug was climbing was the kitchen 0 
the cashier was friendly and even brought the food out to me 1 
i go to far too many places and ive never seen any restaurant that serves a 1 egg breakfast especially for 400 0 
go and see it 1 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
the films dialogue is natural real to life 1 
please dont waste your money 0 
con spotty service 0 
ive dropped my phone more times than i can say even on concrete and my phone is still great knock on wood 1 
this film and i use that word loosely is an insult to the moviegoing public 0 
i was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar not only because the quality is great but the service is fast and the food impeccable 1 
w810i is just superb 1 
1010 1 
do not purchase this phone 0 
a usable keyboard actually turns a pda into a realworld useful machine instead of just a neat gadget 1 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
took an hour to get our food only 4 tables in restaurant my food was luke warm our sever was running around like he was totally overwhelmed 0 
a fantastic neighborhood gem 1 
rating 010 grade z note the show is so bad that even mother of the cast pull her daughter out of the show 0 
they dropped more than the ball 0 
either way it sucks 0 
the shower area is outside so you can only rinse not take a full shower unless you dont mind being nude for everyone to see 0 
i am very impressed with the job that motorola did on the sturdiness of this phone 1 
its a sad movie but very good 1 
im trying to return it for a refund 0 
i am so tired of clichés that is just lazy writing and here they come in thick and fast 0 
the restaurant is very clean and has a family restaurant feel to it 1 
it looses connection to the phone even when it is within a couple feet between the two 0 
this does not fit the palm tungsten e2 and it broke the first time i tried to plug it in 0 
dont waste your money and time 0 
buyer beware you could flush money right down the toilet 0 
we got the food and apparently they have never heard of salt and the batter on the fish was chewy 0 
if this premise sound stupid thats because it is 0 
which has more depth and character than the man underneath it 0 
i have had problems wit hit dropping signal and more 0 
the fried rice was dry as well 0 
the only suspense i was feeling was the frustration at just how retarded the girls were 0 
the bottowm lineanother worthless cheap gimmick from sprint 0 
very disappointing 0 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
this company charge me a restocking fee and still not given me my refund back 0 
i can barely ever hear on it and am constantly saying what 0 
service was very prompt 1 
it is just the sort of pap that is screened in the afternoon to punish the unemployed for not having jobs 0 
the movie lacks visual interest drama expression of feeling and celebration of the very patriotism that underlines the narrative 0 
item does not match picture 0 
headset works great was packaged nicely to avoid any damage 1 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
plug was the wrong size 0 
the instruction manual is lacking 0 
everything was fresh and delicious 1 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
product is useless since it does not have enough charging current to charge the 2 cellphones i was planning to use it with 0 
also were served hot bread and butter and home made potato chips with bacon bits on topvery original and very good 1 
which is precisely why i am giving it such a bad review 0 
you truly take this journey through the eyes and soul of a child 1 
we wont be going back anytime soon 0 
again no plot at all 0 
it was absolutely amazing 1 
cheap but hey it works was pleasantly suprised given the low cost of this item 1 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
im terribly disappointed that this film would receive so many awards and accolades especially when there are far more deserving works of film out there 0 
utterly without merit on any level this is akin to torture 0 
unfortunately it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees 0 
the films dialogue is natural real to life 1 
it was horrible 0 
only pros large seating area nice bar area great simple drink menu the best brick oven pizza with homemade dough 1 
in addition it feels amp looks as if the phone is all lightweight cheap plastic 0 
long whiny and pointless 0 
the story is beyond stupid 0 
so i basically threw my money out the window for nothing 0 
as a sushi lover avoid this place by all means 0 
the ending is so so perfect youll shed a tear 1 
restored my phone to like new performance 1 
the writer gorman bechard undoubtedly did his homework because all references are industry and characterage appropriate 1 
long whiny and pointless 0 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
the food sucked which we expected but it sucked more than we could have imagined 0 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
i could not understand what kind of idiot would produce this mess in the first place not to mention several season 0 
my salad had a bland vinegrette on the baby greens and hearts of palm 0 
all in all im quite satisfied with this purchase 1 
i like armand assante my cable companys summary sounded interesting so i watched it twice already and probably will again 1 
this product is clearly not ready for prime time i dont care how cool it looks if you cant tell a call is coming in its worthless 0 
im in az all the time and now have my new spot 1 
from here on the widmark character turns unintentionally comical 0 
its quite simply the highest most superlative form of cinema imaginable 1 
tried to go here for lunch and it was a madhouse 0 
for those that havent seen it dont waste your time 0 
they have great dinners 1 
im terribly disappointed that this film would receive so many awards and accolades especially when there are far more deserving works of film out there 0 
very good stuff for the price 1 
buttons are too small 0 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
needless to say we will never be back here again 0 
i got to enjoy the seafood salad with a fabulous vinegrette 1 
beautiful styling though 1 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
definitely worth checking out 1 
but in terms of the writing its very fresh and bold 1 
you wont forget this movie 1 
avoid this film at all costs 0 
kris kristoffersen is good in this movie and really makes a difference 1 
the salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop which was perfectly cooked 1 
i received my headset in good time and was happy with it 1 
this phone might well be the worst ive ever had in any brand 0 
at a time when it seems that film animation has been dominated by disneypixars cgi masterpieces it is both refreshing and comforting to know that miyazaki is still relying on traditional handdrawn animation to tell his charming and enchanting stories 1 
join the club and get awesome offers via email 1 
the script is horrendously stupid 0 
at around 4 pm i bought it at around 8pm i started to watch at around 815pm i fast forwarded the remaining film to see if there was anything left watchable for a human being with a brain but there wasnt 0 
hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in 0 
all the actors give a wonderful performance especially jennifer rubin as jamie harris who changes from the nervous starlet in the beginning through the strange events she is part of to the cool star 1 
damian is so talented and versatile in so many ways of writing and portraying different characters on screen 1 
i immediately said i wanted to talk to the manager but i did not want to talk to the guy who was doing shots of fireball behind the bar 0 
when my order arrived one of the gyros was missing 0 
after trying many many handsfree gadgets this is the one that finally works well 1 
it wasnt busy either also the building was freezing cold 0 
i give it 2 thumbs down 0 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
avoid at all costs 0 
his costars dont fare much better with people like morgan freeman jonah hill and ed helms just wasted 0 
just reading on the specs alone makes you say wow 1 
its a sad movie but very good 1 
waitress was sweet and funny 1 
never again will i be dining at this place 0 
will order from them again 1 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
to be honest with you this is unbelievable nonsense and very foolish 0 
i only hear garbage for audio 0 
comes with a strong light that you can use to light up your camera shots and even flash sos signals seriously 1 
also the phone doesnt seem to accept anything except cbr mp3s preferably ripped by windows media player 0 
these are the central themes of the film and they are handled ineptly stereotypically and with no depth of imagination 0 
actually the graphics were good at the time 1 
highquality chicken on the chicken caesar salad 1 
even allowing for poor production values for the time 1971 and the format some kind of miniseries this is baaaaaad 0 
it was a very superficial movie and it gave me the feeling that i was watching play rather than a film 0 
there is a totally unnecessary trainroller coaster scene 0 
nice blanket of moz over top but i feel like this was done to cover up the subpar food 1 
the stories were powerful explorations of the nature of man and of art 1 
works well 1 
up there with the best of melville 1 
i was very excited to get this headset because i thought it was really cute 1 
as always the evening was wonderful and the food delicious 1 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
bad purchase 0 
the service was great even the manager came and helped with our table 1 
you need at least 3 mins to get to your phone book from the time you first turn on the phonebattery life is short 0 
however bt headsets are currently not good for real time games like firstperson shooters since the audio delay messes me up 0 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
crisp and clear 1 
not only did the software do a great job of this i could also make my own ringtones form my existing cds without an internet connection 1 
not loud enough and doesnt turn on like it should 0 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
the pairing of the two devices was so easy it barely took a couple minutes before i started making calls with the voice dialing feature 1 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
for a product that costs as much as this one does i expect it to work far better and with greater ease than this thing does 0 
muddy low quality sound and the casing around the wires insert was poorly super glued and slid off 0 
saw the movie today and thought it was a good effort good messages for kids 1 
logitech bluetooth headset is a 10 1 
the plastic breaks really easy on this clip 0 
very good phone 1 
it is a really good show to watch 1 
well never go again 0 
the acting was bad the dialogs were extremely shallow and insincere 0 
service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is vegas and located inside the crystals shopping mall by aria 1 
i have tried these cables with my computer and my ipod and it works just fine 1 
graphics is far from the best part of the game 0 
the voice recognition thru the handset is excellent 1 
worst martini ever 0 
items stated as included from the description are not included 0 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
nothing special 0 
only had this a month but its worked flawlessly so far 1 
the movie is littered with overt racial slurs towards the black cast members and in return the whites are depicted as morons and boobs 0 
so badwellits just bad 0 
verizons bills however are difficult to understand even though their pricing plans are simple 0 
the only thing i wasnt too crazy about was their guacamole as i dont like it puréed 0 
the construction of the headsets is poor 0 
very bad performance plays angela bennett a computer expert who is at home all the time 0 
for a product that costs as much as this one does i expect it to work far better and with greater ease than this thing does 0 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
the battery runs down quickly 0 
i gave it a 10 1 
then the film just dropped the ball 0 
reception is terrible and full of static 0 
we asked for the bill to leave without eating and they didnt bring that either 0 
not my thing 0 
in summary this was a largely disappointing dining experience 0 
id like to return it 0 
the results well are a shame 0 
the food was terrible 0 
im happy about this purchase good quality and low price 1 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
oh the charger seems to work fine 1 
i cant use this case because the smell is disgusting 0 
this was one of the worst films i have ever seen 0 
his use of the colours of the french flag in the three films was nothing short of incredible every shot every scene was like a work of art 1 
def coming back to bowl next time 1 
there is no plot here to keep you going in the first place 0 
item arrived quickly and works great with my metro pcs samsung schr450 slider phone and sony premium sound in ear plugs 1 
not a weekly haunt but definitely a place to come back to every once in a while 1 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
it clicks into place in a way that makes you wonder how long that mechanism would last 0 
very comfortable 1 
horrible horrible protector 0 
nonlinear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well 1 
you never know if you pushed it hard enough or the right number of times for the function you want or not 0 
john wayne did an incredible job for being so young in the movie industry 1 
the service was a bit lacking 0 
service was exceptional and food was a good as all the reviews 1 
waitress was good though 1 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
worked great 1 
this place is handsdown one of the best places to eat in the phoenix metro area 1 
but the convoluted plot just didnt convince me and much of the film was watched with a weird questioning glance 0 
their daily specials are always a hit with my group 1 
not enough volume 0 
the chips and salsa were really good the salsa was very fresh 1 
i want to first say our server was great and we had perfect service 1 
the reception is excellent 1 
i dont know exactly what it is about this movie but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our familys memories 1 
its been my choice headset for yearsgreat sound good volume good noise cancellation 1 
happy so far 1 
obviously they have a terrible customer service so you get what you pay for 0 
overall i like there food and the service 1 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
my order was not correct 0 
my phone doesnt slide around my car now and the grip prevents my phone from slipping out of my hand 1 
steer clear of this product and go with the genuine palm replacementr pens which come in a threepack 0 
after trying many many handsfree gadgets this is the one that finally works well 1 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
another note about this phones appearance is that it really looks rather bland especially in the all black model 0 
i vomited in the bathroom mid lunch 0 
the new characters werent all that memorable and i found myself forgetting who was who 0 
id rather eat airline food seriously 0 
the dialogue sucked 0 
this movie is so awesome 1 
tom wilkinson broke my heart at the end and everyone elses judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike 1 
very disappointed and wondered how it could be in the oscar shortlist 0 
do not waste your money here 0 
a fly was in my apple juice a fly 0 
i guess that nobody at the network that aired this dribble watched it before putting it on 0 
the waitresses are very friendly 1 
totally different with loads of understatement and black comedy this is a film few get to see but those who do will remember it 1 
all in all ha long bay was a bit of a flop 0 
also the story and acting were weak 0 
he really didnt seem to want to be hosting his voiceovers were monotonous didnt get involved with the guests 0 
however this didnt make up for the fact that overall this was a tremendously boring movie 0 
i would highly recommend this product 1 
in addition it feels amp looks as if the phone is all lightweight cheap plastic 0 
plus it was wellpaced and suited its relatively short run time 1 
the inside is really quite nice and very clean 1 
ray charles is legendary 1 
the tracfonewebsite is user friendly and makes it easy toactivate etc 1 
i was seated immediately 1 
the story is lame not interesting and never really explains the sinister origins of the puppets 0 
setup went very smoothly 1 
verizons bills however are difficult to understand even though their pricing plans are simple 0 
great time family dinner on a sunday night 1 
phone now holds charge like it did when it was new 1 
i wont be back 0 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
there are many continuity errors one other user commented on different cars in the garage joes glassesthe one that got to me the most was the fact joes facial hair configuration seemed to change from scene to scene 0 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
for the price on amazon it is an excellent product which i would highly recommend 1 
the only place good for this film is in the garbage 0 
there was no chemistry between ben affleck and sandra bullock in this film and i couldnt understand why he would consider even leaving his wifetobe for this chick that he supposedly was knocked out by 0 
yet plantronincs continues to use the same flawed charger design 0 
the price is reasonable and the service is great 1 
good show samsung 1 
ive had no trouble accessing the internet downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions 1 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
shes poised and amazing 1 
overall i was not impressed and would not go back 0 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
all in all ha long bay was a bit of a flop 0 
i just cant explain this movie more than romanticcharminghilariousand adorablethe junkyard scenes are funnyall the junkyard dogs have something specialtoo funny i laughedkids will love itbuy it when it comes outit has new features 1 
it is just the sort of pap that is screened in the afternoon to punish the unemployed for not having jobs 0 
warning stay away 0 
i cannot make calls at certain places 0 
it was just too horrible 0 
oh and i forgot to also mention the weird color effect it has on your phone 0 
all in all i think it was a good investment 1 
this movie now joins revenge of the boogeyman and zombiez as part of the hellish trinity of horror films 0 
it kept getting worse and worse so now im officially done 0 
great product for the price 1 
service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is vegas and located inside the crystals shopping mall by aria 1 
the plug did not work very well 0 
if you are razr owneryou must have this 1 
people who like european films and art movies will like this movie 1 
this is an outstanding little restaurant with some of the best food i have ever tasted 1 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
i have yet to run this new battery below two bars and thats three days without charging 1 
it fits so securely that the ear hook does not even need to be used and the sound is better directed through your ear canal 1 
totally believable 1 
the staff are great the ambiance is great 1 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
the dialogue sucked 0 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
one of the most disappointing aspects is the lack of notable gore 0 
the movie is full of wonderful dancing hence the title 1 
i was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar not only because the quality is great but the service is fast and the food impeccable 1 
the plot such as it is is so derivative and predictable that the ending is like a mercy killing 0 
a good quality bargain i bought this after i bought a cheapy from big lots that sounded awful and people on the other end couldnt hear me 1 
its extremely slow and takes forever to do anything with it 0 
shrimp when i unwrapped it i live only 12 a mile from brushfire it was literally ice cold 0 
its also great to see that renowned silent screenwriter frances marion hasnt missed a step going from silent to sound 1 
i enjoyed reading this book to my children when they were little 1 
the phone takes forever to charge like 2 to 5 hours literally 0 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
not easy to watch 0 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
up there with the best of melville 1 
waitress was sweet and funny 1 
yes its shiny on front side and i love it 1 
however after about a year the fliptop started to get loose and wobbly and eventually my screen went black and i couldnt receive and place calls 0 
very serious spoilers this movie was a huge disappointment 0 
in my house i was getting dropped coverage upstairs and no coverage in my basement 0 
who in their right mind is gonna buy this battery 0 
its too bad the food is so damn generic 0 
the lines the cuts the audio everything is wrong 0 
i love the ringtones because they are so upbeat 1 
i was particularly pleased with the acting ability of dwight schultz 1 
i keep watching it over and over 1 
the ambiance isnt much better 0 
doesnt hold charge 0 
even in my bmw 3 series which is fairly quiet i have trouble hearing what the other person is saying 0 
this movie does an excellent job of revealing the complexity of the task and the incredible challenges facing south africa 1 
it was packed 0 
very good quality though 1 
in fact im going to round up to 4 stars just because she was so awesome 1 
both actors truly understand and become their particular character delivering a convincing sincere performance 1 
i dont recommend unless your car breaks down in front of it and you are starving 0 
up there with the best of melville 1 
plantronics bluetooth excelent buy 1 
doesnt hold charge 0 
nonlinear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well 1 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
its not what it says it is 0 
yet plantronincs continues to use the same flawed charger design 0 
very good quality though 1 
level 5 spicy was perfect where spice didnt overwhelm the soup 1 
the chips and salsa were really good the salsa was very fresh 1 
trying to make a call on these is an exercise in frustration 0 
this is one of the better buffets that i have been to 1 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
i will continue to come here on ladies night andddd date night highly recommend this place to anyone who is in the area 1 
i really loved the story line and the poler bear was kinda cutebut if anyone has a question about fort steele just ask away 1 
it was a great phone 1 
great product 1 
the steaks are all well trimmed and also perfectly cooked 1 
i wasted my little money with this earpiece 0 
integrated seamlessly with the motorola razr phone 1 
his performance is simply genius 1 
the movie seemed a little slow at first 0 
then the film just dropped the ball 0 
i promise they wont disappoint 1 
i have had tmobile service for 2 or 3 years now and i am pretty happy with it 1 
i love this device 1 
you need two hands to operate the screenthis software interface is decade old and cannot compete with new software designs 0 
nice headphones for the price and they work great 1 
it is perfect for a sitdown family meal or get together with a few friends 1 
this is an excellent film 1 
110 and only because there is no setting for 010 0 
so they performed 1 
best of luck to the rude and noncustomer service focused new management 0 
the potato chip order was sad i could probably count how many chips were in that box and it was probably around 12 0 
1010 1 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
you can watch them preparing the delicious food 1 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
it was also the right balance of war and love 1 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
the story line is just awful 0 
nicest chinese restaurant ive been in a while 1 
i wont spoil it but the ending in pretty amazing 1 
what this film lacks is a convincing script 0 
sauce was tasteless 0 
the design is very good4 1 
i wear it everyday and it holds up very well 1 
i would highly recommend this product 1 
please dont waste your money 0 
seriously flavorful delights folks 1 
this is a simple little phone to use but the breakage is unacceptible 0 
never got it 0 
we recently witnessed her poor quality of management towards other guests as well 0 
overall i would recommend this phone over the new walkman 1 
very good stuff for the price 1 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
poor construction 0 
it is not good 0 
very good lunch spot 1 
i love this bluetooth 1 
we got the food and apparently they have never heard of salt and the batter on the fish was chewy 0 
the reception has been generally good 1 
the only place good for this film is in the garbage 0 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
great food and service huge portions and they give a military discount 1 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
great earpiece 1 
the screen size is big key pad lit well enough and the camera quality is excellent for a camera phone 1 
this isnt a small family restaurant this is a fine dining establishment 1 
theres barely a boring moment in the film and there are plenty of humorous parts 1 
i paid too much 0 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
if only someone involved with it knew how to string together narrative 0 
in other words the content level of this film is enough to easily fill a dozen other films 1 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
this one is simply a disappointment 0 
this place is not worth your time let alone vegas 0 
either way it sucks 0 
an italian reviewer called this a small great film and thats right 1 
i only hear garbage for audio 0 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
on a positive note our server was very attentive and provided great service 1 
i cannot believe that the actors agreed to do this film 0 
really ugly 0 
the nachos are a must have 1 
end of days is one of the worst bigbudget action movies ive ever seen 0 
earbud piece breaks easily 0 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
bt50 battery junk 0 
talk about great customer service of course we will be back 1 
their menu is diverse and reasonably priced 1 
i am so pleased to know such a modern day genius is out there letting is passion for art drive him and taking us as an audience with him 1 
on a positive note our server was very attentive and provided great service 1 
i think the most wonderful parts literally full of wonder are the excerpts from his works 1 
very disappointed 0 
as many people complained i found this headsets microphone was very weak 0 
even when the women finally show up there is no sign of improvement the most expected things happen and by the time the film is over you might be far asleep 0 
but she is still a bad actress repeating her robotic face moves in each of her pictures 0 
it probably would have been better if the director hadnt spent most of the movie showcasing his own art work which really isnt that noteworthy 0 
its like a really sexy party in your mouth where youre outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party 1 
the descriptions said yum yum sauce and another said eel sauce yet another said spicy mayowell none of the rolls had sauces on them 0 
for a self proclaimed coffee cafe i was wildly disappointed 0 
you need at least 3 mins to get to your phone book from the time you first turn on the phonebattery life is short 0 
the films sole bright spot was jonah hill who will look almost unrecognizable to fans of the recent superbad due to the amount of weight he lost in the interim 1 
this movie is a good and humorous comment on life in 2006 1 
really ugly 0 
a great film by a great director 1 
the casting is also horrible cause all you see is a really really bad actors period 0 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
punishment park is a brilliant piece of cinema 1 
service was exceptional and food was a good as all the reviews 1 
i was very pleased to see that i could replace my well travled swivel holster for my blackberry flip 1 
the staff are also very friendly and efficient 1 
exceptionally bad 0 
so bad 0 
this is a great restaurant at the mandalay bay 1 
eew this location needs a complete overhaul 0 
even in my bmw 3 series which is fairly quiet i have trouble hearing what the other person is saying 0 
maybe there would be a reasonable explanation for this atrocity 0 
i think that it is a must see older john wayne film 1 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
the food was outstanding and the prices were very reasonable 1 
buttons are too small 0 
in addition it feels amp looks as if the phone is all lightweight cheap plastic 0 
i tried talking real loud but shouting on the telephone gets old and i was still told it wasnt great 0 
painful on the ear 0 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
i especially liked the noncliche choices with the parents in other movies i could predict the dialog verbatim but the writing in this movie made better selections 1 
i didnt know pulled pork could be soooo delicious 1 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
much better than the other ayce sushi place i went to in vegas 1 
this pda rocks 1 
i have always used corded headsets and the freedom from the wireless is very helpful 1 
voice recognition is tremendous 1 
dont waste your money 0 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
i highly recommend these and encourage people to give them a try 1 
im translating movies for a living and this is the first movie in my 5year working experience that i found offensive to my intelligence 0 
anyway the plot flowed smoothly and the malebonding scenes were a hoot 1 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
i definitly recommend 1 
the earpiece on this is too large or too heavyit keeps falling out of my ear 0 
definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly will return next time im in vegas 1 
this movie contained an allstar cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i havent seen before 1 
in addition it feels amp looks as if the phone is all lightweight cheap plastic 0 
fans of the genre will be in heaven 1 
phone now holds charge like it did when it was new 1 
this is a great product sure beats using your fingers 1 
that was done in the second movie 0 
the plot is nonsense that doesnt interest in the slightest way or have any uniqueness to it 0 
there is a totally unnecessary trainroller coaster scene 0 
the food was terrible 0 
if only someone involved with it knew how to string together narrative 0 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
obviously they have a terrible customer service so you get what you pay for 0 
extremely tasty 1 
simply beautiful 1 
not good by any stretch of the imagination 0 
only pros large seating area nice bar area great simple drink menu the best brick oven pizza with homemade dough 1 
i rate this movie 910 1 
this film offers many delights and surprises 1 
the food was terrible 0 
i cant use this case because the smell is disgusting 0 
we literally sat there for 20 minutes with no one asking to take our order 0 
we waited for thirty minutes to be seated although there were 8 vacant tables and we were the only folks waiting 0 
i highly recommend this modest priced cellular phone 1 
im super pissd 0 
this movie is greatespecially if you enjoy visual arts 1 
this place lacked style 0 
there is a brilliant twist ending 1
