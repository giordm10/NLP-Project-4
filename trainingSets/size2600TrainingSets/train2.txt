i never walked out of a movie faster 0 
the soundtrack wasnt terrible either 1 
everything captain howdy says is either laughable or just plain stupid 0 
the most annoying thing about cover girl is the way in which rita hayworth is put up on a pedestal 0 
if you have several dozen or several hundred contacts then imagine the fun of sending each of them one by one 0 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
the concert sequences just sucked 0 
not a good bargain 0 
we literally sat there for 20 minutes with no one asking to take our order 0 
i didnt know pulled pork could be soooo delicious 1 
brilliant 1 
ive also had problems with the phone reading the memory card in which i always turn it on and then off again 0 
this was my first time and i cant wait until the next 1 
the acting sucks the music sucks the script sucks the pacing sucks the special fx suck the directing sucks basically this movie sucks 0 
this film highlights the fundamental flaws of the legal process that its not about discovering guilt or innocence but rather is about who presents better in court 1 
the food was delicious our bartender was attentive and personable and we got a great deal 1 
its aggravating 0 
i highly recommend this case 1 
i got the car charger and not even after a week the charger was brokeni went to plug it in and it started smoking 0 
damn good steak 1 
the staff are also very friendly and efficient 1 
this film has no redeeming features 0 
it lasts less than 3o minutes if i actually try to use the phonemy wife has the same phone with the same problem 0 
10 out of 10 for both the movie and trilogy 1 
im still trying to get over how bad it was 0 
only had this a month but its worked flawlessly so far 1 
i recommend this for everyone who loves film movies anythinga work of art 1 
product is useless since it does not have enough charging current to charge the 2 cellphones i was planning to use it with 0 
nothing new there 0 
about 30 minutes of footage is wasted to show mediocre elderly actors awkwardly babbling overwrought pseudosatanic gibberish corny enough to make a teen goth blush almost always in olde english and sometimes in latin that may or may not be made up words 0 
if there was ever a movie that needed wordofmouth to promote this is it 1 
however the keypads are so tinny that i sometimes reach the wrong buttons 0 
probably never coming back and wouldnt recommend it 0 
best of luck to the rude and noncustomer service focused new management 0 
by the time the film ended i not only disliked it i despised it 0 
i didnt know pulled pork could be soooo delicious 1 
i had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get some relief 0 
they do not care about the consumer one bit 0 
the casting is also horrible cause all you see is a really really bad actors period 0 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
blue ant is easy to use 1 
very true to shakespear and a must for all shakespear fans 1 
someone shouldve invented this sooner 1 
nine out of ten for a truly lovely film 1 
the design might be ergonomic in theory but i could not stand having these in my ear 0 
duris has a wholesome appearance and gives a fine performance 1 
ray charles is legendary 1 
very nice and relaxing late night viewing 1 
the tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu 0 
very nice and relaxing late night viewing 1 
very good phone 1 
the cast is good 1 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
it plays louder than any other speaker of this size the price is so low that most would think the quality is lacking however its not 1 
it is not good 0 
appetite instantly gone 0 
i do think tom hanks is a good actor 1 
so just beware 0 
both of the egg rolls were fantastic 1 
gets a signal when other verizon phones wont 1 
i wouldnt return 0 
after arguing with verizon regarding the dropped calls we returned the phones after two days 0 
overall i wasnt very impressed with noca 0 
i really dont see how anyone could enjoy this movie 0 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
this is a great little item 1 
im in az all the time and now have my new spot 1 
the lighting is just dark enough to set the mood 1 
the live music on fridays totally blows 0 
this place is good 1 
a good commentary of todays love and undoubtedly a film worth seeing 1 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
i mean really how do you get so famous for your fish and chips when its so terrible 0 
terrible my car will not accept this cassette 0 
couldnt ask for a more satisfying meal 1 
i have 23 bars on my cell phone when i am home but you cant not hear anything 0 
definitely worth checking out 1 
hated it 0 
third the cheese on my friends burger was cold 0 
was not happy 0 
setup went very smoothly 1 
the refried beans that came with my meal were dried out and crusty and the food was bland 0 
i love this thing 1 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
food was good service was good prices were good 1 
the casting is also horrible cause all you see is a really really bad actors period 0 
none of it works just dont buy it 0 
everything was good and tasty 1 
avoid this film at all costs 0 
this is the place where i first had pho and it was amazing 1 
an interesting premise and billy drago is always good as a dangerous nutbag side note id love to see drago stephen mchattie and lance hendrikson in a flick together talk about raging cheekbones 1 
saggy floppy piece of junk 0 
will not be back 0 
krussel always good 1 
too bad you have to pay up to a month for the service 0 
good case excellent value 1 
restaurant is always full but never a wait 1 
this item is fantastic and works perfectly 1 
unreliable im giving up 0 
having trouble with volume 0 
perfect for the ps3 1 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
the food was great as always compliments to the chef 1 
it felt too light and tinny 0 
that said our mouths and bellies were still quite pleased 1 
i will never forget it now 1 
i can barely ever hear on it and am constantly saying what 0 
really ugly 0 
everything about it is fine and reasonable for the price ie 1 
one more thing i can tolerate political incorrectness very well im all for artistic freedom and suspension of disbelief but the slavic female character was just too much 0 
go watch it 1 
the service was terrible food was mediocre 0 
not enough volume 0 
the reception is excellent 1 
which are small and not worth the price 0 
i really wanted the plantronics 510 to be the right one but it has too many issues for methe good 0 
i am also very happy with the price 1 
cumbersome design 0 
great phone 1 
i started this review with two stars but im editing it to give it only one 0 
the shipping time was also very quick 1 
my wife had the lobster bisque soup which was lukewarm 0 
battery lasts only a few hours 0 
dessert panna cotta was amazing 1 
i particularly remember my senses being assaulted by strident cords of music that would blare out with very little warning and even less meaning 0 
everything was perfect the night we were in 1 
i have bought this nokia cell phone a few weeks ago and it was a nightmare 0 
the concert sequences just sucked 0 
he also came back to check on us regularly excellent service 1 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
i love this place 1 
we started with the tuna sashimi which was brownish in color and obviously wasnt fresh 0 
im pleased 1 
all in all i can assure you ill be back 1 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
regrettably the film fails 0 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
its a shame to see good actors like thomerson and james make a living in a mess like this 0 
im surprised this is a good quality car charger and theres not much reviews about it 1 
clear crisp sound 1 
do not waste your time 0 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
buttons are too small 0 
i have read others reviews here but i havent had any problem with it 1 
i wish i could return the unit and get back my money 0 
the structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema 1 
oh yeah and the storyline was pathetic too 0 
the battery is completely useless to me 0 
no plot whatsoever 0 
there is a lot of beautiful places 1 
this game rocks 1 
great phone 1 
the jamaican mojitos are delicious 1 
i use this product in a motor control center where there is a lot of high voltage humming from the equipment and it works great 1 
i could not understand what kind of idiot would produce this mess in the first place not to mention several season 0 
these headphones were a great find and i think they are perhaps the best purchase ive made in the last several years seriously 1 
if youre not familiar check it out 1 
i believe that pitch black was done well 1 
for service i give them no stars 0 
the script is a big flawed mess 0 
who in their right mind is gonna buy this battery 0 
the real killer is the volume and of course it breaking 0 
a good commentary of todays love and undoubtedly a film worth seeing 1 
we watched our waiter pay a lot more attention to other tables and ignore us 0 
they are so cool 1 
this movie suffered because of the writing it needed more suspense 0 
not only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic but it also managed to give away the entire movie and im not exaggerating every moment every plot point every joke is told in the trailer 0 
rip off over charge shipping 0 
i felt insulted and disrespected how could you talk and judge another human being like that 0 
very very sad 0 
i seriously cannot believe that the owner has so many unexperienced employees that all are running around like chickens with their heads cut off 0 
end of days is one of the worst bigbudget action movies ive ever seen 0 
not worth it 0 
good service very clean and inexpensive to boot 1 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
very slow at seating even with reservation 0 
sam shepards portrayal of a gung ho marine was sobering 1 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
great time family dinner on a sunday night 1 
wont work right or atleast for me 0 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
with great sound effects and impressive special effects i cant recommend this movie enough 1 
the acting was decidely wooden though no worse than a period universal b movie 0 
dont waste your time here 0 
how this piece of trash was ever released is beyond me the acting the story the characters the supposedly special effects etcits all wrong 0 
i especially liked the noncliche choices with the parents in other movies i could predict the dialog verbatim but the writing in this movie made better selections 1 
all this movie does is make you sick watching all these slackers make excuses for their stupid actions for 90 minutes 0 
it really is impressive that the place hasnt closed down 0 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
also the story and acting were weak 0 
nice quality build unlike some cheap s out there 1 
total brunch fail 0 
the cast was great 1 
the lead man is charismafree 0 
this results in the phone being either stuck at max volume or mute 0 
the flair bartenders are absolutely amazing 1 
all in all i give this one a resounding 9 out of 10 1 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
again lame 0 
this place was such a nice surprise 1 
also if your phone is dropped this case is not going to save it specially when dropped face down 0 
the volume for the ringer is real good you have choices how loud 1 
probably never coming back and wouldnt recommend it 0 
cant store anything but phone numbers to sim 0 
the chains which im no fan of beat this place easily 0 
nonlinear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well 1 
you could drive a semi truck into these holes 0 
i highly recommend this case 1 
this one works and was priced right 1 
when it opens the battery connection is broken and the device is turned off 0 
special thanks to dylan t for the recommendation on what to order all yummy for my tummy 1 
i am very impressed with the job that motorola did on the sturdiness of this phone 1 
they are so easy to love but even more easy to identify with 1 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
the food amazing 1 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
i had absolutely no problem with this headset linking to my 8530 blackberry curve 1 
all things considered a job very well done 1 
item arrived quickly and works great with my metro pcs samsung schr450 slider phone and sony premium sound in ear plugs 1 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
but despite these few flaws this case is of exceptional quality and well worth the additional costs of owning an official oem product 1 
yes its shiny on front side and i love it 1 
made very sturdy 1 
the food amazing 1 
i really enjoyed eating here 1 
just does not work 0 
for service i give them no stars 0 
im big fan of rpg games too but this movie its a disgrace to any selfrespecting rpger there is 0 
i found this place by accident and i could not be happier 1 
this is by far the worst purchase ive made on amazon 0 
i cant believe theres even a sequel to this 0 
how can anyone in their right mind ask for anything more from a movie than this 1 
maybe its just their vegetarian fare but ive been twice and i thought it was average at best 0 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
great place fo take out or eat in 1 
hence the whole story lacks a certain energy 0 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
i have seen many movies starring jaclyn smith but my god this was one of her best though it came out 12 years ago 1 
i never come again 0 
piece of trash 0 
it features an outlandish array of memorable psychotic but lovable nuts 1 
have been going since 2007 and every meal has been awesome 1 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
black water is a thriller that manages to completely transcend its limitations its an indie flick by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience 1 
avoid at all cost 0 
if there were zero stars i would give it zero stars 0 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
its just lame 0 
service is quick and friendly 1 
i got the car charger and not even after a week the charger was brokeni went to plug it in and it started smoking 0 
alexander nevsky is a great film 1 
terrible management 0 
the acting is like watching wooden puppets moving around and reading from a book thats how bad it is 0 
i came over from verizon because cingulair has nicer cell phones the first thing i noticed was the really bad service 0 
you cant beat the price on these 1 
the wind and the lion is well written and superbly acted 1 
up there with the best of melville 1 
the movie is terribly boring in places 0 
there are massive levels massive unlockable characters its just a massive game 1 
and generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode 0 
appears to actually outperform the original battery from china that came with my v325i 1 
this review is long overdue since i consider a tale of two sisters to be the single greatest film ever made 1 
even if you love bad movies do not watch this movie 0 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
its been my choice headset for yearsgreat sound good volume good noise cancellation 1 
uncomfortable in the ear dont use with lg vx9900 env 0 
but other than that the movie seemed to drag and the heroes didnt really work for their freedom 0 
i had ordered a motorola data cable got a very well finished and working product 1 
worthless product 0 
highquality chicken on the chicken caesar salad 1 
both actors truly understand and become their particular character delivering a convincing sincere performance 1 
so far so good 1 
i wasnt really impressed with strip steak 0 
the casting is also horrible cause all you see is a really really bad actors period 0 
i waited and waited 0 
aside from its terrible lead this film has loads of other debits 0 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
but if you liked movies like the matrix and better yet their sequels i think youll appreciate the thought provoking mindblowing experience this film will give you 1 
both the hot sour the egg flower soups were absolutely 5 stars 1 
its just adorable seeing mickey playing turkey in the straw in a highly imaginative if occasionally cruel way 1 
i went on motorolas website and followed all directions but could not get it to pair again 0 
honeslty it didnt taste that fresh 0 
battery chargelife is quite long 1 
were jerks on the phone 0 
pricing is a bit of a concern at mellow mushroom 0 
voice quality signal strength dropped calls 0 
the good cinematography also makes her and monica bellucci look very beautiful 1 
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 
i got the car charger and not even after a week the charger was brokeni went to plug it in and it started smoking 0 
you cant beat that 1 
the burger i got the gold standard a 17 burger and was kind of disappointed 0 
i dont think i will be back for a very long time 0 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
do not waste your time 0 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
now you know why i gave it a 10 1 
for 40 bucks a head i really expect better food 0 
call me a nut but i think this is one of the best movies ever 1 
awesome service and food 1 
i guess it was supposed to be clever twist then shed some light on the situation but it was just stupid 0 
has been working great 1 
we will not be coming back 0 
i also didnt like the on button it felt like it would crack with use 0 
my gyro was basically lettuce only 0 
we had 7 at our table and the service was pretty fast 1 
im happy about this purchase good quality and low price 1 
price is good too 1 
its reception is very very poor 0 
i guess that nobody at the network that aired this dribble watched it before putting it on 0 
i could not understand what kind of idiot would produce this mess in the first place not to mention several season 0 
that said our mouths and bellies were still quite pleased 1 
i was seated immediately 1 
the descriptions said yum yum sauce and another said eel sauce yet another said spicy mayowell none of the rolls had sauces on them 0 
i have bought this nokia cell phone a few weeks ago and it was a nightmare 0 
worst foodservice ive had in a while 0 
the screen size is big key pad lit well enough and the camera quality is excellent for a camera phone 1 
the cast is good 1 
very very sad 0 
my wife had the lobster bisque soup which was lukewarm 0 
this case seems well made 1 
lewis blacks considerable talent is wasted here too as he is at his most incendiary when he is unrestrained which the pg13 rating certainly wont allow 0 
however paul schrader has indeed made a film about mishima that is both superb complex 1 
definitely worth seeing its the sort of thought provoking film that forces you to question your own threshold of loneliness 1 
unfortunately cover girl is an example of how hollywood used to exploit women for financial gain 0 
soggy and not good 0 
well im satisfied 1 
and the red curry had so much bamboo shoots and wasnt very tasty to me 0 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
all in all i can assure you ill be back 1 
the real killer is the volume and of course it breaking 0 
how stupid is that 0 
i recommend this for everyone who loves film movies anythinga work of art 1 
this place should honestly be blown up 0 
the characters are fleshed out surprisingly well particularly grimes and blake and all the actors deliver their sharply scripted lines with just the right amount of deadpan tongue in cheek to make the dialogue both hilarious and realistic 1 
im still infatuated with this phone 1 
its just adorable seeing mickey playing turkey in the straw in a highly imaginative if occasionally cruel way 1 
couldnt use the unit with sunglasses not good in texas 0 
this is a good battery and it got here really fast 1 
when it opens the battery connection is broken and the device is turned off 0 
i was deeply impressed with the character he played 1 
the desserts were a bit strange 0 
it is so small and you dont even realize that it is there after a while of getting used to it 1 
what a big waste of time 0 
kind of hard to mess up a steak but they did 0 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
the phone crashed completely and now i have to get it replaced 0 
the decor is nice and the piano music soundtrack is pleasant 1 
dont go here 0 
it is indescribably the most annoying and idiotic show i have ever seen 0 
integrated seamlessly with the motorola razr phone 1 
im not sure what he was trying to do with this film 0 
this movie is greatespecially if you enjoy visual arts 1 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
returned 8 hours later 0 
treo and tmobile refused to replace it again and forced me to buy another phone without any kind of upgrade discount 0 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
overpriced for what you are getting 0 
what the hell kind of crap is that 0 
great headset very impressed h500 1 
dont waste your money and time 0 
i highly recommend this case 1 
motorola finally got the voice quality of a bluetooth headset right 1 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
however my girl was complain that some time the phone doesnt wake up like normal phone does 0 
it looked like a wonderful story 1 
the directing seems too pretentious 0 
im not impressed with the concept or the food 0 
i never come again 0 
do not buy do not buyit sucks 0 
wow what a bad film 0 
hackneyed writing certainly but made even worse by the bad directing 0 
avoid at all costs 0 
their frozen margaritas are way too sugary for my taste 0 
when my order arrived one of the gyros was missing 0 
the cable looks so thin and flimsy it is scary 0 
it is just the sort of pap that is screened in the afternoon to punish the unemployed for not having jobs 0 
the bt headset was such a disapoinment 0 
jamie foxx absolutely is ray charles 1 
not loud enough and doesnt turn on like it should 0 
how awesome is that 1 
the acting as youd expect from this cast is top notch 1 
avoid this film at all costs 0 
owners are really great people 1 
the success of the film depends on the casting of sydney greenstreet as the alexander yardley character 1 
it was just too horrible 0 
nevertheless yet another wonderful film from the great masters stable 1 
but then they came back cold 0 
easy to pair with my samsung cell 1 
setup went very smoothly 1 
this is not moviemaking 0 
i cant wait to go back 1 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
the worst experience ever 0 
what makes this story different are the terrific production values faultless photography composition and editing the terrific casting the underappreciated brian keith playing a bully teddy and vivid history 1 
the headset fulfills my requirements so i am happy with my purchase 1 
this place is like chipotle but better 1 
it looked like a wonderful story 1 
it looses connection to the phone even when it is within a couple feet between the two 0 
good product good seller 1 
what did bother me was the slow service 0 
great audio 1 
the food was outstanding and the prices were very reasonable 1 
a disappointment 0 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
the service was terrible food was mediocre 0 
i struggle to find anything bad to say about it 1 
and the red curry had so much bamboo shoots and wasnt very tasty to me 0 
sweetest phone 1 
a greasy unhealthy meal 0 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
an interesting premise and billy drago is always good as a dangerous nutbag side note id love to see drago stephen mchattie and lance hendrikson in a flick together talk about raging cheekbones 1 
for readers who have already seen one of miyazakis films he is still in top form and made another worthwhile experience 1 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
dont bother coming here 0 
i mean really how do you get so famous for your fish and chips when its so terrible 0 
in particular the relationship between the bakery assistant and the waitress just didnt work for me at all 0 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
finally after three or four times the spring of the latch broke and i could not use it any longer on the visor 0 
this movie is also revealing 1 
wont ever go here again 0 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
i want to first say our server was great and we had perfect service 1 
the phone gets extremely hot 0 
it was probably dirt 0 
if you havent choked in your own vomit by the end by all the cheap drama and worthless dialogue youve must have bored yourself to death with this waste of time 0 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
i give wirefly 1 stari will contact cingularatt and inform them of this practice 0 
i cant wait to go back 1 
we got sitting fairly fast but ended up waiting 40 minutes just to place our order another 30 minutes before the food arrived 0 
check it out 1 
the ngage is still lacking in earbuds 0 
in fact this stinker smells like a directtovideo release 0 
you can even take self portraits with the outside exterior display very cool 1 
i was very pleased to see that i could replace my well travled swivel holster for my blackberry flip 1 
victor mclaglen was even bad and brian donlevy was almost unrecognizable 0 
it is a joy to use 1 
i have tried these cables with my computer and my ipod and it works just fine 1 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
very true to shakespear and a must for all shakespear fans 1 
so far it has worked like a charm 1 
and i just love the colors 1 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
only had this a month but its worked flawlessly so far 1 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
one of the most disappointing aspects is the lack of notable gore 0 
my boyfriend tried the mediterranean chicken salad and fell in love 1 
one character is totally annoying with a voice that gives me the feeling of fingernails on a chalkboard 0 
i have bought this nokia cell phone a few weeks ago and it was a nightmare 0 
the cast is good 1 
ive had better not only from dedicated boba tea spots but even from jenni pho 0 
so bad 0 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
this was one of the worst films i have ever seen 0 
its a total package 1 
this film highlights the fundamental flaws of the legal process that its not about discovering guilt or innocence but rather is about who presents better in court 1 
his performance is simply genius 1 
portable and it works 1 
the design is very good4 1 
the ambiance was incredible 1 
unfortunately this is a bad movie that is just plain bad 0 
how can you call yourself a steakhouse if you cant properly cook a steak i dont understand 0 
i know this is not like the other restaurants at all something is very off here 0 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
constantine gives everything the right intensity and seems to have a good understanding of the underlying psychological motivations 1 
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 
the directing and the cinematography arent quite as good 0 
and the rest of it just sits there being awful with soldiers singing songs about the masculinity they pledge themselves to hairsplitting about purity the admiration of swords etc 0 
the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach 0 
my phone doesnt slide around my car now and the grip prevents my phone from slipping out of my hand 1 
the characters were all funny and had the peculiarity of not having a true lead character 1 
i have to use the smallest earpieces provided but it stays on pretty well 1 
she carries the movie well 1 
i was very disappointed in the movie 0 
i bought this to use with my kindle fire and absolutely loved it 1 
the steak was amazingrge fillet relleno was the best seafood plate i have ever had 1 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
bad reception 0 
there is really nothing for me at postinos hope your experience is better 0 
nice ambiance 1 
cheap but hey it works was pleasantly suprised given the low cost of this item 1 
when it opens the battery connection is broken and the device is turned off 0 
soggy and not good 0 
excellent sound quality 1 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
its pretty surprising that this wonderful film was made in 1949 as hollywood generally had its collective heads in the sand concerning black and white issues at that time 1 
ray charles is legendary 1 
this is some seriously good pizza and im an expertconnisseur on the topic 1 
i only hear garbage for audio 0 
the acting is like watching wooden puppets moving around and reading from a book thats how bad it is 0 
really awful 0 
once you get inside youll be impressed with the place 1 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
leopard print is wonderfully wild 1 
the story which was told so eloquently by francis ford coppola 25 years earlier really unfolds gradually and leaves room for the characters to develop 1 
just does not work 0 
awful service 0 
yet plantronincs continues to use the same flawed charger design 0 
great steak great sides great wine amazing desserts 1 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
headset works great was packaged nicely to avoid any damage 1 
end of days is one of the worst bigbudget action movies ive ever seen 0 
the food was excellent and service was very good 1 
sprint charges for this service 0 
the food was barely lukewarm so it must have been sitting waiting for the server to bring it out to us 0 
steve martin delivers a really funny performance of a middleaged upper class uptight white guy 1 
all in all a great disappointment 0 
after one bite i was hooked 1 
she ordered a toasted english muffin that came out untoasted 0 
so bad 0 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
the acting helps the writing along very well maybe the idiotsavant sister could have been played better and it is a real joy to watch 1 
weve tried to like this place but after 10 times i think were done with them 0 
the phone gets extremely hot 0 
the chefs were friendly and did a good job 1 
tied to charger for conversations lasting more than 45 minutesmajor problems 0 
im glad i found this product on amazon it is hard to find it wasnt high priced 1 
the instructions didnt explain that a microphone jack could be used 0 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
if you stay in vegas you must get breakfast here at least once 1 
this is a simple little phone to use but the breakage is unacceptible 0 
good case excellent value 1 
i can say that the desserts were yummy 1 
stopped by during the late may bank holiday off rick steve recommendation and loved it 1 
reversible plug works great 1 
and there wasnt a single sour note struck actingwise either some surprisingly solid casting here 1 
its hard not to fall headoverheels in love with that girl 1 
one of the best mexican movies ever and one of the less understood even by mexican themselves no matter how identified the should have felt with it 1 
disappointing accessory from a good manufacturer 0 
which is precisely why i am giving it such a bad review 0 
what a disappointment 0 
i love this place 1 
small sleek impressive looking practical setup with ample storage in place 1 
worst customer service ever 0 
excellent product for the price 1 
doesnt hold charge 0 
to those who find this movie intelligent or even masterful i can only say its your intelligence and your imagination you obviously used to try and make some sense of this pitiful attempt its in our human nature to try and make sense of things 0 
in particular the relationship between the bakery assistant and the waitress just didnt work for me at all 0 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
the fries were not hot and neither was my burger 0 
i have tried these cables with my computer and my ipod and it works just fine 1 
i gave it 5 stars because of the sound quality 1 
it is an insane game 1 
but it wasnt until i watched this film that i realised how great he actually was 1 
i dont know what the big deal is about this place but i wont be back yaall 0 
all things considered a job very well done 1 
the opening sequence of this gem is a classic and the cat n mouse games that follow are a delight to watch 1 
this is one of the best italian thrillers of the early 70s 1 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
prosgood camera very nice pictures also has cool styles like black and white and more 1 
the servers went back and forth several times not even so much as an are you being helped 0 
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
i exchanged the sony ericson z500a for this and im pretty happy with that decision 1 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film 1 
i have to mention this and it is a huge spoiler i loved the ending how all the characters of the three films were the remaining survivors of the ferry disaster with valentine and the young judge together and the old man watching it on her tv solidifying his happiness over the suffering which he dealt with for those many years 1 
2 thumbs up to this seller 1 
the bose noise cancelling is amazing which is very important for a nyc commuter 1 
by this time our side of the restaurant was almost empty so there was no excuse 0 
the chicken dishes are ok the beef is like shoe leather 0 
it was a great phone 1 
the ending is so so perfect youll shed a tear 1 
there is a lot of beautiful places 1 
it works fine on my motorola 325 cellphone and a lot better than the wornout battery did 1 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
we had a group of 70 when we claimed we would only have 40 and they handled us beautifully 1 
i rather enjoyed it 1 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
stay away from this store be careful 0 
good service very clean and inexpensive to boot 1 
do not purchase this phone 0 
overall i like this place a lot 1 
also notable is john baileys fine crisp beautifully colored cinematography and the great production design costumes by eiko ishioka who went on to do the memorable costumes for coppolas dracula for which she received a well deserved oscar 1 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
kieslowski never ceases to amaze me 1 
but it does get better reception and clarity than any phone ive had before 1 
by this time our side of the restaurant was almost empty so there was no excuse 0 
last time buying from you 0 
the chains which im no fan of beat this place easily 0 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
bad choice 0 
very dissapointing performance 0 
this movie has a cutting edge to it 1 
it was pretty gross 0 
very bad performance plays angela bennett a computer expert who is at home all the time 0 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
tonight i had the elk filet specialand it sucked 0 
great steak great sides great wine amazing desserts 1 
anyways the food was definitely not filling at all and for the price you pay you should expect more 0 
watching washing machine twirling around wouldnt hurt your eyes as much as this show 0 
great product 1 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
it is super charged up for use as a small hybrid palmtopcameracellphone and excels in those roles 1 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
the refried beans that came with my meal were dried out and crusty and the food was bland 0 
this place is overpriced not consistent with their boba and it really is overpriced 0 
terrible my car will not accept this cassette 0 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
doesnt do the job 0 
the worst one of the series 0 
the awful dialogue and hopeless overacting by everyone who gets shot top off a real waste of space and time 0 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
it had some average acting from the main person and it was a low budget as you clearly can see 0 
wow loved this place 1 
nice headset priced right 1 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
ive dropped my phone more times than i can say even on concrete and my phone is still great knock on wood 1 
very disappointing 0 
if you are looking for a good quality motorola headset keep looking this isnt it 0 
product was excellent and works better than the verizon one and boy was it cheaper 1 
the descriptions said yum yum sauce and another said eel sauce yet another said spicy mayowell none of the rolls had sauces on them 0 
when i saw it in the theater i thought i was going to be sick 0 
i was amazed at the quick arrival of the two original lg cell phone batteries and and at a fraction of the price 1 
this product is clearly not ready for prime time i dont care how cool it looks if you cant tell a call is coming in its worthless 0 
he cant act one of the least scary villains i have ever seen he cant write did he write this damn movie in his sleep 0 
dont bother go to the store 0 
phone is sturdy as all nokia bar phones are 1 
the waitress was friendly and happy to accomodate for veganveggie options 1 
the sides are delish mixed mushrooms yukon gold puree white corn beateous 1 
you also cannot take pictures with it in the case because the lense is covered 0 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
not even a hello we will be right with you 0 
then as if i hadnt wasted enough of my life there they poured salt in the wound by drawing out the time it took to bring the check 0 
meredith m was better than all right 1 
the interplay between martin and emilio contains the same wonderful chemistry we saw in wall street with martin and charlie 1 
good service very clean and inexpensive to boot 1 
the instructions didnt explain that a microphone jack could be used 0 
the restaurant is very clean and has a family restaurant feel to it 1 
im not really sure how joeys was voted best hot dog in the valley by readers of phoenix magazine 0 
works great 1 
with great sound effects and impressive special effects i cant recommend this movie enough 1 
i like steiners because its dark and it feels like a bar 1 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
never been to hard rock casino before will never ever step forward in it again 0 
the servers are not pleasant to deal with and they dont always honor pizza hut coupons 0 
omelets are to die for 1 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
all it took was one drop from about 6 inches above the kitchen counter and it was crackedi am not impressed and i am not laughing 0 
sauce was tasteless 0 
sending it back 0 
now you know why i gave it a 10 1 
my only complaint is the standard sound volume is a little low even when turned up to 5of 5 0 
i checked everywhere and there is no feature for it which is really disappointing 0 
this results in the phone being either stuck at max volume or mute 0 
still waiting im sure this item would work well if i ever recieve it 0 
phenomenal food service and ambiance 1 
as for the service i thought it was good 1 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
as many people complained i found this headsets microphone was very weak 0 
oh and i forgot to also mention the weird color effect it has on your phone 0 
even in my bmw 3 series which is fairly quiet i have trouble hearing what the other person is saying 0 
despite how hard i rate businesses its actually rare for me to give a 1 star 0 
that one didnt work either 0 
in an interesting part of town this place is amazing 1 
if you want healthy authentic or ethic food try this place 1 
but now i was completely grossed out 0 
every element of this story was so over the top excessively phony and contrived that it was painful to sit through 0 
save your money ive had this item for 11 months now 0 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
it works 1 
worked perfectly 1 
the headsets are easy to use and everyone loves them 1 
i would avoid this place if you are staying in the mirage 0 
the battery works great 1 
the salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop which was perfectly cooked 1 
each day of the week they have a different deal and its all so delicious 1 
bacon is hella salty 1 
is pretty funny 1 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
returned 8 hours later 0 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
the worst experience ever 0 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
battery lasts only a few hours 0 
really bad 0 
this place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver 0 
you also cannot take pictures with it in the case because the lense is covered 0 
be sure to order dessert even if you need to pack it togo the tiramisu and cannoli are both to die for 1 
i waited and waited 0 
i kept catching the cable on the seat and i had to pull the phone out to turn it on an off 0 
not recommended 0 
works well 1 
this one wants to surf on the small wave of space movies in 1998 deep impact and armageddon and this one fails everywhere 0 
the sets especially designed to work with the camera are amazingstylized beautiful and effective 1 
nothing at all to recommend 0 
my fiancé and i came in the middle of the day and we were greeted and seated right away 1 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
honeslty it didnt taste that fresh 0 
the ripped banana was not only ripped but petrified and tasteless 0 
great atmosphere friendly and fast service 1 
it was way over fried 0 
bought mainly for the charger which broke soon after purchasing 0 
last night was my second time dining here and i was so happy i decided to go back 1 
the cast is good 1 
the best phone in market 1 
you truly take this journey through the eyes and soul of a child 1 
everything was fresh and delicious 1 
it was so cool 1 
worst thai ever 0 
some great music and terrific scenery 1 
i rate this movie 910 1 
this little device has transformed my organizational capability and made my life a whole lot easier 1 
you can watch them preparing the delicious food 1 
the battery works great 1 
the cashew cream sauce was bland and the vegetables were undercooked 0 
the screen size is big key pad lit well enough and the camera quality is excellent for a camera phone 1 
camera color balance is awful 0 
recommend with confidence 1 
dont go here 0 
i could not understand what kind of idiot would produce this mess in the first place not to mention several season 0 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
to sum the film up breeders is a terrible cheaply made horror movie that should be avoided like the ebola virus 0 
2 thumbs up 1 
these are fabulous 1 
i found this place by accident and i could not be happier 1 
its quite simply the highest most superlative form of cinema imaginable 1 
the most annoying thing about cover girl is the way in which rita hayworth is put up on a pedestal 0 
ill be looking for a new earpiece 0 
by this time our side of the restaurant was almost empty so there was no excuse 0 
arrived quickly and much less expensive than others being sold 1 
there was a warm feeling with the service and i felt like their guest for a special treat 1 
lovely little thriller from hitchcock with lots of nice shenanigans surrounding a murdered spy a kidnapped child a nasty church a foreign plot and some random taxidermists 1 
but now that it is out of warranty the same problems reoccurebottom line put your money somewhere else cingular will not support it 0 
everything was good and tasty 1 
i am very happy 1 
one nice thing was that they added gratuity on the bill since our party was larger than 6 or 8 and they didnt expect more tip than that 1 
the only possible way this movie could be redeemed would be as mst3k fodder 0 
we had so much to say about the place before we walked in that he expected it to be amazing but was quickly disappointed 0 
very good product well made 1 
special mention should be made of the superb music score and sound effects which are an integral element in helping to make this such a memorable and enjoyable cartoon 1 
this was a poor remake of my best friends wedding 0 
the food is good 1 
the seasonal fruit was fresh white peach puree 1 
plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job 1 
the script is horrendously stupid 0 
fantastic food 1 
it also took her forever to bring us the check when we asked for it 0 
if you want a real scare rent this one 1 
hated it 0 
its a fresh subtle and rather sublime effect 1 
not easy to watch 0 
the food sucked which we expected but it sucked more than we could have imagined 0 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
the performances are not improved by improvisation because the actors now have twice as much to worry about not only whether theyre delivering the line well but whether the line itself is any good 0 
first time going but i think i will quickly become a regular 1 
none of it works just dont buy it 0 
dont bother go to the store 0 
so far so good 1 
i checked everywhere and there is no feature for it which is really disappointing 0 
there is nothing authentic about this place 0 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film 1 
great phone 1 
the crêpe was delicate and thin and moist 1 
the refried beans that came with my meal were dried out and crusty and the food was bland 0 
for service i give them no stars 0 
finally after three or four times the spring of the latch broke and i could not use it any longer on the visor 0 
i have been to very few places to eat that under no circumstances would i ever return to and this tops the list 0 
yes its that bad 0 
not good when wearing a hat or sunglasses 0 
we have tried 2 units and they both failed within 2 months pros 0 
my only complaint is the standard sound volume is a little low even when turned up to 5of 5 0 
utterly without merit on any level this is akin to torture 0 
watching washing machine twirling around wouldnt hurt your eyes as much as this show 0 
the pleather case doesnt fit 0 
perhaps my phone is defective but people cannot hear me when i use this 0 
the food is about on par with dennys which is to say not good at all 0 
in fact its hard to remember that the part of ray charles is being acted and not played by the man himself 1 
i love this bluetooth 1 
this place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver 0 
do not waste your money here 0 
it was clear that she had the range and ability to pull off this part 1 
the problem was the script 0 
i recently tried caballeros and i have been back every week since 1 
the bose noise cancelling is amazing which is very important for a nyc commuter 1 
sorry i will not be getting food from here anytime soon 0 
plus it was wellpaced and suited its relatively short run time 1 
a very good film indeed about great and unconditional love 1 
it was not good 0 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
this film highlights the fundamental flaws of the legal process that its not about discovering guilt or innocence but rather is about who presents better in court 1 
everything was good and tasty 1 
the portion was huge 1 
dont bother go to the store 0 
i love all the features and form factor 1 
i dont know what the big deal is about this place but i wont be back yaall 0 
too bad cause i know its family owned i really wanted to like this place 0 
waitress was good though 1 
the use of slowmotion needlessly repeats itself throughout the movie but is well backed up by bad acting and bad is a kind word here no continuity scenes that are thrown in for no reason whatsoever vehicles that looked like they were made from a corn flakes box and a directorial style that bordered on stupidity 0 
director paul matthews who also wrotedirected the weak 1995 monster movie grim clearly doesnt know how to pace his films 0 
the movie is terribly boring in places 0 
worked great 1 
first of all there are enough racial stereotypes and racial jokes to offend everyone 0 
the acting is like watching wooden puppets moving around and reading from a book thats how bad it is 0 
great product and price 1 
ill be looking for a new earpiece 0 
the plot has more holes than a pair of fishnet stockings and the direction and editing is astonishingly ham fisted 0 
nonlinear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well 1 
the sound quality for the device is unacceptableunless you are in a really quiet area you almost hear nothing 0 
very true to shakespear and a must for all shakespear fans 1 
while you dont yet hear mickey speak there are tons of sound effects and music throughout the filmsomething we take for granted now but which was a huge crowd pleaser in 1928 1 
i hate those things as much as cheap quality black olives 0 
having trouble with volume 0 
i especially liked the noncliche choices with the parents in other movies i could predict the dialog verbatim but the writing in this movie made better selections 1 
this early film from future goremeister lucio fulci is a very good addition to the giallo subgenre 1 
every time he opened his mouth you expect to hear you see kids pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show 0 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
this place has it 1 
service stinks here 0 
their chow mein is so good 1 
bad purchase 0 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
i own 2 of these cases and would order another 1 
but other than that the movie seemed to drag and the heroes didnt really work for their freedom 0 
the 12 mega pixel camera being a part of a phone is reasonably good7 1 
the ngage is still lacking in earbuds 0 
instead we got a bore fest about a whiny spoiled brat babysitting 0 
the cast is always entertaining as usual 1 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
director paul matthews who also wrotedirected the weak 1995 monster movie grim clearly doesnt know how to pace his films 0 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
this early film from future goremeister lucio fulci is a very good addition to the giallo subgenre 1 
the script is a big flawed mess 0 
items stated as included from the description are not included 0 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
nothing short of magnificent photographycinematography in this film 1 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
very much disappointed with this company 0 
but even the talented carrell cant save this 0 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
the ending is so so perfect youll shed a tear 1 
we enjoy their pizza and brunch 1 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
from here on the widmark character turns unintentionally comical 0 
im really disappointed all i have now is a charger that doesnt work 0 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
you wont regret it 1 
bluetooth range is good a few days ago i left my phone in the trunk got a call and carried the conversation without a hitch 1 
cool phone 1 
waitress was a little slow in service 0 
this is such a fun and funny movie 1 
new battery works great in phone 1 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
but its just not funny 0 
i did not have any problem with this item and would order it again if needed 1 
i wont say any more i dont like spoilers so i dont want to be one but i believe this film is worth your time 1 
restaurant is always full but never a wait 1 
both great 1 
the kids are very cool too 1 
fits comfortably came with three sizes of earbud tips 1 
while i managed to bend the leaf spring back in place the metal now has enough stress that it will break on the next drop 0 
the poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying 0 
would not reccommend 0 
great price too 1 
but this movie is not funny considering the ridiculousness of it 0 
it was packed 0 
it was too predictable even for a chick flick 0 
but whatever it was that cost them so much it didnt translate to quality thats for sure 0 
if you check the directors filmography on this site you will see why this film didnt have a chance 0 
i saw this film over christmas and what a great film it was 1 
just spicy enough perfect actually 1 
dont make the same mistake i did 0 
this phone is very fast with sending any kind of messages and web browsing is significantly faster than previous phones i have used 1 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
i was totally fascinated by the music the dancing everything 1 
despite how hard i rate businesses its actually rare for me to give a 1 star 0 
it quit working after id used it for about 18 months so i just purchased another one because this is the best headset ive ever owned 1 
well packaged arrived on time and works as intended 1 
the handsfree part works fine but then the car tries to download the address book and the treo rebootsoverall i still rate this device high 1 
i got it because it was so small and adorable 1 
everyone is very attentive providing excellent customer service 1 
i love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it 1 
lange had become a great actress 1 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
earbud piece breaks easily 0 
finally after three or four times the spring of the latch broke and i could not use it any longer on the visor 0 
say bye bye to your tip lady 0 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
all it took was one drop from about 6 inches above the kitchen counter and it was crackedi am not impressed and i am not laughing 0 
i think it was robert ryans best film because he portrayed someone like my father and he was a schizophrenic in real lifemy father although he never murdered anyone but was affected more so during the second world war which made him worse 1 
ive seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie 0 
dont buy it 0 
will not be back 0 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
went for lunch service was slow 0 
great product fast shipping 1 
we started with the tuna sashimi which was brownish in color and obviously wasnt fresh 0 
finally after three or four times the spring of the latch broke and i could not use it any longer on the visor 0 
as a sushi lover avoid this place by all means 0 
this wonderful experience made this place a muststop whenever we are in town again 1 
when my mom and i got home she immediately got sick and she only had a few bites of salad 0 
the volume switch rocketed out of the unit to a destination unknown 0 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
reaching for the bottom row is uncomfortable and the send and end keys are not where i expect them to be3 0 
however the ear pads come off easily and after only one week i lost one 0 
we have tried 2 units and they both failed within 2 months pros 0 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
perabo has a nice energy level and is obviously very comfortable in front of a camera 1 
best tacos in town by far 1 
its the best headset i have used 1 
actually the graphics were good at the time 1 
but now that it is out of warranty the same problems reoccurebottom line put your money somewhere else cingular will not support it 0 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
this film highlights the fundamental flaws of the legal process that its not about discovering guilt or innocence but rather is about who presents better in court 1 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
there was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters 0 
he also came back to check on us regularly excellent service 1 
i searched the internet and found this one to be the best value 1 
it really is impressive that the place hasnt closed down 0 
the service was not up to par either 0 
very disappointing 0 
the biggest complaint i have is the battery drains superfast 0 
could not get strong enough signal 0 
go and see it 1 
however the ear pads come off easily and after only one week i lost one 0 
the story is beyond stupid 0 
the worst phone ive ever had only had it for a few months 0 
special thanks to dylan t for the recommendation on what to order all yummy for my tummy 1 
my order was not correct 0 
and it was way to expensive 0 
the story line is totally predictable 0 
great food and service huge portions and they give a military discount 1 
it worked very well 1 
the ambiance isnt much better 0 
the worst experience ever 0 
a usable keyboard actually turns a pda into a realworld useful machine instead of just a neat gadget 1 
bad purchase 0 
ive dropped my phone more times than i can say even on concrete and my phone is still great knock on wood 1 
mediocre food 0 
a pretty good product 1 
rip off over charge shipping 0 
she ordered a toasted english muffin that came out untoasted 0 
its too bad the food is so damn generic 0 
2 times very bad customer service 0 
this is a good joint 1 
this is a great deal 1 
for the price this was a great deal 1 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
phone falls out easily 0 
all the bread is made inhouse 1 
if youre not familiar check it out 1 
my phone doesnt slide around my car now and the grip prevents my phone from slipping out of my hand 1 
cooked to perfection and the service was impeccable 1 
i was not happy with this item 0 
however my girl was complain that some time the phone doesnt wake up like normal phone does 0 
this was a different cut than the piece the other day but still wonderful and tender s well as well flavored 1 
lately they have been extremely nice and helpful on the phone 1 
it was absolutely amazing 1 
that company is a joke 0 
it was absolutely amazing 1 
and the accents are absolutely abysmal 0 
editing the editing of this film was phenomenal in my opinion 1 
would not recommend to others 0 
youll love it 1 
we enjoy their pizza and brunch 1 
a disappointment 0 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
the design is very good4 1 
total waste of time 0 
wed definitely go back here again 1 
all i have to say is the food was amazing 1 
this place is disgusting 0 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
i want to first say our server was great and we had perfect service 1 
it has all the features i want 1 
almost all of the songs in cover girl are oldfashioned and not very tuneful 0 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
i liked the patio and the service was outstanding 1 
on the negative its insipid enough to cause regret for another 2 hours of life wasted in front of the screen 0 
price is good too 1 
yes its that bad 0 
it kept getting worse and worse so now im officially done 0 
the plot doesnt hang together at all and the acting is absolutely appalling 0 
wow very spicy but delicious 1 
reaching for the bottom row is uncomfortable and the send and end keys are not where i expect them to be3 0 
what a mistake that was 0 
perhaps i caught them on an off night judging by the other reviews but im not inspired to go back 0 
its pure brilliance 1 
i think that it is a must see older john wayne film 1 
this game rocks 1 
phone falls out easily 0 
yet plantronincs continues to use the same flawed charger design 0 
service is friendly and inviting 1 
that said our mouths and bellies were still quite pleased 1 
the earpiece on this is too large or too heavyit keeps falling out of my ear 0 
this was such an awesome movie that i bought it off of ebay 1 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
if you have not seen this movie i definitely recommend it 1 
for the price this was a great deal 1 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
internet is excrutiatingly slow 0 
so bad 0 
by far the best cheesecurds we have ever had 1 
he came running after us when he realized my husband had left his sunglasses on the table 1 
although i very much liked the look and sound of this place the actual experience was a bit disappointing 0 
awesome service and food 1 
best fish ive ever had in my life 1 
editing the editing of this film was phenomenal in my opinion 1 
i mean really how do you get so famous for your fish and chips when its so terrible 0 
i wish i could enter negative values admins 0 
this is a great little item 1 
this is a bad film with bad writing and good actorsan ugly cartoon crafted by paul haggis for people who cant handle anything but the bold strokes in storytellinga picture painted with crayons 0 
now you know why i gave it a 10 1 
it was a great phone 1 
you truly take this journey through the eyes and soul of a child 1 
if you love death and decay and shakespears lyrics this is the one 1 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
i searched the internet and found this one to be the best value 1 
i gave it 5 stars then and im giving it 5 stars now 1 
the noise shield is incrediable 1 
avoid at all costs 0 
you share general loewenhielms exquisite joy in his partaking of the cailles en sarcophage even though you are just watching a movie but you do wish for just a small sample to savor 1 
not good when wearing a hat or sunglasses 0 
the real disappointment was our waiter 0 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
makes it easier to keep up with my bluetooth when im not wearing it 0 
highly recommended a 1 
waste of 13 bucks 0 
saw the movie today and thought it was a good effort good messages for kids 1 
linked to my phone without effort 1 
i have had tmobile service for 2 or 3 years now and i am pretty happy with it 1 
the film is well paced understated and one of the best courtroom documentaries ive seen 1 
point your finger at any item on the menu order it and you wont be disappointed 1 
this is a great place to eat 1 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
dont go here 0 
this blueant supertooth handsfree phone speaker is awesome 1 
however after about a year the fliptop started to get loose and wobbly and eventually my screen went black and i couldnt receive and place calls 0 
this was reflected not only in the cast but also in the belowpar script which borrowed much from the earlier classic 0 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
the use of slowmotion needlessly repeats itself throughout the movie but is well backed up by bad acting and bad is a kind word here no continuity scenes that are thrown in for no reason whatsoever vehicles that looked like they were made from a corn flakes box and a directorial style that bordered on stupidity 0 
i was sitting in my vehicle with the cradle on my belt and the headset lost signal 0 
good prices 1 
but if you liked movies like the matrix and better yet their sequels i think youll appreciate the thought provoking mindblowing experience this film will give you 1 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
the owner used to work at nobu so this place is really similar for half the price 1 
see both films if you can 1 
service sucks 0 
dont waste your on this one 0 
all of the tapas dishes were delicious 1 
yes this film does require a rather significant amount of puzzlesolving but the pieces fit together to create a beautiful picture 1 
great audio 1 
it was just too horrible 0 
a week later after i activated it it suddenly died 0 
i have purchased these for both family and friends and all enjoy their clarity and ease of use 1 
when my mom and i got home she immediately got sick and she only had a few bites of salad 0 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
an amazing finale to possibly the best trilogy of all time 1 
i ordered the lemon raspberry ice cocktail which was also incredible 1 
the fries were great too 1 
the attempts at humor were pitiful and story is so awful it dosent bear thinking about which basically involves a vulcan stealing the enterprise to find god seriously i just didnt care about any of this film and oh not to mention uhura does a belly dance to distract male guards 0 
really really good rice all the time 1 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
this one is simply a disappointment 0 
unfortunately inexperience of direction meant that scene after scene passed with little in the way of dramatic tension or conflict 0 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
i guess i should have known that this place would suck because it is inside of the excalibur but i didnt use my common sense 0 
cheap but hey it works was pleasantly suprised given the low cost of this item 1 
hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in 0 
the only place good for this film is in the garbage 0 
bad quality 0 
woa talk about awful 0 
this item is great installed it let it charged up overnite and it has been working good every since with no problems 1 
great headset very impressed h500 1 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
prosgood camera very nice pictures also has cool styles like black and white and more 1 
dont waste your time here 0 
will not be back 0 
no real improvement 0 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
but i thought his acting was skilled 1 
they have horrible attitudes towards customers and talk down to each one when customers dont enjoy their food 0 
i got the car charger and not even after a week the charger was brokeni went to plug it in and it started smoking 0 
i advise you to look out for it 1 
the design is very odd as the ear clip is not very comfortable at all 0 
it holds a charge for a long time is reasonably comfortable under longwearing conditions and the quality of sound is tremendous 1 
the film has an ultracheap look to it 0 
i believe that pitch black was done well 1 
total waste of time 0 
this is not moviemaking 0 
food was delicious 1 
one more thing i can tolerate political incorrectness very well im all for artistic freedom and suspension of disbelief but the slavic female character was just too much 0 
eew this location needs a complete overhaul 0 
soggy and not good 0 
i would not recommend this place 0 
by this time our side of the restaurant was almost empty so there was no excuse 0 
i would highly recommend this product 1 
i purcashed this for the car charger and it does not work 0 
for that price i can think of a few place i would have much rather gone 0 
who in their right mind is gonna buy this battery 0 
the fries were great too 1 
the films sole bright spot was jonah hill who will look almost unrecognizable to fans of the recent superbad due to the amount of weight he lost in the interim 1 
i cant see how this movie can be an inspiration to anyone to come out or overcome fear and rejection 0 
the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach 0 
what should have been a hilarious yummy christmas eve dinner to remember was the biggest fail of the entire trip for us 0 
i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
your brain will attempt to shutdown as part of a primal impulse of selfpreservation 0 
arrived quickly and much less expensive than others being sold 1 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
very good quality though 1 
then i exchanged for the same phone even that had the same problem 0 
it is worth the drive 1 
how awesome is that 1 
the food is rich so order accordingly 1 
we wont be going back anytime soon 0 
car charger as well as ac charger are included to make sure you never run out of juicehighy recommended 1 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
the films dialogue is natural real to life 1 
a happy wonderful feel good ending 1 
i will never forget it now 1 
it quit working after id used it for about 18 months so i just purchased another one because this is the best headset ive ever owned 1 
very prompt service 1 
thank you for wasting my money 0 
great phone 1 
waste your money on this game 1 
the eargels channel the sound directly into your ear and seem to increase the sound volume and clarity 1 
problem is that the ear loops are made of weak material and break easily 0 
i love being able to use one headset for both by landline and cell 1 
on the up side their cafe serves really good food 1 
the awful dialogue and hopeless overacting by everyone who gets shot top off a real waste of space and time 0 
i started this review with two stars but im editing it to give it only one 0 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
you never know if you pushed it hard enough or the right number of times for the function you want or not 0 
today was my first taste of a buldogis gourmet hot dog and i have to tell you it was more than i ever thought possible 1 
im glad i found this product on amazon it is hard to find it wasnt high priced 1 
this movie is excellentangel is beautiful and scamp is adorablehis little yelps when hes scaredand the funniest parts are whenscamp is caught under the curtain and when angel and scamp are singing ive never had this feeling beforei totally recommend this movieits coming out on special edition on june 20the cover has scamp on a garbage can and angel underneath the lid 1 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
for the price this was a great deal 1 
their menu is diverse and reasonably priced 1 
the plot was the same as pretty much every other cheap horror 0 
we will not be coming back 0 
i was deeply impressed with the character he played 1 
the company shipped my product very promptly and it works well 1 
the incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film 1 
this little device has transformed my organizational capability and made my life a whole lot easier 1 
i highly recommend these and encourage people to give them a try 1 
it has all the features i want 1 
i purchased this and within 2 days it was no longer working 0 
its a total package 1 
on the up side their cafe serves really good food 1 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
the plot is nonsense that doesnt interest in the slightest way or have any uniqueness to it 0 
so for our enjoyment we get to see them run around play games and be dangerous 1 
the ngage is still lacking in earbuds 0 
they have been around for years and carries the highest quality of antiglare screen protector that i have found to date 1 
the bathroom is just next door and very nice 1 
excellent sound battery life and inconspicuous to boot 1 
worst foodservice ive had in a while 0 
it crackles with an unpredictable youthful energy but honestly i found it hard to follow and concentrate on it meanders so badly 0 
both actors truly understand and become their particular character delivering a convincing sincere performance 1 
the decor is nice and the piano music soundtrack is pleasant 1 
the lines the cuts the audio everything is wrong 0 
the problem i have is that they charge 1199 for a sandwich that is no bigger than a subway sub which offers better and more amount of vegetables 0 
its pretty surprising that this wonderful film was made in 1949 as hollywood generally had its collective heads in the sand concerning black and white issues at that time 1 
phenomenal food service and ambiance 1 
i have had this phone for over a year now and i will tell you its not that great 0 
its a great tool for entertainment communication and data managementoh be sure to use activesync 42 for optimal data synchronization results 1 
the best example of how dumb the writing is when its established that you can turn the zombiestudents back into humans by removing a necklace containing a piece of the meteorite 0 
it isnt even an achievement as a sobaditsgood or sobaditsmemorable movie 0 
go to place for gyros 1 
woa talk about awful 0 
10 out of 10 stars 1 
the food wasnt good 0 
lastly the mozzarella sticks they were the best thing we ordered 1 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
im not really sure how joeys was voted best hot dog in the valley by readers of phoenix magazine 0 
i did not have any problem with this item and would order it again if needed 1 
you need two hands to operate the screenthis software interface is decade old and cannot compete with new software designs 0 
i highly recommend these and encourage people to give them a try 1 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
i was particularly pleased with the acting ability of dwight schultz 1 
yeah the movie pretty much sucked 0 
and i really did find them funny 1 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
the poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying 0 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
ive missed numerous calls because of this reason 0 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
i am so pleased to know such a modern day genius is out there letting is passion for art drive him and taking us as an audience with him 1 
the sweet potato fries were very good and seasoned well 1 
a greasy unhealthy meal 0 
it wasnt busy either also the building was freezing cold 0 
one of my favorite purchases ever 1 
ive dropped my phone more times than i can say even on concrete and my phone is still great knock on wood 1 
the potatoes were great and so was the biscuit 1 
this was my first and only vegas buffet and it did not disappoint 1 
we walked away stuffed and happy about our first vegas buffet experience 1 
the phone gets extremely hot 0 
feelings thoughtsgabriels discomfort during the danceall these intangibles leap to life and come within the viewers grasp in hustons portrayal 1 
i would recommend purchasing the jabra jx10 series 2 which works flawlessly with my moto q go figure 1 
host staff were for lack of a better word bitches 0 
we arent ones to make a scene at restaurants but i just dont get itdefinitely lost the love after this one 0 
the ripped banana was not only ripped but petrified and tasteless 0 
the feel of the dining room was more college cooking course than high class dining and the service was slow at best 0 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
service stinks here 0 
i cant believe theres even a sequel to this 0 
awesome device 1 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
the staff is friendly and the joint is always clean 1 
it was pretty gross 0 
the films sole bright spot was jonah hill who will look almost unrecognizable to fans of the recent superbad due to the amount of weight he lost in the interim 1 
i have had problems wit hit dropping signal and more 0 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
i have had this phone for over a year now and i will tell you its not that great 0 
you wont regret it 1 
the selection of food was not the best 0 
comfortable nice range good battery life 1 
summary the witticisms werent witty 0 
the camera although rated at an impressive 13 megapixels renders images that fall well below expectations of such a relatively high resolution 0 
nice case feels good in your hands 1 
his costars dont fare much better with people like morgan freeman jonah hill and ed helms just wasted 0 
i know this is not like the other restaurants at all something is very off here 0 
it was a long time that i didnt see a so charismatic actor on screen 1 
the voice recognition thru the handset is excellent 1 
that being said for a phone the camera is very nice many cool effects to play with and video is decent as well 1 
pricing is a bit of a concern at mellow mushroom 0 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
he is almost unbearable to watch on screen he has little to no charisma and terrible comedic timing 0 
a greasy unhealthy meal 0 
just spicy enough perfect actually 1 
i cannot believe that the actors agreed to do this film 0 
i am going to have to be the first to negatively review this product 0 
this place has it 1 
its pretty easy 1 
i searched the internet and found this one to be the best value 1 
the waitress was friendly and happy to accomodate for veganveggie options 1 
you cant relate with them hell you barely can understand them 0 
its like a bad two hour tv movie 0 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
these were so good we ordered them twice 1 
this device is great in several situations1 1 
i let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this bad idea we both hated it 0 
excellent short film 1 
after the disappointing dinner we went elsewhere for dessert 0 
the sides are delish mixed mushrooms yukon gold puree white corn beateous 1 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
im so sorry but i really cant recommend it to anyone 0 
its pretty surprising that this wonderful film was made in 1949 as hollywood generally had its collective heads in the sand concerning black and white issues at that time 1 
they dropped more than the ball 0 
this place was such a nice surprise 1 
in the summer you can dine in a charming outdoor patio so very delightful 1 
disappointing 0 
i ended up sliding it on the edge of my pants or back pockets instead 1 
overall i was not impressed and would not go back 0 
the owners really really need to quit being soooooo cheap let them wrap my freaking sandwich in two papers not one 0 
about half way through this film i started to dislike it 0 
i saw this film over christmas and what a great film it was 1 
well im satisfied 1 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
very prompt service 1 
good value great food great service 1 
restaurant is always full but never a wait 1 
either way it sucks 0 
appetite instantly gone 0 
if you simply want a small flip phone look elsewhere as the extra bells whistles are mediocre 0 
after the disappointing dinner we went elsewhere for dessert 0 
dont waste your on this one 0 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
bluetooth does not work phone locks up screens just flash up and now it just makes calls randomly while in my pocket locked 0 
this phone might well be the worst ive ever had in any brand 0 
punishment park is a brilliant piece of cinema 1 
another note about this phones appearance is that it really looks rather bland especially in the all black model 0 
it just blew 0 
graphics is far from the best part of the game 0 
if the food isnt bad enough for you then enjoy dealing with the worlds worstannoying drunk people 0 
this pda rocks 1 
he is almost unbearable to watch on screen he has little to no charisma and terrible comedic timing 0 
an hour and a half i wish i could bring back 0 
i had about two bites and refused to eat anymore 0 
i thought it was bad 0 
their menu is diverse and reasonably priced 1 
jamie foxx absolutely is ray charles 1 
all the actors give a wonderful performance especially jennifer rubin as jamie harris who changes from the nervous starlet in the beginning through the strange events she is part of to the cool star 1 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
see it 1 
the headsets are easy to use and everyone loves them 1 
this place has it 1 
i keep watching it over and over 1 
ill be looking for a new earpiece 0 
i believe that pitch black was done well 1 
i guess i liked the details of his dysfunctionhe was believable 1 
it was a great phone 1 
the movie was so boring that i sometimes found myself occupied peaking in the paper instead of watching never happened during a columbo movie before 0 
its very slow 0 
maybe its just their vegetarian fare but ive been twice and i thought it was average at best 0 
they dropped more than the ball 0 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
the construction of the headsets is poor 0 
warning stay away 0 
the directing seems too pretentious 0 
the seasonal fruit was fresh white peach puree 1 
aside from its terrible lead this film has loads of other debits 0 
all the other cases ive tried normally fall apart after a few months but this one seems to be in for the long haul 1 
delicious and i will absolutely be back 1 
service sucks 0 
i love the look and feel of samsung flipphones 1 
logitech bluetooth headset is a 10 1 
it just blew 0 
i guess i should have known that this place would suck because it is inside of the excalibur but i didnt use my common sense 0 
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0 
updatewent back for a second time and it was still just as amazing 1 
service is also cute 1 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
the only thing that i think could improve is the sound leaks out from the headset 0 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
all things considered a job very well done 1 
it will drive you barking mad 0 
plug was the wrong size 0 
after i pulled up my car i waited for another 15 minutes before being acknowledged 0 
i wouldnt see this movie again for free 0 
the restaurant is very clean and has a family restaurant feel to it 1 
my gyro was basically lettuce only 0 
the service was terrible though 0 
kieslowski never ceases to amaze me 1 
i totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is 1 
the story itself is just predictable and lazy 0 
painful on the ear 0 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
low quality 0 
it has northern humour and positive about the community it represents 1 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
highly entertaining at all angles 1 
the buttons for on and off are bad 0 
makes it easier to keep up with my bluetooth when im not wearing it 0 
the writers were smack on and i think the best actors and actresses were a bonus to the showthese characters were so real 1 
the volume switch rocketed out of the unit to a destination unknown 0 
we made the drive all the way from north scottsdale and i was not one bit disappointed 1 
this movie suffered because of the writing it needed more suspense 0 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
the staff is great the food is delish and they have an incredible beer selection 1 
i mean really how do you get so famous for your fish and chips when its so terrible 0 
excellent bluetooth headset 1 
i literally vomited while watching this film 0 
we waited for thirty minutes to be seated although there were 8 vacant tables and we were the only folks waiting 0 
disappointing accessory from a good manufacturer 0 
you cant beat that 1 
at around 4 pm i bought it at around 8pm i started to watch at around 815pm i fast forwarded the remaining film to see if there was anything left watchable for a human being with a brain but there wasnt 0 
great for ipods too 1 
excellent product for the price 1 
the attempts at humor were pitiful and story is so awful it dosent bear thinking about which basically involves a vulcan stealing the enterprise to find god seriously i just didnt care about any of this film and oh not to mention uhura does a belly dance to distract male guards 0 
performed awful muffled tinny incoming sound and severe echo for those on the other end of the call 0 
for the price on amazon it is an excellent product which i would highly recommend 1 
unless youre just out to visually collect all extant films of austens work you can skip this one 0 
the ambience is wonderful and there is music playing 1 
we asked for the bill to leave without eating and they didnt bring that either 0 
the chefs were friendly and did a good job 1 
sprint charges for this service 0 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
it is an excellent drama an excellent thriller and an excellent film 1 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
just dont know why they were so slow 0 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
i had verizon 2 years ago and really liked their service 1 
these products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet 0 
i seriously cannot believe that the owner has so many unexperienced employees that all are running around like chickens with their heads cut off 0 
i love the pho and the spring rolls oh so yummy you have to try 1 
i really enjoyed eating here 1 
be sure to order dessert even if you need to pack it togo the tiramisu and cannoli are both to die for 1 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
and it was way to expensive 0 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
excellent product for the price 1 
sam shepards portrayal of a gung ho marine was sobering 1 
never going back 0 
i had to go to a store and bought a new nokia phone which is working great 1 
this movie is also revealing 1 
i really wanted the plantronics 510 to be the right one but it has too many issues for methe good 0 
the worst piece of crap ever along with the verizon customer service 0 
i will be back many times soon 1 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
the selection was probably the worst ive seen in vegasthere was none 0 
were jerks on the phone 0 
great value 1 
hands down my favorite italian restaurant 1 
i am very impressed with this headset from plantronics 1 
im a big fan of this series mostly due to anne rices style sensitivities and treatments 1 
feelings thoughtsgabriels discomfort during the danceall these intangibles leap to life and come within the viewers grasp in hustons portrayal 1 
how can anyone in their right mind ask for anything more from a movie than this 1 
i love the pho and the spring rolls oh so yummy you have to try 1 
nothing short of magnificent photographycinematography in this film 1 
you truly take this journey through the eyes and soul of a child 1 
razr battery good buy 1 
he was terrible 0 
nice solid keyboard 1 
the reception has been generally good 1 
good case excellent value 1 
highly entertaining at all angles 1 
there is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again 0 
worked great 1 
editing the editing of this film was phenomenal in my opinion 1 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
the plot simply rumbles on like a machine desperately depending on the addition of new scenes 0 
i cannot make calls at certain places 0 
did not like at all 0 
the food is rich so order accordingly 1 
i kept looking at the time and it had soon become 35 minutes yet still no food 0 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
battery life is real good 1 
by the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant i was bored and didnt care what happened next and so i switched off 0 
great earpiece 1 
this movie does an excellent job of revealing the complexity of the task and the incredible challenges facing south africa 1 
still i do like this movie for its empowerment of women theres not enough movies out there like this one 1 
couldnt use the unit with sunglasses not good in texas 0 
an absolute must visit 1 
also if your phone is dropped this case is not going to save it specially when dropped face down 0 
we wont be going back anytime soon 0 
love this product 1 
i saw it as a child on tv back in 1973 when it was the stranger and i loved it 1 
setup couldnt have been simpler 1 
the cashew cream sauce was bland and the vegetables were undercooked 0 
i literally vomited while watching this film 0 
well packaged arrived on time and works as intended 1 
overall i would recommend this phone over the new walkman 1 
the food amazing 1 
the characters are interesting and you want to find out more about them the longer the movie goes on and i think people will be surprised by who does and doesnt make it 1 
the burger is good beef cooked just right 1 
he is an amazing film artist one of the most important whoever lived 1 
reaching for the bottom row is uncomfortable and the send and end keys are not where i expect them to be3 0 
product is useless since it does not have enough charging current to charge the 2 cellphones i was planning to use it with 0 
they never brought a salad we asked for 0 
everyone is treated equally special 1 
what the hell kind of crap is that 0 
very tough and very short on flavor 0 
the shrimp tender and moist 1 
dont make the same mistake that i did and please dont buy this phone 0 
its a great tool for entertainment communication and data managementoh be sure to use activesync 42 for optimal data synchronization results 1 
the cashier was friendly and even brought the food out to me 1 
this is such a fun and funny movie 1 
just whatever you do avoid groove as its the antithesis of all that is good about human traffic 0 
the cashew cream sauce was bland and the vegetables were undercooked 0 
2 times very bad customer service 0 
first of all there are enough racial stereotypes and racial jokes to offend everyone 0 
but above all the exquisite visual composition of each moment with inventive and elegant use of closeup camera angle and lighting including pointillistic faux home movie footage is a wonder and joy to behold 1 
the acting from all involved and that includes those like shatner and nimoy is bad and washed out and making them seem as old as they look in real life the special effects are tacky like when spock has to rescue kirk on a jet pack when he falls down from a mountain 0 
service was good and the company was better 1 
when i saw it in the theater i thought i was going to be sick 0 
my salad had a bland vinegrette on the baby greens and hearts of palm 0 
kieslowski never ceases to amaze me 1 
the movie was very interesting from beginning to the end 1 
i wont be back 0 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
there are massive levels massive unlockable characters its just a massive game 1 
there is nothing authentic about this place 0 
rude inconsiderate management 0 
the acting is terrible and the writing is worse 0 
the bathroom is just next door and very nice 1 
the file browser offers all the options that one needshandsfree is great 1 
it is simple to use and i like it 1 
really ugly 0 
best fish ive ever had in my life 1 
the last 15 minutes of movie are also not bad as well 1 
sounds good reasonably priced and effective its that simple 1 
however i recently watched the whole thing again on dvd and i was completely struck by how extremely stupid the storyline was how it contained holes inconsistencies and frankly a whole lot of crap and how horrid the dancing was 0 
there was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth but it didnt really work into the rest of the plot 0 
i believe that pitch black was done well 1 
if youre not familiar check it out 1 
the food is very good for your typical bar food 1 
great movie 1 
it was also the right balance of war and love 1 
i would recommend this 1 
food arrived quickly 1 
worst martini ever 0 
really ugly 0 
food was delicious 1 
all this movie does is make you sick watching all these slackers make excuses for their stupid actions for 90 minutes 0 
the service was great even the manager came and helped with our table 1 
plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job 1 
works for me 1 
i really wanted the plantronics 510 to be the right one but it has too many issues for methe good 0 
food arrived quickly 1 
its reception is very very poor 0 
owners are really great people 1 
will never ever go back and have told many people what had happened 0 
mobile phone tools are a must have 1 
everything from acting to cinematography was solid 1 
the plot simply rumbles on like a machine desperately depending on the addition of new scenes 0 
for 40 bucks a head i really expect better food 0 
so for our enjoyment we get to see them run around play games and be dangerous 1 
very disappointed 0 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
the pizza selections are good 1 
this game rocks 1 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
this movie is bad 0 
i kept catching the cable on the seat and i had to pull the phone out to turn it on an off 0 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic 1 
this film tries to be a serious and sophisticated thrillerhorror flick and it fails miserably 0 
highly entertaining at all angles 1 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
very good quality though 1 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
my fiancé and i came in the middle of the day and we were greeted and seated right away 1 
mishima is extremely uninteresting 0 
we literally sat there for 20 minutes with no one asking to take our order 0 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
will be back again 1 
it even has its sweet moments 1 
hell no will i go back 0 
on the up side their cafe serves really good food 1 
the cast is good 1 
while you dont yet hear mickey speak there are tons of sound effects and music throughout the filmsomething we take for granted now but which was a huge crowd pleaser in 1928 1 
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
it was delicious 1 
the screen does get smudged easily because it touches your ear and face 0 
dont buy this product 0 
not even good for camp value 0 
i dont know what the big deal is about this place but i wont be back yaall 0 
the speaker is of low quality so as making the ring tones sound very cheap 0 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
great audio 1 
very nice and relaxing late night viewing 1 
its a total package 1 
we watched our waiter pay a lot more attention to other tables and ignore us 0 
the script is horrendously stupid 0 
its a little geeky but i think thats its sex on toast and it rocks and oozes sex right down to its battery embedded sleek stylish leather case 1 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
her role was played well 1 
both do good jobs and are quite amusing 1 
crisp and clear 1 
the block was amazing 1 
i got it because it was so small and adorable 1 
i mean really how do you get so famous for your fish and chips when its so terrible 0 
this was a poor remake of my best friends wedding 0 
people who like european films and art movies will like this movie 1 
total letdown i would much rather just go to the camelback flower shop and cartel coffee 0 
the feel of the dining room was more college cooking course than high class dining and the service was slow at best 0 
secondly hitchcock pretty much perfected the thriller and chase movie 1 
i just saw this film and i recommend it 1 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
horrible had to switch 3 times 0 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
juano hernandez an exceptional actor who played supporting roles in many films of the era is a proud black man who is accused of murdering a white man in the south 1 
after arguing with verizon regarding the dropped calls we returned the phones after two days 0 
food arrived quickly 1 
of course the acting is blah 0 
its still wild stuff though and is highly recommended to fans of giallo cinema 1 
horrible horrible protector 0 
this is truly an art movieit actually has a lot of art in it 1 
jabra ear gels r the best 1 
it was a riot to see hugo weaving play a sexobsessed gay real estate salesman who uses his clients houses for his trysts with the flaming darren tom hollander 1 
the stories were powerful explorations of the nature of man and of art 1 
my boyfriend tried the mediterranean chicken salad and fell in love 1 
i had verizon 2 years ago and really liked their service 1 
i love all the features and form factor 1 
poor product 0 
fast service 1 
by the time the film ended i not only disliked it i despised it 0 
you learn a lot about the real inside emotions of people in this movie and a lot about the movie business itself 1 
and the red curry had so much bamboo shoots and wasnt very tasty to me 0 
not recommended 0 
cumbersome design 0 
i swung in to give them a try but was deeply disappointed 0 
great time family dinner on a sunday night 1 
the stories were powerful explorations of the nature of man and of art 1 
an instant classic with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits 1 
overall i rate this movie a 10 out of a 110 scale 1 
even if you love bad movies do not watch this movie 0 
im not really sure how joeys was voted best hot dog in the valley by readers of phoenix magazine 0 
a good commentary of todays love and undoubtedly a film worth seeing 1 
then i exchanged for the same phone even that had the same problem 0 
rating 1 out of 10 0 
this is a great deal 1 
poor talk time performance 0 
i was not happy with this item 0 
fantastic food 1 
rating 1 out of 10 0 
omelets are to die for 1 
when a song could explain the emotions of the subjects better such as when jay adams unfortunate life was a subject of talk the song old man by neil young was played which evokes many emotions 1 
poor sound quality 0 
the jalapeno bacon is soooo good 1 
this place is horrible and way overpriced 0 
great bluetooth 1 
the lighting is just dark enough to set the mood 1 
first time going but i think i will quickly become a regular 1 
restaurant is always full but never a wait 1 
if there is a wind it is completely useless 0 
it was too predictable even for a chick flick 0 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
the acting was bad 0 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
dont waste your money 0 
i dont know exactly what it is about this movie but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our familys memories 1 
the best place in vegas for breakfast just check out a sat or sun 1 
the performances are not improved by improvisation because the actors now have twice as much to worry about not only whether theyre delivering the line well but whether the line itself is any good 0 
kids pizza is always a hit too with lots of great side dish options for the kiddos 1 
hitchcock is a great director 1 
i dont know what the big deal is about this place but i wont be back yaall 0 
prosgood camera very nice pictures also has cool styles like black and white and more 1 
my boyfriend tried the mediterranean chicken salad and fell in love 1 
it also took her forever to bring us the check when we asked for it 0 
its a total package 1 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
this place is handsdown one of the best places to eat in the phoenix metro area 1 
love this phone 1 
lucy bell is so much higher than this crap and for her to sink this low is quite depressing 0 
definitely a turn off for me i doubt ill be back unless someone else is buying 0 
started watching this but didnt believe in any of the characters 0 
her lines seem to have been written by a fifteen year old though they are trying oh so so hard to sound like how a fifteen year old would really um you know well talk 0 
ive seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie 0 
nice blanket of moz over top but i feel like this was done to cover up the subpar food 1 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
product was excellent and works better than the verizon one and boy was it cheaper 1 
the shrimp tender and moist 1 
the phone gets extremely hot 0 
it was clear that she had the range and ability to pull off this part 1 
it is super charged up for use as a small hybrid palmtopcameracellphone and excels in those roles 1 
and i really did find them funny 1 
the goat taco didnt skimp on the meat and wow what flavor 1 
i probably wont be coming back here 0 
this is just a great movie 1 
dont waste your time here 0 
i seriously cannot believe that the owner has so many unexperienced employees that all are running around like chickens with their heads cut off 0 
nice case feels good in your hands 1 
hard to judge whether these sides were good because we were grossed out by the melted styrofoam and didnt want to eat it for fear of getting sick 0 
if you look for authentic thai food go else where 0 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
we will not be coming back 0 
i dont know exactly what it is about this movie but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our familys memories 1 
a cheap and cheerless heist movie with poor characterisation lots of underbite style stoic emoting think chow yun fat in a better tomorrow and some cheesy clichés thrown into an abandoned factory ready for a few poorly executed flying judo rolls a la john woo 0 
last time buying from you 0 
people couldnt hear me talk and i had to pull out the earphone and talk on the phone 0 
ive only had my bluetooth for a few weeks but i really like it 1 
so anyone near you will hear part of your conversation 0 
ive only had my bluetooth for a few weeks but i really like it 1 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
excellent hands free tool 1 
his performance is simply genius 1 
will not be back 0 
great for the jawbone 1 
food was good service was good prices were good 1 
if you want a real scare rent this one 1 
the pan cakes everyone are raving about taste like a sugary disaster tailored to the palate of a six year old 0 
always a great time at dos gringos 1 
my salad had a bland vinegrette on the baby greens and hearts of palm 0 
all in all i can assure you ill be back 1 
the only very disappointing thing was there was no speakerphone 0 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
four stars for the food the guy in the blue shirt for his great vibe still letting us in to eat 1 
otherwise easy to install and use clear sound 1 
the only thing i wasnt too crazy about was their guacamole as i dont like it puréed 0 
bluetooth range is good a few days ago i left my phone in the trunk got a call and carried the conversation without a hitch 1 
i have had tmobile service for 2 or 3 years now and i am pretty happy with it 1 
it clicks into place in a way that makes you wonder how long that mechanism would last 0 
the owner used to work at nobu so this place is really similar for half the price 1 
steamboat willie is an amazingly important film to our cinema history 1 
even allowing for poor production values for the time 1971 and the format some kind of miniseries this is baaaaaad 0 
spend your money and time some place else 0 
hated it 0 
the awful dialogue and hopeless overacting by everyone who gets shot top off a real waste of space and time 0 
we got the food and apparently they have never heard of salt and the batter on the fish was chewy 0 
they keep getting better and better this is my third one and ive had numerous palms too 1 
some applause should be given to the prelude however 1 
due to this happening on every call i was forced to stop using this headset 0 
it was a very superficial movie and it gave me the feeling that i was watching play rather than a film 0 
the acting by the whole cast could be put on a scale and balanced perfectly between overacting and underacting 0 
i am going to have to be the first to negatively review this product 0 
i know this is not like the other restaurants at all something is very off here 0 
a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it 1 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
its one of the movies i need to see whenever it comes on tvnever mind the fact that i already have it memorized 1 
does not work for listening to music with the cingular 8125 0 
how can that bethe audio quality is poor 0 
arrived quickly and much less expensive than others being sold 1 
if you check the directors filmography on this site you will see why this film didnt have a chance 0 
the budget was evidently very limited 0 
each day of the week they have a different deal and its all so delicious 1 
this was such an awesome movie that i bought it off of ebay 1 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
aside from its terrible lead this film has loads of other debits 0 
i wont be back 0 
we have tried 2 units and they both failed within 2 months pros 0 
it looked like a wonderful story 1 
also the story and acting were weak 0 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
the characters are interesting and you want to find out more about them the longer the movie goes on and i think people will be surprised by who does and doesnt make it 1 
i got home to see the driest damn wings ever 0 
no ear loop needed its tiny and the sound is great 1 
if you want healthy authentic or ethic food try this place 1 
waste of 13 bucks 0 
this phone tries very hard to do everything but fails at its very ability to be a phone 0 
if you love death and decay and shakespears lyrics this is the one 1 
delete this film from your mind 0 
why was this film made 0 
its hard not to fall headoverheels in love with that girl 1 
i have seen many movies starring jaclyn smith but my god this was one of her best though it came out 12 years ago 1 
ive had no trouble accessing the internet downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions 1 
appears to actually outperform the original battery from china that came with my v325i 1 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
the cinematographyif it can be called thatsucked 0 
now you know why i gave it a 10 1 
the macarons here are insanely good 1 
nargile i think you are great 1 
if you dont find it too bad as again the unit comes with one earpad onlyi would not recommend this to anyone 0 
very unreliable service from tmobile 0 
comfortable in my hand 1 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
i found this place by accident and i could not be happier 1 
bacon is hella salty 1 
plus it was wellpaced and suited its relatively short run time 1 
good service very clean and inexpensive to boot 1 
this place is horrible and way overpriced 0 
everything about it is just bad 0 
if you are razr owneryou must have this 1 
saw the movie today and thought it was a good effort good messages for kids 1 
in a word it is embarrassing 0 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
the ri style calamari was a joke 0 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
say bye bye to your tip lady 0 
best service and food ever maria our server was so good and friendly she made our day 1 
poor talk time performance 0 
pricing is a bit of a concern at mellow mushroom 0 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
the chips that came out were dripping with grease and mostly not edible 0 
the only good thing was our waiter he was very helpful and kept the bloddy marys coming 1 
the eargels channel the sound directly into your ear and seem to increase the sound volume and clarity 1 
this is a great deal 1 
the plot such as it is is so derivative and predictable that the ending is like a mercy killing 0 
lange had become a great actress 1 
this place has it 1 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
hell no will i go back 0 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
i went to bachi burger on a friends recommendation and was not disappointed 1 
food was good service was good prices were good 1 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
worst martini ever 0 
i enjoyed reading this book to my children when they were little 1 
the cable looks so thin and flimsy it is scary 0 
sound quality on both end is excellent i use headset to call my wife and ask my wife to use headset to call me 2 1 
any grandmother can make a roasted chicken better than this one 0 
the crêpe was delicate and thin and moist 1 
this place deserves one star and 90 has to do with the food 0 
despite how hard i rate businesses its actually rare for me to give a 1 star 0 
the tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu 0 
the stories were powerful explorations of the nature of man and of art 1 
lately they have been extremely nice and helpful on the phone 1 
the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach 0 
think of the film being like a dream 1 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
absolutely great 1 
poorly contstruct hinge 0 
both great 1 
better than youd expect 1 
its a total package 1 
it plays louder than any other speaker of this size the price is so low that most would think the quality is lacking however its not 1 
this item is great installed it let it charged up overnite and it has been working good every since with no problems 1 
excellent sound quality 1 
the goat taco didnt skimp on the meat and wow what flavor 1 
nice design and quality 1 
youd have to have the iq of particularly stupid mollusk not to see that one coming 0 
for a product that costs as much as this one does i expect it to work far better and with greater ease than this thing does 0 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
if you love authentic mexican food and want a whole bunch of interesting yet delicious meats to choose from you need to try this place 1 
defective crap 0 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
main thing i didnt enjoy is that the crowd is of older crowd around mid 30s and up 0 
his losing his marbles so early in the proceedings is totally implausible and unconvincing 0 
this case has passed the one year mark and while it shows signs of wear it is 100 functional 1 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
its a great item 1 
i want to first say our server was great and we had perfect service 1 
this is probably the most irritating show i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
the buffet at bellagio was far from what i anticipated 0 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
i know this is not like the other restaurants at all something is very off here 0 
lucy bell is so much higher than this crap and for her to sink this low is quite depressing 0 
the place was fairly clean but the food simply wasnt worth it 0 
the cg opening sequence in space looked like it could have been created on microsoft slideshow for gods sake 0 
i just wanted to leave 0 
this convention never worked well in the past and certainly doesnt work here 0 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
and the rest of it just sits there being awful with soldiers singing songs about the masculinity they pledge themselves to hairsplitting about purity the admiration of swords etc 0 
it makes very strange ticking noises before it ends the call 0 
but its just not funny 0 
unfortunately it will not recharge my iphone 4s despite connecting it from multiple power sources imac external battery wall outlet etc 0 
i was bored throughout the whole damn thing 0 
horrible dont waste your time and money 0 
highly recommended for all ages although the younger set will probably not appreciate some of the more subtle references they will certainly appreciate one galley scene in particular 1 
it is perfect for a sitdown family meal or get together with a few friends 1 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
it also had a new problem 0 
if you want a sandwich just go to any firehouse 1 
personally i think it shows that people should learn to find a compromise them self without involving other people into issue 1 
id advise anyone to go and see it 1 
so i bought about 10 of these and saved alot of money 1 
this is one of the best movies out there that shows such strong sibling bond for each other 1 
it is wonderful and inspiring to watch and i hope that it gets released again on to video or dvd 1 
theres barely a boring moment in the film and there are plenty of humorous parts 1 
i was not impressed by this product 0 
motorola finally got the voice quality of a bluetooth headset right 1 
summary the witticisms werent witty 0 
the sound quality for the device is unacceptableunless you are in a really quiet area you almost hear nothing 0 
jamie foxx absolutely is ray charles 1 
crostini that came with the salad was stale 0 
we wont be going back 0 
works great 1 
it fits so securely that the ear hook does not even need to be used and the sound is better directed through your ear canal 1 
this fixes all the problems 1 
this is a great deal 1 
this is infuriating 0 
i especially love the long battery life 1 
headset works great was packaged nicely to avoid any damage 1 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
overall i would recommend this phone over the new walkman 1 
i gave it 5 stars because of the sound quality 1 
food arrived quickly 1 
the story starts too fast with absolutely no suspense or buildup in the slightest 0 
the calls drop the phone comes on and off at will the screen goes black and the worst of all it stops ringing intermittently 0 
the chicken dishes are ok the beef is like shoe leather 0 
i love all the features and form factor 1 
utterly without merit on any level this is akin to torture 0 
the service was outshining i definitely recommend the halibut 1 
at around 4 pm i bought it at around 8pm i started to watch at around 815pm i fast forwarded the remaining film to see if there was anything left watchable for a human being with a brain but there wasnt 0 
i mean in a realistic world she would never have gotten into that ballet repertory the whole thing was quite pathetic 0 
i would give this television series a 10 plus if i could 1 
the art style has the appearance of crayonpencil drawings and is wonderfully colorful and fanciful 1 
i really do recommend this place you can go wrong with this donut place 1 
their regular toasted bread was equally satisfying with the occasional pats of butter mmmm 1 
waitress was a little slow in service 0 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
for people who are first timers in film making i think they did an excellent job 1 
not only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic but it also managed to give away the entire movie and im not exaggerating every moment every plot point every joke is told in the trailer 0 
the acting as youd expect from this cast is top notch 1 
the ri style calamari was a joke 0 
none of them are engaging or exciting 0 
my only complaint is the standard sound volume is a little low even when turned up to 5of 5 0 
black water is a thriller that manages to completely transcend its limitations its an indie flick by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience 1 
very displeased 0 
the igo chargers and tips are really great 1 
well just if you keep thinking how bad it is 0 
at around 4 pm i bought it at around 8pm i started to watch at around 815pm i fast forwarded the remaining film to see if there was anything left watchable for a human being with a brain but there wasnt 0 
nevertheless yet another wonderful film from the great masters stable 1 
the jamaican mojitos are delicious 1 
you can watch them preparing the delicious food 1 
the menu is always changing food quality is going down service is extremely slow 0 
they have a plethora of salads and sandwiches and everything ive tried gets my seal of approval 1 
great movie 1 
no im going to eat the potato that i found some strangers hair in it 0 
their regular toasted bread was equally satisfying with the occasional pats of butter mmmm 1 
also if your phone is dropped this case is not going to save it specially when dropped face down 0 
i will be back many times soon 1 
first of all there are enough racial stereotypes and racial jokes to offend everyone 0 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
light weight i hardly notice it is there 1 
the only very disappointing thing was there was no speakerphone 0 
the worst was the salmon sashimi 0 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
either way it sucks 0 
so i basically threw my money out the window for nothing 0 
it also had a new problem 0 
i was amazed at the quick arrival of the two original lg cell phone batteries and and at a fraction of the price 1 
i have recommended it to friends 1 
dont buy this product 0 
better than youd expect 1 
i love their fries and their beans 1 
the best phone in market 1 
there is no real plot 0 
go watch it 1 
speaking of the music it is unbearably predictably and kitchy 0 
great phone 1 
good product good seller 1 
very good phone 1 
the salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop which was perfectly cooked 1 
probably not in a hurry to go back 0 
there is however some pretty good acting at least for this type of film 1 
i waited and waited 0 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
host staff were for lack of a better word bitches 0 
there are massive levels massive unlockable characters its just a massive game 1 
kind of hard to mess up a steak but they did 0 
it makes very strange ticking noises before it ends the call 0 
what on earth is irons doing in this film 0 
some may say this buffet is pricey but i think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot 1 
there were too many close ups 0 
the scallop dish is quite appalling for value as well 0 
i contacted the company and they told me that although the unit was still under warranty if i couldnt produce my receipt i was out of luck 0 
so badwellits just bad 0 
this was one of the worst films i have ever seen 0 
also notable is john baileys fine crisp beautifully colored cinematography and the great production design costumes by eiko ishioka who went on to do the memorable costumes for coppolas dracula for which she received a well deserved oscar 1 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
well never go again 0 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
excellent cast story line performances 1 
if good intentions made a film great then this film might be one of the greatest films ever made 1 
a good time 1 
comfort for our whole family 1 
i kept looking at the time and it had soon become 35 minutes yet still no food 0 
nonlinear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well 1 
weve have gotten a much better service from the pizza place next door than the services we received from this restaurant 0 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
the staff is always super friendly and helpful which is especially cool when you bring two small boys and a baby 1 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
totally different with loads of understatement and black comedy this is a film few get to see but those who do will remember it 1 
disappointment i hate anything that goes in my ear 0 
this pair of headphones is the worst that i have ever had soundwise 0 
i checked everywhere and there is no feature for it which is really disappointing 0 
my friend did not like his bloody mary 0 
i guess that nobody at the network that aired this dribble watched it before putting it on 0 
problem is that the ear loops are made of weak material and break easily 0 
con spotty service 0 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
the story starts too fast with absolutely no suspense or buildup in the slightest 0 
the worst one of the series 0 
penne vodka excellent 1 
unfortunately we must have hit the bakery on leftover day because everything we ordered was stale 0 
the service was extremely slow 0 
timely shipment and quality product 1 
with great sound effects and impressive special effects i cant recommend this movie enough 1 
i exchanged the sony ericson z500a for this and im pretty happy with that decision 1 
the kids are annoying 0 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
couldnt use the unit with sunglasses not good in texas 0 
no one at the table thought the food was above average or worth the wait that we had for it 0 
we wont be returning 0 
i dont understand how this garbage got on the shelves of the movie store its not even a real movie 0 
ill be looking for a new earpiece 0 
so there is no way for me to plug it in here in the us unless i go by a converter 0 
do not purchase this phone 0 
this phone is slim and light and the display is beautiful 1 
i was hoping for more 0 
the descriptions said yum yum sauce and another said eel sauce yet another said spicy mayowell none of the rolls had sauces on them 0 
tom wilkinson broke my heart at the end and everyone elses judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike 1 
i have only had it for a few weeks but so far so good 1 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
there is really nothing for me at postinos hope your experience is better 0 
the cinematography is simply stunning to say the least and the fx are nothing if not stateoftheart 1 
you can even take self portraits with the outside exterior display very cool 1 
the food came out at a good pace 1 
i had heard good things about this place but it exceeding every hope i could have dreamed of 1 
in fact this stinker smells like a directtovideo release 0 
the service was outshining i definitely recommend the halibut 1 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
ill put this gem up against any movie in terms of screenplay cinematography acting postproduction editing directing or any other aspect of filmmaking 1 
very very disappointed ordered the 35 big bay plater 0 
for people who are first timers in film making i think they did an excellent job 1 
if you plan to use this in a car forget about it 0 
this case has passed the one year mark and while it shows signs of wear it is 100 functional 1 
if you want a real scare rent this one 1 
the inside is really quite nice and very clean 1 
once you get inside youll be impressed with the place 1 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
do not buy do not buyit sucks 0 
i cant believe theres even a sequel to this 0 
great product and price 1 
at any rate this film stinks its not funny and fulci should have stayed with giallo and supernatural zombie movies 0 
the film has great actors a master director a significant themeat least a wouldbe significant theme undertone of fifties existential worldweariness aerial scenes that ought to have thrilled both senses and imagination and characters about which one might deeply care 1 
integrated seamlessly with the motorola razr phone 1 
however the ear pads come off easily and after only one week i lost one 0 
att is not clear sound is very distorted and you have to yell when you talk 0 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
but its just not funny 0 
avoid this film at all costs 0 
if good intentions made a film great then this film might be one of the greatest films ever made 1 
this blueant supertooth handsfree phone speaker is awesome 1 
i wont be back 0 
great audio 1 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
you have to hold the phone at a particular angle for the other party to hear you clearly 0 
when i saw it in the theater i thought i was going to be sick 0 
the plot simply rumbles on like a machine desperately depending on the addition of new scenes 0 
youll love how thin it is 1 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
we definately enjoyed ourselves 1 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
the keyboard is a nice compromise between a full qwerty and the basic cell phone number keypad 1 
timely shipment and quality product 1 
bad quality 0 
ample portions and good prices 1 
i had a salad with the wings and some ice cream for dessert and left feeling quite satisfied 1 
2 thumbs up 1 
perfect for someone me who only likes beer ice cold or in this case even colder 1 
i was very disappointed in the movie 0 
these headphones were a great find and i think they are perhaps the best purchase ive made in the last several years seriously 1 
the sound is clear and the people i talk to on it are amazed at the quality too 1 
over rated 0 
returned 8 hours later 0 
terrible phone holder 0 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
how this piece of trash was ever released is beyond me the acting the story the characters the supposedly special effects etcits all wrong 0 
it is a true classic 1 
the cable looks so thin and flimsy it is scary 0 
if you love authentic mexican food and want a whole bunch of interesting yet delicious meats to choose from you need to try this place 1 
there was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters 0 
bluetooth range is good a few days ago i left my phone in the trunk got a call and carried the conversation without a hitch 1 
this is high adventure at its best 1 
the waiter wasnt helpful or friendly and rarely checked on us 0 
the performances are not improved by improvisation because the actors now have twice as much to worry about not only whether theyre delivering the line well but whether the line itself is any good 0 
one more thing i can tolerate political incorrectness very well im all for artistic freedom and suspension of disbelief but the slavic female character was just too much 0 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
very easy to use 1 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
i was so insulted 0 
on three different occasions i asked for well done or medium well and all three times i got the bloodiest piece of meat on my plate 0 
i love their fries and their beans 1 
after the first charge kept going dead after 12 minutes 0 
the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach 0 
basically the service was very bad 0 
i dont know what kind it is but they have the best iced tea 1 
the only suspense i was feeling was the frustration at just how retarded the girls were 0 
this gets a 1 out of 10 simply because theres nothing lower 0 
camera color balance is awful 0 
i was mortified 0 
i dont think well be going back anytime soon 0 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
its pure brilliance 1 
freezes frequently4 0 
worst thai ever 0 
it ranks highly as a great noircrimedrama incredible performances by belmondo and lino ventura 1 
the interplay between martin and emilio contains the same wonderful chemistry we saw in wall street with martin and charlie 1 
we loved the biscuits 1 
things happen characters personalities change plot twists occur for no real reason other than that script calls for it 0 
ample portions and good prices 1 
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
best fish ive ever had in my life 1 
their onscreen chemistry critical to the entire film is genuine 1 
call me a nut but i think this is one of the best movies ever 1 
i could not recommend these more 0 
the pairing of the two devices was so easy it barely took a couple minutes before i started making calls with the voice dialing feature 1 
avoid avoid avoid 0 
saggy floppy piece of junk 0 
not a weekly haunt but definitely a place to come back to every once in a while 1 
avoid this establishment 0 
but kevin spacey is an excellent verbal tsunami as buddy ackerman  and totally believable because he is a great actor 1 
the yellowtail carpaccio was melt in your mouth fresh 1 
im translating movies for a living and this is the first movie in my 5year working experience that i found offensive to my intelligence 0 
the acting by the whole cast could be put on a scale and balanced perfectly between overacting and underacting 0 
works fine 1 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
crostini that came with the salad was stale 0 
very dissapointing performance 0 
very prompt service 1 
at first i thought i was grtting a good deal at 744 until i plugged it into my phone v3c razr 0 
aside from its terrible lead this film has loads of other debits 0 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
this was one of the worst films i have ever seen 0 
i totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is 1 
thats how id describe this painfully dreary timewaster of a film 0 
my gyro was basically lettuce only 0 
the chicken dishes are ok the beef is like shoe leather 0 
just does not work 0 
and finally after all that we get to an ending that wouldve been great had it been handled by competent people and not jerry falwell 0 
he was very impressed when going from the original battery to the extended battery 1 
ive missed numerous calls because of this reason 0 
the chefs were friendly and did a good job 1 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
the food was terrible 0 
restored my phone to like new performance 1 
this battery is an excellent bargain 1 
it didnt work people can not hear me when i talk 0 
seems like a good quick place to grab a bite of some familiar pub food but do yourself a favor and look elsewhere 0 
great movie 1 
light weight i hardly notice it is there 1 
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
i wear it everyday and it holds up very well 1 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
this is an outstanding little restaurant with some of the best food i have ever tasted 1 
the steak was amazingrge fillet relleno was the best seafood plate i have ever had 1 
the steak was amazingrge fillet relleno was the best seafood plate i have ever had 1 
adapter does not provide enough charging current 0 
the fries were great too 1 
1 hour 54 minutes of sheer tedium melodrama and horrible acting a mess of a script and a sinking feeling of good lord what were they thinking 0 
disappointed with battery 0 
this is a great little item 1 
clear skype calls long battery life long range 1 
it dit not work most of the time with my nokia 5320 0 
avoid at all costs 0 
everything stinks 0 
they have horrible attitudes towards customers and talk down to each one when customers dont enjoy their food 0 
definitely worth seeing its the sort of thought provoking film that forces you to question your own threshold of loneliness 1 
i use this product in a motor control center where there is a lot of high voltage humming from the equipment and it works great 1 
bad purchase 0 
a week later after i activated it it suddenly died 0 
the movie in movie situations in the beginning and through the game that is played with her by the acting coach are fascinating 1 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
1 hour 54 minutes of sheer tedium melodrama and horrible acting a mess of a script and a sinking feeling of good lord what were they thinking 0 
buyerbe very careful 0 
not loud enough and doesnt turn on like it should 0 
im trying to return it for a refund 0 
i had to go to a store and bought a new nokia phone which is working great 1 
hence the whole story lacks a certain energy 0 
the new characters werent all that memorable and i found myself forgetting who was who 0 
yes i am simplifying things here for the sake of brevity for this really is at the core of the problems with this film it has too much going on without any real fulfilling explanation 0 
couldnt use the unit with sunglasses not good in texas 0 
if you plan to use this in a car forget about it 0 
this pair of headphones is the worst that i have ever had soundwise 0 
the macarons here are insanely good 1 
so there is no way for me to plug it in here in the us unless i go by a converter 0 
the service was meh 0 
the decor is nice and the piano music soundtrack is pleasant 1 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
the food came out at a good pace 1 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
returned 8 hours later 0 
now this is a movie i really dislike 0 
for those that havent seen it dont waste your time 0 
i was sitting in my vehicle with the cradle on my belt and the headset lost signal 0 
this is one of the better buffets that i have been to 1 
lordy the khao soi is a dish that is not to be missed for curry lovers 1 
pretty piece of junk 0 
all things considered a job very well done 1 
good value works fine power via usb car or wall outlet 1 
i bought this phone as a replacement for my startac and have regretted it since 0 
everything was good and tasty 1 
the bipolarity of the ruthless thug one minute a ruthless killer the next minute a luvs diaper commercial is completely unconvincing 0 
definitely worth checking out 1 
best tater tots in the southwest 1 
what a piece of junk i lose more calls on this phone 0 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
an hour seriously 0 
the worst was the salmon sashimi 0 
worth every penny 1 
the result is a powerhouse achievement made more timely now perhaps because of our cultures disturbing fascination with celebrity and its distorted interpretations of fame 1 
i wouldnt return 0 
very funny 1 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
just dont know why they were so slow 0 
poor quality 0 
the two main characters may be two of the most believable children i ever saw put on screen 1 
we had a group of 70 when we claimed we would only have 40 and they handled us beautifully 1 
food arrived quickly 1 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
do not buy for d807wrongly advertised for d807 0 
i received it quickly and it works great 1 
earbud piece breaks easily 0 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
the live music on fridays totally blows 0 
i had the mac salad and it was pretty bland so i will not be getting that again 0 
i work in the hospitality industry in paradise valley and have refrained from recommending cibo any longer 0 
its quite simply the highest most superlative form of cinema imaginable 1 
an amazing finale to possibly the best trilogy of all time 1 
the budget was evidently very limited 0 
its a great tool for entertainment communication and data managementoh be sure to use activesync 42 for optimal data synchronization results 1 
terrible my car will not accept this cassette 0 
and the sound quality is great 1 
needless to say i wont be going back anytime soon 0 
although i very much liked the look and sound of this place the actual experience was a bit disappointing 0 
this is a stunning movie 1 
however the ear pads come off easily and after only one week i lost one 0 
the good cinematography also makes her and monica bellucci look very beautiful 1 
however after seeing the short again after about 25 years i was amazed at how timeless the film actually is 1 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
good beer drink selection and good food selection 1 
not good enough for the price 0 
when it opens the battery connection is broken and the device is turned off 0 
customer service was terrible 0 
unfortunately cover girl is an example of how hollywood used to exploit women for financial gain 0 
the only suspense i was feeling was the frustration at just how retarded the girls were 0 
the acting sucks the music sucks the script sucks the pacing sucks the special fx suck the directing sucks basically this movie sucks 0 
i immediately said i wanted to talk to the manager but i did not want to talk to the guy who was doing shots of fireball behind the bar 0 
doesnt last long 0 
the worst one of the series 0 
it was too predictable even for a chick flick 0 
saggy floppy piece of junk 0 
it fits so securely that the ear hook does not even need to be used and the sound is better directed through your ear canal 1 
i loved it 1 
good prices 1 
it is a joy to use 1 
we got sitting fairly fast but ended up waiting 40 minutes just to place our order another 30 minutes before the food arrived 0 
i was left shattered from the experience of watching this film and i took a good two hours to fully recover 0 
i think it was robert ryans best film because he portrayed someone like my father and he was a schizophrenic in real lifemy father although he never murdered anyone but was affected more so during the second world war which made him worse 1 
regrettably the film fails 0 
it rocked my world and is certainly a must see for anyone with no social or physical outlets 1 
attempting artiness with black white and clever camera angles the movie disappointed became even more ridiculous as the acting was poor and the plot and lines almost nonexistent 0 
pretty good beer selection too 1 
dont waste your money 0 
but its just not funny 0 
ive dropped my phone more times than i can say even on concrete and my phone is still great knock on wood 1 
the worst sappiest dialogue i could go on and on 0 
main thing i didnt enjoy is that the crowd is of older crowd around mid 30s and up 0 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
i was bored throughout the whole damn thing 0 
very bad performance plays angela bennett a computer expert who is at home all the time 0 
it is light easy to use and has very clear reception and transmission 1 
the battery works great 1 
a world better than 95 of the garbage in the theatres today 1 
i love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it 1 
you never know if you pushed it hard enough or the right number of times for the function you want or not 0 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
this is a good joint 1 
comfortable in my hand 1 
the cashier had no care what so ever on what i had to say it still ended up being wayyy overpriced 0 
but now that it is out of warranty the same problems reoccurebottom line put your money somewhere else cingular will not support it 0 
portable and it works 1 
i connected my wifes bluetoothmotorola hs850 to my phone and it worked like a charm whether the phone was in my pocket or the case 1 
excellent product for the price 1 
the movie was so boring that i sometimes found myself occupied peaking in the paper instead of watching never happened during a columbo movie before 0 
it was too predictable even for a chick flick 0 
good case 1 
its been my choice headset for yearsgreat sound good volume good noise cancellation 1 
much less than the jawbone i was going to replace it with 1 
i bought this phone as a replacement for my startac and have regretted it since 0 
there still are good actors around 1 
anne heche was utterly convincing 1 
i bought this to use with my kindle fire and absolutely loved it 1 
food was really good and i got full petty fast 1 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
i cant see how this movie can be an inspiration to anyone to come out or overcome fear and rejection 0 
there is a totally unnecessary trainroller coaster scene 0 
the sweet potato tots were good but the onion rings were perfection or as close as i have had 1 
this is a great deal 1 
the pleather case doesnt fit 0 
it was a pale color instead of nice and char and has no flavor 0 
great hands free device 1 
its a total package 1 
there is no plot here to keep you going in the first place 0 
we had a group of 70 when we claimed we would only have 40 and they handled us beautifully 1 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
he came running after us when he realized my husband had left his sunglasses on the table 1 
but the premise of the film was so ridiculous that the president of the us 0 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
tied to charger for conversations lasting more than 45 minutesmajor problems 0 
the puppets look really cheesy not in a good way like in the puppet master 80s flicks 0 
i thought errol flynn was brilliant as custer and has since become my favourite actor 1 
the structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema 1 
i felt as though her going to ireland did absolutely nothing whatsoever 0 
i wear glasses and it fits fine with them 1 
its still wild stuff though and is highly recommended to fans of giallo cinema 1 
no ear loop needed its tiny and the sound is great 1 
the staff is always super friendly and helpful which is especially cool when you bring two small boys and a baby 1 
customer service was terrible 0 
i cant tell you how disappointed i was 0 
i could eat their bruschetta all day it is devine 1 
the hockey scenes are terrible defensemen playing like theyre 5 years old goalies diving at shots that are 10 feet wide of the net etc 0 
poor quality and service 0 
the ngage is still lacking in earbuds 0 
we thought youd have to venture further away to get good sushi but this place really hit the spot that night 1 
i own a jabra earset and was very happy with it but the sound quality especially outgoing on this is better 1 
i do think tom hanks is a good actor 1 
very good food great atmosphere1 1 
for that its worth checking out 1 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
i also decided not to send it back because our waitress looked like she was on the verge of having a heart attack 0 
wasted two hours 0 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
its a great item 1 
the design might be ergonomic in theory but i could not stand having these in my ear 0 
pretty good beer selection too 1 
im returning them 0 
wow very spicy but delicious 1 
the phone gets extremely hot 0 
very good though 1 
much more interesting more action more suspense and less of the unneeded controversy 1 
for people who are first timers in film making i think they did an excellent job 1 
i love the scream movies and all horror movies and this one ranks way up there 1 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
i guess that nobody at the network that aired this dribble watched it before putting it on 0 
after arguing with verizon regarding the dropped calls we returned the phones after two days 0 
this one wants to surf on the small wave of space movies in 1998 deep impact and armageddon and this one fails everywhere 0 
now you know why i gave it a 10 1 
the steak and the shrimp are in my opinion the best entrees at gc 1 
you truly take this journey through the eyes and soul of a child 1 
what the hell kind of crap is that 0 
eew this location needs a complete overhaul 0 
his costars dont fare much better with people like morgan freeman jonah hill and ed helms just wasted 0 
you could only take 2 videos at a time and the quality was very poor 0 
good protection and does not make phone too bulky 1 
never got it 0 
i only hear garbage for audio 0 
they refuse to refund or replace 0 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
the service was terrible food was mediocre 0 
2 times very bad customer service 0 
i exchanged the sony ericson z500a for this and im pretty happy with that decision 1 
im probably one of the few people to ever go to ians and not like it 0 
i had ordered a motorola data cable got a very well finished and working product 1 
wont go back 0 
a drive thru means you do not want to wait around for half an hour for your food but somehow when we end up going here they make us wait and wait 0 
dont buy this product 0 
before i go in to why i gave a 1 star rating please know that this was my third time eating at bachi burger before writing a review 0 
do not buy for d807wrongly advertised for d807 0 
motorola finally got the voice quality of a bluetooth headset right 1 
it is very comfortable to wear as well which is probably the most important aspect about using a case 1 
then i exchanged for the same phone even that had the same problem 0 
they work about 2 weeks then break 0 
ive tried several different earpieces for my cell phone and this jabra one is the first one ive found that fits my ear comfortably 1 
the concert sequences just sucked 0 
a great touch 1 
the cg opening sequence in space looked like it could have been created on microsoft slideshow for gods sake 0 
best of luck to the rude and noncustomer service focused new management 0 
we were promptly greeted and seated 1 
this totally unfunny movie is so over the top and pathetic and unrealistic that throughout the whole 90 minutes of utter torture i probably looked at my watch about 70000 times 0 
i felt insulted and disrespected how could you talk and judge another human being like that 0 
sorry i will not be getting food from here anytime soon 0 
macbeth jason connery moved me to tears with his final monolog out brief candle outhe gave the sphere of moral decay and dark forces a human face which makes it the more interesting 1 
im glad i found this product on amazon it is hard to find it wasnt high priced 1 
the acting is terrible and the writing is worse 0 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
comfort for our whole family 1 
his losing his marbles so early in the proceedings is totally implausible and unconvincing 0 
ive seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie 0 
a must study for anyone interested in the worst sins of industrial design 0 
lucy bell is so much higher than this crap and for her to sink this low is quite depressing 0 
good show samsung 1 
the service was outshining i definitely recommend the halibut 1 
you can watch them preparing the delicious food 1 
cumbersome design 0 
nothing short of magnificent photographycinematography in this film 1 
we thought youd have to venture further away to get good sushi but this place really hit the spot that night 1 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
do not buy for d807wrongly advertised for d807 0 
whatever the producer was going for he missed entirely 0 
and the chef was generous with his time even came around twice so we can take pictures with him 1 
i know that sounds funny but to me it seemed like sketchy technology that wouldnt work wellwell this one works great 1 
watching washing machine twirling around wouldnt hurt your eyes as much as this show 0 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
battery is holding up well 1 
i love the ringtones because they are so upbeat 1 
however bt headsets are currently not good for real time games like firstperson shooters since the audio delay messes me up 0 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
i know this is not like the other restaurants at all something is very off here 0 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
this blueant supertooth handsfree phone speaker is awesome 1 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
i wear glasses and it fits fine with them 1 
a standout scene 1 
this one wants to surf on the small wave of space movies in 1998 deep impact and armageddon and this one fails everywhere 0 
overall i would recommend this phone over the new walkman 1 
i am so pleased to know such a modern day genius is out there letting is passion for art drive him and taking us as an audience with him 1 
if i take a picture the battery drops a bar and starts beeping letting me know its dieing 0 
as for the service im a fan because its quick and youre being served by some nice folks 1 
it is a very well acted and done tv movie 1 
i give wirefly 1 stari will contact cingularatt and inform them of this practice 0 
would not reccommend 0 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
its still wild stuff though and is highly recommended to fans of giallo cinema 1 
good product incredible value 1 
i received my orders well within the shipping timeframe everything was in good working order and overall i am very excited to have this source 1 
no complaints 1 
dont make the same mistake that i did and please dont buy this phone 0 
i put the latest os on it v115g and it now likes to slow to a crawl and lock up every once in a while 0 
its a long time since i was so entertained by a movie 1 
it also had a new problem 0 
none of them are engaging or exciting 0 
id say that would be the hardest decision honestly all of ms dishes taste how they are supposed to taste amazing 1 
how this piece of trash was ever released is beyond me the acting the story the characters the supposedly special effects etcits all wrong 0 
the only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive 1 
setup went very smoothly 1 
the films sole bright spot was jonah hill who will look almost unrecognizable to fans of the recent superbad due to the amount of weight he lost in the interim 1 
very bad experience 0 
ive seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie 0 
so bad 0 
the plug did not work very well 0 
this place is pretty good nice little vibe in the restaurant 1 
horrible phone 0 
i wasnt expecting oscar material but this 0 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
it makes very strange ticking noises before it ends the call 0 
we made the drive all the way from north scottsdale and i was not one bit disappointed 1 
i have had problems wit hit dropping signal and more 0 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
by far the best cheesecurds we have ever had 1 
i had heard good things about this place but it exceeding every hope i could have dreamed of 1 
he is an amazing film artist one of the most important whoever lived 1 
im translating movies for a living and this is the first movie in my 5year working experience that i found offensive to my intelligence 0 
rating 1 out of 10 0 
very tough and very short on flavor 0 
the phone gets extremely hot 0 
very true to shakespear and a must for all shakespear fans 1 
this place is awesome if you want something light and healthy during the summer 1 
gotta love those closeups of slimy drooling teeth 1 
none of it works just dont buy it 0 
i was hoping for more 0 
i mean really how do you get so famous for your fish and chips when its so terrible 0 
crust is not good 0 
same evening him and i are both drastically sick 0 
an instant classic with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits 1 
this is infuriating 0 
my sister has one also and she loves it 1 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
each day of the week they have a different deal and its all so delicious 1 
the chains which im no fan of beat this place easily 0 
the new characters werent all that memorable and i found myself forgetting who was who 0 
this may be the only bad film he ever made 0 
it is indescribably the most annoying and idiotic show i have ever seen 0 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
it was delicious 1 
i checked out this place a couple years ago and was not impressed 0 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
but when someone strives for greatness and poetry but delivers a muddled and often ridiculous story a bunch of disparate scenes pretentious dialogue then you get the worst kind of a movie that some other reviewer very accurately defined as pretentious crap 0 
i bought this to use with my kindle fire and absolutely loved it 1 
the ending is so so perfect youll shed a tear 1 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
everything on the menu is terrific and we were also thrilled that they made amazing accommodations for our vegetarian daughter 1 
and generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode 0 
its a shame to see good actors like thomerson and james make a living in a mess like this 0 
i swung in to give them a try but was deeply disappointed 0 
the basic premise is wasted since it is sidelined by the inexplicable focus on the documentary crew 0 
there is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again 0 
you could only take 2 videos at a time and the quality was very poor 0 
its just lame 0 
the shipping time was also very quick 1 
would come back again if i had a sushi craving while in vegas 1 
its this pandering to the audience that sabotages most of his films 0 
great for the jawbone 1 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
great case and price 1 
went in for happy hour great list of wines 1 
it did not work in my cell phone plug i am very up set with the charger 0 
the handsfree part works fine but then the car tries to download the address book and the treo rebootsoverall i still rate this device high 1 
a greasy unhealthy meal 0 
2 thumbs up to this seller 1 
i was mortified 0 
my headset works just peachykeen 1 
even in my bmw 3 series which is fairly quiet i have trouble hearing what the other person is saying 0 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
first off the reception sucks i have never had more than 2 bars ever 0 
food was delicious 1 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
classywarm atmosphere fun and fresh appetizers succulent steaks baseball steak 1 
this is such a fun and funny movie 1 
the cocktails are all handmade and delicious 1 
what i really like there is the crepe station 1 
i really like this product over the motorola because it is allot clearer on the ear piece and the mic 1 
it also had a new problem 0 
i ordered the lemon raspberry ice cocktail which was also incredible 1 
i was not impressed by this product 0 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
service is also cute 1 
the range is very decent ive been able to roam around my house with the phone in the living room with no receptionsound quality issues 1 
damn good steak 1 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
this was reflected not only in the cast but also in the belowpar script which borrowed much from the earlier classic 0 
this is not moviemaking 0 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
i have yet to run this new battery below two bars and thats three days without charging 1 
cinematography noteworthy including fine views of barcelona and its famed gaudi towers 1 
the jabra eargels fit my ears very well 1 
great food and awesome service 1 
i really dont see how anyone could enjoy this movie 0 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
ive had no trouble accessing the internet downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions 1 
its a case of so bad it is laughable 0 
one of the best mexican movies ever and one of the less understood even by mexican themselves no matter how identified the should have felt with it 1 
i love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it 1 
shrimp when i unwrapped it i live only 12 a mile from brushfire it was literally ice cold 0 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
the plot has more holes than a pair of fishnet stockings and the direction and editing is astonishingly ham fisted 0 
my drink was never empty and he made some really great menu suggestions 1 
awful 0 
a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it 1 
good audio quality 1 
my boyfriend and i sat at the bar and had a completely delightful experience 1 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
the cow tongue and cheek tacos are amazing 1 
price is good too 1 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
the earpiece on this is too large or too heavyit keeps falling out of my ear 0 
2 times very bad customer service 0 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
i dont think it would hold it too securly on your belt 0 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
the service was meh 0 
i got the car charger and not even after a week the charger was brokeni went to plug it in and it started smoking 0 
would not recommend to others 0 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
the tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu 0 
i dont have very many words to say about this place but it does everything pretty well 1 
this totally unfunny movie is so over the top and pathetic and unrealistic that throughout the whole 90 minutes of utter torture i probably looked at my watch about 70000 times 0 
i love lane but ive never seen her in a movie this lousy 0 
do not waste your time 0 
im trying to return it for a refund 0 
weird vibe from owners 0 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
after watching this film i wanted to learn more about the works of this artist 1 
great software for motorolas 1 
big disappointment with calendar sync 0 
everything about this product is wrongfirst 0 
what a big waste of time 0 
food was really good and i got full petty fast 1 
cant say enough good things about this place 1 
jabra ear gels r the best 1 
the movie in movie situations in the beginning and through the game that is played with her by the acting coach are fascinating 1 
if you stay in vegas you must get breakfast here at least once 1 
stay away from this store be careful 0 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
it was not good 0 
it is light easy to use and has very clear reception and transmission 1 
predictable but not a bad watch 1 
weird vibe from owners 0 
there is nothing authentic about this place 0 
what a waste 0 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
the film has great actors a master director a significant themeat least a wouldbe significant theme undertone of fifties existential worldweariness aerial scenes that ought to have thrilled both senses and imagination and characters about which one might deeply care 1 
it crackles with an unpredictable youthful energy but honestly i found it hard to follow and concentrate on it meanders so badly 0 
the ri style calamari was a joke 0 
however paul schrader has indeed made a film about mishima that is both superb complex 1 
poor product 0 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
i gave it a 10 1 
great steak great sides great wine amazing desserts 1 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
those burgers were amazing 1 
i consider this theft 0 
if you hate earbugs avoid this phone by all means 0 
i started this review with two stars but im editing it to give it only one 0 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
motorola finally got the voice quality of a bluetooth headset right 1 
the acting helps the writing along very well maybe the idiotsavant sister could have been played better and it is a real joy to watch 1 
sam shepards portrayal of a gung ho marine was sobering 1 
avoid this one if you can 0 
try them in the airport to experience some tasty food and speedy friendly service 1 
not only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic but it also managed to give away the entire movie and im not exaggerating every moment every plot point every joke is told in the trailer 0 
hence the whole story lacks a certain energy 0 
the whole experience was underwhelming and i think well just go to ninja sushi next time 0 
it looses connection to the phone even when it is within a couple feet between the two 0 
i have had this phone for over a year now and i will tell you its not that great 0 
the only place good for this film is in the garbage 0 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
this phone is slim and light and the display is beautiful 1 
who in their right mind is gonna buy this battery 0 
needless to say i wont be going back anytime soon 0 
would not recommend to others 0 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
great food and awesome service 1 
the tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu 0 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
the decor is nice and the piano music soundtrack is pleasant 1 
battery has no life 0 
good value works fine power via usb car or wall outlet 1 
i just wanted to leave 0 
the only thing that i think could improve is the sound leaks out from the headset 0 
it failed to convey the broad sweep of landscapes that were a great part of the original 0 
the food is good 1 
however after seeing the short again after about 25 years i was amazed at how timeless the film actually is 1 
a standout scene 1 
this place is not worth your time let alone vegas 0 
the fried rice was dry as well 0 
i am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this 1 
you could drive a semi truck into these holes 0 
better than youd expect 1 
dont waste your money 0 
the budget was evidently very limited 0 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
waitress was sweet and funny 1 
but kevin spacey is an excellent verbal tsunami as buddy ackerman  and totally believable because he is a great actor 1 
poorly contstruct hinge 0 
the waitresses are very friendly 1 
i was very excited to get this headset because i thought it was really cute 1 
i love this thing 1 
when my order arrived one of the gyros was missing 0 
worst customer service 0 
service stinks here 0 
there is a lot of beautiful places 1 
i liked the patio and the service was outstanding 1 
my friend loved the salmon tartar 1 
the food is about on par with dennys which is to say not good at all 0 
avoid this one if you can 0 
none of them are engaging or exciting 0 
everything about this film is simply incredible 1 
fast service 1 
server did a great job handling our large rowdy table 1 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
we waited for forty five minutes in vain 0 
please dont waste your money 0 
i searched the internet and found this one to be the best value 1 
conclusion i loved it 1 
i have recommended it to friends 1 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
at first i thought i was grtting a good deal at 744 until i plugged it into my phone v3c razr 0 
these were so good we ordered them twice 1 
lasted one day and then blew up 0 
verizons bills however are difficult to understand even though their pricing plans are simple 0 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
the eargels channel the sound directly into your ear and seem to increase the sound volume and clarity 1 
and i just love the colors 1 
i am sorry i made this purchase 0 
great phone 1 
when i saw it in the theater i thought i was going to be sick 0 
not recommended 0
