the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
it was horrendous 0 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
good case 1 
john garfield ann revere lilli plmer william conrad canada leeand filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screenjames wong howe 1 
we had 7 at our table and the service was pretty fast 1 
i am pairing this with my iphone and i could not be happier with it so far 1 
dont buy this product 0 
as always the evening was wonderful and the food delicious 1 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
to call this movie a drama is ridiculous 0 
appetite instantly gone 0 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
overall i like this place a lot 1 
sending it back 0 
i purchased this and within 2 days it was no longer working 0 
and dont even get me started on the jerky camerawork 0 
filmiing was less expansive 0 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
i think not again 0 
you never know if you pushed it hard enough or the right number of times for the function you want or not 0 
the burger is good beef cooked just right 1 
i like steiners because its dark and it feels like a bar 1 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
lasted one day and then blew up 0 
i was totally fascinated by the music the dancing everything 1 
the descriptions said yum yum sauce and another said eel sauce yet another said spicy mayowell none of the rolls had sauces on them 0 
i get absolutely horrible reception in my apartment where with other phones i have not had this problem 0 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
the mic there is a joke and the volume is quite low 0 
overall a great experience 1 
a disappointment 0 
ray charles life provided excellent biographical material for the film which goes well beyond being just another movie about a musician 1 
last time buying from you 0 
the service was extremely slow 0 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
nicest chinese restaurant ive been in a while 1 
i went on motorolas website and followed all directions but could not get it to pair again 0 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
good value great food great service 1 
the acting sucks the music sucks the script sucks the pacing sucks the special fx suck the directing sucks basically this movie sucks 0 
i must say i have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again 1 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
returned 8 hours later 0 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
both actors truly understand and become their particular character delivering a convincing sincere performance 1 
service was very prompt 1 
definitely worth checking out 1 
but storm trooper is not even bad enough to make it to the list of wonderfully terrible movies 0 
in particular the relationship between the bakery assistant and the waitress just didnt work for me at all 0 
logitech bluetooth headset is a 10 1 
i cant see how this movie can be an inspiration to anyone to come out or overcome fear and rejection 0 
the movie is full of wonderful dancing hence the title 1 
any ring toneoverall good phone to buy 1 
the results well are a shame 0 
big disappointment with calendar sync 0 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
the ending is so so perfect youll shed a tear 1 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
i love the ownerchef his one authentic japanese cool dude 1 
after one bite i was hooked 1 
we will not be coming back 0 
awesome selection of beer 1 
the result is a powerhouse achievement made more timely now perhaps because of our cultures disturbing fascination with celebrity and its distorted interpretations of fame 1 
i immediately said i wanted to talk to the manager but i did not want to talk to the guy who was doing shots of fireball behind the bar 0 
there is a totally unnecessary trainroller coaster scene 0 
owners are really great people 1 
you wont forget this movie 1 
the screen size is big key pad lit well enough and the camera quality is excellent for a camera phone 1 
i especially liked the noncliche choices with the parents in other movies i could predict the dialog verbatim but the writing in this movie made better selections 1 
similarly the delivery man did not say a word of apology when our food was 45 minutes late 0 
poor product 0 
the most annoying thing about cover girl is the way in which rita hayworth is put up on a pedestal 0 
the concert sequences just sucked 0 
my sister has one also and she loves it 1 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
i hate those things as much as cheap quality black olives 0 
perfect for someone me who only likes beer ice cold or in this case even colder 1 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
up there with the best of melville 1 
love it great armband 1 
worthwhile 1 
the cast was great 1 
those phones are working just fine now 1 
ive had better not only from dedicated boba tea spots but even from jenni pho 0 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
i have yet to run this new battery below two bars and thats three days without charging 1 
waitress was sweet and funny 1 
highquality chicken on the chicken caesar salad 1 
what should have been a hilarious yummy christmas eve dinner to remember was the biggest fail of the entire trip for us 0 
my wife had the lobster bisque soup which was lukewarm 0 
he really didnt seem to want to be hosting his voiceovers were monotonous didnt get involved with the guests 0 
the potatoes were great and so was the biscuit 1 
if only someone involved with it knew how to string together narrative 0 
great price too 1 
just really good so far probably the best bt headset i have ever had 1 
not good by any stretch of the imagination 0 
i am also very happy with the price 1 
he deserves 5 stars 1 
there is nothing authentic about this place 0 
victor mclaglen was even bad and brian donlevy was almost unrecognizable 0 
what a mistake 0 
any ring toneoverall good phone to buy 1 
the acting was decidely wooden though no worse than a period universal b movie 0 
i guess i should have known that this place would suck because it is inside of the excalibur but i didnt use my common sense 0 
the sweet potato tots were good but the onion rings were perfection or as close as i have had 1 
this movie does an excellent job of revealing the complexity of the task and the incredible challenges facing south africa 1 
i had verizon 2 years ago and really liked their service 1 
that just screams legit in my booksomethats also pretty rare here in vegas 1 
this place should honestly be blown up 0 
but it picked up speed and got right to the point 1 
this is a stunning movie 1 
the movie was so boring that i sometimes found myself occupied peaking in the paper instead of watching never happened during a columbo movie before 0 
i guess i should have known that this place would suck because it is inside of the excalibur but i didnt use my common sense 0 
i believe that pitch black was done well 1 
really pleased with this product so far 1 
its a campy sort of film thats a joy to watch 1 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
a cheap and cheerless heist movie with poor characterisation lots of underbite style stoic emoting think chow yun fat in a better tomorrow and some cheesy clichés thrown into an abandoned factory ready for a few poorly executed flying judo rolls a la john woo 0 
all of the main players are mesmerising 1 
i loved it it was really scary 1 
i hate those things as much as cheap quality black olives 0 
which is precisely why i am giving it such a bad review 0 
dont waste your time 0 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
i loved it 1 
on the negative its insipid enough to cause regret for another 2 hours of life wasted in front of the screen 0 
mishima is extremely uninteresting 0 
very easy to use 1 
i have tried these cables with my computer and my ipod and it works just fine 1 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
after i pulled up my car i waited for another 15 minutes before being acknowledged 0 
i understand that its supposed to be a cheap popcorn comedy but that doesnt mean that it has to completely insult our intelligence and have writing so incredibly hackneyed that it borders on offensive 0 
the film succeeds despite or perhaps because of an obviously meagre budget 1 
it is easy to turn on and off when you are in the car and the volume controls are quite accessable 1 
which are small and not worth the price 0 
the incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film 1 
youd have to have the iq of particularly stupid mollusk not to see that one coming 0 
we made the drive all the way from north scottsdale and i was not one bit disappointed 1 
over rated 0 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
i would not recommend this place 0 
it makes very strange ticking noises before it ends the call 0 
lucy bell is so much higher than this crap and for her to sink this low is quite depressing 0 
as for the service im a fan because its quick and youre being served by some nice folks 1 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
works great 1 
the worst experience ever 0 
i was particularly pleased with the acting ability of dwight schultz 1 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
krussel always good 1 
too bad you have to pay up to a month for the service 0 
it ranks highly as a great noircrimedrama incredible performances by belmondo and lino ventura 1 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
this is the first phone ive had that has been so cheaply made 0 
ill put this gem up against any movie in terms of screenplay cinematography acting postproduction editing directing or any other aspect of filmmaking 1 
i dont think well be going back anytime soon 0 
you cant go wrong with any of the food here 1 
sam shepards portrayal of a gung ho marine was sobering 1 
the cast is good 1 
whatever prompted such a documentary is beyond me 0 
i highly recommend these and encourage people to give them a try 1 
but kevin spacey is an excellent verbal tsunami as buddy ackerman  and totally believable because he is a great actor 1 
the turkey and roast beef were bland 0 
total letdown i would much rather just go to the camelback flower shop and cartel coffee 0 
the acting by the whole cast could be put on a scale and balanced perfectly between overacting and underacting 0 
saggy floppy piece of junk 0 
otherwise dont even waste your time on this 0 
if you want a real scare rent this one 1 
this is the first phone ive had that has been so cheaply made 0 
you truly take this journey through the eyes and soul of a child 1 
service was good and the company was better 1 
they have great dinners 1 
this game rocks 1 
great phone 1 
soggy and not good 0 
ill give this film 10 out of 10 1 
everything is appalling 0 
w810i is just superb 1 
my fiancé and i came in the middle of the day and we were greeted and seated right away 1 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
what a waste of time 0 
the kids are very cool too 1 
excellent phone 1 
the macarons here are insanely good 1 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
avoid at all cost 0 
the performances are not improved by improvisation because the actors now have twice as much to worry about not only whether theyre delivering the line well but whether the line itself is any good 0 
i really hope the team behind this movie makes more movies and that they will continue to do so in their own some kinda weird style 1 
only had this a month but its worked flawlessly so far 1 
but the service was beyond bad 0 
you could drive a semi truck into these holes 0 
we walked away stuffed and happy about our first vegas buffet experience 1 
product is exactly as described 1 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
even the squibs look awful 0 
despite how hard i rate businesses its actually rare for me to give a 1 star 0 
its a great tool for entertainment communication and data managementoh be sure to use activesync 42 for optimal data synchronization results 1 
what happened next was prettyoff putting 0 
the headsets are easy to use and everyone loves them 1 
they are so easy to love but even more easy to identify with 1 
the cable looks so thin and flimsy it is scary 0 
things happen characters personalities change plot twists occur for no real reason other than that script calls for it 0 
and the chef was generous with his time even came around twice so we can take pictures with him 1 
this is an extraordinary film 1 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
i came over from verizon because cingulair has nicer cell phones the first thing i noticed was the really bad service 0 
when im on this side of town this will definitely be a spot ill hit up again 1 
good product incredible value 1 
after the disappointing dinner we went elsewhere for dessert 0 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
it wasnt busy either also the building was freezing cold 0 
poor construction 0 
and those baby owls were adorable 1 
i will continue to come here on ladies night andddd date night highly recommend this place to anyone who is in the area 1 
a drive thru means you do not want to wait around for half an hour for your food but somehow when we end up going here they make us wait and wait 0 
this short film certainly pulls no punches 0 
good service very clean and inexpensive to boot 1 
excellent phone 1 
waitress was sweet and funny 1 
at first i thought i was grtting a good deal at 744 until i plugged it into my phone v3c razr 0 
it was a bit too sweet not really spicy enough and lacked flavor 0 
case was more or less an extra that i originally put on but later discarded because it scratched my ear 0 
i heart this place 1 
it probably would have been better if the director hadnt spent most of the movie showcasing his own art work which really isnt that noteworthy 0 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
exceptionally bad 0 
by this time our side of the restaurant was almost empty so there was no excuse 0 
avoid at any and all costs 0 
our server was very nice and even though he looked a little overwhelmed with all of our needs he stayed professional and friendly until the end 1 
i do not know if this was emilio estevezs directorial debut but the pacing the interplay and development of the characters as well as some clever camera work surrounding the character estevez plays all suggest a natural eye 1 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
2 thumbs up to this seller 1 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
so i had to take the battery out of the phone put it all back together and then restart it 0 
go watch it 1 
the fries were not hot and neither was my burger 0 
i cannot believe that the actors agreed to do this film 0 
service is quick and even to go orders are just like we like it 1 
the goat taco didnt skimp on the meat and wow what flavor 1 
i was not impressed by this product 0 
he is an amazing film artist one of the most important whoever lived 1 
its like a really sexy party in your mouth where youre outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party 1 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
what a waste 0 
yes i am simplifying things here for the sake of brevity for this really is at the core of the problems with this film it has too much going on without any real fulfilling explanation 0 
do not buy for d807wrongly advertised for d807 0 
all in all an excellent restaurant highlighted by great service a unique menu and a beautiful setting 1 
unreliable im giving up 0 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
battery lasts only a few hours 0 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
worst ever 0 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
we definately enjoyed ourselves 1 
in my house i was getting dropped coverage upstairs and no coverage in my basement 0 
of course the footage from the 70s was grainy but that only enhanced the film 1 
their onscreen chemistry critical to the entire film is genuine 1 
its still wild stuff though and is highly recommended to fans of giallo cinema 1 
its a shame to see good actors like thomerson and james make a living in a mess like this 0 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
everything was good and tasty 1 
i have always used corded headsets and the freedom from the wireless is very helpful 1 
anyway the plot flowed smoothly and the malebonding scenes were a hoot 1 
i believe that pitch black was done well 1 
then i watched it again two sundays ago march 20th 2005 and i began to really enjoy it and this time i taped the entire thing 1 
this movie is a good and humorous comment on life in 2006 1 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
no ear loop needed its tiny and the sound is great 1 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
the phone takes forever to charge like 2 to 5 hours literally 0 
very clear quality sound and you dont have to mess with the sound on your ipod since you have the sound buttons on the headset 1 
the attempts at humor were pitiful and story is so awful it dosent bear thinking about which basically involves a vulcan stealing the enterprise to find god seriously i just didnt care about any of this film and oh not to mention uhura does a belly dance to distract male guards 0 
the pancake was also really good and pretty large at that 1 
the only thing that i think could improve is the sound leaks out from the headset 0 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
dont waste your money 0 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
alexander nevsky is a great film 1 
basically the service was very bad 0 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
from what my dinner companions told meeverything was very fresh with nice texture and taste 1 
small sleek impressive looking practical setup with ample storage in place 1 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
conclusion i loved it 1 
their steaks are 100 recommended 1 
just dont know why they were so slow 0 
really pleased with this product so far 1 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
def coming back to bowl next time 1 
i just wanted to leave 0 
the fried rice was dry as well 0 
my sister has one also and she loves it 1 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
muddy low quality sound and the casing around the wires insert was poorly super glued and slid off 0 
a good commentary of todays love and undoubtedly a film worth seeing 1 
i immediately said i wanted to talk to the manager but i did not want to talk to the guy who was doing shots of fireball behind the bar 0 
the vegetables are so fresh and the sauce feels like authentic thai 1 
unfortunately inexperience of direction meant that scene after scene passed with little in the way of dramatic tension or conflict 0 
i just dont know how this place managed to served the blandest food i have ever eaten when they are preparing indian cuisine 0 
ive seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie 0 
seriously its not worth wasting your or your kids time on 0 
it was horrendous 0 
that being said for a phone the camera is very nice many cool effects to play with and video is decent as well 1 
my drink was never empty and he made some really great menu suggestions 1 
food was below average 0 
last time buying from you 0 
but above all the exquisite visual composition of each moment with inventive and elegant use of closeup camera angle and lighting including pointillistic faux home movie footage is a wonder and joy to behold 1 
even when the women finally show up there is no sign of improvement the most expected things happen and by the time the film is over you might be far asleep 0 
i hate writing bad reviews about films especially those in which i really like the star but this film is so bad i dont believe for one second that anyone could have been proud of it 0 
its a great tool for entertainment communication and data managementoh be sure to use activesync 42 for optimal data synchronization results 1 
this film and i use that word loosely is an insult to the moviegoing public 0 
then our food came out disappointment ensued 0 
i took back my money and got outta there 0 
one character is totally annoying with a voice that gives me the feeling of fingernails on a chalkboard 0 
if you are looking for a good quality motorola headset keep looking this isnt it 0 
the fact is this film is a wonderful heartwarming tale about two people chasing their dreams 1 
id rather eat airline food seriously 0 
one character is totally annoying with a voice that gives me the feeling of fingernails on a chalkboard 0 
the nano stated itmy son was dissapointed 0 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
stay away from the q 0 
i am very impressed with this headset from plantronics 1 
good quality 1 
i live in the neighborhood so i am disappointed i wont be back here because it is a convenient location 0 
warning do not buy 0 
best of luck to the rude and noncustomer service focused new management 0 
ryans bar is definitely one edinburgh establishment i wont be revisiting 0 
soyo technology sucks 0 
krussel always good 1 
echo problemvery unsatisfactory 0 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
clever and a real crowdpleaserthis film still ranks among mickeys best films even after 80 wonderful years 1 
the cow tongue and cheek tacos are amazing 1 
good product incredible value 1 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
i dont think i will be back for a very long time 0 
it is perfect for a sitdown family meal or get together with a few friends 1 
ordered burger rare came in well done 0 
this is a great place to eat 1 
if you are reading this please dont go there 0 
considering the relations off screen between taylor and stanwyck it was surprising how little chemistry there was on screen between the two of them 0 
an awesome new look for fall 2000 1 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
if youre not familiar check it out 1 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
i never come again 0 
sweetest phone 1 
and dont even get me started on the jerky camerawork 0 
i liked the patio and the service was outstanding 1 
i didnt realize how wonderful the short really is until the last two scenes 1 
it was so bad i had lost the heart to finish it 0 
the last 15 minutes of movie are also not bad as well 1 
they have been around for years and carries the highest quality of antiglare screen protector that i have found to date 1 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
the death row scenes were entirely unmoving 0 
these products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet 0 
its one of the movies i need to see whenever it comes on tvnever mind the fact that i already have it memorized 1 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
id like to return it 0 
the best example of how dumb the writing is when its established that you can turn the zombiestudents back into humans by removing a necklace containing a piece of the meteorite 0 
you wont be disappointed 1 
raw and sublimely moving 1 
poor product 0 
phone is sturdy as all nokia bar phones are 1 
the plantains were the worst ive ever tasted 0 
everything is appalling 0 
wont work right or atleast for me 0 
see it with your kids if you have a chanceit will open up some amazing dialog about how far race relations have come in the last 50 years 1 
have been going since 2007 and every meal has been awesome 1 
very very sad 0 
and i really did find them funny 1 
its a great tool for entertainment communication and data managementoh be sure to use activesync 42 for optimal data synchronization results 1 
tom wilkinson broke my heart at the end and everyone elses judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike 1 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job 1 
i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
i sat riveted to the tv screen 1 
this is an outstanding little restaurant with some of the best food i have ever tasted 1 
very very fun chef 1 
none of it works just dont buy it 0 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
the lighting is just dark enough to set the mood 1 
avoid at all cost 0 
worst hour and a half of my lifeoh my gosh 0 
also its a real treat to see anthony quinn playing crazy horse 1 
20th century foxs road house 1948 is not only quite a silly noir but is an implausible unmitigated bore of a movie 0 
however after about a year the fliptop started to get loose and wobbly and eventually my screen went black and i couldnt receive and place calls 0 
i was deeply impressed with the character he played 1 
then as if i hadnt wasted enough of my life there they poured salt in the wound by drawing out the time it took to bring the check 0 
ive had this for nearly 2 years and it has worked great for me 1 
i love all the features and form factor 1 
this is one of the best italian thrillers of the early 70s 1 
great product fast shipping 1 
it worked very well 1 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
do not purchase this phone 0 
you get extra minutes so that you can carry out the call and not get cut off 1 
service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is vegas and located inside the crystals shopping mall by aria 1 
i am not a filmmaker nor am i a director but i would hide my head in the sand if id spent whatever amount of money and time on this movie 0 
makes it easier to keep up with my bluetooth when im not wearing it 0 
overall i would recommend this phone over the new walkman 1 
this is cool because most cases are just open there allowing the screen to get all scratched up 1 
1010 1 
doesnt last long 0 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
this pda rocks 1 
he was terrible 0 
pretty awesome place 1 
im glad the film didnt go for the most obvious choice as a lesser film certainly would have 1 
i dont think there are any redeeming qualities in this remake 0 
i even dropped this phone into a stream and it was submerged for 15 seconds and it still works great 1 
the fries were great too 1 
you get what you pay for i guess 0 
good beer drink selection and good food selection 1 
anyway the plot flowed smoothly and the malebonding scenes were a hoot 1 
have been going since 2007 and every meal has been awesome 1 
when my mom and i got home she immediately got sick and she only had a few bites of salad 0 
really awful 0 
ill put this gem up against any movie in terms of screenplay cinematography acting postproduction editing directing or any other aspect of filmmaking 1 
i was seated immediately 1 
battery life is real good 1 
we will not be coming back 0 
i mean this in a terrible way 0 
worst customer service 0 
disappointed 0 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
the accompanied software is almost brilliant 1 
did not like at all 0 
the food was barely lukewarm so it must have been sitting waiting for the server to bring it out to us 0 
think it over when you plan to own this onethis sure is the last moto phone for me 0 
good product incredible value 1 
i think the most wonderful parts literally full of wonder are the excerpts from his works 1 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
i checked out this place a couple years ago and was not impressed 0 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
it is a really good show to watch 1 
the camera really likes her in this movie 1 
it was a riot to see hugo weaving play a sexobsessed gay real estate salesman who uses his clients houses for his trysts with the flaming darren tom hollander 1 
we wont be going back 0 
i got home to see the driest damn wings ever 0 
poor quality and service 0 
i never walked out of a movie faster 0 
this film offers many delights and surprises 1 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
seriously killer hot chai latte 1 
i dont think it would hold it too securly on your belt 0 
a film not easily forgotten 1 
my drink was never empty and he made some really great menu suggestions 1 
horrible had to switch 3 times 0 
it seems completely secure both holding on to my belt and keeping the iphone inside 1 
i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
every element of this story was so over the top excessively phony and contrived that it was painful to sit through 0 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
it didnt charge for me 0 
i will never go back to this place and will never ever recommended this place to anyone 0 
it is light easy to use and has very clear reception and transmission 1 
this is a great place to eat 1 
waited and waited and waited 0 
fantastic service here 1 
seriously its not worth wasting your or your kids time on 0 
what happened next was prettyoff putting 0 
not much flavor to them and very poorly constructed 0 
favorite place in town for shawarrrrrrma 1 
the acting from all involved and that includes those like shatner and nimoy is bad and washed out and making them seem as old as they look in real life the special effects are tacky like when spock has to rescue kirk on a jet pack when he falls down from a mountain 0 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
highly recommended a 1 
i have tried these cables with my computer and my ipod and it works just fine 1 
i love lane but ive never seen her in a movie this lousy 0 
this movie is also revealing 1 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
what a piece of junk i lose more calls on this phone 0 
the staff are also very friendly and efficient 1 
this was such an awesome movie that i bought it off of ebay 1 
its aggravating 0 
the cable looks so thin and flimsy it is scary 0 
we enjoy their pizza and brunch 1 
the potatoes were great and so was the biscuit 1 
if only someone involved with it knew how to string together narrative 0 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
but i definitely would not eat here again 0 
dee snider just plain sucks 0 
in an interesting part of town this place is amazing 1 
it was awesome 1 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
i have purchased these for both family and friends and all enjoy their clarity and ease of use 1 
great pork sandwich 1 
i think the most wonderful parts literally full of wonder are the excerpts from his works 1 
this is such a fun and funny movie 1 
definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly will return next time im in vegas 1 
in the span of an hour i had two people exclaim whoa is that the new phone on tv 1 
maybe there would be a reasonable explanation for this atrocity 0 
also difficult to put onid recommend avoiding this product 0 
the death row scenes were entirely unmoving 0 
good protection and does not make phone too bulky 1 
we got sitting fairly fast but ended up waiting 40 minutes just to place our order another 30 minutes before the food arrived 0 
you need at least 3 mins to get to your phone book from the time you first turn on the phonebattery life is short 0 
the good cinematography also makes her and monica bellucci look very beautiful 1 
wow what a bad film 0 
there is nothing privileged about workingeating there 0 
your servers suck wait correction our server heimer sucked 0 
does not fit 0 
phone now holds charge like it did when it was new 1 
if only someone involved with it knew how to string together narrative 0 
rude inconsiderate management 0 
i will be back many times soon 1 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
love this product 1 
despite the pans of reviewers i liked this movie 1 
other than that the leather is nice and soft the fit is very tight the cut out for the face is a good shape 1 
now the burgers arent as good the pizza which used to be amazing is doughy and flavorless 0 
the waitresses are very friendly 1 
i can assure you that you wont be disappointed 1 
better than expected 1 
in the span of an hour i had two people exclaim whoa is that the new phone on tv 1 
but i thought his acting was skilled 1 
this place should honestly be blown up 0 
theres also enough hypocrisy in this film to make me vomit 0 
this one is simply a disappointment 0 
this item is fantastic and works perfectly 1 
i cant wait to go back 1 
the majority of the logitech earbud headsets failed 0 
actually the graphics were good at the time 1 
in fact its hard to remember that the part of ray charles is being acted and not played by the man himself 1 
the pizza selections are good 1 
leopard print is wonderfully wild 1 
he was very impressed when going from the original battery to the extended battery 1 
the seasonal fruit was fresh white peach puree 1 
so in a nutshell 1 the restaraunt smells like a combination of a dirty fish market and a sewer 0 
now imagine that every single one of those decisions was made wrong 0 
easy to use 1 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
they have horrible attitudes towards customers and talk down to each one when customers dont enjoy their food 0 
20th century foxs road house 1948 is not only quite a silly noir but is an implausible unmitigated bore of a movie 0 
the story which was told so eloquently by francis ford coppola 25 years earlier really unfolds gradually and leaves room for the characters to develop 1 
the interplay between martin and emilio contains the same wonderful chemistry we saw in wall street with martin and charlie 1 
better than expected 1 
it was too predictable even for a chick flick 0 
i would definitely recommend the jabra bt250v for those who are looking for comfort clarity and a great price 1 
thats how id describe this painfully dreary timewaster of a film 0 
the best example of how dumb the writing is when its established that you can turn the zombiestudents back into humans by removing a necklace containing a piece of the meteorite 0 
internet is excrutiatingly slow 0 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
the lines the cuts the audio everything is wrong 0 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
bad quality 0 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
we have gotten a lot of compliments on it 1 
the movie is not completely perfect but titta di girolamo will stay with you for a long time after the vision of the movie 1 
he deserves 5 stars 1 
horrible horrible protector 0 
after arguing with verizon regarding the dropped calls we returned the phones after two days 0 
i am glad i purchased it 1 
in fact its hard to remember that the part of ray charles is being acted and not played by the man himself 1 
then as if i hadnt wasted enough of my life there they poured salt in the wound by drawing out the time it took to bring the check 0 
at first glance it is a lovely bakery cafe nice ambiance clean friendly staff 1 
the server was very negligent of our needs and made us feel very unwelcome i would not suggest this place 0 
avoid this one if you can 0 
ive owned this phone for 7 months now and can say that its the best mobile phone ive had 1 
this was such an awesome movie that i bought it off of ebay 1 
strike 2 who wants to be rushed 0 
i thought errol flynn was brilliant as custer and has since become my favourite actor 1 
waiter was a jerk 0 
everything was fresh and delicious 1 
so absolutley fantastic 1 
it was a good thing that the tickets only cost five dollars because i would be mad if id have paid 750 to see this crap 0 
i mean really how do you get so famous for your fish and chips when its so terrible 0 
is pretty funny 1 
one of my favorite purchases ever 1 
did not like at all 0 
its a piece of crap 0 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
the cashier was friendly and even brought the food out to me 1 
save your money ive had this item for 11 months now 0 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
works great 1 
very serious spoilers this movie was a huge disappointment 0 
the service was a bit lacking 0 
very nice and relaxing late night viewing 1 
because both ears are occupied background is not distracting at all 1 
service stinks here 0 
what should have been a hilarious yummy christmas eve dinner to remember was the biggest fail of the entire trip for us 0 
great brunch spot 1 
i loved their mussels cooked in this wine reduction the duck was tender and their potato dishes were delicious 1 
we have tried 2 units and they both failed within 2 months pros 0 
we ordered the duck rare and it was pink and tender on the inside with a nice char on the outside 1 
raw and sublimely moving 1 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
problem is that the ear loops are made of weak material and break easily 0 
just really good so far probably the best bt headset i have ever had 1 
the performances are not improved by improvisation because the actors now have twice as much to worry about not only whether theyre delivering the line well but whether the line itself is any good 0 
the inside is really quite nice and very clean 1 
big disappointment with calendar sync 0 
due to this happening on every call i was forced to stop using this headset 0 
damn good steak 1 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
it lasts less than 3o minutes if i actually try to use the phonemy wife has the same phone with the same problem 0 
they have a really nice atmosphere 1 
this one works and was priced right 1 
the atmosphere is modern and hip while maintaining a touch of coziness 1 
great choice 1 
there was no chemistry between ben affleck and sandra bullock in this film and i couldnt understand why he would consider even leaving his wifetobe for this chick that he supposedly was knocked out by 0 
also notable is john baileys fine crisp beautifully colored cinematography and the great production design costumes by eiko ishioka who went on to do the memorable costumes for coppolas dracula for which she received a well deserved oscar 1 
we definately enjoyed ourselves 1 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
jamie foxx absolutely is ray charles 1 
it dit not work most of the time with my nokia 5320 0 
the acting was decidely wooden though no worse than a period universal b movie 0 
the poor actors 0 
what should have been a hilarious yummy christmas eve dinner to remember was the biggest fail of the entire trip for us 0 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
kind of flops around 0 
after i pulled up my car i waited for another 15 minutes before being acknowledged 0 
very comfortable 1 
phone is sturdy as all nokia bar phones are 1 
the bathrooms are clean and the place itself is well decorated 1 
its quite simply the highest most superlative form of cinema imaginable 1 
clever and a real crowdpleaserthis film still ranks among mickeys best films even after 80 wonderful years 1 
my salad had a bland vinegrette on the baby greens and hearts of palm 0 
will order from them again 1 
unreliable im giving up 0 
also makes it easier to hold on to 1 
crash is a depressing little nothing that provokes emotion but teaches you nothing if you already know racism and prejudice are bad things 0 
fantastic buy and will get again for whatever my next phone is 1 
couldnt use the unit with sunglasses not good in texas 0 
painful on the ear 0 
after a year the battery went completely dead on my headset 0 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
one thing i hate is the mode set button at the side 0 
everything was fresh and delicious 1 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
the price is reasonable and the service is great 1 
i must say i have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again 1 
tonight i had the elk filet specialand it sucked 0 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
hell no will i go back 0 
the plot simply rumbles on like a machine desperately depending on the addition of new scenes 0 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
their menu is diverse and reasonably priced 1 
i was shocked because no signs indicate cash only 0 
i exchanged the sony ericson z500a for this and im pretty happy with that decision 1 
any ring toneoverall good phone to buy 1 
generally it just lacked imagination 0 
dont buy it 0 
you wont forget this movie 1 
actually the graphics were good at the time 1 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
better than youd expect 1 
i love the scream movies and all horror movies and this one ranks way up there 1 
at no point in the proceedings does it look remotely like america 0 
i was not happy with this item 0 
having trouble with volume 0 
i wouldnt return 0 
this is an excellent film 1 
babie bop is very cute 1 
every thing on phone work perfectly she like it 1 
and if that isnt enough of a mess of a movie for you the picture is also marred with a constant use of studio sets and indoor exteriors 0 
battery has no life 0 
the movie seemed a little slow at first 0 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
works great 1 
we loved the place 1 
heres where the movie really pied me off 0 
the death row scenes were entirely unmoving 0 
seller shipped quickly and much cheaper than the competitors 1 
i guess maybe we went on an off night but it was disgraceful 0 
as for the mains also uninspired 0 
in my house i was getting dropped coverage upstairs and no coverage in my basement 0 
oh this is such a thing of beauty this restaurant 1 
food was so gooodd 1 
the performances are not improved by improvisation because the actors now have twice as much to worry about not only whether theyre delivering the line well but whether the line itself is any good 0 
this movie now joins revenge of the boogeyman and zombiez as part of the hellish trinity of horror films 0 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
good quality 1 
my rating just 3 out of 10 0 
the story is lame not interesting and never really explains the sinister origins of the puppets 0 
is it possible for a movie to get any worse than this 0 
the lines the cuts the audio everything is wrong 0 
a fly was in my apple juice a fly 0 
simply beautiful 1 
i have recommended it to friends 1 
the least said about the acting the better 0 
the camera really likes her in this movie 1 
delicious nyc bagels good selections of cream cheese real lox with capers even 1 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
im not impressed with the concept or the food 0 
the food is rich so order accordingly 1 
the only good thing was that it fits comfortably on small ears 1 
i saw this short film on hbo the other day and absolutely loved it 1 
i am very impressed with this headset from plantronics 1 
the two main characters may be two of the most believable children i ever saw put on screen 1 
damian is so talented and versatile in so many ways of writing and portraying different characters on screen 1 
its reception is very very poor 0 
im using it with an iriver spinn with case and it fits fine 1 
this place was such a nice surprise 1 
the good cinematography also makes her and monica bellucci look very beautiful 1 
it is unusable in a moving car at freeway speed 0 
not as good as i had hoped 0 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
yet plantronincs continues to use the same flawed charger design 0 
four stars for the food the guy in the blue shirt for his great vibe still letting us in to eat 1 
overall i rate this movie a 10 out of a 110 scale 1 
the plot well i said id let that one go 0 
the burger had absolutely no flavor the meat itself was totally bland the burger was overcooked and there was no charcoal flavor 0 
the lines the cuts the audio everything is wrong 0 
everything about it is just bad 0 
heres where the movie really pied me off 0 
go to place for gyros 1 
very nice and relaxing late night viewing 1 
product is exactly as described 1 
you cant relate with them hell you barely can understand them 0 
i know that sounds funny but to me it seemed like sketchy technology that wouldnt work wellwell this one works great 1 
the service was outshining i definitely recommend the halibut 1 
definitely will come back here again 1 
i especially love the long battery life 1 
but this movie is not funny considering the ridiculousness of it 0 
amazon sucks 0 
the sweet potato tots were good but the onion rings were perfection or as close as i have had 1 
then i watched it again two sundays ago march 20th 2005 and i began to really enjoy it and this time i taped the entire thing 1 
what this film lacks is a convincing script 0 
cooked to perfection and the service was impeccable 1 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
a truly truly bad film 0 
i wasnt expecting oscar material but this 0 
i dont think it would hold it too securly on your belt 0 
but if you liked movies like the matrix and better yet their sequels i think youll appreciate the thought provoking mindblowing experience this film will give you 1 
there is no real plot 0 
as a sushi lover avoid this place by all means 0 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
personally i think it shows that people should learn to find a compromise them self without involving other people into issue 1 
the food was terrible 0 
good item low price 1 
my first visit to hiro was a delight 1 
their daily specials are always a hit with my group 1 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
i did not have any problem with this item and would order it again if needed 1 
highly unprofessional and rude to a loyal patron 0 
the food was great as always compliments to the chef 1 
will be back again 1 
woa talk about awful 0 
much more interesting more action more suspense and less of the unneeded controversy 1 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
so in a nutshell 1 the restaraunt smells like a combination of a dirty fish market and a sewer 0 
i could barely stomach the meal but didnt complain because it was a business lunch 0 
i am glad i purchased it 1 
we watched our waiter pay a lot more attention to other tables and ignore us 0 
its a piece of crap 0 
i would recommend it 1 
sounds good reasonably priced and effective its that simple 1 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
wont ever go here again 0 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
food is way overpriced and portions are fucking small 0 
we waited for thirty minutes to be seated although there were 8 vacant tables and we were the only folks waiting 0 
looks great and is strong 1 
he surely doesnt know how to make a coherent action movie from the screenwriter of air force one who was only obliged to write the script just for a big sum of money 0 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
save your money ive had this item for 11 months now 0 
it fits my ear well and is comfortable on 1 
this movie contained an allstar cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i havent seen before 1 
i was mortified 0 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
cant store anything but phone numbers to sim 0 
the price is reasonable and the service is great 1 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
try them in the airport to experience some tasty food and speedy friendly service 1 
if you want a real scare rent this one 1 
she carries the movie well 1 
i was totally fascinated by the music the dancing everything 1 
as i said abovepretty useless 0 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
needless to say i wont be going back anytime soon 0 
today was my first taste of a buldogis gourmet hot dog and i have to tell you it was more than i ever thought possible 1 
i ordered the voodoo pasta and it was the first time id had really excellent pasta since going gluten free several years ago 1 
the food came out at a good pace 1 
i love this thing 1 
the least said about the acting the better 0 
there was no chemistry between ben affleck and sandra bullock in this film and i couldnt understand why he would consider even leaving his wifetobe for this chick that he supposedly was knocked out by 0 
for that its worth checking out 1 
first of all there are enough racial stereotypes and racial jokes to offend everyone 0 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
i have bought this nokia cell phone a few weeks ago and it was a nightmare 0 
i know this is not like the other restaurants at all something is very off here 0 
not as good as i had hoped 0 
in short dont bother with this movie 0 
the ripped banana was not only ripped but petrified and tasteless 0 
lordy the khao soi is a dish that is not to be missed for curry lovers 1 
anne heche was utterly convincing 1 
i have never had such bland food which surprised me considering the article we read focused so much on their spices and flavor 0 
generally it just lacked imagination 0 
my ribeye steak was cooked perfectly and had great mesquite flavor 1 
the camera on the phone may be used as a dustpan when indoors id rather be using a disposable then this 0 
not nearly as good looking as the amazon picture makes it look 0 
see both films if you can 1 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
it was so cool 1 
if you want healthy authentic or ethic food try this place 1 
the voice recognition thru the handset is excellent 1 
a pretty good product 1 
over rated 0 
case was more or less an extra that i originally put on but later discarded because it scratched my ear 0 
its a piece of crap 0 
this phone tries very hard to do everything but fails at its very ability to be a phone 0 
extremely tasty 1 
lastly the mozzarella sticks they were the best thing we ordered 1 
i get absolutely horrible reception in my apartment where with other phones i have not had this problem 0 
lets start with all the problemsthe acting especially from the lead professor was very very bad 0 
its a fresh subtle and rather sublime effect 1 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
some may say this buffet is pricey but i think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot 1 
i was so insulted 0 
they were goldencrispy and delicious 1 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
i really hope the team behind this movie makes more movies and that they will continue to do so in their own some kinda weird style 1 
then our food came out disappointment ensued 0 
nicest chinese restaurant ive been in a while 1 
it has kept up very well 1 
perhaps my phone is defective but people cannot hear me when i use this 0 
my sashimi was poor quality being soggy and tasteless 0 
i just saw this film and i recommend it 1 
i got this phone on reccomendation from a relative and im glad i did 1 
all in all i think it was a good investment 1 
dont waste your on this one 0 
the bathrooms are clean and the place itself is well decorated 1 
great sound and service 1 
this allows the possibility of double booking for the same date and time after the first 0 
good protection and does not make phone too bulky 1 
it finds my cell phone right away when i enter the car 1 
the charger arrived within the promised timeframe but it did not work 0 
overall a great experience 1 
works great 1 
i dont have to be an accountant to know im getting screwed 0 
the service was terrible food was mediocre 0 
the story which was told so eloquently by francis ford coppola 25 years earlier really unfolds gradually and leaves room for the characters to develop 1 
hence the whole story lacks a certain energy 0 
food quality has been horrible 0 
omelets are to die for 1 
i hate those things as much as cheap quality black olives 0 
your brain will attempt to shutdown as part of a primal impulse of selfpreservation 0 
avoid at any and all costs 0 
his performance as awarded was stunning 1 
2 thumbs up 1 
great place to relax and have an awesome burger and beer 1 
the dialogue is composed of things that make little sense 0 
there was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth but it didnt really work into the rest of the plot 0 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
very disappointing 0 
needless to say i wont be going back anytime soon 0 
owners are really great people 1 
omg the food was delicioso 1 
later i found myself lost in the power of the film 1 
food was below average 0 
this phone tries very hard to do everything but fails at its very ability to be a phone 0 
i ate there twice on my last visit and especially enjoyed the salmon salad 1 
highly recommended a 1 
up there with the best of melville 1 
it is the best charger i have seen on the market yet 1 
the phone takes forever to charge like 2 to 5 hours literally 0 
everything on the menu is terrific and we were also thrilled that they made amazing accommodations for our vegetarian daughter 1 
but this movie is definitely a below average rent 0 
do not purchase this phone 0 
this is a great place to eat 1 
the greek dressing was very creamy and flavorful 1 
i wont be back 0 
the price was very good and with the free shipping and all it was a good purchase 1 
all in all its an insult to ones intelligence and a huge waste of money 0 
cinematography noteworthy including fine views of barcelona and its famed gaudi towers 1 
i think it was robert ryans best film because he portrayed someone like my father and he was a schizophrenic in real lifemy father although he never murdered anyone but was affected more so during the second world war which made him worse 1 
in fact i liked it better than interview with a vampire and i liked this lestat stuart townsend better than cruises attempt 1 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
product is useless since it does not have enough charging current to charge the 2 cellphones i was planning to use it with 0 
it features an outlandish array of memorable psychotic but lovable nuts 1 
theres really nothing bad i can say about this headset 0 
youll love how thin it is 1 
walked in and the place smelled like an old grease trap and only 2 others there eating 0 
in an interesting part of town this place is amazing 1 
as for the service i thought it was good 1 
very tough and very short on flavor 0 
i am so pleased to know such a modern day genius is out there letting is passion for art drive him and taking us as an audience with him 1 
if you dont find it too bad as again the unit comes with one earpad onlyi would not recommend this to anyone 0 
the nokia ca42 usb cable did not work with my phone 0 
the bartender was also nice 1 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
bad purchase 0 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
the film succeeds despite or perhaps because of an obviously meagre budget 1 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
ill put this gem up against any movie in terms of screenplay cinematography acting postproduction editing directing or any other aspect of filmmaking 1 
i checked out this place a couple years ago and was not impressed 0 
what is even more stupid is that who had thought an idea that there should be a volcano in los angeles 0 
easily none other cartoon made me laugh in a tender way before getting into dark sitcoms oriented for teenagers 1 
waaaaaayyyyyyyyyy over rated is all i am saying 0 
it was so cool 1 
their frozen margaritas are way too sugary for my taste 0 
walked in and the place smelled like an old grease trap and only 2 others there eating 0 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
try them in the airport to experience some tasty food and speedy friendly service 1 
it is so small and you dont even realize that it is there after a while of getting used to it 1 
hard to judge whether these sides were good because we were grossed out by the melted styrofoam and didnt want to eat it for fear of getting sick 0 
very disappointing 0 
babie bop is very cute 1 
tasted like dirt 0 
this is the kind of money that is wasted properly 1 
this movie is also revealing 1 
20th century foxs road house 1948 is not only quite a silly noir but is an implausible unmitigated bore of a movie 0 
this place is way too overpriced for mediocre food 0 
lame would be the best way to describe it 0 
also if your phone is dropped this case is not going to save it specially when dropped face down 0 
light weight i hardly notice it is there 1 
despite the pans of reviewers i liked this movie 1 
why are these sad little vegetables so overcooked 0 
dont go here 0 
avoid at all costs 0 
im using it with an iriver spinn with case and it fits fine 1 
it was a drive to get there 0 
product is exactly as described 1 
barney is definitely super de duper 1 
too bad cause i know its family owned i really wanted to like this place 0 
ordered an appetizer and took 40 minutes and then the pizza another 10 minutes 0 
what the hell kind of crap is that 0 
product is useless since it does not have enough charging current to charge the 2 cellphones i was planning to use it with 0 
it wasnt busy either also the building was freezing cold 0 
there is really nothing for me at postinos hope your experience is better 0 
i recommend igo to anyone with different brand cell phonesmp3 players in the family 1 
here in the wind and the lion we see a wonderful rendering of americas own imperial age 1 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
characters are onedimensional even the good guys and especially the bad guys 0 
back to good bbq lighter fare reasonable pricing and tell the public they are back to the old ways 1 
item arrived quickly and works great with my metro pcs samsung schr450 slider phone and sony premium sound in ear plugs 1 
the problem i have is that they charge 1199 for a sandwich that is no bigger than a subway sub which offers better and more amount of vegetables 0 
i cant wait to go back 1 
id rather eat airline food seriously 0 
never got it 0 
wont ever go here again 0 
then i watched it again two sundays ago march 20th 2005 and i began to really enjoy it and this time i taped the entire thing 1 
will definitely be back 1 
i wear glasses and it fits fine with them 1 
i cannot believe that the actors agreed to do this film 0 
never got it 0 
this place is disgusting 0 
the acting helps the writing along very well maybe the idiotsavant sister could have been played better and it is a real joy to watch 1 
oh yeah and the storyline was pathetic too 0 
i ordered the voodoo pasta and it was the first time id had really excellent pasta since going gluten free several years ago 1 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
id advise anyone to go and see it 1 
this is was due to the fact that it took 20 minutes to be acknowledged then another 35 minutes to get our foodand they kept forgetting things 0 
great pork sandwich 1 
the bus boy on the other hand was so rude 0 
i would not recommend this place 0 
all of the main players are mesmerising 1 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
paolo sorrentino has written a wonderful story about loneliness and tony has built one of the most unforgettable characters seen in movies in recent years 1 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
i was very excited to get this headset because i thought it was really cute 1 
it also had a new problem 0 
the staff are also very friendly and efficient 1 
it was a drive to get there 0 
fantastic buy and will get again for whatever my next phone is 1 
love the margaritas too 1 
def coming back to bowl next time 1 
they could be used as exemplars for any set designer 1 
definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly will return next time im in vegas 1 
first time going but i think i will quickly become a regular 1 
star trek v the final frontier is the worst in the series 0 
you need at least 3 mins to get to your phone book from the time you first turn on the phonebattery life is short 0 
they brought a fresh batch of fries and i was thinking yay something warm but no 0 
so absolutley fantastic 1 
so anyone near you will hear part of your conversation 0 
i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
my first visit to hiro was a delight 1 
everyone is very attentive providing excellent customer service 1 
im very disappointed with my decision 0 
the acting sucks the music sucks the script sucks the pacing sucks the special fx suck the directing sucks basically this movie sucks 0 
the memories are murky but i can only say that i enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show 1 
they work about 2 weeks then break 0 
i do not know if this was emilio estevezs directorial debut but the pacing the interplay and development of the characters as well as some clever camera work surrounding the character estevez plays all suggest a natural eye 1 
stay away from the q 0 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
unfortunately it will not recharge my iphone 4s despite connecting it from multiple power sources imac external battery wall outlet etc 0 
gave up trying to eat any of the crust teeth still sore 0 
very slow at seating even with reservation 0 
i found the product to be easy to set up and use 1 
a lot of websites have been rating this a very good phone and so do i 1 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
we ordered some old classics and some new dishes after going there a few times and were sorely disappointed with everything 0 
he came running after us when he realized my husband had left his sunglasses on the table 1 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
cant get the software to work with my computer 0 
that one didnt work either 0 
all i can do is whine on the internet so here it goesthe more i use the thing the less i like it 0 
this movie does an excellent job of revealing the complexity of the task and the incredible challenges facing south africa 1 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
treo and tmobile refused to replace it again and forced me to buy another phone without any kind of upgrade discount 0 
this is an excellent tool especially when paired with your phones autoanswer 1 
if that bug never showed up i would have given a 4 for sure but on the other side of the wall where this bug was climbing was the kitchen 0 
delicious nyc bagels good selections of cream cheese real lox with capers even 1 
never got it 0 
1 long lasting battery you dont have to recharge it as frequentyly as some of the flip phones2 0 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
this case seems well made 1 
not worth it 0 
very very fun chef 1 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
it kept getting worse and worse so now im officially done 0 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
this mostly routine factbased tv drama gets a boost from the fine performance by cole 1 
the only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port irda 0 
i hope this place sticks around 1 
i know that sounds funny but to me it seemed like sketchy technology that wouldnt work wellwell this one works great 1 
my rating just 3 out of 10 0 
110 and only because there is no setting for 010 0 
you need two hands to operate the screenthis software interface is decade old and cannot compete with new software designs 0 
overall i am psyched to have a phone which has all my appointments and contacts in and gets great reception 1 
this is an excellent film 1 
i want to first say our server was great and we had perfect service 1 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
the portion was huge 1 
dont waste your time watching this rubbish nonresearched film 0 
a happy wonderful feel good ending 1 
it is perfect for a sitdown family meal or get together with a few friends 1 
unfortunately the ability to actually know you are receiving a call is a rather important feature and this phone is pitiful in that respect 0 
it did not work in my cell phone plug i am very up set with the charger 0 
we walked away stuffed and happy about our first vegas buffet experience 1 
i think i was one of the people who found this another one of roths pearls 1 
schrader has made a resume full of lousy amateurish films 0 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
this movie has a cutting edge to it 1 
their steaks are 100 recommended 1 
he also came back to check on us regularly excellent service 1 
the chicken i got was definitely reheated and was only ok the wedges were cold and soggy 0 
so far it has worked like a charm 1 
2 thumbs up 1 
del taco is pretty nasty and should be avoided if possible 0 
the staff are great the ambiance is great 1 
great sound and service 1 
i found a six inch long piece of wire in my salsa 0 
there are many continuity errors one other user commented on different cars in the garage joes glassesthe one that got to me the most was the fact joes facial hair configuration seemed to change from scene to scene 0 
ive had no trouble accessing the internet downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions 1 
10 out of 10 for both the movie and trilogy 1 
both actors truly understand and become their particular character delivering a convincing sincere performance 1 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
great atmosphere friendly and fast service 1 
i struggle to find anything bad to say about it 1 
food was really good and i got full petty fast 1 
excellent product for the price 1 
but if you liked movies like the matrix and better yet their sequels i think youll appreciate the thought provoking mindblowing experience this film will give you 1 
the bt headset was such a disapoinment 0 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
the menu is always changing food quality is going down service is extremely slow 0 
it was awesome 1 
the film has great actors a master director a significant themeat least a wouldbe significant theme undertone of fifties existential worldweariness aerial scenes that ought to have thrilled both senses and imagination and characters about which one might deeply care 1 
each track commands sentiment actually contributing to the scenes and characters 1 
adapter does not provide enough charging current 0 
an instant classic with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits 1 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
they were goldencrispy and delicious 1 
my friend loved the salmon tartar 1 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
it was so boring 0 
still i do like this movie for its empowerment of women theres not enough movies out there like this one 1 
after the disappointing dinner we went elsewhere for dessert 0 
its fits like a glove and is strong secure and durable 1 
and considering the two of us left there very full and happy for about 20 you just cant go wrong 1 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
great place to relax and have an awesome burger and beer 1 
it deserves strong love 1 
this movie is also revealing 1 
this if the first movie ive given a 10 to in years 1 
these were so good we ordered them twice 1 
this pair of headphones is the worst that i have ever had soundwise 0 
the buttons for on and off are bad 0 
the cashier was friendly and even brought the food out to me 1 
it was probably dirt 0 
the movie showed a lot of florida at its best made it look very appealing 1 
i have purchased these for both family and friends and all enjoy their clarity and ease of use 1 
this phone works great 1 
1 long lasting battery you dont have to recharge it as frequentyly as some of the flip phones2 0 
no ear loop needed its tiny and the sound is great 1 
i can think of no other film where something vitally important occurs every other minute 1 
the last 15 minutes of movie are also not bad as well 1 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
avoid at any and all costs 0 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
that just screams legit in my booksomethats also pretty rare here in vegas 1 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
this is a masterful piece of filmmaking with many themes simmering and occasionally boiling over in this warts and all study of the poets bohemian selfindulgent wartime years that span the aerial bombardments of london and the outward tranquillity of a welsh coastal retreat the borderlines between friendship lust and love dedication to art and experience versus practical concerns jealousy rivalry cowardice and egotism versus heroism and selfsacrifice and more 1 
its kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly its embarrassing how childlike the company is 0 
do not buy for d807wrongly advertised for d807 0 
my side greek salad with the greek dressing was so tasty and the pita and hummus was very refreshing 1 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
the 12 mega pixel camera being a part of a phone is reasonably good7 1 
the food was barely lukewarm so it must have been sitting waiting for the server to bring it out to us 0 
the construction of the headsets is poor 0 
i bought this phone as a replacement for my startac and have regretted it since 0 
incredible 1 
four stars for the food the guy in the blue shirt for his great vibe still letting us in to eat 1 
this place receives stars for their appetizers 1 
at no point in the proceedings does it look remotely like america 0 
the fried rice was dry as well 0 
i was shocked because no signs indicate cash only 0 
both do good jobs and are quite amusing 1 
their daily specials are always a hit with my group 1 
kind of flops around 0 
i really dont see how anyone could enjoy this movie 0 
so far it has worked like a charm 1 
the bathrooms are clean and the place itself is well decorated 1 
all in all i can assure you ill be back 1 
trouble is the writing and directing make it impossible to establish those things that make a movie watchable like character story theme and so on 0 
the acting is fantastic the stories are seamlessly woven together and the dogs are splendid a must rent view or see 1 
very disappointing 0 
id rather eat airline food seriously 0 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
i really enjoyed eating here 1 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
wow what a bad film 0 
voice quality signal strength dropped calls 0 
call me a nut but i think this is one of the best movies ever 1 
freezes frequently4 0 
youll love it 1 
nice design and quality 1 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 
the scenes with the ohsomature neighbourgirl are a misplace 0 
disappointing accessory from a good manufacturer 0 
this place is disgusting 0 
be sure to order dessert even if you need to pack it togo the tiramisu and cannoli are both to die for 1 
this totally unfunny movie is so over the top and pathetic and unrealistic that throughout the whole 90 minutes of utter torture i probably looked at my watch about 70000 times 0 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
iam very pleased with my purchase 1 
i have had mine for about a year and this christmas i bought some for the rest of the family 1 
penne vodka excellent 1 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
they dropped more than the ball 0 
good item low price 1 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
i asked multiple times for the wine list and after some time of being ignored i went to the hostess and got one myself 0 
does not work 0 
the pancake was also really good and pretty large at that 1 
what makes this story different are the terrific production values faultless photography composition and editing the terrific casting the underappreciated brian keith playing a bully teddy and vivid history 1 
those phones are working just fine now 1 
it was also the right balance of war and love 1 
when a song could explain the emotions of the subjects better such as when jay adams unfortunate life was a subject of talk the song old man by neil young was played which evokes many emotions 1 
everything on the menu is terrific and we were also thrilled that they made amazing accommodations for our vegetarian daughter 1 
the lines the cuts the audio everything is wrong 0 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
we wont be going back 0 
i could eat their bruschetta all day it is devine 1 
i am glad i purchased it 1 
bacon is hella salty 1 
what makes this story different are the terrific production values faultless photography composition and editing the terrific casting the underappreciated brian keith playing a bully teddy and vivid history 1 
the battery is unreliable as well as the service use antena 0 
i keep watching it over and over 1 
does not work for listening to music with the cingular 8125 0 
overall i wasnt very impressed with noca 0 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
the buttons for on and off are bad 0 
10 out of 10 stars 1 
i am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this 1 
the sides are delish mixed mushrooms yukon gold puree white corn beateous 1 
superb phone on a great network 1 
im a bit disappointed 0 
each day of the week they have a different deal and its all so delicious 1 
good servicecheck 1 
product is useless since it does not have enough charging current to charge the 2 cellphones i was planning to use it with 0 
this is simply the best bluetooth headset for sound quality 1 
this is a disgrace 0 
we watched our waiter pay a lot more attention to other tables and ignore us 0 
so flavorful and has just the perfect amount of heat 1 
but even the talented carrell cant save this 0 
overall i would recommend this phone over the new walkman 1 
good case excellent value 1 
it has northern humour and positive about the community it represents 1 
trying to make a call on these is an exercise in frustration 0 
i have bought this nokia cell phone a few weeks ago and it was a nightmare 0 
krussel always good 1 
his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic 1 
i will continue to come here on ladies night andddd date night highly recommend this place to anyone who is in the area 1 
as many people complained i found this headsets microphone was very weak 0 
drinks took close to 30 minutes to come out at one point 0 
this place receives stars for their appetizers 1 
as for the service im a fan because its quick and youre being served by some nice folks 1 
its one of the most boring horror movies from the 90s mainly because it starts slow and centers in a boring atmosphere 0 
but even the talented carrell cant save this 0 
the bose noise cancelling is amazing which is very important for a nyc commuter 1 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
if good intentions made a film great then this film might be one of the greatest films ever made 1 
this place is amazing 1 
the results well are a shame 0 
it is worth the drive 1 
great time family dinner on a sunday night 1 
weve tried to like this place but after 10 times i think were done with them 0 
the service was great even the manager came and helped with our table 1 
the owner used to work at nobu so this place is really similar for half the price 1 
the soundtrack sucked 0 
the structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema 1 
stay away from the q 0 
this movie is also revealing 1 
very good food great atmosphere1 1 
i immediately said i wanted to talk to the manager but i did not want to talk to the guy who was doing shots of fireball behind the bar 0 
finally after three or four times the spring of the latch broke and i could not use it any longer on the visor 0 
excellent performance 1 
this hole in the wall has great mexican street tacos and friendly staff 1 
oh and i forgot to also mention the weird color effect it has on your phone 0 
i love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it 1 
warning stay away 0 
the food was great as always compliments to the chef 1 
the pancake was also really good and pretty large at that 1 
what a disappointment 0 
see it with your kids if you have a chanceit will open up some amazing dialog about how far race relations have come in the last 50 years 1 
reasonably priced also 1 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
it isnt even an achievement as a sobaditsgood or sobaditsmemorable movie 0 
frozen pucks of disgust with some of the worst people behind the register 0 
i love my 350 headset my jabra350 bluetooth headset is great the reception is very good and the ear piece is a comfortable fit 1 
great food and service huge portions and they give a military discount 1 
totally believable 1 
i was able to do voice dialing in the car with no problem 1 
one thing i hate is the mode set button at the side 0 
so in a nutshell 1 the restaraunt smells like a combination of a dirty fish market and a sewer 0 
on the up side their cafe serves really good food 1 
after i pulled up my car i waited for another 15 minutes before being acknowledged 0 
you wont forget this movie 1 
the stories were powerful explorations of the nature of man and of art 1 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
a truly truly bad film 0 
cinematography noteworthy including fine views of barcelona and its famed gaudi towers 1 
maybe its just their vegetarian fare but ive been twice and i thought it was average at best 0 
their regular toasted bread was equally satisfying with the occasional pats of butter mmmm 1 
everything is appalling 0 
for that price i can think of a few place i would have much rather gone 0 
razr battery good buy 1 
the only good thing was our waiter he was very helpful and kept the bloddy marys coming 1 
the poor actors 0 
the characters are interesting even if a bit predictable 1 
my experience was terrible this was my fourth bluetooth headset and while it was much more comfortable than my last jabra which i hated 0 
i especially love the long battery life 1 
worst hour and a half of my lifeoh my gosh 0 
say bye bye to your tip lady 0 
2 thumbs up to this seller 1 
our server was very nice and even though he looked a little overwhelmed with all of our needs he stayed professional and friendly until the end 1 
food was really good and i got full petty fast 1 
the writers were smack on and i think the best actors and actresses were a bonus to the showthese characters were so real 1 
i connected my wifes bluetoothmotorola hs850 to my phone and it worked like a charm whether the phone was in my pocket or the case 1 
im returning them 0 
very clear quality sound and you dont have to mess with the sound on your ipod since you have the sound buttons on the headset 1 
when my mom and i got home she immediately got sick and she only had a few bites of salad 0 
i was deeply impressed with the character he played 1 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
the camera really likes her in this movie 1 
the mic there is a joke and the volume is quite low 0 
for those that havent seen it dont waste your time 0 
food quality has been horrible 0 
i found the product to be easy to set up and use 1 
the only thing i wasnt too crazy about was their guacamole as i dont like it puréed 0 
the pancake was also really good and pretty large at that 1 
if you want a sandwich just go to any firehouse 1 
doesnt last long 0 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
unfortunately it will not recharge my iphone 4s despite connecting it from multiple power sources imac external battery wall outlet etc 0 
it features an outlandish array of memorable psychotic but lovable nuts 1 
definitely not worth the 3 i paid 0 
also difficult to put onid recommend avoiding this product 0 
call me a nut but i think this is one of the best movies ever 1 
i wont be back 0 
i have only had it for a few weeks but so far so good 1 
the ending is so so perfect youll shed a tear 1 
crash is a depressing little nothing that provokes emotion but teaches you nothing if you already know racism and prejudice are bad things 0 
it felt like a very gripping intelligent stage play but without the overly theatrical feeling one actually gets from watching people on a stage which plays on everyones terror of a white lie escalating to monstrous consequences 1 
if only someone involved with it knew how to string together narrative 0 
cooked to perfection and the service was impeccable 1 
my rating just 3 out of 10 0 
it probably would have been better if the director hadnt spent most of the movie showcasing his own art work which really isnt that noteworthy 0 
car charger as well as ac charger are included to make sure you never run out of juicehighy recommended 1 
one thing i hate is the mode set button at the side 0 
very good product well made 1 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
my 810 score is mostly for the plot 1 
all in all i think it was a good investment 1 
special mention should be made of the superb music score and sound effects which are an integral element in helping to make this such a memorable and enjoyable cartoon 1 
would recommend this item 1 
very very disappointed ordered the 35 big bay plater 0 
these are the central themes of the film and they are handled ineptly stereotypically and with no depth of imagination 0 
beautiful styling though 1 
because both ears are occupied background is not distracting at all 1 
leopard print is wonderfully wild 1 
your servers suck wait correction our server heimer sucked 0 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
and if that isnt enough of a mess of a movie for you the picture is also marred with a constant use of studio sets and indoor exteriors 0 
i cant see how this movie can be an inspiration to anyone to come out or overcome fear and rejection 0 
service was fantastic 1 
the steak and the shrimp are in my opinion the best entrees at gc 1 
i love being able to use one headset for both by landline and cell 1 
i was very excited to get this headset because i thought it was really cute 1 
its the one movie that never ceases to interest me simply because it keeps me alert as i try to attempt to decipher its meanings 1 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
so i basically threw my money out the window for nothing 0 
its welldesigned and very sharp the blue is a very nice color 1 
its been my choice headset for yearsgreat sound good volume good noise cancellation 1 
we waited for forty five minutes in vain 0 
this is infuriating 0 
the accompanied software is almost brilliant 1 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
great hands free device 1 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
i used bitpim a free program you can find on the internetto transfer data to the phonethe price of the cable was excellent 1 
i am so pleased to know such a modern day genius is out there letting is passion for art drive him and taking us as an audience with him 1 
he came running after us when he realized my husband had left his sunglasses on the table 1 
the plot is nonsense that doesnt interest in the slightest way or have any uniqueness to it 0 
great price also 1 
i checked out this place a couple years ago and was not impressed 0 
works well 1 
its a feelgood film and thats how i felt when i came out of the cinema 1 
the server was very negligent of our needs and made us feel very unwelcome i would not suggest this place 0 
then our food came out disappointment ensued 0 
my side greek salad with the greek dressing was so tasty and the pita and hummus was very refreshing 1 
not sure who was more lost the flat characters or the audience nearly half of whom walked out 0 
hayao miyazakis latest and eighth film for studio ghibili gake no ue no ponyo ponyo on the cliff by the sea is a wonderfully fun and imaginative look at childhood 1 
the black eyed peas and sweet potatoes unreal 1 
and there wasnt a single sour note struck actingwise either some surprisingly solid casting here 1 
waitress was good though 1 
also makes it easier to hold on to 1 
the descriptions said yum yum sauce and another said eel sauce yet another said spicy mayowell none of the rolls had sauces on them 0 
my 5year old nokia 2160 from tracfone holds the charge a lot better than this 0 
im a bit disappointed 0 
soggy and not good 0 
constantine gives everything the right intensity and seems to have a good understanding of the underlying psychological motivations 1 
john garfield ann revere lilli plmer william conrad canada leeand filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screenjames wong howe 1 
i especially liked the noncliche choices with the parents in other movies i could predict the dialog verbatim but the writing in this movie made better selections 1 
nargile i think you are great 1 
it wasnt busy either also the building was freezing cold 0 
the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach 0 
very disappointed 0 
soyo technology sucks 0 
i will continue to come here on ladies night andddd date night highly recommend this place to anyone who is in the area 1 
the inside is really quite nice and very clean 1 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
dont buy this product it fails 0 
it was awesome 1 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
that was funny 1 
the soundtrack sucked 0 
the chicken dishes are ok the beef is like shoe leather 0 
i have 23 bars on my cell phone when i am home but you cant not hear anything 0 
both great 1 
i am very impressed with the job that motorola did on the sturdiness of this phone 1 
ample portions and good prices 1 
the malta settings are as dry and as barren as the dialogue 0 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
dont do it 0 
best ive found so far ive tried 2 other bluetooths and this one has the best quality for both me and the listener as well as ease of using 1 
avoid at all costs 0 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
i saw it as a child on tv back in 1973 when it was the stranger and i loved it 1 
great place to relax and have an awesome burger and beer 1 
absolutely great 1 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
the budget was evidently very limited 0 
the hockey scenes are terrible defensemen playing like theyre 5 years old goalies diving at shots that are 10 feet wide of the net etc 0 
plus its only 8 bucks 1 
if you dont find it too bad as again the unit comes with one earpad onlyi would not recommend this to anyone 0 
the restaurant atmosphere was exquisite 1 
that said our mouths and bellies were still quite pleased 1 
i could eat their bruschetta all day it is devine 1 
not nearly as good looking as the amazon picture makes it look 0 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
the puppets look really cheesy not in a good way like in the puppet master 80s flicks 0 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
piece of junk 0 
im surprised this is a good quality car charger and theres not much reviews about it 1 
i struggle to find anything bad to say about it 1 
highly entertaining at all angles 1 
my boyfriend tried the mediterranean chicken salad and fell in love 1 
the mic there is a joke and the volume is quite low 0 
this is simply the best bluetooth headset for sound quality 1 
only had this a month but its worked flawlessly so far 1 
a pretty good product 1 
i enjoyed it 1 
item arrived quickly and works great with my metro pcs samsung schr450 slider phone and sony premium sound in ear plugs 1 
the jabra eargels fit my ears very well 1 
not as good as i had hoped 0 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
even when the women finally show up there is no sign of improvement the most expected things happen and by the time the film is over you might be far asleep 0 
i had to go to a store and bought a new nokia phone which is working great 1 
i was left shattered from the experience of watching this film and i took a good two hours to fully recover 0 
excellent product 1 
best tacos in town by far 1 
tom wilkinson broke my heart at the end and everyone elses judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike 1 
bad characters bad story and bad acting 0 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
the mic there is a joke and the volume is quite low 0 
definitely worth checking out 1 
last time buying from you 0 
crust is not good 0 
and his subtle connections between the three films are awesome 1 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
the stories were as unbelievable as the actors 0 
talk about great customer service of course we will be back 1 
absolutel junk 0 
in short dont bother with this movie 0 
ive had this bluetoooth headset for some time now and still not comfortable with the way it fits on the ear 0 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
by the time the film ended i not only disliked it i despised it 0 
very very disappointed ordered the 35 big bay plater 0 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
trumbull on i love lucy 1 
this would not even be good as a made for tv flick 0 
when my mom and i got home she immediately got sick and she only had a few bites of salad 0 
a cheap and cheerless heist movie with poor characterisation lots of underbite style stoic emoting think chow yun fat in a better tomorrow and some cheesy clichés thrown into an abandoned factory ready for a few poorly executed flying judo rolls a la john woo 0 
steve martin delivers a really funny performance of a middleaged upper class uptight white guy 1 
i want to first say our server was great and we had perfect service 1 
great atmosphere friendly and fast service 1 
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 
unreliable im giving up 0 
very good lunch spot 1 
would recommend this item 1 
weve tried to like this place but after 10 times i think were done with them 0 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
what should have been a hilarious yummy christmas eve dinner to remember was the biggest fail of the entire trip for us 0 
it really is impressive that the place hasnt closed down 0 
makes it easier to keep up with my bluetooth when im not wearing it 0 
wow what a bad film 0 
it was that loudglad to say that the plantronics 510 maintains a flawless connection to my cell and with no static during normal use 1 
no plot whatsoever 0 
we walked away stuffed and happy about our first vegas buffet experience 1 
very clear quality sound and you dont have to mess with the sound on your ipod since you have the sound buttons on the headset 1 
bad choice 0 
trouble is the writing and directing make it impossible to establish those things that make a movie watchable like character story theme and so on 0 
it had some average acting from the main person and it was a low budget as you clearly can see 0 
i especially love the long battery life 1 
the movie lacks visual interest drama expression of feeling and celebration of the very patriotism that underlines the narrative 0 
weird vibe from owners 0 
do not buy if you want to use the holster 0 
none of the new ones have ever quite worked properly 0 
this is a very average phone with bad battery life that operates on a weak network 0 
perhaps i caught them on an off night judging by the other reviews but im not inspired to go back 0 
i believe every one should see this movie as i think few people outside of south africa understand its past and what is being attempted in the truth and reconciliation process 1 
the only consistent thread holding the series together were the amazing performances of leni parker and anita laselva as the two taelons in quiet idealogical conflict 0 
but then they came back cold 0 
the battery is unreliable as well as the service use antena 0 
extremely tasty 1 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
i saw this short film on hbo the other day and absolutely loved it 1 
now this is a movie i really dislike 0 
walked in and the place smelled like an old grease trap and only 2 others there eating 0 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
voice quality signal strength dropped calls 0 
it just blew 0 
nice headset priced right 1 
i was not happy with this item 0 
you could only take 2 videos at a time and the quality was very poor 0 
it works fine on my motorola 325 cellphone and a lot better than the wornout battery did 1 
the whole experience was underwhelming and i think well just go to ninja sushi next time 0 
the food was terrible 0 
one nice thing was that they added gratuity on the bill since our party was larger than 6 or 8 and they didnt expect more tip than that 1 
do not buy if you want to use the holster 0 
i felt as though her going to ireland did absolutely nothing whatsoever 0 
my 810 score is mostly for the plot 1 
the design is very good4 1 
for that price i can think of a few place i would have much rather gone 0 
the basic premise is wasted since it is sidelined by the inexplicable focus on the documentary crew 0 
does not fit 0 
i keep watching it over and over 1 
the food is rich so order accordingly 1 
this place was such a nice surprise 1 
only like 3 or 4 buildings used a couple of locations maybe poor hummh 0 
you share general loewenhielms exquisite joy in his partaking of the cailles en sarcophage even though you are just watching a movie but you do wish for just a small sample to savor 1 
sucked most of the stuff does not work with my phone 0 
the han nan chicken was also very tasty 1 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
i would recommend saving room for this 1 
eew this location needs a complete overhaul 0 
honeslty it didnt taste that fresh 0 
if youre not familiar check it out 1 
not good enough for the price 0 
it was equally awful 0 
this is a great deal 1 
plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job 1 
highly entertaining at all angles 1 
i liked the patio and the service was outstanding 1 
his losing his marbles so early in the proceedings is totally implausible and unconvincing 0 
i never come again 0 
ambience is perfect 1 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
director paul matthews who also wrotedirected the weak 1995 monster movie grim clearly doesnt know how to pace his films 0 
beautiful styling though 1 
it was too predictable even for a chick flick 0 
the film succeeds despite or perhaps because of an obviously meagre budget 1 
nice leather 1 
it is light easy to use and has very clear reception and transmission 1 
i have purchased these for both family and friends and all enjoy their clarity and ease of use 1 
that one didnt work either 0 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
barney is definitely super de duper 1 
and i just love the colors 1 
pretty piece of junk 0 
i consider this theft 0 
10 out of 10 for both the movie and trilogy 1 
ive had this bluetoooth headset for some time now and still not comfortable with the way it fits on the ear 0 
it works fine on my motorola 325 cellphone and a lot better than the wornout battery did 1 
its a campy sort of film thats a joy to watch 1 
of all the dishes the salmon was the best but all were great 1 
doesnt work 0 
good show samsung 1 
if there was ever an indication of a writer and a directors ability to meld two highly volatile temperaments into a seamless union of creativity then this is it 1 
his performance as awarded was stunning 1 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
keep up the good work amazon 1 
i got to enjoy the seafood salad with a fabulous vinegrette 1 
my salad had a bland vinegrette on the baby greens and hearts of palm 0 
it came free with a dvd player i bought but i still turned the thing off halfway through because i was embarrassed for howell 0 
a very good film indeed about great and unconditional love 1 
this film and i use that word loosely is an insult to the moviegoing public 0 
reversible plug works great 1 
i can think of no other film where something vitally important occurs every other minute 1 
fits comfortably came with three sizes of earbud tips 1 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
this is such a fun and funny movie 1 
an hour seriously 0 
damian is so talented and versatile in so many ways of writing and portraying different characters on screen 1 
it was either too cold not enough flavor or just bad 0 
excellent phone 1 
great food and great service in a clean and friendly setting 1 
lots of holes in the script 0 
oh and i forgot to also mention the weird color effect it has on your phone 0 
how this piece of trash was ever released is beyond me the acting the story the characters the supposedly special effects etcits all wrong 0 
i dont understand how this garbage got on the shelves of the movie store its not even a real movie 0 
the dialogue sucked 0 
it has northern humour and positive about the community it represents 1 
i checked everywhere and there is no feature for it which is really disappointing 0 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
not only did the software do a great job of this i could also make my own ringtones form my existing cds without an internet connection 1 
things happen characters personalities change plot twists occur for no real reason other than that script calls for it 0 
as for the service i thought it was good 1 
no one at the table thought the food was above average or worth the wait that we had for it 0 
say bye bye to your tip lady 0 
the plastic breaks really easy on this clip 0 
i do think tom hanks is a good actor 1 
i liked this movie way too much 1 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
everyone is very attentive providing excellent customer service 1 
love it great armband 1 
its a feelgood film and thats how i felt when i came out of the cinema 1 
today the graphics are crap 0 
its a sad movie but very good 1 
the waitress and manager are so friendly 1 
poor talk time performance 0 
the battery is unreliable as well as the service use antena 0 
please dont waste your money 0 
i am sorry i made this purchase 0 
penne vodka excellent 1 
from what my dinner companions told meeverything was very fresh with nice texture and taste 1 
the roast beef sandwich tasted really good 1 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
the concert sequences just sucked 0 
internet is excrutiatingly slow 0 
and if that isnt enough of a mess of a movie for you the picture is also marred with a constant use of studio sets and indoor exteriors 0 
this company charge me a restocking fee and still not given me my refund back 0 
a very good film indeed about great and unconditional love 1 
meredith m was better than all right 1 
whatever the producer was going for he missed entirely 0 
i would recommend this 1 
good beer drink selection and good food selection 1 
by the time the film ended i not only disliked it i despised it 0 
im so happy to be here 1 
the owners are super friendly and the staff is courteous 1 
once your food arrives its meh 0 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
i had the chicken pho and it tasted very bland 0 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
avoid this establishment 0 
all in all i can assure you ill be back 1 
the restaurant atmosphere was exquisite 1 
im a bit disappointed 0 
down the drain because of a weak snap 0 
there are the usual hitchcock logic flaws 0 
id love to go back 1 
about ten minutes into this film i started having second thoughts 0 
the worst piece of crap ever along with the verizon customer service 0 
good audio quality 1 
personally i think it shows that people should learn to find a compromise them self without involving other people into issue 1 
these were so good we ordered them twice 1 
worst ever 0 
talk about great customer service of course we will be back 1 
their rotating beers on tap is also a highlight of this place 1 
but then they came back cold 0 
and the rest of it just sits there being awful with soldiers singing songs about the masculinity they pledge themselves to hairsplitting about purity the admiration of swords etc 0 
great value 1 
the battery works great 1 
then our food came out disappointment ensued 0 
the secondary plot line is incomprehensible and its relation to the primary plot line is mystifying 0 
lordy the khao soi is a dish that is not to be missed for curry lovers 1 
i am very happy 1 
nothing special 0 
voice recognition is tremendous 1 
these are the central themes of the film and they are handled ineptly stereotypically and with no depth of imagination 0 
i had strawberry tea which was good 1 
ps the only scene in the movie that was cool is when the central character finds her room blown up 1 
anyway the plot flowed smoothly and the malebonding scenes were a hoot 1 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
50 down the drain 0 
great headset very impressed h500 1 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
you cant beat the price on these 1 
poor product 0 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
best service and food ever maria our server was so good and friendly she made our day 1 
the results well are a shame 0 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
obviously they have a terrible customer service so you get what you pay for 0 
exactly what i wanted 1 
however after finally watching this film i realized that not only had i had a closed mind to the brilliance it depicts i also found myself watching it over and over again 1 
the characters are interesting even if a bit predictable 1 
good service very clean and inexpensive to boot 1 
oh and i forgot to also mention the weird color effect it has on your phone 0 
clear skype calls long battery life long range 1 
never going back 0 
the biggest complaint i have is the battery drains superfast 0 
they are so cool 1 
food was really good and i got full petty fast 1 
it is cheap and it feel and look just as cheap 0 
the food was terrible 0 
i would highly recommend this product 1 
this blueant supertooth handsfree phone speaker is awesome 1 
four stars for the food the guy in the blue shirt for his great vibe still letting us in to eat 1 
the place was fairly clean but the food simply wasnt worth it 0 
it was a bit too sweet not really spicy enough and lacked flavor 0 
soggy and not good 0 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
very poor service 0 
the battery is unreliable as well as the service use antena 0 
the restaurant atmosphere was exquisite 1 
i guess maybe we went on an off night but it was disgraceful 0 
really good product 1 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
if you stay in vegas you must get breakfast here at least once 1 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
everything was perfect the night we were in 1 
think it over when you plan to own this onethis sure is the last moto phone for me 0 
this place is good 1 
wont work right or atleast for me 0 
very true to shakespear and a must for all shakespear fans 1 
these were so good we ordered them twice 1 
not recommended 0 
i have bought this nokia cell phone a few weeks ago and it was a nightmare 0 
the best electronics of the available fm transmitters 1 
i didnt realize how wonderful the short really is until the last two scenes 1 
i came over from verizon because cingulair has nicer cell phones the first thing i noticed was the really bad service 0 
fans of the genre will be in heaven 1 
the roast beef sandwich tasted really good 1 
piece of trash 0 
i just saw this film and i recommend it 1 
we loved the place 1 
i was bored throughout the whole damn thing 0 
yes i am simplifying things here for the sake of brevity for this really is at the core of the problems with this film it has too much going on without any real fulfilling explanation 0 
great phone 1 
tonight i had the elk filet specialand it sucked 0 
the food is not tasty at all not to say its real traditional hunan style 0 
we have gotten a lot of compliments on it 1 
this is an excellent film 1 
my fiancé and i came in the middle of the day and we were greeted and seated right away 1 
the explosion of the gas tanks at the end was just as awful 0 
id rather eat airline food seriously 0 
dont waste your time 0 
i bought this battery with a coupon from amazon and im very happy with my purchase 1 
service was good and the company was better 1 
battery lasts only a few hours 0 
almost all of the songs in cover girl are oldfashioned and not very tuneful 0 
they do not last forever but is not overly expensive to replaceeasy to operate and the sound is much better than others i have tried 1 
works for me 1 
thus far have only visited twice and the food was absolutely delicious each time 1 
the film gives meaning to the phrase never in the history of human conflict has so much been owed by so many to so few 1 
after i pulled up my car i waited for another 15 minutes before being acknowledged 0 
poor construction 0 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
im still infatuated with this phone 1 
its fits like a glove and is strong secure and durable 1 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
makes it easier to keep up with my bluetooth when im not wearing it 0 
i am not a filmmaker nor am i a director but i would hide my head in the sand if id spent whatever amount of money and time on this movie 0 
much less than the jawbone i was going to replace it with 1 
i have always used corded headsets and the freedom from the wireless is very helpful 1 
tonight i had the elk filet specialand it sucked 0 
greatno problems at all 1 
phone now holds charge like it did when it was new 1 
i received it quickly and it works great 1 
the chicken i got was definitely reheated and was only ok the wedges were cold and soggy 0 
there was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters 0 
i especially liked the noncliche choices with the parents in other movies i could predict the dialog verbatim but the writing in this movie made better selections 1 
the food amazing 1 
the characters are interesting and you want to find out more about them the longer the movie goes on and i think people will be surprised by who does and doesnt make it 1 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
the steak was amazingrge fillet relleno was the best seafood plate i have ever had 1 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
highly recommended a 1 
the hockey scenes are terrible defensemen playing like theyre 5 years old goalies diving at shots that are 10 feet wide of the net etc 0 
i love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it 1 
thus far have only visited twice and the food was absolutely delicious each time 1 
very good quality though 1 
classywarm atmosphere fun and fresh appetizers succulent steaks baseball steak 1 
i will not be eating there again 0 
this greedy corporation will never see another dime from me 0 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
so absolutley fantastic 1 
made very sturdy 1 
food was good service was good prices were good 1 
this wonderful experience made this place a muststop whenever we are in town again 1 
i can assure you that you wont be disappointed 1 
the potatoes were like rubber and you could tell they had been made up ahead of time being kept under a warmer 0 
really really good rice all the time 1 
not too screamy not to masculine but just right 1 
his costars dont fare much better with people like morgan freeman jonah hill and ed helms just wasted 0 
couldnt figure it out 0 
its not hard to make a decent hamburger 0 
the ambiance was incredible 1 
great phone 1 
i dont think i will be back for a very long time 0 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
none of the three sizes they sent with the headset would stay in my ears 0 
do not waste your money here 0 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
this is a great place to eat 1 
a very charming film with wonderful sentiment and heart 1 
we enjoy their pizza and brunch 1 
any ring toneoverall good phone to buy 1 
there are many continuity errors one other user commented on different cars in the garage joes glassesthe one that got to me the most was the fact joes facial hair configuration seemed to change from scene to scene 0 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
i recently tried caballeros and i have been back every week since 1 
i would recommend this 1 
nonlinear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well 1 
to my disbelief each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods i have ever tasted 0 
car charger as well as ac charger are included to make sure you never run out of juicehighy recommended 1 
i love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it 1 
the budget was evidently very limited 0 
the refried beans that came with my meal were dried out and crusty and the food was bland 0 
dont waste your money 0 
i would have casted her in that role after ready the script 1 
which are small and not worth the price 0 
wont ever go here again 0 
waitress was a little slow in service 0 
the battery is unreliable as well as the service use antena 0 
the atmosphere was great with a lovely duo of violinists playing songs we requested 1 
im terribly disappointed that this film would receive so many awards and accolades especially when there are far more deserving works of film out there 0 
you wont be disappointed 1 
but even the talented carrell cant save this 0 
that said our mouths and bellies were still quite pleased 1 
im not impressed with the concept or the food 0 
all in all a great disappointment 0 
i have eaten here multiple times and each time the food was delicious 1 
avoid this film at all costs 0 
i loved their mussels cooked in this wine reduction the duck was tender and their potato dishes were delicious 1 
my rating just 3 out of 10 0 
this phone tries very hard to do everything but fails at its very ability to be a phone 0 
it is a very well acted and done tv movie 1 
the chicken wings contained the driest chicken meat i have ever eaten 0 
spoilers whatever else can or cant be said about it surface is superbly crafted 1 
barney is definitely super de duper 1 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
try them in the airport to experience some tasty food and speedy friendly service 1 
as for the killer dont expect anything original or even remotely frightening 0 
the staff is friendly and the joint is always clean 1 
much more interesting more action more suspense and less of the unneeded controversy 1 
you need at least 3 mins to get to your phone book from the time you first turn on the phonebattery life is short 0 
i just dont know how this place managed to served the blandest food i have ever eaten when they are preparing indian cuisine 0 
the plantains were the worst ive ever tasted 0 
it is easy to turn on and off when you are in the car and the volume controls are quite accessable 1 
bland not a liking this place for a number of reasons and i dont want to waste time on bad reviewing ill leave it at that 0 
this pair of headphones is the worst that i have ever had soundwise 0 
phone is sturdy as all nokia bar phones are 1 
the story is also both funny and poignant at times 1 
highly unprofessional and rude to a loyal patron 0 
lasted one day and then blew up 0 
while i managed to bend the leaf spring back in place the metal now has enough stress that it will break on the next drop 0 
i am a fan of his this movie sucked really bad 0 
crostini that came with the salad was stale 0 
very comfortable 1 
great price also 1 
pretty cool i would say 1 
the food was very good 1 
this place receives stars for their appetizers 1 
i love this phone 1 
crust is not good 0 
poor talk time performance 0 
if it were possible to give them zero stars theyd have it 0 
loved the casting of jimmy buffet as the science teacher 1 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
if youre not familiar check it out 1 
again no plot at all 0 
if you want healthy authentic or ethic food try this place 1 
im not sure what he was trying to do with this film 0 
i have recommended it to friends 1 
waitress was good though 1 
the best phone in market 1 
im not sure what he was trying to do with this film 0 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
im a bit disappointed 0 
some highlights great quality nigiri here 1 
the headset fulfills my requirements so i am happy with my purchase 1 
if you want a real scare rent this one 1 
its a piece of crap 0 
the owners really really need to quit being soooooo cheap let them wrap my freaking sandwich in two papers not one 0 
though the wind and the lion is told largely through the eyes of the son every member of the family can identify with one of the characters whether it be sean connerys noble brigand candace bergens feisty heroine john hustons wily john hay or steve kanalys spiffy radiant ruthless cando lieutenant roosevelts big stick 1 
you need at least 3 mins to get to your phone book from the time you first turn on the phonebattery life is short 0 
this phone is slim and light and the display is beautiful 1 
what a waste 0 
they could serve it with just the vinaigrette and it may make for a better overall dish but it was still very good 1 
the cast of veteran actors are more than just a nostalgia trip 1 
a bit predictable 0 
at any rate this film stinks its not funny and fulci should have stayed with giallo and supernatural zombie movies 0 
waste of money 0 
do not make the same mistake as me 0 
even the squibs look awful 0 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
as for the service im a fan because its quick and youre being served by some nice folks 1 
overall i wasnt very impressed with noca 0 
this review is long overdue since i consider a tale of two sisters to be the single greatest film ever made 1 
sam shepards portrayal of a gung ho marine was sobering 1 
is it possible for a movie to get any worse than this 0 
we have gotten a lot of compliments on it 1 
interesting decor 1 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
which has more depth and character than the man underneath it 0 
this pda rocks 1 
i recommend this for everyone who loves film movies anythinga work of art 1 
this is a great phone 1 
1010 1 
case was more or less an extra that i originally put on but later discarded because it scratched my ear 0 
i ordered the voodoo pasta and it was the first time id had really excellent pasta since going gluten free several years ago 1 
the decor is nice and the piano music soundtrack is pleasant 1 
this place receives stars for their appetizers 1 
meredith m was better than all right 1 
food was great and so was the serivce 1 
bland and flavorless is a good way of describing the barely tepid meat 0 
i loved it 1 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
this is was due to the fact that it took 20 minutes to be acknowledged then another 35 minutes to get our foodand they kept forgetting things 0 
i know this is not like the other restaurants at all something is very off here 0 
crust is not good 0 
kind of flops around 0 
the characters are interesting and you want to find out more about them the longer the movie goes on and i think people will be surprised by who does and doesnt make it 1 
i must say i have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again 1 
good case 1 
the shipping time was also very quick 1 
i knew when i saw the film that more great things were to come from this gifted actor 1 
when i received my pita it was huge it did have a lot of meat in it so thumbs up there 1 
i love this phone 1 
what a waste 0 
they could serve it with just the vinaigrette and it may make for a better overall dish but it was still very good 1 
the fries were not hot and neither was my burger 0 
gets the job done 1 
i love the camera its really pretty good quality 1 
worthwhile 1 
so bad 0 
its an empty hollow shell of a movie 0 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
i highly recommend this device to everyone 1 
dont buy it 0 
we wont be going back anytime soon 0 
ordered an appetizer and took 40 minutes and then the pizza another 10 minutes 0 
i saw this short film on hbo the other day and absolutely loved it 1 
uncomfortable in the ear dont use with lg vx9900 env 0 
magical help 1 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
i gave it 5 stars then and im giving it 5 stars now 1 
fantastic buy and will get again for whatever my next phone is 1 
this movie is greatespecially if you enjoy visual arts 1 
incredible 1 
we watched our waiter pay a lot more attention to other tables and ignore us 0 
owners are really great people 1 
great hands free device 1 
doesnt last long 0 
the movie seemed a little slow at first 0 
i would recommend it 1 
yet i enjoy watching it 1 
classywarm atmosphere fun and fresh appetizers succulent steaks baseball steak 1 
everything from acting to cinematography was solid 1 
the headset fulfills my requirements so i am happy with my purchase 1 
adapter does not provide enough charging current 0 
and considering the two of us left there very full and happy for about 20 you just cant go wrong 1 
works great 1 
friends pasta also bad he barely touched it 0 
its a feelgood film and thats how i felt when i came out of the cinema 1 
cinematography noteworthy including fine views of barcelona and its famed gaudi towers 1 
at around 4 pm i bought it at around 8pm i started to watch at around 815pm i fast forwarded the remaining film to see if there was anything left watchable for a human being with a brain but there wasnt 0 
im super pissd 0 
first the bathrooms at this location were dirty seat covers were not replenished just plain yucky 0 
clear skype calls long battery life long range 1 
dont make the same mistake that i did and please dont buy this phone 0 
i just dont know how this place managed to served the blandest food i have ever eaten when they are preparing indian cuisine 0 
this is so embarassing and also my ears hurt if i try to push the ear plug into my ear 0 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
went in for happy hour great list of wines 1 
i wish i could return the unit and get back my money 0 
their research and development division obviously knows what theyre doing 1 
its like a really sexy party in your mouth where youre outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party 1 
phenomenal food service and ambiance 1 
if you look for authentic thai food go else where 0 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
it was horrendous 0 
these products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet 0 
they work about 2 weeks then break 0 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
for those that havent seen it dont waste your time 0 
i have always used corded headsets and the freedom from the wireless is very helpful 1 
the manager was the worst 0 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
it looses connection to the phone even when it is within a couple feet between the two 0 
crust is not good 0 
worthwhile 1 
we got sitting fairly fast but ended up waiting 40 minutes just to place our order another 30 minutes before the food arrived 0 
this pair of headphones is the worst that i have ever had soundwise 0 
at around 4 pm i bought it at around 8pm i started to watch at around 815pm i fast forwarded the remaining film to see if there was anything left watchable for a human being with a brain but there wasnt 0 
after trying many many handsfree gadgets this is the one that finally works well 1 
at a time when it seems that film animation has been dominated by disneypixars cgi masterpieces it is both refreshing and comforting to know that miyazaki is still relying on traditional handdrawn animation to tell his charming and enchanting stories 1 
generally it just lacked imagination 0 
service is quick and even to go orders are just like we like it 1 
will be back again 1 
i am glad i purchased it 1 
a piece of cinematic garbage captured on celluloid 0 
warning do not buy 0 
on the good side the staff was genuinely pleasant and enthusiastic a real treat 1 
freezes frequently4 0 
and it was way to expensive 0 
a lot of websites have been rating this a very good phone and so do i 1 
does not fit 0 
i ordered albondigas soup which was just warm and tasted like tomato soup with frozen meatballs 0 
rude inconsiderate management 0 
also the fries are without a doubt the worst fries ive ever had 0 
it was a drive to get there 0 
none of the new ones have ever quite worked properly 0 
waaaaaayyyyyyyyyy over rated is all i am saying 0 
kieslowski never ceases to amaze me 1 
there was hardly any meat 0 
they work about 2 weeks then break 0 
rating 010 grade z note the show is so bad that even mother of the cast pull her daughter out of the show 0 
as for the service im a fan because its quick and youre being served by some nice folks 1 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
magical help 1 
worst customer service ever 0 
it only recognizes the phone as its storage device 0 
we loved the biscuits 1 
characters are onedimensional even the good guys and especially the bad guys 0 
product is useless since it does not have enough charging current to charge the 2 cellphones i was planning to use it with 0 
not tasty and the texture was just nasty 0 
this really is how vegas fine dining used to be right down to the menus handed to the ladies that have no prices listed 1 
the story itself is just predictable and lazy 0 
everything captain howdy says is either laughable or just plain stupid 0 
im super pissd 0 
110 and only because there is no setting for 010 0 
the food was outstanding and the prices were very reasonable 1 
the company shipped my product very promptly and it works well 1 
these headphones were a great find and i think they are perhaps the best purchase ive made in the last several years seriously 1 
tried to go here for lunch and it was a madhouse 0 
the chicken dishes are ok the beef is like shoe leather 0 
its a total package 1 
after trying many many handsfree gadgets this is the one that finally works well 1 
over rated 0 
because both ears are occupied background is not distracting at all 1 
dont buy this product 0 
over rated 0 
we recently witnessed her poor quality of management towards other guests as well 0 
alexander nevsky is a great film 1 
your servers suck wait correction our server heimer sucked 0 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
totally believable 1 
i own a jabra earset and was very happy with it but the sound quality especially outgoing on this is better 1 
absolutely great 1 
the death row scenes were entirely unmoving 0 
the interplay between martin and emilio contains the same wonderful chemistry we saw in wall street with martin and charlie 1 
having to humour him just to get by and get through the day was so apt 1 
i dont think i will be back for a very long time 0 
i cant wait to go back 1 
a piece of cinematic garbage captured on celluloid 0 
i will continue to come here on ladies night andddd date night highly recommend this place to anyone who is in the area 1 
their chow mein is so good 1 
one of the best mexican movies ever and one of the less understood even by mexican themselves no matter how identified the should have felt with it 1 
ryans bar is definitely one edinburgh establishment i wont be revisiting 0 
we have tried 2 units and they both failed within 2 months pros 0 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
i liked this movie way too much 1 
i got the aluminum case for my new palm vx and it worked really wellit has protected my handheld perfectly so far 1 
highly recommended for all ages although the younger set will probably not appreciate some of the more subtle references they will certainly appreciate one galley scene in particular 1 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
the potato chip order was sad i could probably count how many chips were in that box and it was probably around 12 0 
the use of slowmotion needlessly repeats itself throughout the movie but is well backed up by bad acting and bad is a kind word here no continuity scenes that are thrown in for no reason whatsoever vehicles that looked like they were made from a corn flakes box and a directorial style that bordered on stupidity 0 
he is an amazing film artist one of the most important whoever lived 1 
highquality chicken on the chicken caesar salad 1 
its kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly its embarrassing how childlike the company is 0 
10 out of 10 for both the movie and trilogy 1 
the soundtrack wasnt terrible either 1 
i wasnt expecting oscar material but this 0 
the lead man is charismafree 0 
you wont regret it 1 
his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic 1 
obviously they have a terrible customer service so you get what you pay for 0 
really really good rice all the time 1 
im still infatuated with this phone 1 
bad script bad direction and horrible acting make this one plain bad 0 
the most annoying thing about cover girl is the way in which rita hayworth is put up on a pedestal 0 
none of the three sizes they sent with the headset would stay in my ears 0 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
it was also the right balance of war and love 1 
i am so pleased to know such a modern day genius is out there letting is passion for art drive him and taking us as an audience with him 1 
crisp and clear 1 
just does not work 0 
the story itself is just predictable and lazy 0 
this film highlights the fundamental flaws of the legal process that its not about discovering guilt or innocence but rather is about who presents better in court 1 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
great food and awesome service 1 
to be honest with you this is unbelievable nonsense and very foolish 0 
i checked out this place a couple years ago and was not impressed 0 
i wasnt the least bit interested 0 
so i had to take the battery out of the phone put it all back together and then restart it 0 
battery life is real good 1 
the volume for the ringer is real good you have choices how loud 1 
they could serve it with just the vinaigrette and it may make for a better overall dish but it was still very good 1 
i love the scream movies and all horror movies and this one ranks way up there 1 
cant get the software to work with my computer 0 
service was very prompt 1 
a cheap and cheerless heist movie with poor characterisation lots of underbite style stoic emoting think chow yun fat in a better tomorrow and some cheesy clichés thrown into an abandoned factory ready for a few poorly executed flying judo rolls a la john woo 0 
their chow mein is so good 1 
i would have given no star if i was able 0 
but even the talented carrell cant save this 0 
the volume switch rocketed out of the unit to a destination unknown 0 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
if there is a wind it is completely useless 0 
this hole in the wall has great mexican street tacos and friendly staff 1 
nobody identifies with these characters because theyre all cardboard cutouts and stereotypes or predictably reversestereotypes 0 
very good quality though 1 
crostini that came with the salad was stale 0 
i went to bachi burger on a friends recommendation and was not disappointed 1 
the plantains were the worst ive ever tasted 0 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
it was forced like everything in this movie 0 
better than expected 1 
the black eyed peas and sweet potatoes unreal 1 
good item low price 1 
this product is clearly not ready for prime time i dont care how cool it looks if you cant tell a call is coming in its worthless 0 
the cashier was friendly and even brought the food out to me 1 
definitely will come back here again 1 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
director paul matthews who also wrotedirected the weak 1995 monster movie grim clearly doesnt know how to pace his films 0 
the story line is totally predictable 0 
ive never been treated so bad 0 
this is a simple little phone to use but the breakage is unacceptible 0 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
fantastic service here 1 
so anyone near you will hear part of your conversation 0 
nice leather 1 
but it wasnt anything at all just one big yawn 0 
i waited and waited 0 
this place is like chipotle but better 1 
today was my first taste of a buldogis gourmet hot dog and i have to tell you it was more than i ever thought possible 1 
and sometimes it was so embarrassing that i had to look away 0 
great food 1 
not much seafood and like 5 strings of pasta at the bottom 0 
the sets especially designed to work with the camera are amazingstylized beautiful and effective 1 
i think not again 0 
so they performed 1 
i exchanged the sony ericson z500a for this and im pretty happy with that decision 1 
happy so far 1 
i highly recommend this case 1 
the restaurant atmosphere was exquisite 1 
i felt as though her going to ireland did absolutely nothing whatsoever 0 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
it plays louder than any other speaker of this size the price is so low that most would think the quality is lacking however its not 1 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
this place is disgusting 0 
everything was fresh and delicious 1 
although i very much liked the look and sound of this place the actual experience was a bit disappointing 0 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
this is a good joint 1 
however i needed some better instructions 0 
we definately enjoyed ourselves 1 
i love it 1 
i get absolutely horrible reception in my apartment where with other phones i have not had this problem 0 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
reception is terrible and full of static 0 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
friends pasta also bad he barely touched it 0 
the basic premise is wasted since it is sidelined by the inexplicable focus on the documentary crew 0 
five star plus plus 1 
it plays louder than any other speaker of this size the price is so low that most would think the quality is lacking however its not 1 
the potatoes were like rubber and you could tell they had been made up ahead of time being kept under a warmer 0 
the plantains were the worst ive ever tasted 0 
i have to jiggle the plug to get it to line up right to get decent volume 0 
dont buy this product it fails 0 
food was average at best 0 
im pleased 1 
it fits my ear well and is comfortable on 1 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
great place to eat reminds me of the little mom and pop shops in the san francisco bay area 1 
i got to enjoy the seafood salad with a fabulous vinegrette 1 
we wont be going back 0 
disappointment i hate anything that goes in my ear 0 
i mean this in a terrible way 0 
very bad performance plays angela bennett a computer expert who is at home all the time 0 
really pleased with this product so far 1 
this is an extraordinary film 1 
car charger as well as ac charger are included to make sure you never run out of juicehighy recommended 1 
food is way overpriced and portions are fucking small 0 
food was below average 0 
hayao miyazakis latest and eighth film for studio ghibili gake no ue no ponyo ponyo on the cliff by the sea is a wonderfully fun and imaginative look at childhood 1 
this is high adventure at its best 1 
i wont spoil it but the ending in pretty amazing 1 
really bad 0 
the design is very good4 1 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
no shifting no bubbling no peeling not even a scratch nothingi couldnt be more happier with my new one for the droid 1 
and his subtle connections between the three films are awesome 1 
the service was terrible though 0 
it was equally awful 0 
so for our enjoyment we get to see them run around play games and be dangerous 1 
the voice recognition thru the handset is excellent 1 
i had the chicken pho and it tasted very bland 0 
he is one of my favourite directors and one of the most talented directors in the history of cinema 1 
they could serve it with just the vinaigrette and it may make for a better overall dish but it was still very good 1 
all in all i can assure you ill be back 1 
nice solid keyboard 1 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
often the dialogue doesnt really follow from one line to another or fit the surroundings 0 
when i received my pita it was huge it did have a lot of meat in it so thumbs up there 1 
after 20 minutes wait i got a table 0 
what a great double cheeseburger 1 
we ordered the duck rare and it was pink and tender on the inside with a nice char on the outside 1 
works great 1 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
how stupid is that 0 
everything about this product is wrongfirst 0 
i felt as though her going to ireland did absolutely nothing whatsoever 0 
a happy wonderful feel good ending 1 
lewis blacks considerable talent is wasted here too as he is at his most incendiary when he is unrestrained which the pg13 rating certainly wont allow 0 
now the pizza itself was good the peanut sauce was very tasty 1 
this is the kind of money that is wasted properly 1 
now imagine that every single one of those decisions was made wrong 0 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
trumbull on i love lucy 1 
both of them were truly unbelievably good and i am so glad we went back 1 
i have always used corded headsets and the freedom from the wireless is very helpful 1 
the update procedure is difficult and cumbersome 0 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
couldnt ask for a more satisfying meal 1 
a very good film indeed about great and unconditional love 1 
the only possible way this movie could be redeemed would be as mst3k fodder 0 
i know he was a contract player with little control over his scripts but the acting was as bad as the script 0 
utterly without merit on any level this is akin to torture 0 
when im on this side of town this will definitely be a spot ill hit up again 1 
i wish i could enter negative values admins 0 
this place lacked style 0 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
constantine gives everything the right intensity and seems to have a good understanding of the underlying psychological motivations 1 
it is practically useless and did not add any kind of boost to my reception after i bought it 0 
the soundtrack sucked 0 
i guess i liked the details of his dysfunctionhe was believable 1 
this place is not worth your time let alone vegas 0 
it is a joy to use 1 
this hole in the wall has great mexican street tacos and friendly staff 1 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
i was disgusted because i was pretty sure that was human hair 0 
the chicken dishes are ok the beef is like shoe leather 0 
i wear glasses and it fits fine with them 1 
the characters were all funny and had the peculiarity of not having a true lead character 1 
hands down my favorite italian restaurant 1 
i have purchased these for both family and friends and all enjoy their clarity and ease of use 1 
i purcashed this for the car charger and it does not work 0 
i had heard good things about this place but it exceeding every hope i could have dreamed of 1 
even when the women finally show up there is no sign of improvement the most expected things happen and by the time the film is over you might be far asleep 0 
definitely a bargain 1 
this movie is terrible 0 
not impressed 0 
this movie creates its own universe and is fascinating in every way 1 
very friendly staff 1 
but its just not funny 0 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
the plantains were the worst ive ever tasted 0 
so for our enjoyment we get to see them run around play games and be dangerous 1 
maybe if they werent cold they would have been somewhat edible 0 
nice headset priced right 1 
the classic maine lobster roll was fantastic 1 
the only consistent thread holding the series together were the amazing performances of leni parker and anita laselva as the two taelons in quiet idealogical conflict 0 
this place is good 1 
i really dont see how anyone could enjoy this movie 0 
bland not a liking this place for a number of reasons and i dont want to waste time on bad reviewing ill leave it at that 0 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
first of all there are enough racial stereotypes and racial jokes to offend everyone 0 
i am very impressed with the job that motorola did on the sturdiness of this phone 1 
this product is clearly not ready for prime time i dont care how cool it looks if you cant tell a call is coming in its worthless 0 
the folks at otto always make us feel so welcome and special 1 
i checked out this place a couple years ago and was not impressed 0 
im glad i found this product on amazon it is hard to find it wasnt high priced 1 
the cast was great 1 
love this headset 1 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
phone now holds charge like it did when it was new 1 
which are small and not worth the price 0 
good prices 1 
sooooo good 1 
i own 2 of these cases and would order another 1 
their regular toasted bread was equally satisfying with the occasional pats of butter mmmm 1 
works as described 1 
the acting from all involved and that includes those like shatner and nimoy is bad and washed out and making them seem as old as they look in real life the special effects are tacky like when spock has to rescue kirk on a jet pack when he falls down from a mountain 0 
the last 15 minutes of movie are also not bad as well 1 
after the first charge kept going dead after 12 minutes 0 
i never walked out of a movie faster 0 
im very disappointed with my decision 0 
also makes it easier to hold on to 1 
i hate writing bad reviews about films especially those in which i really like the star but this film is so bad i dont believe for one second that anyone could have been proud of it 0 
dont waste your time 0 
happy so far 1 
highly recommended for all ages although the younger set will probably not appreciate some of the more subtle references they will certainly appreciate one galley scene in particular 1 
only pros large seating area nice bar area great simple drink menu the best brick oven pizza with homemade dough 1 
i was so insulted 0 
also were served hot bread and butter and home made potato chips with bacon bits on topvery original and very good 1 
i vomited in the bathroom mid lunch 0 
garbo who showed right off the bat that her talents could carry over from the silent era i wanted to see some of her silent work but netflix doesnt seem to be stocking them 1 
i can barely ever hear on it and am constantly saying what 0 
but kevin spacey is an excellent verbal tsunami as buddy ackerman  and totally believable because he is a great actor 1 
worst hour and a half of my lifeoh my gosh 0 
i purchased this and within 2 days it was no longer working 0 
dont waste your time 0 
nothing special 0 
the servers went back and forth several times not even so much as an are you being helped 0 
this is a simple little phone to use but the breakage is unacceptible 0 
this is a simple little phone to use but the breakage is unacceptible 0 
not good enough for the price 0 
which has more depth and character than the man underneath it 0 
the veggitarian platter is out of this world 1 
i live in the neighborhood so i am disappointed i wont be back here because it is a convenient location 0 
the movie has almost no action scenes in it and very little comedy 0 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
perhaps my phone is defective but people cannot hear me when i use this 0 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
the only very disappointing thing was there was no speakerphone 0 
the pizza tasted old super chewy in not a good way 0 
useless phone simply deaf 0 
definitely will come back here again 1 
it ranks highly as a great noircrimedrama incredible performances by belmondo and lino ventura 1 
nice sound 1 
i hate movies like that 0 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
things happen characters personalities change plot twists occur for no real reason other than that script calls for it 0 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
soggy and not good 0 
so for our enjoyment we get to see them run around play games and be dangerous 1 
last night was my second time dining here and i was so happy i decided to go back 1 
not recommended 0 
i was so insulted 0 
this was my first and only vegas buffet and it did not disappoint 1 
omg the food was delicioso 1 
not loud enough and doesnt turn on like it should 0 
this phone works great 1 
a week later after i activated it it suddenly died 0 
fits comfortably came with three sizes of earbud tips 1 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
i could barely stomach the meal but didnt complain because it was a business lunch 0 
perhaps my phone is defective but people cannot hear me when i use this 0 
i am a fan of his this movie sucked really bad 0 
we had fantastic service and were pleased by the atmosphere 1 
the kids are very cool too 1 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
you wont forget this movie 1 
gets the job done 1 
worst foodservice ive had in a while 0 
ordered an appetizer and took 40 minutes and then the pizza another 10 minutes 0 
unfortunately it will not recharge my iphone 4s despite connecting it from multiple power sources imac external battery wall outlet etc 0 
the only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive 1 
this is a really fantastic thai restaurant which is definitely worth a visit 1 
if good intentions made a film great then this film might be one of the greatest films ever made 1 
poor quality 0 
great food and awesome service 1 
the film has great actors a master director a significant themeat least a wouldbe significant theme undertone of fifties existential worldweariness aerial scenes that ought to have thrilled both senses and imagination and characters about which one might deeply care 1 
i promise they wont disappoint 1 
delete this film from your mind 0 
terrible service 0 
much more interesting more action more suspense and less of the unneeded controversy 1 
def coming back to bowl next time 1 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
the sides are delish mixed mushrooms yukon gold puree white corn beateous 1 
definitely will come back here again 1 
just reading on the specs alone makes you say wow 1 
this place deserves no stars 0 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
the best place in vegas for breakfast just check out a sat or sun 1 
it has all the features i want 1 
try them in the airport to experience some tasty food and speedy friendly service 1 
happy so far 1 
ive had no trouble accessing the internet downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions 1 
perhaps i caught them on an off night judging by the other reviews but im not inspired to go back 0 
my husband said she was very rude did not even apologize for the bad food or anything 0 
youll love how thin it is 1 
when i placed my treo into the case not only was it not snug but there was a lot of extra room on the sides 0 
the food is not tasty at all not to say its real traditional hunan style 0 
they have great dinners 1 
the presentation of the food was awful 0 
hence the whole story lacks a certain energy 0 
the movie lacks visual interest drama expression of feeling and celebration of the very patriotism that underlines the narrative 0 
so just beware 0 
the plot such as it is is so derivative and predictable that the ending is like a mercy killing 0 
we will not be coming back 0 
what happened next was prettyoff putting 0 
nothing at all to recommend 0 
delete this film from your mind 0 
nevertheless yet another wonderful film from the great masters stable 1 
the voice recognition thru the handset is excellent 1 
best tacos in town by far 1 
steve martin delivers a really funny performance of a middleaged upper class uptight white guy 1 
the acting was bad 0 
the staff is always super friendly and helpful which is especially cool when you bring two small boys and a baby 1 
i really hope the team behind this movie makes more movies and that they will continue to do so in their own some kinda weird style 1 
why was this film made 0 
both rickman and stowe play their roles to the hilt in this tale of a childrens book writer who maybe has written a subversive tract 1 
id advise anyone to go and see it 1 
then scene where they debated whether or not to sack the trumpeter who falsely was accused for the murder is pure horror really stupid 0 
i used bitpim a free program you can find on the internetto transfer data to the phonethe price of the cable was excellent 1 
great place to eat reminds me of the little mom and pop shops in the san francisco bay area 1 
but the convoluted plot just didnt convince me and much of the film was watched with a weird questioning glance 0 
this is the place where i first had pho and it was amazing 1 
if only someone involved with it knew how to string together narrative 0 
the two main characters may be two of the most believable children i ever saw put on screen 1 
i asked multiple times for the wine list and after some time of being ignored i went to the hostess and got one myself 0 
the service was a bit lacking 0 
waitress was sweet and funny 1 
the headset fulfills my requirements so i am happy with my purchase 1 
what happened next was prettyoff putting 0 
my only complaint is the standard sound volume is a little low even when turned up to 5of 5 0 
if you love authentic mexican food and want a whole bunch of interesting yet delicious meats to choose from you need to try this place 1 
good item low price 1 
each day of the week they have a different deal and its all so delicious 1 
really pleased with this product so far 1 
the chips and sals a here is amazing 1 
i have read others reviews here but i havent had any problem with it 1 
my 810 score is mostly for the plot 1 
i think the most wonderful parts literally full of wonder are the excerpts from his works 1 
i think it was robert ryans best film because he portrayed someone like my father and he was a schizophrenic in real lifemy father although he never murdered anyone but was affected more so during the second world war which made him worse 1 
great pork sandwich 1 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
see it with your kids if you have a chanceit will open up some amazing dialog about how far race relations have come in the last 50 years 1 
this movie contained an allstar cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i havent seen before 1 
it didnt make me scared horrified or make me sympathetic towards the characters it was simply annoying 0 
they have horrible attitudes towards customers and talk down to each one when customers dont enjoy their food 0 
the seasonal fruit was fresh white peach puree 1 
the dialogue sucked 0 
which is precisely why i am giving it such a bad review 0 
my side greek salad with the greek dressing was so tasty and the pita and hummus was very refreshing 1 
an italian reviewer called this a small great film and thats right 1 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
both of the egg rolls were fantastic 1 
worst thai ever 0 
the shower area is outside so you can only rinse not take a full shower unless you dont mind being nude for everyone to see 0 
dont waste your on this one 0 
rude inconsiderate management 0 
again lame 0 
bland and flavorless is a good way of describing the barely tepid meat 0 
i do love sushi but i found kabuki to be overpriced overhip and underservices 0 
so absolutley fantastic 1 
lousy product 0 
the fries were not hot and neither was my burger 0 
it was pretty gross 0 
i dont have to be an accountant to know im getting screwed 0 
it dit not work most of the time with my nokia 5320 0 
it was that year however that reminded us that huston was still at the top of his game as evinced by his faithful adaptation of james joyces acclaimed novella the dead 1 
there arent death scenes like in previous movies and the fx are terrible 0 
i do love sushi but i found kabuki to be overpriced overhip and underservices 0 
nice solid keyboard 1 
i would definitely recommend the jabra bt250v for those who are looking for comfort clarity and a great price 1 
very convenient since we were staying at the mgm 1 
during several different 2 minute calls i experienced 5 drops and it was in an area that had 5 bars 0 
the earpiece on this is too large or too heavyit keeps falling out of my ear 0 
food was great and so was the serivce 1 
none of the new ones have ever quite worked properly 0 
the story line is totally predictable 0 
very disappointing 0 
hands down my favorite italian restaurant 1 
car charger as well as ac charger are included to make sure you never run out of juicehighy recommended 1 
the manager was the worst 0 
the steak and the shrimp are in my opinion the best entrees at gc 1 
when i received my pita it was huge it did have a lot of meat in it so thumbs up there 1 
the football scenes at the end were perplexing 0 
for readers who have already seen one of miyazakis films he is still in top form and made another worthwhile experience 1 
i was so insulted 0 
110 and only because there is no setting for 010 0 
waste your money on this game 1 
while you dont yet hear mickey speak there are tons of sound effects and music throughout the filmsomething we take for granted now but which was a huge crowd pleaser in 1928 1 
its uncomfortable and the sound quality is quite poor compared with the phone razr or with my previous wired headset that plugged into an lg 0 
not recommended 0 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
lasted one day and then blew up 0 
it wasnt busy either also the building was freezing cold 0 
that being said for a phone the camera is very nice many cool effects to play with and video is decent as well 1 
i highly recommend this device to everyone 1 
all i can do is whine on the internet so here it goesthe more i use the thing the less i like it 0 
i highly recommend this modest priced cellular phone 1 
i am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this 1 
lot of holes in the plot theres nothing about how he became the emperor nothing about where he spend 20 years between his childhood and mature age 0 
i own a jabra earset and was very happy with it but the sound quality especially outgoing on this is better 1 
very satisifed with that 1 
nothing special 0 
i have been in more than a few bars in vegas and do not ever recall being charged for tap water 0 
fantastic buy and will get again for whatever my next phone is 1 
easily none other cartoon made me laugh in a tender way before getting into dark sitcoms oriented for teenagers 1 
a very charming film with wonderful sentiment and heart 1 
plus it was wellpaced and suited its relatively short run time 1 
the burger is good beef cooked just right 1 
actually the graphics were good at the time 1 
the acting sucks the music sucks the script sucks the pacing sucks the special fx suck the directing sucks basically this movie sucks 0 
this is a witty and delightful adaptation of the dr seuss book brilliantly animated by upas finest and thoroughly deserving of its academy award 1 
i do not know if this was emilio estevezs directorial debut but the pacing the interplay and development of the characters as well as some clever camera work surrounding the character estevez plays all suggest a natural eye 1 
i was very excited to get this headset because i thought it was really cute 1 
i cannot believe that the actors agreed to do this film 0 
this movie is excellentangel is beautiful and scamp is adorablehis little yelps when hes scaredand the funniest parts are whenscamp is caught under the curtain and when angel and scamp are singing ive never had this feeling beforei totally recommend this movieits coming out on special edition on june 20the cover has scamp on a garbage can and angel underneath the lid 1 
i can take a little bad service but the food sucks 0 
wont work right or atleast for me 0 
we watched our waiter pay a lot more attention to other tables and ignore us 0 
the selection of food was not the best 0 
if you dont find it too bad as again the unit comes with one earpad onlyi would not recommend this to anyone 0 
its been my choice headset for yearsgreat sound good volume good noise cancellation 1 
tonight i had the elk filet specialand it sucked 0 
never been to hard rock casino before will never ever step forward in it again 0 
this is one of the best italian thrillers of the early 70s 1 
disappointing 0 
battery has no life 0 
but if you liked movies like the matrix and better yet their sequels i think youll appreciate the thought provoking mindblowing experience this film will give you 1 
i probably would not go here again 0 
the attractive set used throughout most of the film is an eyepleasing gem 1 
in the summer you can dine in a charming outdoor patio so very delightful 1 
they made this case too small and is very difficult to install 0 
just really good so far probably the best bt headset i have ever had 1 
full of unconvincing cardboard characters it is blandly written by edward chodorov who also produced and is surprisingly directed by jean negulesco from whom one would expect a great deal more 0 
plus it was wellpaced and suited its relatively short run time 1 
incredible 1 
they have a plethora of salads and sandwiches and everything ive tried gets my seal of approval 1 
hated it 0 
the waitress and manager are so friendly 1 
this movie is possibly one of the most creative works of horror ever 1 
this is an outstanding little restaurant with some of the best food i have ever tasted 1 
phone now holds charge like it did when it was new 1 
product is exactly as described 1 
everything stinks 0 
better than expected 1 
it has everything i need and i couldnt ask for more 1 
highquality chicken on the chicken caesar salad 1 
the acting from all involved and that includes those like shatner and nimoy is bad and washed out and making them seem as old as they look in real life the special effects are tacky like when spock has to rescue kirk on a jet pack when he falls down from a mountain 0 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
unreliable im giving up 0 
a film not easily forgotten 1 
linksys should have some way to exchange a bad phone for a refurb unit or something 0 
the shower area is outside so you can only rinse not take a full shower unless you dont mind being nude for everyone to see 0 
this place is good 1 
heres where the movie really pied me off 0 
well just if you keep thinking how bad it is 0 
i dont think i will be back for a very long time 0 
not good enough for the price 0 
i love this phone 1 
waitress was sweet and funny 1 
for sushi on the strip this is the place to go 1 
i would have given no star if i was able 0 
i cant believe theres even a sequel to this 0 
just does not work 0 
recommend with confidence 1 
imdb ratings only go as low 1 for awful its time to get some negative numbers in there for cases such as these 0 
the only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive 1 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
it was a waste of my money 0 
in the span of an hour i had two people exclaim whoa is that the new phone on tv 1 
favorite place in town for shawarrrrrrma 1 
i am very impressed with this headset from plantronics 1 
the dialogue is composed of things that make little sense 0 
and considering the two of us left there very full and happy for about 20 you just cant go wrong 1 
everything captain howdy says is either laughable or just plain stupid 0 
the songs were the best and the muppets were so hilarious 1 
any ring toneoverall good phone to buy 1 
couldnt use the unit with sunglasses not good in texas 0 
the biggest complaint i have is the battery drains superfast 0 
i had the mac salad and it was pretty bland so i will not be getting that again 0 
fits comfortably came with three sizes of earbud tips 1 
i have yet to run this new battery below two bars and thats three days without charging 1 
then as if i hadnt wasted enough of my life there they poured salt in the wound by drawing out the time it took to bring the check 0 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
best of luck to the rude and noncustomer service focused new management 0 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
again lame 0 
that being said for a phone the camera is very nice many cool effects to play with and video is decent as well 1 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
unless youre just out to visually collect all extant films of austens work you can skip this one 0 
what a mistake 0 
the movie is not completely perfect but titta di girolamo will stay with you for a long time after the vision of the movie 1 
perhaps my phone is defective but people cannot hear me when i use this 0 
do not buy for d807wrongly advertised for d807 0 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
avoid at all cost 0 
im translating movies for a living and this is the first movie in my 5year working experience that i found offensive to my intelligence 0 
very satisifed with that 1 
very pleased with this headset 1 
its not hard to make a decent hamburger 0 
graphics is far from the best part of the game 0 
worked very well paired with a treo 700w and as a skype headset on my pc using a usb bluetooth transceiver 1 
this frog phone charm is adorable and very eye catching 1 
great software for motorolas 1 
this is the phone to get for 2005 i just bought my s710a and all i can say is wow 1 
if there is a wind it is completely useless 0 
in particular the relationship between the bakery assistant and the waitress just didnt work for me at all 0 
the potatoes were like rubber and you could tell they had been made up ahead of time being kept under a warmer 0 
i received my supposedly new motorola 375 and apparently there was not a match between the phone and the charger 0 
really really good rice all the time 1 
food arrived quickly 1 
the fries were not hot and neither was my burger 0 
from what my dinner companions told meeverything was very fresh with nice texture and taste 1 
beautiful styling though 1 
good prices 1 
elias koteasjack palance play good roles angelina is hot and gets nakedbilly drago appears in this and is cool as usual a cameo by sven ole thorsen helps make this a very enjoyable movie with good acting and a decent budget 1 
the movie is not completely perfect but titta di girolamo will stay with you for a long time after the vision of the movie 1 
the management is rude 0 
he was very impressed when going from the original battery to the extended battery 1 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
i love their fries and their beans 1 
horrible had to switch 3 times 0 
again lame 0 
when i received my pita it was huge it did have a lot of meat in it so thumbs up there 1 
the black eyed peas and sweet potatoes unreal 1 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
both do good jobs and are quite amusing 1 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
it has all the features i want 1 
the ngage is still lacking in earbuds 0 
the sides are delish mixed mushrooms yukon gold puree white corn beateous 1 
an amazing finale to possibly the best trilogy of all time 1 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
everything about it is fine and reasonable for the price ie 1 
so just beware 0 
it really is impressive that the place hasnt closed down 0 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
i was so insulted 0 
it was horrendous 0 
the menu is always changing food quality is going down service is extremely slow 0 
personally i think it shows that people should learn to find a compromise them self without involving other people into issue 1 
del taco is pretty nasty and should be avoided if possible 0 
better than new 1 
also its a real treat to see anthony quinn playing crazy horse 1 
not as good as i had hoped 0 
it did not work in my cell phone plug i am very up set with the charger 0 
the football scenes at the end were perplexing 0 
generally it just lacked imagination 0 
muddy low quality sound and the casing around the wires insert was poorly super glued and slid off 0 
this one works and was priced right 1 
the screen size is big key pad lit well enough and the camera quality is excellent for a camera phone 1 
i got home to see the driest damn wings ever 0 
i have had mine for about a year and this christmas i bought some for the rest of the family 1 
the waitresses are very friendly 1 
similarly the delivery man did not say a word of apology when our food was 45 minutes late 0 
i asked multiple times for the wine list and after some time of being ignored i went to the hostess and got one myself 0 
this place should honestly be blown up 0 
the volume switch rocketed out of the unit to a destination unknown 0 
either way it sucks 0 
it probably would have been better if the director hadnt spent most of the movie showcasing his own art work which really isnt that noteworthy 0 
the service was extremely slow 0 
stay away from the q 0 
classywarm atmosphere fun and fresh appetizers succulent steaks baseball steak 1 
first time going but i think i will quickly become a regular 1 
its a fresh subtle and rather sublime effect 1 
as for the service i thought it was good 1 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
the plot is nonsense that doesnt interest in the slightest way or have any uniqueness to it 0 
the results well are a shame 0 
probably not in a hurry to go back 0 
i hate to disagree with my fellow yelpers but my husband and i were so disappointed with this place 0 
i am also very happy with the price 1 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
not recommended 0 
the speaker is of low quality so as making the ring tones sound very cheap 0 
i got home to see the driest damn wings ever 0 
best tacos in town by far 1 
ordered an appetizer and took 40 minutes and then the pizza another 10 minutes 0
