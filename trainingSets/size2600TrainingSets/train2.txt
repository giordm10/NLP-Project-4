the chefs were friendly and did a good job 1 
i purchased this and within 2 days it was no longer working 0 
i hate to disagree with my fellow yelpers but my husband and i were so disappointed with this place 0 
the food wasnt good 0 
bland and flavorless is a good way of describing the barely tepid meat 0 
penne vodka excellent 1 
not a pleasant voyage of selfdiscovery 0 
this movie is terrible 0 
everything about it is just bad 0 
tried to go here for lunch and it was a madhouse 0 
too politically correct 0 
my wife had the lobster bisque soup which was lukewarm 0 
the update procedure is difficult and cumbersome 0 
best fish ive ever had in my life 1 
their steaks are 100 recommended 1 
favorite place in town for shawarrrrrrma 1 
this short film certainly pulls no punches 0 
the menu had so much good stuff on it i could not decide 1 
small sleek impressive looking practical setup with ample storage in place 1 
went for lunch service was slow 0 
the manager was the worst 0 
similarly the delivery man did not say a word of apology when our food was 45 minutes late 0 
the service was great even the manager came and helped with our table 1 
does not fit 0 
i found the product to be easy to set up and use 1 
nonlinear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well 1 
all in all ha long bay was a bit of a flop 0 
food was really good and i got full petty fast 1 
this is simply the best bluetooth headset for sound quality 1 
top line dont waste your time and money on this one its as bad as it comes 0 
it was not good 0 
the pizza selections are good 1 
it was awesome 1 
the menu had so much good stuff on it i could not decide 1 
when im on this side of town this will definitely be a spot ill hit up again 1 
this second appearance of mickey mouse following the silent plane crazy earlier that year is probably his most famous filmmostly because it was so groundbreaking 1 
very good product well made 1 
this convention never worked well in the past and certainly doesnt work here 0 
the keyboard is a nice compromise between a full qwerty and the basic cell phone number keypad 1 
helen baxendale is a very credible lady macbeth who can be very cheerfull at times and sometimes she just looks like a naughty girl but deadly in her taste for blood and evil 1 
theres really nothing bad i can say about this headset 0 
the foreigner is not worth one second of your time 0 
bluetooth range is good a few days ago i left my phone in the trunk got a call and carried the conversation without a hitch 1 
i went on motorolas website and followed all directions but could not get it to pair again 0 
i sat riveted to the tv screen 1 
i work in the hospitality industry in paradise valley and have refrained from recommending cibo any longer 0 
the film succeeds despite or perhaps because of an obviously meagre budget 1 
i recommend igo to anyone with different brand cell phonesmp3 players in the family 1 
really bad 0 
a drive thru means you do not want to wait around for half an hour for your food but somehow when we end up going here they make us wait and wait 0 
treo and tmobile refused to replace it again and forced me to buy another phone without any kind of upgrade discount 0 
after charging overnight these batteries work great 1 
if good intentions made a film great then this film might be one of the greatest films ever made 1 
very good quality though 1 
steer clear of this product and go with the genuine palm replacementr pens which come in a threepack 0 
not good when wearing a hat or sunglasses 0 
weird vibe from owners 0 
i think the most wonderful parts literally full of wonder are the excerpts from his works 1 
do not waste your time 0 
i loved it it was really scary 1 
the cashier had no care what so ever on what i had to say it still ended up being wayyy overpriced 0 
its like a bad two hour tv movie 0 
the screen does get smudged easily because it touches your ear and face 0 
this is so embarassing and also my ears hurt if i try to push the ear plug into my ear 0 
nevertheless yet another wonderful film from the great masters stable 1 
fantastic food 1 
it was way over fried 0 
the story is lame not interesting and never really explains the sinister origins of the puppets 0 
bad fit way too big 0 
about ten minutes into this film i started having second thoughts 0 
it is the best charger i have seen on the market yet 1 
john garfield ann revere lilli plmer william conrad canada leeand filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screenjames wong howe 1 
so far it has worked like a charm 1 
the script is bad very bad  it contains both cheesiness and unethical joke that you normally see in rated r or nc17 movie 0 
the awful dialogue and hopeless overacting by everyone who gets shot top off a real waste of space and time 0 
when a song could explain the emotions of the subjects better such as when jay adams unfortunate life was a subject of talk the song old man by neil young was played which evokes many emotions 1 
i liked it 1 
see it with your kids if you have a chanceit will open up some amazing dialog about how far race relations have come in the last 50 years 1 
the new characters werent all that memorable and i found myself forgetting who was who 0 
what a disappointment 0 
the acting helps the writing along very well maybe the idiotsavant sister could have been played better and it is a real joy to watch 1 
best tacos in town by far 1 
this is a bad film with bad writing and good actorsan ugly cartoon crafted by paul haggis for people who cant handle anything but the bold strokes in storytellinga picture painted with crayons 0 
nargile i think you are great 1 
rating 010 grade z note the show is so bad that even mother of the cast pull her daughter out of the show 0 
a world better than 95 of the garbage in the theatres today 1 
ive missed numerous calls because of this reason 0 
i had a seriously solid breakfast here 1 
delicious nyc bagels good selections of cream cheese real lox with capers even 1 
the burrittos blah 0 
all in all i can assure you ill be back 1 
voice quality signal strength dropped calls 0 
unfortunately any virtue in this films production work was lost on a regrettable script 0 
lets start with all the problemsthe acting especially from the lead professor was very very bad 0 
battery is terrible 0 
product was excellent and works better than the verizon one and boy was it cheaper 1 
excellent 1 
the last 15 minutes of movie are also not bad as well 1 
ordered an appetizer and took 40 minutes and then the pizza another 10 minutes 0 
not good when wearing a hat or sunglasses 0 
if there is a wind it is completely useless 0 
do not waste your money here 0 
i was shocked because no signs indicate cash only 0 
what makes this story different are the terrific production values faultless photography composition and editing the terrific casting the underappreciated brian keith playing a bully teddy and vivid history 1 
the only thing that i think could improve is the sound leaks out from the headset 0 
product is exactly as described 1 
dont buy this product it fails 0 
the movie is full of wonderful dancing hence the title 1 
but it wasnt anything at all just one big yawn 0 
i especially love the long battery life 1 
he was extremely rude and really there are so many other restaurants i would love to dine at during a weekend in vegas 0 
the live music on fridays totally blows 0 
he came running after us when he realized my husband had left his sunglasses on the table 1 
easily none other cartoon made me laugh in a tender way before getting into dark sitcoms oriented for teenagers 1 
so i had to take the battery out of the phone put it all back together and then restart it 0 
works great 1 
i love the look and feel of samsung flipphones 1 
not much seafood and like 5 strings of pasta at the bottom 0 
very disappointing 0 
it is simple to use and i like it 1 
unfortunately we must have hit the bakery on leftover day because everything we ordered was stale 0 
nice design and quality 1 
the service was a little slow considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace 0 
it is light easy to use and has very clear reception and transmission 1 
bt50 battery junk 0 
the only very disappointing thing was there was no speakerphone 0 
the puppets look really cheesy not in a good way like in the puppet master 80s flicks 0 
there arent death scenes like in previous movies and the fx are terrible 0 
the soundtrack sucked 0 
great value 1 
they made this case too small and is very difficult to install 0 
bought mainly for the charger which broke soon after purchasing 0 
i have never had such bland food which surprised me considering the article we read focused so much on their spices and flavor 0 
the story itself is just predictable and lazy 0 
the only good thing was that it fits comfortably on small ears 1 
we walked away stuffed and happy about our first vegas buffet experience 1 
the battery runs down quickly 0 
i will be back many times soon 1 
verizon tech support walked my through a few procedures none of which worked and i ended up having to do a hard reset wiping out all my data 0 
the nano stated itmy son was dissapointed 0 
a fantastic neighborhood gem 1 
doesnt last long 0 
fits comfortably came with three sizes of earbud tips 1 
disappointed 0 
their steaks are 100 recommended 1 
aside from its terrible lead this film has loads of other debits 0 
in particular the relationship between the bakery assistant and the waitress just didnt work for me at all 0 
its the best headset i have used 1 
needless to say we will never be back here again 0 
other than that the leather is nice and soft the fit is very tight the cut out for the face is a good shape 1 
very very sad 0 
i thoroughly enjoyed it when christopher eccleston took control of the tardis and the continuation of the series 1 
please dont waste your money 0 
obviously they have a terrible customer service so you get what you pay for 0 
there still are good actors around 1 
john wayne did an incredible job for being so young in the movie industry 1 
i wouldnt return 0 
its pretty surprising that this wonderful film was made in 1949 as hollywood generally had its collective heads in the sand concerning black and white issues at that time 1 
this device is great in several situations1 1 
the plantains were the worst ive ever tasted 0 
sprint charges for this service 0 
as always the evening was wonderful and the food delicious 1 
this is a good joint 1 
service stinks here 0 
her lines seem to have been written by a fifteen year old though they are trying oh so so hard to sound like how a fifteen year old would really um you know well talk 0 
its this pandering to the audience that sabotages most of his films 0 
the sets especially designed to work with the camera are amazingstylized beautiful and effective 1 
great phone 1 
a great film by a great director 1 
meredith m was better than all right 1 
the han nan chicken was also very tasty 1 
everything was perfect the night we were in 1 
the entire audience applauded at the conclusion of the film 1 
were jerks on the phone 0 
everything stinks 0 
the chains which im no fan of beat this place easily 0 
waitress was a little slow in service 0 
what on earth is irons doing in this film 0 
i love this place 1 
it was clear that she had the range and ability to pull off this part 1 
the movie is full of wonderful dancing hence the title 1 
the foreigner is not worth one second of your time 0 
the worst phone ive ever had only had it for a few months 0 
one nice thing was that they added gratuity on the bill since our party was larger than 6 or 8 and they didnt expect more tip than that 1 
will never ever go back 0 
this is a great phone 1 
the decor is nice and the piano music soundtrack is pleasant 1 
conclusion very filling meals 1 
but the convoluted plot just didnt convince me and much of the film was watched with a weird questioning glance 0 
whatever the producer was going for he missed entirely 0 
i have been to very few places to eat that under no circumstances would i ever return to and this tops the list 0 
its aggravating 0 
the potatoes were like rubber and you could tell they had been made up ahead of time being kept under a warmer 0 
it has a very good plot it holds your complete attention the acting is superb tom wilkinson was fantastic and emily watson was also very good 1 
excellent sound battery life and inconspicuous to boot 1 
the plug did not work very well 0 
the ear buds only play music in one ear 0 
the story which was told so eloquently by francis ford coppola 25 years earlier really unfolds gradually and leaves room for the characters to develop 1 
the acting is like watching wooden puppets moving around and reading from a book thats how bad it is 0 
waiter was a jerk 0 
but i definitely would not eat here again 0 
after trying many many handsfree gadgets this is the one that finally works well 1 
what a mistake 0 
there is a totally unnecessary trainroller coaster scene 0 
it probably would have been better if the director hadnt spent most of the movie showcasing his own art work which really isnt that noteworthy 0 
first time going but i think i will quickly become a regular 1 
if you are razr owneryou must have this 1 
the screen does get smudged easily because it touches your ear and face 0 
the nano stated itmy son was dissapointed 0 
i wasnt really impressed with strip steak 0 
black water is a thriller that manages to completely transcend its limitations its an indie flick by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience 1 
updatewent back for a second time and it was still just as amazing 1 
the potato chip order was sad i could probably count how many chips were in that box and it was probably around 12 0 
the acting was decidely wooden though no worse than a period universal b movie 0 
again lame 0 
and the beans and rice were mediocre at best 0 
they were goldencrispy and delicious 1 
all of the main players are mesmerising 1 
the movie is littered with overt racial slurs towards the black cast members and in return the whites are depicted as morons and boobs 0 
great brunch spot 1 
i really like this product over the motorola because it is allot clearer on the ear piece and the mic 1 
judith light is one of my favorite actresses and i think she does a superb job in this film 1 
its like a really sexy party in your mouth where youre outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party 1 
this product had a strong rubberpetroleum smell that was unbearable after a while and caused me to return it 0 
its one of the movies i need to see whenever it comes on tvnever mind the fact that i already have it memorized 1 
best tacos in town by far 1 
i find this inexcusable and so will probably be returning this phone and perhaps changing carriers 0 
these are fabulous 1 
my first visit to hiro was a delight 1 
best headset ever 1 
the vanilla ice cream was creamy and smooth while the profiterole choux pastry was fresh enough 1 
fantastic earphones 1 
his costars dont fare much better with people like morgan freeman jonah hill and ed helms just wasted 0 
honeslty it didnt taste that fresh 0 
i literally vomited while watching this film 0 
i kept looking at the time and it had soon become 35 minutes yet still no food 0 
never again will i be dining at this place 0 
the staff is always super friendly and helpful which is especially cool when you bring two small boys and a baby 1 
no ear loop needed its tiny and the sound is great 1 
the management is rude 0 
then the film just dropped the ball 0 
the movie is not completely perfect but titta di girolamo will stay with you for a long time after the vision of the movie 1 
food was average at best 0 
this place lacked style 0 
highly recommend for any one who has a blue tooth phone 1 
the scenery that the two daughters paint and photograph are beautiful 1 
the film gives meaning to the phrase never in the history of human conflict has so much been owed by so many to so few 1 
the writers were smack on and i think the best actors and actresses were a bonus to the showthese characters were so real 1 
great it was new packaged nice works good no problems and it came in less time then i expected 1 
it was a waste of my money 0 
loved itfriendly servers great food wonderful and imaginative menu 1 
when i saw it in the theater i thought i was going to be sick 0 
made very sturdy 1 
the classic maine lobster roll was fantastic 1 
this film has no redeeming features 0 
there is simply no excuse for something this poorly done 0 
there were several moments in the movie that just didnt need to be there and were excruciatingly slow moving 0 
theres also enough hypocrisy in this film to make me vomit 0 
however my girl was complain that some time the phone doesnt wake up like normal phone does 0 
the film succeeds despite or perhaps because of an obviously meagre budget 1 
dont waste your money 0 
he was extremely rude and really there are so many other restaurants i would love to dine at during a weekend in vegas 0 
and the rest of it just sits there being awful with soldiers singing songs about the masculinity they pledge themselves to hairsplitting about purity the admiration of swords etc 0 
i have to jiggle the plug to get it to line up right to get decent volume 0 
the best place in vegas for breakfast just check out a sat or sun 1 
while i managed to bend the leaf spring back in place the metal now has enough stress that it will break on the next drop 0 
i couldnt think of a better way to end the film but a smile on my face great way to wrap up an amazing film and trilogy 1 
the goat taco didnt skimp on the meat and wow what flavor 1 
the camera although rated at an impressive 13 megapixels renders images that fall well below expectations of such a relatively high resolution 0 
this is definitely one of the better documentaries i have seen looking at family relationships and marriage 1 
even worse than ticker 0 
save your money ive had this item for 11 months now 0 
on the ground right next to our table was a large smeared beensteppedinandtrackedeverywhere pile of green bird poop 0 
it was a riot to see hugo weaving play a sexobsessed gay real estate salesman who uses his clients houses for his trysts with the flaming darren tom hollander 1 
lately they have been extremely nice and helpful on the phone 1 
we wont be returning 0 
it is shameful 0 
there is a brilliant twist ending 1 
service is perfect and the family atmosphere is nice to see 1 
the bus boy on the other hand was so rude 0 
bad fit way too big 0 
his performance as awarded was stunning 1 
linksys should have some way to exchange a bad phone for a refurb unit or something 0 
the ambiance was incredible 1 
who in their right mind is gonna buy this battery 0 
highly unrecommended 0 
if there is a wind it is completely useless 0 
they work about 2 weeks then break 0 
five star plus plus 1 
kind of hard to mess up a steak but they did 0 
i am pairing this with my iphone and i could not be happier with it so far 1 
at first glance it is a lovely bakery cafe nice ambiance clean friendly staff 1 
our server was super nice and checked on us many times 1 
not to mention the combination of pears almonds and bacon is a big winner 1 
do not waste your time 0 
the script is horrendously stupid 0 
the concert sequences just sucked 0 
the mic there is a joke and the volume is quite low 0 
despite how hard i rate businesses its actually rare for me to give a 1 star 0 
it has all the features i want 1 
i had the mac salad and it was pretty bland so i will not be getting that again 0 
the script is was there a script 0 
talk about great customer service of course we will be back 1 
but when someone strives for greatness and poetry but delivers a muddled and often ridiculous story a bunch of disparate scenes pretentious dialogue then you get the worst kind of a movie that some other reviewer very accurately defined as pretentious crap 0 
im really disappointed all i have now is a charger that doesnt work 0 
i am so pleased to know such a modern day genius is out there letting is passion for art drive him and taking us as an audience with him 1 
rip off over charge shipping 0 
it was either too cold not enough flavor or just bad 0 
with the originality and freshness of the first movie now spent this remake had little else to offer 0 
but storm trooper is not even bad enough to make it to the list of wonderfully terrible movies 0 
that movie was bad 0 
wow loved this place 1 
he is an amazing film artist one of the most important whoever lived 1 
after arguing with verizon regarding the dropped calls we returned the phones after two days 0 
i felt insulted and disrespected how could you talk and judge another human being like that 0 
i got it because it was so small and adorable 1 
those phones are working just fine now 1 
by the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant i was bored and didnt care what happened next and so i switched off 0 
i know this is not like the other restaurants at all something is very off here 0 
pretty awesome place 1 
if you hate earbugs avoid this phone by all means 0 
good price 1 
good works fine 1 
a very good film indeed about great and unconditional love 1 
if it were possible to give them zero stars theyd have it 0 
also the area where my unit broke im not too fond of the magnetic strap 0 
down the drain because of a weak snap 0 
not recommended 0 
wasted two hours 0 
never again will i be dining at this place 0 
best breakfast buffet 1 
an amazing finale to possibly the best trilogy of all time 1 
the stories were powerful explorations of the nature of man and of art 1 
its worth driving up from tucson 1 
awful service 0 
its also great to see that renowned silent screenwriter frances marion hasnt missed a step going from silent to sound 1 
its a gloriously fun fast paced and fairly accurate portrayal of the night of a raver 1 
the headsets are easy to use and everyone loves them 1 
to summarize the food was incredible nay transcendant but nothing brings me joy quite like the memory of the pneumatic condiment dispenser 1 
works as described 1 
dee snider just plain sucks 0 
when it opens the battery connection is broken and the device is turned off 0 
a usable keyboard actually turns a pda into a realworld useful machine instead of just a neat gadget 1 
her lines seem to have been written by a fifteen year old though they are trying oh so so hard to sound like how a fifteen year old would really um you know well talk 0 
bt50 battery junk 0 
works as described 1 
the sides are delish mixed mushrooms yukon gold puree white corn beateous 1 
i could care less the interior is just beautiful 1 
for the price this was a great deal 1 
great for the jawbone 1 
it came free with a dvd player i bought but i still turned the thing off halfway through because i was embarrassed for howell 0 
the food amazing 1 
painful on the ear 0 
the only downside is the service 0 
the poor actors 0 
i left with a stomach ache and felt sick the rest of the day 0 
artless camerawork endlessly presents us with the ugliest setting imaginable ie 0 
the only place good for this film is in the garbage 0 
dont buy it 0 
i highly recommend this modest priced cellular phone 1 
bad purchase 0 
other than that the leather is nice and soft the fit is very tight the cut out for the face is a good shape 1 
the dining space is tiny but elegantly decorated and comfortable 1 
seems like a good quick place to grab a bite of some familiar pub food but do yourself a favor and look elsewhere 0 
works great 1 
for that its worth checking out 1 
the reception is excellent 1 
a piece of cinematic garbage captured on celluloid 0 
he is almost unbearable to watch on screen he has little to no charisma and terrible comedic timing 0 
not only did the software do a great job of this i could also make my own ringtones form my existing cds without an internet connection 1 
the films sole bright spot was jonah hill who will look almost unrecognizable to fans of the recent superbad due to the amount of weight he lost in the interim 1 
product was excellent and works better than the verizon one and boy was it cheaper 1 
this phone tries very hard to do everything but fails at its very ability to be a phone 0 
i liked the patio and the service was outstanding 1 
and the chef was generous with his time even came around twice so we can take pictures with him 1 
its also great to see that renowned silent screenwriter frances marion hasnt missed a step going from silent to sound 1 
they work about 2 weeks then break 0 
the incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film 1 
just whatever you do avoid groove as its the antithesis of all that is good about human traffic 0 
yes its that bad 0 
the vegetables are so fresh and the sauce feels like authentic thai 1 
the calls drop the phone comes on and off at will the screen goes black and the worst of all it stops ringing intermittently 0 
disappointment i hate anything that goes in my ear 0 
there are many continuity errors one other user commented on different cars in the garage joes glassesthe one that got to me the most was the fact joes facial hair configuration seemed to change from scene to scene 0 
saw the movie today and thought it was a good effort good messages for kids 1 
everyone is very attentive providing excellent customer service 1 
the point is the journey a journey that touches every member of the family 1 
his use of the colours of the french flag in the three films was nothing short of incredible every shot every scene was like a work of art 1 
our server was super nice and checked on us many times 1 
if you simply want a small flip phone look elsewhere as the extra bells whistles are mediocre 0 
another note about this phones appearance is that it really looks rather bland especially in the all black model 0 
and i just love the colors 1 
now we were chosen to be tortured with this disgusting piece of blatant american propaganda 0 
does not fit 0 
everything was good and tasty 1 
if only someone involved with it knew how to string together narrative 0 
the script is horrendously stupid 0 
this film tries to be a serious and sophisticated thrillerhorror flick and it fails miserably 0 
what the hell kind of crap is that 0 
the best place in vegas for breakfast just check out a sat or sun 1 
not too screamy not to masculine but just right 1 
too bad cause i know its family owned i really wanted to like this place 0 
i had ordered a motorola data cable got a very well finished and working product 1 
it crackles with an unpredictable youthful energy but honestly i found it hard to follow and concentrate on it meanders so badly 0 
the cast of veteran actors are more than just a nostalgia trip 1 
by this time our side of the restaurant was almost empty so there was no excuse 0 
the worst one of the series 0 
the food is very good for your typical bar food 1 
with great sound effects and impressive special effects i cant recommend this movie enough 1 
they will customize your order any way youd like my usual is eggplant with green bean stir fry love it 1 
just spicy enough perfect actually 1 
save your money ive had this item for 11 months now 0 
you cant relate with them hell you barely can understand them 0 
someone shouldve invented this sooner 1 
it felt like a very gripping intelligent stage play but without the overly theatrical feeling one actually gets from watching people on a stage which plays on everyones terror of a white lie escalating to monstrous consequences 1 
if you want a real scare rent this one 1 
i dont think well be going back anytime soon 0 
the vanilla ice cream was creamy and smooth while the profiterole choux pastry was fresh enough 1 
i will continue to come here on ladies night andddd date night highly recommend this place to anyone who is in the area 1 
first of all there are enough racial stereotypes and racial jokes to offend everyone 0 
ill even say it again  this is torture 0 
they really want to make your experience a good one 1 
your brain will attempt to shutdown as part of a primal impulse of selfpreservation 0 
integrated seamlessly with the motorola razr phone 1 
this wonderful experience made this place a muststop whenever we are in town again 1 
bela lugosi was totally extraneous intoning odd lines 0 
lame would be the best way to describe it 0 
i would recommend purchasing the jabra jx10 series 2 which works flawlessly with my moto q go figure 1 
imdb ratings only go as low 1 for awful its time to get some negative numbers in there for cases such as these 0 
the design is very odd as the ear clip is not very comfortable at all 0 
the update procedure is difficult and cumbersome 0 
excellent cast story line performances 1 
the cg opening sequence in space looked like it could have been created on microsoft slideshow for gods sake 0 
we are so glad we found this place 1 
be sure to order dessert even if you need to pack it togo the tiramisu and cannoli are both to die for 1 
though the wind and the lion is told largely through the eyes of the son every member of the family can identify with one of the characters whether it be sean connerys noble brigand candace bergens feisty heroine john hustons wily john hay or steve kanalys spiffy radiant ruthless cando lieutenant roosevelts big stick 1 
price is good too 1 
i consider this theft 0 
the staff are also very friendly and efficient 1 
yet plantronincs continues to use the same flawed charger design 0 
the acting is beyond abysmal 0 
very pleased with this headset 1 
the potatoes were great and so was the biscuit 1 
my order was not correct 0 
im really disappointed all i have now is a charger that doesnt work 0 
the cg opening sequence in space looked like it could have been created on microsoft slideshow for gods sake 0 
we would recommend these to others 1 
it is simple to use and i like it 1 
very disappointed 0 
very satisifed with that 1 
editing the editing of this film was phenomenal in my opinion 1 
terrible phone holder 0 
integrated seamlessly with the motorola razr phone 1 
i wasnt really impressed with strip steak 0 
the film is way too long 0 
the cast is good 1 
ill be looking for a new earpiece 0 
jamie foxx absolutely is ray charles 1 
love this product 1 
great earpiece 1 
bland not a liking this place for a number of reasons and i dont want to waste time on bad reviewing ill leave it at that 0 
lastly the mozzarella sticks they were the best thing we ordered 1 
linked to my phone without effort 1 
the worst experience ever 0 
feelings thoughtsgabriels discomfort during the danceall these intangibles leap to life and come within the viewers grasp in hustons portrayal 1 
the eargels channel the sound directly into your ear and seem to increase the sound volume and clarity 1 
we waited an hour for what was a breakfast i could have done 100 times better at home 0 
simple lightweight and great fit 1 
wed definitely go back here again 1 
cinematography the film was shot in an interesting way 1 
ive never been more insulted or felt disrespected 0 
its still wild stuff though and is highly recommended to fans of giallo cinema 1 
im trying to return it for a refund 0 
so bad 0 
buyerbe very careful 0 
it defeats the purpose of a bluetooth headset 0 
the acting as youd expect from this cast is top notch 1 
so i had to take the battery out of the phone put it all back together and then restart it 0 
i would have given no star if i was able 0 
poor sound quality 0 
worst foodservice ive had in a while 0 
waitress was a little slow in service 0 
very comfortable 1 
we definately enjoyed ourselves 1 
food arrived quickly 1 
good prices 1 
very clear quality sound and you dont have to mess with the sound on your ipod since you have the sound buttons on the headset 1 
the greek dressing was very creamy and flavorful 1 
lately they have been extremely nice and helpful on the phone 1 
but what really made it unwatchable was the direction 0 
makes it easier to keep up with my bluetooth when im not wearing it 0 
this was utterly confusing at first which caused me to lose a couple of very very important contacts 0 
light weight i hardly notice it is there 1 
this was like the final blow 0 
it sure does beat the nachos at the movies but i would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant 0 
this is one of the best movies out there that shows such strong sibling bond for each other 1 
main thing i didnt enjoy is that the crowd is of older crowd around mid 30s and up 0 
i got it because it was so small and adorable 1 
the story unfolds in 18th century jutland and the use of period music played on period instruments is just one more fine touch 1 
that was done in the second movie 0 
however i needed some better instructions 0 
10 out of 10 for both the movie and trilogy 1 
this is a really fantastic thai restaurant which is definitely worth a visit 1 
from here on the widmark character turns unintentionally comical 0 
like the other reviewer said you couldnt pay me to eat at this place again 0 
definitely worth checking out 1 
i felt insulted and disrespected how could you talk and judge another human being like that 0 
all in all id expected a better consumer experience from motorola 0 
not to mention the combination of pears almonds and bacon is a big winner 1 
i found the product to be easy to set up and use 1 
i bought this phone as a replacement for my startac and have regretted it since 0 
i heart this place 1 
you wont forget this movie 1 
i have seen many movies starring jaclyn smith but my god this was one of her best though it came out 12 years ago 1 
the vegetables are so fresh and the sauce feels like authentic thai 1 
waste of 13 bucks 0 
these are fabulous 1 
ryans bar is definitely one edinburgh establishment i wont be revisiting 0 
they do not care about the consumer one bit 0 
the movie in movie situations in the beginning and through the game that is played with her by the acting coach are fascinating 1 
the battery runs down quickly 0 
poor quality 0 
great product and price 1 
i work in the hospitality industry in paradise valley and have refrained from recommending cibo any longer 0 
we received a white colored battery that goes dead after a couple hoursthe original used to last a week but still lasts longer than thereplacement 0 
cinematography the film was shot in an interesting way 1 
if you love death and decay and shakespears lyrics this is the one 1 
youll love how thin it is 1 
the headset fulfills my requirements so i am happy with my purchase 1 
she carries the movie well 1 
i am sorry i made this purchase 0 
these are the central themes of the film and they are handled ineptly stereotypically and with no depth of imagination 0 
the reception has been generally good 1 
the chicken dishes are ok the beef is like shoe leather 0 
now i know that i made a wise decision 1 
i paid the bill but did not tip because i felt the server did a terrible job 0 
i could eat their bruschetta all day it is devine 1 
restored my phone to like new performance 1 
overall i like this place a lot 1 
it came free with a dvd player i bought but i still turned the thing off halfway through because i was embarrassed for howell 0 
you can even take self portraits with the outside exterior display very cool 1 
when achille and philippa beautifully sing a duet from don giovanni that perfectly describes their situation in the movie you appreciate the subtle layers of this excellent film 1 
the food was excellent and service was very good 1 
will not be back 0 
my girlfriends veal was very bad 0 
the pan cakes everyone are raving about taste like a sugary disaster tailored to the palate of a six year old 0 
works great when my cat attacked the phone he scratched the protective strip instead of destroying the screen 1 
what happened next was prettyoff putting 0 
the turkey and roast beef were bland 0 
very disappointing 0 
it is rare when a filmmaker takes the time to tell a worthy moral tale with care and love that doesnt fall into the trap of being overly syrupy or over indulgent 1 
one of the most disappointing aspects is the lack of notable gore 0 
it was a drive to get there 0 
the buffet at bellagio was far from what i anticipated 0 
the food is not tasty at all not to say its real traditional hunan style 0 
timely shipment and quality product 1 
you wont regret it 1 
i have to use the smallest earpieces provided but it stays on pretty well 1 
this is just a great movie 1 
i love this place 1 
service is also cute 1 
tied to charger for conversations lasting more than 45 minutesmajor problems 0 
say bye bye to your tip lady 0 
i have yet to run this new battery below two bars and thats three days without charging 1 
i seriously cannot believe that the owner has so many unexperienced employees that all are running around like chickens with their heads cut off 0 
50 down the drain 0 
the reception is excellent 1 
jabra ear gels r the best 1 
it was also the right balance of war and love 1 
i have to use the smallest earpieces provided but it stays on pretty well 1 
the script is was there a script 0 
this is a bad film with bad writing and good actorsan ugly cartoon crafted by paul haggis for people who cant handle anything but the bold strokes in storytellinga picture painted with crayons 0 
great pork sandwich 1 
i have had tmobile service for 2 or 3 years now and i am pretty happy with it 1 
it doesnt make you look cool 0 
only like 3 or 4 buildings used a couple of locations maybe poor hummh 0 
the classic maine lobster roll was fantastic 1 
we had 7 at our table and the service was pretty fast 1 
poorly contstruct hinge 0 
pretty piece of junk 0 
the cashier had no care what so ever on what i had to say it still ended up being wayyy overpriced 0 
its a shame to see good actors like thomerson and james make a living in a mess like this 0 
setup went very smoothly 1 
this battery is an excellent bargain 1 
they work about 2 weeks then break 0 
it is cheap and it feel and look just as cheap 0 
and the chef was generous with his time even came around twice so we can take pictures with him 1 
the acting by the whole cast could be put on a scale and balanced perfectly between overacting and underacting 0 
there was no chemistry between ben affleck and sandra bullock in this film and i couldnt understand why he would consider even leaving his wifetobe for this chick that he supposedly was knocked out by 0 
also were served hot bread and butter and home made potato chips with bacon bits on topvery original and very good 1 
great place to eat reminds me of the little mom and pop shops in the san francisco bay area 1 
but it does get better reception and clarity than any phone ive had before 1 
think of the film being like a dream 1 
very funny 1 
we waited an hour for what was a breakfast i could have done 100 times better at home 0 
even allowing for poor production values for the time 1971 and the format some kind of miniseries this is baaaaaad 0 
definitely will come back here again 1 
see it 1 
now this dish was quite flavourful 1 
the waiter wasnt helpful or friendly and rarely checked on us 0 
horrible horrible protector 0 
the grilled chicken was so tender and yellow from the saffron seasoning 1 
dont buy this product 0 
i love the ownerchef his one authentic japanese cool dude 1 
juano hernandez an exceptional actor who played supporting roles in many films of the era is a proud black man who is accused of murdering a white man in the south 1 
the menu is always changing food quality is going down service is extremely slow 0 
the transfers are very good 1 
the screen size is big key pad lit well enough and the camera quality is excellent for a camera phone 1 
ray charles is legendary 1 
disappointment i hate anything that goes in my ear 0 
low quality 0 
it is rare when a filmmaker takes the time to tell a worthy moral tale with care and love that doesnt fall into the trap of being overly syrupy or over indulgent 1 
this is a chilly unremarkable movie about an author livingworking in a chilly abstruse culture 0 
the inside is really quite nice and very clean 1 
waste of money 0 
if you look for authentic thai food go else where 0 
if you love authentic mexican food and want a whole bunch of interesting yet delicious meats to choose from you need to try this place 1 
the interplay between martin and emilio contains the same wonderful chemistry we saw in wall street with martin and charlie 1 
the food is very good for your typical bar food 1 
it seems completely secure both holding on to my belt and keeping the iphone inside 1 
the acting helps the writing along very well maybe the idiotsavant sister could have been played better and it is a real joy to watch 1 
all the other cases ive tried normally fall apart after a few months but this one seems to be in for the long haul 1 
do not waste your money here 0 
in addition to having one of the most lovely songs ever written french cancan also boasts one of the cutest leading ladies ever to grace the screen 1 
i ordered albondigas soup which was just warm and tasted like tomato soup with frozen meatballs 0 
the plot such as it is is so derivative and predictable that the ending is like a mercy killing 0 
its been my choice headset for yearsgreat sound good volume good noise cancellation 1 
works as described 1 
unfortunately inexperience of direction meant that scene after scene passed with little in the way of dramatic tension or conflict 0 
2 thumbs up 1 
camerawork again bad 0 
you cant beat that 1 
i totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is 1 
everything was fresh and delicious 1 
its one of the movies i need to see whenever it comes on tvnever mind the fact that i already have it memorized 1 
their chow mein is so good 1 
i started this review with two stars but im editing it to give it only one 0 
but it is great i would really recommend it 1 
frankly after cotton club and unfaithful it was kind of embarrassing to watch lane and gere in this film because it is bad 0 
i tried the cape cod ravoli chickenwith cranberrymmmm 1 
awesome device 1 
this is my new fav vegas buffet spot 1 
raw and sublimely moving 1 
how awful she is 0 
if you love death and decay and shakespears lyrics this is the one 1 
spend your money elsewhere 0 
for the price this was a great deal 1 
not even good for camp value 0 
i started this review with two stars but im editing it to give it only one 0 
about 30 minutes of footage is wasted to show mediocre elderly actors awkwardly babbling overwrought pseudosatanic gibberish corny enough to make a teen goth blush almost always in olde english and sometimes in latin that may or may not be made up words 0 
the plot is nonsense that doesnt interest in the slightest way or have any uniqueness to it 0 
the chicken i got was definitely reheated and was only ok the wedges were cold and soggy 0 
the dialogue sucked 0 
you have to hold the phone at a particular angle for the other party to hear you clearly 0 
the food was outstanding and the prices were very reasonable 1 
at first i thought i was grtting a good deal at 744 until i plugged it into my phone v3c razr 0 
but it wasnt anything at all just one big yawn 0 
there was a warm feeling with the service and i felt like their guest for a special treat 1 
in the span of an hour i had two people exclaim whoa is that the new phone on tv 1 
it is easy to turn on and off when you are in the car and the volume controls are quite accessable 1 
the only consistent thread holding the series together were the amazing performances of leni parker and anita laselva as the two taelons in quiet idealogical conflict 0 
i received it quickly and it works great 1 
the movie is terribly boring in places 0 
doesnt work 0 
it was equally awful 0 
the sound quality is excellent as well 1 
if you want a real scare rent this one 1 
will never ever go back and have told many people what had happened 0 
we got the food and apparently they have never heard of salt and the batter on the fish was chewy 0 
i did not expect this to be so good 1 
see it with your kids if you have a chanceit will open up some amazing dialog about how far race relations have come in the last 50 years 1 
very well made and fits my surefire gx2 perfectly 1 
you wont forget this movie 1 
steamboat willie is an amazingly important film to our cinema history 1 
if this premise sound stupid thats because it is 0 
it even has its sweet moments 1 
not much flavor to them and very poorly constructed 0 
it is an hour and half waste of time following a bunch of very pretty high schoolers whine and cry about life 0 
there are massive levels massive unlockable characters its just a massive game 1 
battery is terrible 0 
the interplay between martin and emilio contains the same wonderful chemistry we saw in wall street with martin and charlie 1 
all in all an excellent restaurant highlighted by great service a unique menu and a beautiful setting 1 
will never ever go back and have told many people what had happened 0 
fantastic earphones 1 
awful 0 
we will not be coming back 0 
i own 2 of these cases and would order another 1 
director paul matthews who also wrotedirected the weak 1995 monster movie grim clearly doesnt know how to pace his films 0 
reaching for the bottom row is uncomfortable and the send and end keys are not where i expect them to be3 0 
could not get strong enough signal 0 
enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film 1 
we have tried 2 units and they both failed within 2 months pros 0 
food was below average 0 
i keep watching it over and over 1 
it is a true classic 1 
the cashew cream sauce was bland and the vegetables were undercooked 0 
then as if i hadnt wasted enough of my life there they poured salt in the wound by drawing out the time it took to bring the check 0 
the charger arrived within the promised timeframe but it did not work 0 
i am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this 1 
but the service was beyond bad 0 
i received my headset in good time and was happy with it 1 
im pleased 1 
it is the best charger i have seen on the market yet 1 
the attempts at humor were pitiful and story is so awful it dosent bear thinking about which basically involves a vulcan stealing the enterprise to find god seriously i just didnt care about any of this film and oh not to mention uhura does a belly dance to distract male guards 0 
everything was perfect the night we were in 1 
if i take a picture the battery drops a bar and starts beeping letting me know its dieing 0 
seriously its not worth wasting your or your kids time on 0 
one more thing i can tolerate political incorrectness very well im all for artistic freedom and suspension of disbelief but the slavic female character was just too much 0 
total waste of time 0 
not only did the software do a great job of this i could also make my own ringtones form my existing cds without an internet connection 1 
eclectic selection 1 
i keep watching it over and over 1 
you wont regret it 1 
to call this movie a drama is ridiculous 0 
very very disappointed ordered the 35 big bay plater 0 
freezes frequently4 0 
the chips and sals a here is amazing 1 
its a feelgood film and thats how i felt when i came out of the cinema 1 
while you dont yet hear mickey speak there are tons of sound effects and music throughout the filmsomething we take for granted now but which was a huge crowd pleaser in 1928 1 
i believe that pitch black was done well 1 
gotta love those closeups of slimy drooling teeth 1 
an italian reviewer called this a small great film and thats right 1 
the ri style calamari was a joke 0 
people who like european films and art movies will like this movie 1 
regardless the film fails on most levels 0 
great software for motorolas 1 
however after about a year the fliptop started to get loose and wobbly and eventually my screen went black and i couldnt receive and place calls 0 
still its quite interesting and entertaining to follow 1 
makes it easier to keep up with my bluetooth when im not wearing it 0 
the first thing that happened was that the tracking was off 0 
his performance is simply genius 1 
summary the witticisms werent witty 0 
we loved the place 1 
gotta love those closeups of slimy drooling teeth 1 
editing the editing of this film was phenomenal in my opinion 1 
today was my first taste of a buldogis gourmet hot dog and i have to tell you it was more than i ever thought possible 1 
worked perfectly 1 
it also had a new problem 0 
really pleased with this product so far 1 
i highly recommend this case 1 
if you look for authentic thai food go else where 0 
ill be looking for a new earpiece 0 
the food wasnt good 0 
she ordered a toasted english muffin that came out untoasted 0 
if it was to turn my good day feeling into a night of disturbing memories than i guess he succeeded 0 
the battery is working well as a replacement for the original that came with the phone over 2 years ago 1 
this company charge me a restocking fee and still not given me my refund back 0 
dont bother go to the store 0 
definitely will come back here again 1 
my sashimi was poor quality being soggy and tasteless 0 
heres where the movie really pied me off 0 
there was no chemistry between ben affleck and sandra bullock in this film and i couldnt understand why he would consider even leaving his wifetobe for this chick that he supposedly was knocked out by 0 
now imagine that every single one of those decisions was made wrong 0 
excellent hands free tool 1 
the attractive set used throughout most of the film is an eyepleasing gem 1 
dessert panna cotta was amazing 1 
great pork sandwich 1 
the malta settings are as dry and as barren as the dialogue 0 
this game rocks 1 
it was that year however that reminded us that huston was still at the top of his game as evinced by his faithful adaptation of james joyces acclaimed novella the dead 1 
generally it just lacked imagination 0 
works like a charm it work the same as the one i got with the phone 1 
the film is well paced understated and one of the best courtroom documentaries ive seen 1 
unfortunately any virtue in this films production work was lost on a regrettable script 0 
painful on the ear 0 
it worked very well 1 
woa talk about awful 0 
i could care less the interior is just beautiful 1 
doesnt last long 0 
the battery life is highly unacceptable 0 
horrible had to switch 3 times 0 
we arent ones to make a scene at restaurants but i just dont get itdefinitely lost the love after this one 0 
never again will i be dining at this place 0 
not good for the money 0 
disappointed with battery 0 
i had to wait over 30 minutes to get my drink and longer to get 2 arepas 0 
hands down my favorite italian restaurant 1 
first off the reception sucks i have never had more than 2 bars ever 0 
i like armand assante my cable companys summary sounded interesting so i watched it twice already and probably will again 1 
does not work 0 
we got sitting fairly fast but ended up waiting 40 minutes just to place our order another 30 minutes before the food arrived 0 
i was left shattered from the experience of watching this film and i took a good two hours to fully recover 0 
though the wind and the lion is told largely through the eyes of the son every member of the family can identify with one of the characters whether it be sean connerys noble brigand candace bergens feisty heroine john hustons wily john hay or steve kanalys spiffy radiant ruthless cando lieutenant roosevelts big stick 1 
i dont think there are any redeeming qualities in this remake 0 
i wouldnt see this movie again for free 0 
i would recommend purchasing the jabra jx10 series 2 which works flawlessly with my moto q go figure 1 
all in all i think it was a good investment 1 
if you are looking for a good quality motorola headset keep looking this isnt it 0 
doesnt hold charge 0 
he came running after us when he realized my husband had left his sunglasses on the table 1 
the cg opening sequence in space looked like it could have been created on microsoft slideshow for gods sake 0 
waste your money on this game 1 
some applause should be given to the prelude however 1 
2 thumbs up 1 
i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
i love that they put their food in nice plastic containers as opposed to cramming it in little paper takeout boxes 1 
it was awesome 1 
again no plot at all 0 
but the service was beyond bad 0 
this is one of the best italian thrillers of the early 70s 1 
for those that havent seen it dont waste your time 0 
a happy wonderful feel good ending 1 
but in any case the best part is you can download these pictures to your laptop using ir or even send pictures from your laptop to the phone 1 
but now that it is out of warranty the same problems reoccurebottom line put your money somewhere else cingular will not support it 0 
lately they have been extremely nice and helpful on the phone 1 
not even a hello we will be right with you 0 
service is friendly and inviting 1 
i can say that the desserts were yummy 1 
service is friendly and inviting 1 
it did not work in my cell phone plug i am very up set with the charger 0 
the burrittos blah 0 
nothing new there 0 
battery life is also great 1 
during several different 2 minute calls i experienced 5 drops and it was in an area that had 5 bars 0 
god and i can never get that 90 minutes back 0 
their regular toasted bread was equally satisfying with the occasional pats of butter mmmm 1 
the majority of the logitech earbud headsets failed 0 
con spotty service 0 
friends pasta also bad he barely touched it 0 
long whiny and pointless 0 
i thoroughly enjoyed it when christopher eccleston took control of the tardis and the continuation of the series 1 
its a feelgood film and thats how i felt when i came out of the cinema 1 
nevertheless yet another wonderful film from the great masters stable 1 
overall i like this place a lot 1 
this may be the only bad film he ever made 0 
the acting was decidely wooden though no worse than a period universal b movie 0 
i had a seriously solid breakfast here 1 
the volume switch rocketed out of the unit to a destination unknown 0 
sorry i will not be getting food from here anytime soon 0 
nevertheless yet another wonderful film from the great masters stable 1 
by the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant i was bored and didnt care what happened next and so i switched off 0 
not good for the money 0 
the point is the journey a journey that touches every member of the family 1 
but whatever it was that cost them so much it didnt translate to quality thats for sure 0 
definitely will come back here again 1 
the best place in vegas for breakfast just check out a sat or sun 1 
i dont understand how this garbage got on the shelves of the movie store its not even a real movie 0 
this totally unfunny movie is so over the top and pathetic and unrealistic that throughout the whole 90 minutes of utter torture i probably looked at my watch about 70000 times 0 
appetite instantly gone 0 
the bathroom is just next door and very nice 1 
its too bad that everyone else involved didnt share crowes level of dedication to quality for if they did wed have a far better film on our hands than this subpar mess 0 
great audio 1 
this is probably one of the least effective and utterly unoriginal films i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
i dont know exactly what it is about this movie but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our familys memories 1 
highly recommended a 1 
the warmth it generates is in contrast to its austere backdrop 1 
it crackles with an unpredictable youthful energy but honestly i found it hard to follow and concentrate on it meanders so badly 0 
the greek dressing was very creamy and flavorful 1 
my 810 score is mostly for the plot 1 
its too bad that everyone else involved didnt share crowes level of dedication to quality for if they did wed have a far better film on our hands than this subpar mess 0 
phenomenal food service and ambiance 1 
internet is excrutiatingly slow 0 
this place is pretty good nice little vibe in the restaurant 1 
we ordered the duck rare and it was pink and tender on the inside with a nice char on the outside 1 
the film has an ultracheap look to it 0 
the story line is totally predictable 0 
this is a bad film with bad writing and good actorsan ugly cartoon crafted by paul haggis for people who cant handle anything but the bold strokes in storytellinga picture painted with crayons 0 
im terribly disappointed that this film would receive so many awards and accolades especially when there are far more deserving works of film out there 0 
great price too 1 
there was no chemistry between ben affleck and sandra bullock in this film and i couldnt understand why he would consider even leaving his wifetobe for this chick that he supposedly was knocked out by 0 
the bottowm lineanother worthless cheap gimmick from sprint 0 
this product is great it makes working a lot easier i can go to the copier while waiting on hold for something 1 
lordy the khao soi is a dish that is not to be missed for curry lovers 1 
waitress was a little slow in service 0 
this movie is also revealing 1 
i advise everyone do not be fooled 0 
they are so cool 1 
my wife had the lobster bisque soup which was lukewarm 0 
very tough and very short on flavor 0 
we sat another ten minutes and finally gave up and left 0 
i am far from a sushi connoisseur but i can definitely tell the difference between good food and bad food and this was certainly bad food 0 
terrible my car will not accept this cassette 0 
they were goldencrispy and delicious 1 
not good by any stretch of the imagination 0 
but in any case the best part is you can download these pictures to your laptop using ir or even send pictures from your laptop to the phone 1 
i wont spoil it but the ending in pretty amazing 1 
this is a disgrace 0 
treo and tmobile refused to replace it again and forced me to buy another phone without any kind of upgrade discount 0 
ive had this bluetoooth headset for some time now and still not comfortable with the way it fits on the ear 0 
i checked out this place a couple years ago and was not impressed 0 
and dont even get me started on the jerky camerawork 0 
obviously they have a terrible customer service so you get what you pay for 0 
feelings thoughtsgabriels discomfort during the danceall these intangibles leap to life and come within the viewers grasp in hustons portrayal 1 
before i go in to why i gave a 1 star rating please know that this was my third time eating at bachi burger before writing a review 0 
i am very impressed with the job that motorola did on the sturdiness of this phone 1 
this hole in the wall has great mexican street tacos and friendly staff 1 
highly recommended a 1 
the cast is always entertaining as usual 1 
and there wasnt a single sour note struck actingwise either some surprisingly solid casting here 1 
the presentation of the food was awful 0 
the headset fulfills my requirements so i am happy with my purchase 1 
i am sorry i made this purchase 0 
duris has a wholesome appearance and gives a fine performance 1 
pricing is a bit of a concern at mellow mushroom 0 
and i really did find them funny 1 
the roast beef sandwich tasted really good 1 
the sergeant pepper beef sandwich with auju sauce is an excellent sandwich as well 1 
the service here leaves a lot to be desired 0 
nevertheless yet another wonderful film from the great masters stable 1 
some applause should be given to the prelude however 1 
it also took her forever to bring us the check when we asked for it 0 
great price also 1 
waiter was a jerk 0 
when my mom and i got home she immediately got sick and she only had a few bites of salad 0 
hes a national treasure 1 
if you are razr owneryou must have this 1 
good audio quality 1 
unfortunately this is a bad movie that is just plain bad 0 
ray charles is legendary 1 
definitely worth checking out 1 
i was very pleased to see that i could replace my well travled swivel holster for my blackberry flip 1 
lange had become a great actress 1 
do not buy if you want to use the holster 0 
restaurant is always full but never a wait 1 
linksys should have some way to exchange a bad phone for a refurb unit or something 0 
the live music on fridays totally blows 0 
today was my first taste of a buldogis gourmet hot dog and i have to tell you it was more than i ever thought possible 1 
if it were possible to give them zero stars theyd have it 0 
i love that they put their food in nice plastic containers as opposed to cramming it in little paper takeout boxes 1 
the camera on the phone may be used as a dustpan when indoors id rather be using a disposable then this 0 
okay i like to consider myself a fair critic so ill give credit where credits duethe creature effects were actually pretty cool 1 
the seller is very understanding and patient i would definitely buy from them again 1 
he really didnt seem to want to be hosting his voiceovers were monotonous didnt get involved with the guests 0 
the best phone in market 1 
its so bad its actually worth seeing just for that reason 0 
worst customer service ever 0 
my phone doesnt slide around my car now and the grip prevents my phone from slipping out of my hand 1 
a good commentary of todays love and undoubtedly a film worth seeing 1 
i was very disappointed 0 
this is an outstanding little restaurant with some of the best food i have ever tasted 1 
the music in the film is really nice too 1 
there is no plot here to keep you going in the first place 0 
his use of the colours of the french flag in the three films was nothing short of incredible every shot every scene was like a work of art 1 
service was fantastic 1 
omg the food was delicioso 1 
you never know if you pushed it hard enough or the right number of times for the function you want or not 0 
first time going but i think i will quickly become a regular 1 
it was a huge awkward 15lb piece of cow that was 34ths gristle and fat 0 
now the pizza itself was good the peanut sauce was very tasty 1 
there are the usual hitchcock logic flaws 0 
leopard print is wonderfully wild 1 
even the squibs look awful 0 
if that bug never showed up i would have given a 4 for sure but on the other side of the wall where this bug was climbing was the kitchen 0 
too bad cause i know its family owned i really wanted to like this place 0 
cant store anything but phone numbers to sim 0 
both of the egg rolls were fantastic 1 
its quite simply the highest most superlative form of cinema imaginable 1 
i love this cable it allows me to connect any miniusb device to my pc 1 
probably never coming back and wouldnt recommend it 0 
the acting is fantastic the stories are seamlessly woven together and the dogs are splendid a must rent view or see 1 
the speaker is of low quality so as making the ring tones sound very cheap 0 
star trek v the final frontier is the worst in the series 0 
so i am here to warn youdo not rent this movie it is the dumbest thing you have never seen 0 
this is cool because most cases are just open there allowing the screen to get all scratched up 1 
there is a lot of beautiful places 1 
poorly contstruct hinge 0 
very friendly staff 1 
the cocktails are all handmade and delicious 1 
i wasnt the least bit interested 0 
the film succeeds despite or perhaps because of an obviously meagre budget 1 
sprint charges for this service 0 
i could not stand to even watch it for very long for fear of losing iq 0 
ive had no trouble accessing the internet downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions 1 
its one of the movies i need to see whenever it comes on tvnever mind the fact that i already have it memorized 1 
i would avoid this place if you are staying in the mirage 0 
jamie foxx absolutely is ray charles 1 
this is some seriously good pizza and im an expertconnisseur on the topic 1 
my experience was terrible this was my fourth bluetooth headset and while it was much more comfortable than my last jabra which i hated 0 
and his subtle connections between the three films are awesome 1 
however after seeing the short again after about 25 years i was amazed at how timeless the film actually is 1 
one nice thing was that they added gratuity on the bill since our party was larger than 6 or 8 and they didnt expect more tip than that 1 
who in their right mind is gonna buy this battery 0 
you wont forget this movie 1 
interesting decor 1 
dessert panna cotta was amazing 1 
and service was super friendly 1 
i dont think it would hold it too securly on your belt 0 
i am sorry i made this purchase 0 
the screen size is big key pad lit well enough and the camera quality is excellent for a camera phone 1 
overall a delight 1 
i had to wait over 30 minutes to get my drink and longer to get 2 arepas 0 
the story is lame not interesting and never really explains the sinister origins of the puppets 0 
terrible my car will not accept this cassette 0 
earbud piece breaks easily 0 
if you are razr owneryou must have this 1 
disapointing results 0 
has been working great 1 
whatever the producer was going for he missed entirely 0 
the handsfree part works fine but then the car tries to download the address book and the treo rebootsoverall i still rate this device high 1 
every element of this story was so over the top excessively phony and contrived that it was painful to sit through 0 
the food sucked which we expected but it sucked more than we could have imagined 0 
sucked most of the stuff does not work with my phone 0 
a happy wonderful feel good ending 1 
ill be looking for a new earpiece 0 
if it was to turn my good day feeling into a night of disturbing memories than i guess he succeeded 0 
this is probably one of the least effective and utterly unoriginal films i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
i wear it everyday and it holds up very well 1 
there is however some pretty good acting at least for this type of film 1 
the server was very negligent of our needs and made us feel very unwelcome i would not suggest this place 0 
very bad performance plays angela bennett a computer expert who is at home all the time 0 
awful service 0 
an excellent new restaurant by an experienced frenchman 1 
great product 1 
anne heche was utterly convincing 1 
its welldesigned and very sharp the blue is a very nice color 1 
we got sitting fairly fast but ended up waiting 40 minutes just to place our order another 30 minutes before the food arrived 0 
this was reflected not only in the cast but also in the belowpar script which borrowed much from the earlier classic 0 
this place is overpriced not consistent with their boba and it really is overpriced 0 
the warm beer didnt help 0 
and i really did find them funny 1 
if the food isnt bad enough for you then enjoy dealing with the worlds worstannoying drunk people 0 
big disappointment with calendar sync 0 
in short dont bother with this movie 0 
cinematography the film was shot in an interesting way 1 
the story starts too fast with absolutely no suspense or buildup in the slightest 0 
the chains which im no fan of beat this place easily 0 
howeverthe riingtones are not the best and neither are the games 0 
if it were possible to give them zero stars theyd have it 0 
i found the product to be easy to set up and use 1 
performed awful muffled tinny incoming sound and severe echo for those on the other end of the call 0 
a drive thru means you do not want to wait around for half an hour for your food but somehow when we end up going here they make us wait and wait 0 
i had heard good things about this place but it exceeding every hope i could have dreamed of 1 
these are the nicest restaurant owners ive ever come across 1 
it dit not work most of the time with my nokia 5320 0 
their monster chicken fried steak and eggs is my all time favorite 1 
this game rocks 1 
omg the food was delicioso 1 
i was not impressed by this product 0 
the acting is terrible and the writing is worse 0 
the sangria was about half of a glass wine full and was 12 ridiculous 0 
now i know that i made a wise decision 1 
i love this cable it allows me to connect any miniusb device to my pc 1 
a very charming film with wonderful sentiment and heart 1 
there was so much hype over this phone that i assumed it was the best my mistake 0 
we enjoy their pizza and brunch 1 
the phone takes forever to charge like 2 to 5 hours literally 0 
the majority of the logitech earbud headsets failed 0 
i will not be eating there again 0 
i ordered this for sony ericsson w810i but i think it only worked once thats when i first used it 0 
must have been an off night at this place 0 
that was done in the second movie 0 
furthermore you cant even find hours of operation on the website 0 
it was also the right balance of war and love 1 
lousy product 0 
this is the phone to get for 2005 i just bought my s710a and all i can say is wow 1 
i left the theater with a lilt in my step joy in my heart and hope for the human race 1 
the film has an ultracheap look to it 0 
but other than that the movie seemed to drag and the heroes didnt really work for their freedom 0 
all i have to say is the food was amazing 1 
a film not easily forgotten 1 
probably not in a hurry to go back 0 
still its quite interesting and entertaining to follow 1 
im in az all the time and now have my new spot 1 
there is so much good food in vegas that i feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to rice and company 0 
the seller is very understanding and patient i would definitely buy from them again 1 
if you simply want a small flip phone look elsewhere as the extra bells whistles are mediocre 0 
a disappointment 0 
god and i can never get that 90 minutes back 0 
i must say i have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again 1 
it was packed 0 
battery is terrible 0 
you will leave the theater wanting to go out and dance under the stars 1 
anyway the plot flowed smoothly and the malebonding scenes were a hoot 1 
sucked most of the stuff does not work with my phone 0 
this is simply the best bluetooth headset for sound quality 1 
cooked to perfection and the service was impeccable 1 
just spicy enough perfect actually 1 
unfortunately cover girl is an example of how hollywood used to exploit women for financial gain 0 
the turkey and roast beef were bland 0 
i could barely stomach the meal but didnt complain because it was a business lunch 0 
in fact i liked it better than interview with a vampire and i liked this lestat stuart townsend better than cruises attempt 1 
for those that havent seen it dont waste your time 0 
both rickman and stowe play their roles to the hilt in this tale of a childrens book writer who maybe has written a subversive tract 1 
he was very impressed when going from the original battery to the extended battery 1 
good audio quality 1 
the service was extremely slow 0 
i just cant explain this movie more than romanticcharminghilariousand adorablethe junkyard scenes are funnyall the junkyard dogs have something specialtoo funny i laughedkids will love itbuy it when it comes outit has new features 1 
voice recognition is tremendous 1 
check it out 1 
strike 2 who wants to be rushed 0 
hayao miyazakis latest and eighth film for studio ghibili gake no ue no ponyo ponyo on the cliff by the sea is a wonderfully fun and imaginative look at childhood 1 
this place should honestly be blown up 0 
will never ever go back and have told many people what had happened 0 
he is almost unbearable to watch on screen he has little to no charisma and terrible comedic timing 0 
the only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive 1 
does not fit 0 
his performance as awarded was stunning 1 
i checked everywhere and there is no feature for it which is really disappointing 0 
overall i wasnt very impressed with noca 0 
this wonderful experience made this place a muststop whenever we are in town again 1 
if you are razr owneryou must have this 1 
i especially love the long battery life 1 
you cant relate with them hell you barely can understand them 0 
the casting is also horrible cause all you see is a really really bad actors period 0 
maybe there would be a reasonable explanation for this atrocity 0 
helen baxendale is a very credible lady macbeth who can be very cheerfull at times and sometimes she just looks like a naughty girl but deadly in her taste for blood and evil 1 
the goat taco didnt skimp on the meat and wow what flavor 1 
so flavorful and has just the perfect amount of heat 1 
dont make the same mistake i did 0 
its fits like a glove and is strong secure and durable 1 
be sure to order dessert even if you need to pack it togo the tiramisu and cannoli are both to die for 1 
the dialogue sucked 0 
i did not bother contacting the company for few dollar product but i learned the lesson that i should not have bought this form online anyway 0 
i give it 2 thumbs down 0 
it doesnt work in europe or asia 0 
2 times very bad customer service 0 
def coming back to bowl next time 1 
this is probably the most irritating show i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
how this piece of trash was ever released is beyond me the acting the story the characters the supposedly special effects etcits all wrong 0 
everyone is treated equally special 1 
treo and tmobile refused to replace it again and forced me to buy another phone without any kind of upgrade discount 0 
the soundtrack sucked 0 
an amazing finale to possibly the best trilogy of all time 1 
wed definitely go back here again 1 
oh this is such a thing of beauty this restaurant 1 
my breakfast was perpared great with a beautiful presentation of 3 giant slices of toast lightly dusted with powdered sugar 1 
it is the best charger i have seen on the market yet 1 
gets the job done 1 
im pleased 1 
i received it quickly and it works great 1 
when im on this side of town this will definitely be a spot ill hit up again 1 
i hate those things as much as cheap quality black olives 0 
very true to shakespear and a must for all shakespear fans 1 
comfortable in my hand 1 
ive tried several different earpieces for my cell phone and this jabra one is the first one ive found that fits my ear comfortably 1 
the script is a big flawed mess 0 
elias koteasjack palance play good roles angelina is hot and gets nakedbilly drago appears in this and is cool as usual a cameo by sven ole thorsen helps make this a very enjoyable movie with good acting and a decent budget 1 
glad i didnt pay to see it 0 
very tough and very short on flavor 0 
im probably one of the few people to ever go to ians and not like it 0 
however i recently watched the whole thing again on dvd and i was completely struck by how extremely stupid the storyline was how it contained holes inconsistencies and frankly a whole lot of crap and how horrid the dancing was 0 
all i have to say is the food was amazing 1 
all the characters in this film are tremendously well played 1 
because both ears are occupied background is not distracting at all 1 
i wasted my little money with this earpiece 0 
my first visit to hiro was a delight 1 
the characters are interesting and you want to find out more about them the longer the movie goes on and i think people will be surprised by who does and doesnt make it 1 
jamie foxx absolutely is ray charles 1 
it was packed 0 
you get extra minutes so that you can carry out the call and not get cut off 1 
definitely a turn off for me i doubt ill be back unless someone else is buying 0 
i waited and waited 0 
it wasnt busy at all and now we know why 0 
i would not recommend this place 0 
for 40 bucks a head i really expect better food 0 
the food was terrible 0 
dont make the same mistake that i did and please dont buy this phone 0 
very windresistant 1 
the performances are not improved by improvisation because the actors now have twice as much to worry about not only whether theyre delivering the line well but whether the line itself is any good 0 
i am sorry i made this purchase 0 
i received my supposedly new motorola 375 and apparently there was not a match between the phone and the charger 0 
the scallop dish is quite appalling for value as well 0 
their menu is diverse and reasonably priced 1 
if you look for authentic thai food go else where 0 
jamie foxx absolutely is ray charles 1 
not worth it 0 
the first time i ever came here i had an amazing experience i still tell people how awesome the duck was 1 
ive had this bluetoooth headset for some time now and still not comfortable with the way it fits on the ear 0 
jamie foxx absolutely is ray charles 1 
by the time the film ended i not only disliked it i despised it 0 
the sound quality for the device is unacceptableunless you are in a really quiet area you almost hear nothing 0 
all in all ha long bay was a bit of a flop 0 
the nokia ca42 usb cable did not work with my phone 0 
it was awesome 1 
customer service was terrible 0 
we also ordered the spinach and avocado salad the ingredients were sad and the dressing literally had zero taste 0 
worst thai ever 0 
i want to first say our server was great and we had perfect service 1 
in fact its hard to remember that the part of ray charles is being acted and not played by the man himself 1 
adapter does not provide enough charging current 0 
glad i didnt pay to see it 0 
theres barely a boring moment in the film and there are plenty of humorous parts 1 
i was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar not only because the quality is great but the service is fast and the food impeccable 1 
weird vibe from owners 0 
its worth driving up from tucson 1 
really ugly 0 
worthless product 0 
but the service was beyond bad 0 
at around 4 pm i bought it at around 8pm i started to watch at around 815pm i fast forwarded the remaining film to see if there was anything left watchable for a human being with a brain but there wasnt 0 
unfortunately cover girl is an example of how hollywood used to exploit women for financial gain 0 
not recommended 0 
unfortunately it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees 0 
a cheap and cheerless heist movie with poor characterisation lots of underbite style stoic emoting think chow yun fat in a better tomorrow and some cheesy clichés thrown into an abandoned factory ready for a few poorly executed flying judo rolls a la john woo 0 
happy so far 1 
will never ever go back 0 
doesnt do the job 0 
sooooo good 1 
awful service 0 
bad fit way too big 0 
disappointing accessory from a good manufacturer 0 
this was reflected not only in the cast but also in the belowpar script which borrowed much from the earlier classic 0 
drinks took close to 30 minutes to come out at one point 0 
it was equally awful 0 
it has a very good plot it holds your complete attention the acting is superb tom wilkinson was fantastic and emily watson was also very good 1 
really pleased with this product so far 1 
i like armand assante my cable companys summary sounded interesting so i watched it twice already and probably will again 1 
food was good service was good prices were good 1 
the sets especially designed to work with the camera are amazingstylized beautiful and effective 1 
the film succeeds despite or perhaps because of an obviously meagre budget 1 
frankly after cotton club and unfaithful it was kind of embarrassing to watch lane and gere in this film because it is bad 0 
yet plantronincs continues to use the same flawed charger design 0 
i wasnt really impressed with strip steak 0 
its a shame to see good actors like thomerson and james make a living in a mess like this 0 
im still trying to get over how bad it was 0 
if you have not seen this movie i definitely recommend it 1 
worst customer service 0 
lets start with all the problemsthe acting especially from the lead professor was very very bad 0 
that was done in the second movie 0 
that company is a joke 0 
the directing and the cinematography arent quite as good 0 
this is one of the worst sandra bullock movie since speed 2 but not quite that bad 0 
i came over from verizon because cingulair has nicer cell phones the first thing i noticed was the really bad service 0 
the desserts were a bit strange 0 
this film highlights the fundamental flaws of the legal process that its not about discovering guilt or innocence but rather is about who presents better in court 1 
bad reception 0 
very disappointed 0 
i must say i have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again 1 
she carries the movie well 1 
still waiting im sure this item would work well if i ever recieve it 0 
great steak great sides great wine amazing desserts 1 
this item is fantastic and works perfectly 1 
not tasty and the texture was just nasty 0 
sorry i will not be getting food from here anytime soon 0 
unfortunately this is a bad movie that is just plain bad 0 
the tracfonewebsite is user friendly and makes it easy toactivate etc 1 
the tracfonewebsite is user friendly and makes it easy toactivate etc 1 
see both films if you can 1 
the poor actors 0 
spend your money elsewhere 0 
i am a fan of his this movie sucked really bad 0 
the camera on the phone may be used as a dustpan when indoors id rather be using a disposable then this 0 
kind of flops around 0 
never heard of any of them except cole who was totally unbelievable in the part 0 
the things that the four kids get themselves into is absolutely hilarious to watch 1 
treo and tmobile refused to replace it again and forced me to buy another phone without any kind of upgrade discount 0 
this is one of the best movies out there that shows such strong sibling bond for each other 1 
simply beautiful 1 
useless phone simply deaf 0 
maybe its just their vegetarian fare but ive been twice and i thought it was average at best 0 
this greedy corporation will never see another dime from me 0 
check it out 1 
very unreliable service from tmobile 0 
love this product 1 
excellent product for the price 1 
if you love death and decay and shakespears lyrics this is the one 1 
it was just not a fun experience 1 
good product good seller 1 
initially the local sites in the film which was filmed here in buffalo intrigued me 1 
they have a plethora of salads and sandwiches and everything ive tried gets my seal of approval 1 
all things considered a job very well done 1 
i thought errol flynn was brilliant as custer and has since become my favourite actor 1 
it showed exactly how the government and the scientist argued for humanity and the reasons of the gadget 1 
easy to pair with my samsung cell 1 
add betty white and jean smart and you have a great cast everyone played their parts really well 1 
there is a brilliant twist ending 1 
the foreigner is not worth one second of your time 0 
i would give this television series a 10 plus if i could 1 
the flat reenactments dont hold your attention because they are emotionally adrift and stagy 0 
it is very educational for children 1 to 8 years old 1 
very friendly staff 1 
not even good for camp value 0 
works as described 1 
i love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it 1 
there is nothing authentic about this place 0 
i literally vomited while watching this film 0 
unfortunately any virtue in this films production work was lost on a regrettable script 0 
the best place to go for a tasty bowl of pho 1 
i was not impressed by this product 0 
server did a great job handling our large rowdy table 1 
conclusion very filling meals 1 
everything captain howdy says is either laughable or just plain stupid 0 
it had some average acting from the main person and it was a low budget as you clearly can see 0 
phone now holds charge like it did when it was new 1 
omelets are to die for 1 
new battery works great in phone 1 
i wouldnt see this movie again for free 0 
a truly truly bad film 0 
also the fries are without a doubt the worst fries ive ever had 0 
nice case feels good in your hands 1 
to summarize the food was incredible nay transcendant but nothing brings me joy quite like the memory of the pneumatic condiment dispenser 1 
for a self proclaimed coffee cafe i was wildly disappointed 0 
thank you for wasting my money 0 
ryans bar is definitely one edinburgh establishment i wont be revisiting 0 
fans of the genre will be in heaven 1 
not much flavor to them and very poorly constructed 0 
con spotty service 0 
meredith m was better than all right 1 
that company is a joke 0 
delete this film from your mind 0 
when it opens the battery connection is broken and the device is turned off 0 
but i definitely would not eat here again 0 
but it is great i would really recommend it 1 
gotta love those closeups of slimy drooling teeth 1 
this case seems well made 1 
it is simple to use and i like it 1 
its so bad its actually worth seeing just for that reason 0 
the burger is good beef cooked just right 1 
verizon tech support walked my through a few procedures none of which worked and i ended up having to do a hard reset wiping out all my data 0 
i took back my money and got outta there 0 
i ordered the voodoo pasta and it was the first time id had really excellent pasta since going gluten free several years ago 1 
food was delicious 1 
the characters were all funny and had the peculiarity of not having a true lead character 1 
also its a real treat to see anthony quinn playing crazy horse 1 
my experience was terrible this was my fourth bluetooth headset and while it was much more comfortable than my last jabra which i hated 0 
very good phone 1 
attempting artiness with black white and clever camera angles the movie disappointed became even more ridiculous as the acting was poor and the plot and lines almost nonexistent 0 
10 out of 10 for both the movie and trilogy 1 
it was just not a fun experience 1 
the real disappointment was our waiter 0 
like the other reviewer said you couldnt pay me to eat at this place again 0 
the black eyed peas and sweet potatoes unreal 1 
the bt headset was such a disapoinment 0 
the fact is this film is a wonderful heartwarming tale about two people chasing their dreams 1 
they have been around for years and carries the highest quality of antiglare screen protector that i have found to date 1 
the only thing i wasnt too crazy about was their guacamole as i dont like it puréed 0 
for that price i can think of a few place i would have much rather gone 0 
this is actually a very smart movie 1 
the concert sequences just sucked 0 
on a positive note our server was very attentive and provided great service 1 
the staff is great the food is delish and they have an incredible beer selection 1 
i dont know what the big deal is about this place but i wont be back yaall 0 
unfortunately the ability to actually know you are receiving a call is a rather important feature and this phone is pitiful in that respect 0 
pricing is a bit of a concern at mellow mushroom 0 
do not make the same mistake as me 0 
however the keypads are so tinny that i sometimes reach the wrong buttons 0 
i wasnt really impressed with strip steak 0 
the shower area is outside so you can only rinse not take a full shower unless you dont mind being nude for everyone to see 0 
the movie in movie situations in the beginning and through the game that is played with her by the acting coach are fascinating 1 
you wont be disappointed 1 
the acting sucks the music sucks the script sucks the pacing sucks the special fx suck the directing sucks basically this movie sucks 0 
see it with your kids if you have a chanceit will open up some amazing dialog about how far race relations have come in the last 50 years 1 
returned 8 hours later 0 
i wear glasses and it fits fine with them 1 
it is cheap and it feel and look just as cheap 0 
the voice recognition thru the handset is excellent 1 
however this didnt make up for the fact that overall this was a tremendously boring movie 0 
the restaurant is very clean and has a family restaurant feel to it 1 
the instructions didnt explain that a microphone jack could be used 0 
after i pulled up my car i waited for another 15 minutes before being acknowledged 0 
i am sorry i made this purchase 0 
people who like european films and art movies will like this movie 1 
these products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet 0 
i used bitpim a free program you can find on the internetto transfer data to the phonethe price of the cable was excellent 1 
great product for the price 1 
couldnt use the unit with sunglasses not good in texas 0 
it rocked my world and is certainly a must see for anyone with no social or physical outlets 1 
you get what you pay for i guess 0 
it is unusable in a moving car at freeway speed 0 
it isnt even an achievement as a sobaditsgood or sobaditsmemorable movie 0 
it was so bad i had lost the heart to finish it 0 
to be honest with you this is unbelievable nonsense and very foolish 0 
the best place in vegas for breakfast just check out a sat or sun 1 
great phone 1 
same problem as others have mentioned 0 
i dont know exactly what it is about this movie but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our familys memories 1 
see both films if you can 1 
not tasty and the texture was just nasty 0 
however the keypads are so tinny that i sometimes reach the wrong buttons 0 
the cast is good 1 
good value works fine power via usb car or wall outlet 1 
i am going to have to be the first to negatively review this product 0 
totally believable 1 
bt50 battery junk 0 
lastly the mozzarella sticks they were the best thing we ordered 1 
i would have casted her in that role after ready the script 1 
rating 1 out of 10 0 
and the accents are absolutely abysmal 0 
a good quality bargain i bought this after i bought a cheapy from big lots that sounded awful and people on the other end couldnt hear me 1 
this was one of the worst films i have ever seen 0 
so bad 0 
i highly recommend this movie for anyone interested in art poetry theater politics or japanese history 1 
i checked out this place a couple years ago and was not impressed 0 
it showed exactly how the government and the scientist argued for humanity and the reasons of the gadget 1 
after the disappointing dinner we went elsewhere for dessert 0 
very disappointed 0 
the cg opening sequence in space looked like it could have been created on microsoft slideshow for gods sake 0 
i would not recommend this place 0 
you get extra minutes so that you can carry out the call and not get cut off 1 
and it was boring 0 
piece of junk 0 
if you love authentic mexican food and want a whole bunch of interesting yet delicious meats to choose from you need to try this place 1 
logitech bluetooth headset is a 10 1 
but it is great i would really recommend it 1 
we wont be going back anytime soon 0 
server did a great job handling our large rowdy table 1 
even allowing for poor production values for the time 1971 and the format some kind of miniseries this is baaaaaad 0 
the jabra eargels fit my ears very well 1 
the entire audience applauded at the conclusion of the film 1 
jabra ear gels r the best 1 
you wont forget this movie 1 
the secondary plot line is incomprehensible and its relation to the primary plot line is mystifying 0 
woa talk about awful 0 
this place is not quality sushi it is not a quality restaurant 0 
if this premise sound stupid thats because it is 0 
unfortunately any virtue in this films production work was lost on a regrettable script 0 
very unreliable service from tmobile 0 
this if the first movie ive given a 10 to in years 1 
for the price this was a great deal 1 
at around 4 pm i bought it at around 8pm i started to watch at around 815pm i fast forwarded the remaining film to see if there was anything left watchable for a human being with a brain but there wasnt 0 
he came running after us when he realized my husband had left his sunglasses on the table 1 
nevertheless yet another wonderful film from the great masters stable 1 
simply beautiful 1 
however after seeing the short again after about 25 years i was amazed at how timeless the film actually is 1 
the story unfolds in 18th century jutland and the use of period music played on period instruments is just one more fine touch 1 
the puppets look really cheesy not in a good way like in the puppet master 80s flicks 0 
my fella got the huevos rancheros and they didnt look too appealing 0 
these are certainly very comfortable and functionality is decent 1 
a standout scene 1 
there are so many problems i dont know where to start 0 
the dialogue is composed of things that make little sense 0 
think it over when you plan to own this onethis sure is the last moto phone for me 0 
the explosion of the gas tanks at the end was just as awful 0 
i have always used corded headsets and the freedom from the wireless is very helpful 1 
its still wild stuff though and is highly recommended to fans of giallo cinema 1 
adapter does not provide enough charging current 0 
the igo chargers and tips are really great 1 
in my house i was getting dropped coverage upstairs and no coverage in my basement 0 
earbud piece breaks easily 0 
i used bitpim a free program you can find on the internetto transfer data to the phonethe price of the cable was excellent 1 
ive only had my bluetooth for a few weeks but i really like it 1 
piece of trash 0 
i think it was robert ryans best film because he portrayed someone like my father and he was a schizophrenic in real lifemy father although he never murdered anyone but was affected more so during the second world war which made him worse 1 
an awesome new look for fall 2000 1 
does not fit 0 
so there is no way for me to plug it in here in the us unless i go by a converter 0 
not loud enough and doesnt turn on like it should 0 
they have been around for years and carries the highest quality of antiglare screen protector that i have found to date 1 
this movie contained an allstar cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i havent seen before 1 
everything about this movie is stupid 0 
in fact im going to round up to 4 stars just because she was so awesome 1 
this product is clearly not ready for prime time i dont care how cool it looks if you cant tell a call is coming in its worthless 0 
as for the mains also uninspired 0 
i do not know if this was emilio estevezs directorial debut but the pacing the interplay and development of the characters as well as some clever camera work surrounding the character estevez plays all suggest a natural eye 1 
i liked it 1 
i know that sounds funny but to me it seemed like sketchy technology that wouldnt work wellwell this one works great 1 
i bought this to use with my kindle fire and absolutely loved it 1 
this movie is excellentangel is beautiful and scamp is adorablehis little yelps when hes scaredand the funniest parts are whenscamp is caught under the curtain and when angel and scamp are singing ive never had this feeling beforei totally recommend this movieits coming out on special edition on june 20the cover has scamp on a garbage can and angel underneath the lid 1 
so i had to take the battery out of the phone put it all back together and then restart it 0 
damian is so talented and versatile in so many ways of writing and portraying different characters on screen 1 
i had ordered a motorola data cable got a very well finished and working product 1 
we made the drive all the way from north scottsdale and i was not one bit disappointed 1 
the last 15 minutes of movie are also not bad as well 1 
the worst was the salmon sashimi 0 
doesnt hold charge 0 
but in terms of the writing its very fresh and bold 1 
even when the women finally show up there is no sign of improvement the most expected things happen and by the time the film is over you might be far asleep 0 
avoid at any and all costs 0 
the phone loads super 1 
i guess i liked the details of his dysfunctionhe was believable 1 
ive had this for nearly 2 years and it has worked great for me 1 
i have been very happy with the 510 and have had no complaints from any one regarding my sound quality on their end 1 
john wayne did an incredible job for being so young in the movie industry 1 
the noise shield is incrediable 1 
the reception is excellent 1 
for the price this was a great deal 1 
the movie lacks visual interest drama expression of feeling and celebration of the very patriotism that underlines the narrative 0 
i hate to disagree with my fellow yelpers but my husband and i were so disappointed with this place 0 
we were promptly greeted and seated 1 
so there is no way for me to plug it in here in the us unless i go by a converter 0 
great for ipods too 1 
the chains which im no fan of beat this place easily 0 
walked in and the place smelled like an old grease trap and only 2 others there eating 0 
the vegetables are so fresh and the sauce feels like authentic thai 1 
i hate writing bad reviews about films especially those in which i really like the star but this film is so bad i dont believe for one second that anyone could have been proud of it 0 
bt50 battery junk 0 
i dont like this nokia either 0 
this movie creates its own universe and is fascinating in every way 1 
the chicken dishes are ok the beef is like shoe leather 0 
would not go back 0 
the story line is totally predictable 0 
he also came back to check on us regularly excellent service 1 
i loved it it was really scary 1 
four stars for the food the guy in the blue shirt for his great vibe still letting us in to eat 1 
paolo sorrentino has written a wonderful story about loneliness and tony has built one of the most unforgettable characters seen in movies in recent years 1 
which are small and not worth the price 0 
stopped by during the late may bank holiday off rick steve recommendation and loved it 1 
which has more depth and character than the man underneath it 0 
dont bother go to the store 0 
i used bitpim a free program you can find on the internetto transfer data to the phonethe price of the cable was excellent 1 
mobile phone tools are a must have 1 
helen baxendale is a very credible lady macbeth who can be very cheerfull at times and sometimes she just looks like a naughty girl but deadly in her taste for blood and evil 1 
i have seen many movies starring jaclyn smith but my god this was one of her best though it came out 12 years ago 1 
never been to hard rock casino before will never ever step forward in it again 0 
what on earth is irons doing in this film 0 
the film succeeds despite or perhaps because of an obviously meagre budget 1 
these products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet 0 
if you love authentic mexican food and want a whole bunch of interesting yet delicious meats to choose from you need to try this place 1 
i will not be eating there again 0 
aailiyah was pretty good as akasha in places compelling her first entrance and mini dance scene 1 
he cant act one of the least scary villains i have ever seen he cant write did he write this damn movie in his sleep 0 
anyway the plot flowed smoothly and the malebonding scenes were a hoot 1 
the explosion of the gas tanks at the end was just as awful 0 
now i know that i made a wise decision 1 
the success of the film depends on the casting of sydney greenstreet as the alexander yardley character 1 
i could not stand to even watch it for very long for fear of losing iq 0 
the characters were all funny and had the peculiarity of not having a true lead character 1 
then as if i hadnt wasted enough of my life there they poured salt in the wound by drawing out the time it took to bring the check 0 
i own a jabra earset and was very happy with it but the sound quality especially outgoing on this is better 1 
this place deserves no stars 0 
first the bathrooms at this location were dirty seat covers were not replenished just plain yucky 0 
i bought two of them and neither will charge 0 
who in their right mind is gonna buy this battery 0 
its pretty surprising that this wonderful film was made in 1949 as hollywood generally had its collective heads in the sand concerning black and white issues at that time 1 
service stinks here 0 
its the one movie that never ceases to interest me simply because it keeps me alert as i try to attempt to decipher its meanings 1 
if you want healthy authentic or ethic food try this place 1 
the handsfree part works fine but then the car tries to download the address book and the treo rebootsoverall i still rate this device high 1 
i love this place 1 
the acting helps the writing along very well maybe the idiotsavant sister could have been played better and it is a real joy to watch 1 
it was attached to a gas station and that is rarely a good sign 0 
i gave it 5 stars then and im giving it 5 stars now 1 
all in all a great disappointment 0 
none of the three sizes they sent with the headset would stay in my ears 0 
the only suspense i was feeling was the frustration at just how retarded the girls were 0 
sound quality on both end is excellent i use headset to call my wife and ask my wife to use headset to call me 2 1 
we walked away stuffed and happy about our first vegas buffet experience 1 
the charger arrived within the promised timeframe but it did not work 0 
fantastic earphones 1 
the characters were all funny and had the peculiarity of not having a true lead character 1 
the acting is like watching wooden puppets moving around and reading from a book thats how bad it is 0 
it lasts less than 3o minutes if i actually try to use the phonemy wife has the same phone with the same problem 0 
its been my choice headset for yearsgreat sound good volume good noise cancellation 1 
easy to use 1 
im glad i found this product on amazon it is hard to find it wasnt high priced 1 
their rotating beers on tap is also a highlight of this place 1 
someone shouldve invented this sooner 1 
however paul schrader has indeed made a film about mishima that is both superb complex 1 
it has northern humour and positive about the community it represents 1 
only like 3 or 4 buildings used a couple of locations maybe poor hummh 0 
worst thai ever 0 
cant get the software to work with my computer 0 
i really hope the team behind this movie makes more movies and that they will continue to do so in their own some kinda weird style 1 
will definitely be back 1 
exceptionally bad 0 
this greedy corporation will never see another dime from me 0 
it defeats the purpose of a bluetooth headset 0 
plus it was wellpaced and suited its relatively short run time 1 
im not sure how long we stood there but it was long enough for me to begin to feel awkwardly out of place 0 
you learn a lot about the real inside emotions of people in this movie and a lot about the movie business itself 1 
i rate this movie 910 1 
the jamaican mojitos are delicious 1 
good item low price 1 
best breakfast buffet 1 
lots of holes in the script 0 
the story is also both funny and poignant at times 1 
spend your money and time some place else 0 
hayao miyazakis latest and eighth film for studio ghibili gake no ue no ponyo ponyo on the cliff by the sea is a wonderfully fun and imaginative look at childhood 1 
the plot such as it is is so derivative and predictable that the ending is like a mercy killing 0 
in fact this stinker smells like a directtovideo release 0 
what a waste of money and time 0 
i believe the screenwriter did a good job of tying up the loose ends 1 
this device is great in several situations1 1 
seriously killer hot chai latte 1 
if you want healthy authentic or ethic food try this place 1 
one character is totally annoying with a voice that gives me the feeling of fingernails on a chalkboard 0 
the service was terrible though 0 
amazon sucks 0 
i swung in to give them a try but was deeply disappointed 0 
the cast of veteran actors are more than just a nostalgia trip 1 
this place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver 0 
the worst sappiest dialogue i could go on and on 0 
but its just not funny 0 
i love this bluetooth 1 
they never brought a salad we asked for 0 
buttons are too small 0 
this is the phone to get for 2005 i just bought my s710a and all i can say is wow 1 
light weight i hardly notice it is there 1 
ive owned this phone for 7 months now and can say that its the best mobile phone ive had 1 
the best place to go for a tasty bowl of pho 1 
beware this is not a trashy cult movie this is trash period 0 
brilliance indeed 1 
i saw it as a child on tv back in 1973 when it was the stranger and i loved it 1 
the food was terrible 0 
i thoroughly enjoyed it when christopher eccleston took control of the tardis and the continuation of the series 1 
one character is totally annoying with a voice that gives me the feeling of fingernails on a chalkboard 0 
my phone doesnt slide around my car now and the grip prevents my phone from slipping out of my hand 1 
the films sole bright spot was jonah hill who will look almost unrecognizable to fans of the recent superbad due to the amount of weight he lost in the interim 1 
john garfield ann revere lilli plmer william conrad canada leeand filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screenjames wong howe 1 
we sat another ten minutes and finally gave up and left 0 
the server was very negligent of our needs and made us feel very unwelcome i would not suggest this place 0 
my husband and i ate lunch here and were very disappointed with the food and service 0 
and his subtle connections between the three films are awesome 1 
a disappointment 0 
this is an excellent tool especially when paired with your phones autoanswer 1 
which is precisely why i am giving it such a bad review 0 
the charger worked for about a week and then completely stopped charging my phone 0 
great choice 1 
its like a bad two hour tv movie 0 
a very charming film with wonderful sentiment and heart 1 
this movie was kind of long in length but i enjoyed every minute of it 1 
bad quality 0 
what a mistake 0 
the transfers are very good 1 
i recently tried caballeros and i have been back every week since 1 
the cast is good 1 
the staff are great the ambiance is great 1 
voice recognition is tremendous 1 
comfortable nice range good battery life 1 
i guess that nobody at the network that aired this dribble watched it before putting it on 0 
these headphones were a great find and i think they are perhaps the best purchase ive made in the last several years seriously 1 
not good enough for the price 0 
steve martin delivers a really funny performance of a middleaged upper class uptight white guy 1 
just does not work 0 
one of the most disappointing aspects is the lack of notable gore 0 
to sum the film up breeders is a terrible cheaply made horror movie that should be avoided like the ebola virus 0 
this is one of the best italian thrillers of the early 70s 1 
service was very prompt 1 
probably never coming back and wouldnt recommend it 0 
the most annoying thing about cover girl is the way in which rita hayworth is put up on a pedestal 0 
this is a witty and delightful adaptation of the dr seuss book brilliantly animated by upas finest and thoroughly deserving of its academy award 1 
artless camerawork endlessly presents us with the ugliest setting imaginable ie 0 
we have tried 2 units and they both failed within 2 months pros 0 
sending it back 0 
if i take a picture the battery drops a bar and starts beeping letting me know its dieing 0 
the seasonal fruit was fresh white peach puree 1 
i guess that nobody at the network that aired this dribble watched it before putting it on 0 
i can say that the desserts were yummy 1 
product is useless since it does not have enough charging current to charge the 2 cellphones i was planning to use it with 0 
the movie seemed a little slow at first 0 
the basic premise is wasted since it is sidelined by the inexplicable focus on the documentary crew 0 
bt50 battery junk 0 
it is simple to use and i like it 1 
tied to charger for conversations lasting more than 45 minutesmajor problems 0 
i hate writing bad reviews about films especially those in which i really like the star but this film is so bad i dont believe for one second that anyone could have been proud of it 0 
the biggest complaint i have is the battery drains superfast 0 
ive dropped my phone more times than i can say even on concrete and my phone is still great knock on wood 1 
you have to hold the phone at a particular angle for the other party to hear you clearly 0 
the cast was great 1 
it was quite comfortable in the ear 1 
i do love sushi but i found kabuki to be overpriced overhip and underservices 0 
it definitely was not as good as my s11 1 
this was a poor remake of my best friends wedding 0 
i did not have any problem with this item and would order it again if needed 1 
as many people complained i found this headsets microphone was very weak 0 
the service was poor and thats being nice 0 
the fish is badly made and some of its underwater shots are repeated a thousand times in the film 0 
avoid at all costs 0 
the things that the four kids get themselves into is absolutely hilarious to watch 1 
i have purchased these for both family and friends and all enjoy their clarity and ease of use 1 
hell no will i go back 0 
excellent cast story line performances 1 
but if you liked movies like the matrix and better yet their sequels i think youll appreciate the thought provoking mindblowing experience this film will give you 1 
the movie lacks visual interest drama expression of feeling and celebration of the very patriotism that underlines the narrative 0 
despite the pans of reviewers i liked this movie 1 
very slow at seating even with reservation 0 
exactly what i wanted 1 
i can take a little bad service but the food sucks 0 
but i dont like it 0 
unfortunately it did not work 0 
this item is fantastic and works perfectly 1 
i love the ringtones because they are so upbeat 1 
but storm trooper is not even bad enough to make it to the list of wonderfully terrible movies 0 
ive had this bluetoooth headset for some time now and still not comfortable with the way it fits on the ear 0 
im really disappointed all i have now is a charger that doesnt work 0 
i really do recommend this place you can go wrong with this donut place 1 
now we were chosen to be tortured with this disgusting piece of blatant american propaganda 0 
the pan cakes everyone are raving about taste like a sugary disaster tailored to the palate of a six year old 0 
the pizza selections are good 1 
it felt too light and tinny 0 
very good lunch spot 1 
service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is vegas and located inside the crystals shopping mall by aria 1 
not loud enough and doesnt turn on like it should 0 
worked very well paired with a treo 700w and as a skype headset on my pc using a usb bluetooth transceiver 1 
now i know that i made a wise decision 1 
considering the relations off screen between taylor and stanwyck it was surprising how little chemistry there was on screen between the two of them 0 
the music in the film is really nice too 1 
the best part about nurse betty is its unpredictability 1 
i have eaten here multiple times and each time the food was delicious 1 
i really like this product over the motorola because it is allot clearer on the ear piece and the mic 1 
its fits like a glove and is strong secure and durable 1 
terrible my car will not accept this cassette 0 
the film succeeds despite or perhaps because of an obviously meagre budget 1 
perhaps my phone is defective but people cannot hear me when i use this 0 
john wayne did an incredible job for being so young in the movie industry 1 
avoid this film at all costs 0 
ive bought 5 wired headphones that sound better than these 0 
the best phone in market 1 
if you want a real scare rent this one 1 
none of it works just dont buy it 0 
the text messaging feature is really tricky to use 0 
this place is like chipotle but better 1 
the loudspeaker option is great the bumpers with the lights is very appealing 0 
any ring toneoverall good phone to buy 1 
the service was terrible food was mediocre 0 
the service was meh 0 
thanks good a movie like this was done and released 1 
we walked away stuffed and happy about our first vegas buffet experience 1 
used and dirty 0 
so flavorful and has just the perfect amount of heat 1 
im really disappointed all i have now is a charger that doesnt work 0 
you can find better movies at youtube 0 
of course the acting is blah 0 
the story is lame not interesting and never really explains the sinister origins of the puppets 0 
absolutely great 1 
no one at the table thought the food was above average or worth the wait that we had for it 0 
in addition it feels amp looks as if the phone is all lightweight cheap plastic 0 
everyone is treated equally special 1 
my wife had the lobster bisque soup which was lukewarm 0 
the bt headset was such a disapoinment 0 
works great 1 
for 40 bucks a head i really expect better food 0 
the food is not tasty at all not to say its real traditional hunan style 0 
after a year the battery went completely dead on my headset 0 
im probably one of the few people to ever go to ians and not like it 0 
the service was terrible though 0 
i do not know if this was emilio estevezs directorial debut but the pacing the interplay and development of the characters as well as some clever camera work surrounding the character estevez plays all suggest a natural eye 1 
it didnt make me scared horrified or make me sympathetic towards the characters it was simply annoying 0 
there was no chemistry between ben affleck and sandra bullock in this film and i couldnt understand why he would consider even leaving his wifetobe for this chick that he supposedly was knocked out by 0 
bt50 battery junk 0 
almost all of the songs in cover girl are oldfashioned and not very tuneful 0 
i went on motorolas website and followed all directions but could not get it to pair again 0 
we got sitting fairly fast but ended up waiting 40 minutes just to place our order another 30 minutes before the food arrived 0 
thats how id describe this painfully dreary timewaster of a film 0 
waited and waited and waited 0 
great audio 1 
the fact is this film is a wonderful heartwarming tale about two people chasing their dreams 1 
he cant act one of the least scary villains i have ever seen he cant write did he write this damn movie in his sleep 0 
this product is great it makes working a lot easier i can go to the copier while waiting on hold for something 1 
for that price i can think of a few place i would have much rather gone 0 
also notable is john baileys fine crisp beautifully colored cinematography and the great production design costumes by eiko ishioka who went on to do the memorable costumes for coppolas dracula for which she received a well deserved oscar 1 
i advise everyone do not be fooled 0 
nice quality build unlike some cheap s out there 1 
service was very prompt 1 
even if you love bad movies do not watch this movie 0 
their monster chicken fried steak and eggs is my all time favorite 1 
i have been very happy with the 510 and have had no complaints from any one regarding my sound quality on their end 1 
has been working great 1 
i also didnt like the on button it felt like it would crack with use 0 
unreliable im giving up 0 
i will come back here every time im in vegas 1 
there are many continuity errors one other user commented on different cars in the garage joes glassesthe one that got to me the most was the fact joes facial hair configuration seemed to change from scene to scene 0 
i had to wait over 30 minutes to get my drink and longer to get 2 arepas 0 
voice quality signal strength dropped calls 0 
i love this place 1 
it was just too horrible 0 
110 and only because there is no setting for 010 0 
the place was fairly clean but the food simply wasnt worth it 0 
the greek dressing was very creamy and flavorful 1 
i didnt want the clip going over the top of my ear causing discomfort 0 
it holds a charge for a long time is reasonably comfortable under longwearing conditions and the quality of sound is tremendous 1 
then scene where they debated whether or not to sack the trumpeter who falsely was accused for the murder is pure horror really stupid 0 
i received my headset in good time and was happy with it 1 
its just adorable seeing mickey playing turkey in the straw in a highly imaginative if occasionally cruel way 1 
we wont be going back 0 
this is definitely a cult classic well worth viewing and sharing with others 1 
it is just the sort of pap that is screened in the afternoon to punish the unemployed for not having jobs 0 
i will never go back to this place and will never ever recommended this place to anyone 0 
its aggravating 0 
tied to charger for conversations lasting more than 45 minutesmajor problems 0 
i love the camera its really pretty good quality 1 
aside from its terrible lead this film has loads of other debits 0 
the feel of the dining room was more college cooking course than high class dining and the service was slow at best 0 
this is probably one of the least effective and utterly unoriginal films i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
every time he opened his mouth you expect to hear you see kids pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show 0 
bluetooth range is good a few days ago i left my phone in the trunk got a call and carried the conversation without a hitch 1 
lame would be the best way to describe it 0 
i wont say any more i dont like spoilers so i dont want to be one but i believe this film is worth your time 1 
personally i think it shows that people should learn to find a compromise them self without involving other people into issue 1 
exactly what i wanted 1 
it feels poorly constructed the menus are difficult to navigate and the buttons are so recessed that it is difficult to push them 0 
im not impressed with the concept or the food 0 
her lines seem to have been written by a fifteen year old though they are trying oh so so hard to sound like how a fifteen year old would really um you know well talk 0 
level 5 spicy was perfect where spice didnt overwhelm the soup 1 
i had about two bites and refused to eat anymore 0 
by this time our side of the restaurant was almost empty so there was no excuse 0 
a fantastic neighborhood gem 1 
great choice 1 
this frog phone charm is adorable and very eye catching 1 
i was able to do voice dialing in the car with no problem 1 
the fries were great too 1 
very prompt service 1 
it did not work in my cell phone plug i am very up set with the charger 0 
i would recommend this 1 
i like design and look of jabra behing the ear headsets and 5020 is pretty comfortible to wear 24 hours a day without pain in the ear 1 
for those that havent seen it dont waste your time 0 
i just dont know how this place managed to served the blandest food i have ever eaten when they are preparing indian cuisine 0 
however the ear pads come off easily and after only one week i lost one 0 
its one of the most boring horror movies from the 90s mainly because it starts slow and centers in a boring atmosphere 0 
the nachos are a must have 1 
maybe if they werent cold they would have been somewhat edible 0 
overall i am psyched to have a phone which has all my appointments and contacts in and gets great reception 1 
rating 010 grade z note the show is so bad that even mother of the cast pull her daughter out of the show 0 
in summary this was a largely disappointing dining experience 0 
this film has no redeeming features 0 
do not waste your money here 0 
highly recommend for any one who has a blue tooth phone 1 
nice ambiance 1 
if you have not seen this movie i definitely recommend it 1 
great character actors telly savalas and peter boyle 1 
unfortunately the ability to actually know you are receiving a call is a rather important feature and this phone is pitiful in that respect 0 
i thought errol flynn was brilliant as custer and has since become my favourite actor 1 
the only very disappointing thing was there was no speakerphone 0 
there was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth but it didnt really work into the rest of the plot 0 
the handsfree part works fine but then the car tries to download the address book and the treo rebootsoverall i still rate this device high 1 
everything about this film is simply incredible 1 
oh and i forgot to also mention the weird color effect it has on your phone 0 
very very disappointed ordered the 35 big bay plater 0 
if you havent choked in your own vomit by the end by all the cheap drama and worthless dialogue youve must have bored yourself to death with this waste of time 0 
the pairing of the two devices was so easy it barely took a couple minutes before i started making calls with the voice dialing feature 1 
couldnt ask for a more satisfying meal 1 
people who like european films and art movies will like this movie 1 
after trying many many handsfree gadgets this is the one that finally works well 1 
the server was very negligent of our needs and made us feel very unwelcome i would not suggest this place 0 
so just beware 0 
you could drive a semi truck into these holes 0 
good case excellent value 1 
i dont know exactly what it is about this movie but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our familys memories 1 
the phone loads super 1 
this is a masterful piece of filmmaking with many themes simmering and occasionally boiling over in this warts and all study of the poets bohemian selfindulgent wartime years that span the aerial bombardments of london and the outward tranquillity of a welsh coastal retreat the borderlines between friendship lust and love dedication to art and experience versus practical concerns jealousy rivalry cowardice and egotism versus heroism and selfsacrifice and more 1 
do not buy do not buyit sucks 0 
delicious 1 
give this one a look 1 
you have to hold the phone at a particular angle for the other party to hear you clearly 0 
honeslty it didnt taste that fresh 0 
i have to mention this and it is a huge spoiler i loved the ending how all the characters of the three films were the remaining survivors of the ferry disaster with valentine and the young judge together and the old man watching it on her tv solidifying his happiness over the suffering which he dealt with for those many years 1 
the han nan chicken was also very tasty 1 
wed definitely go back here again 1 
one thing i hate is the mode set button at the side 0 
dont waste your time 0 
i really dont see how anyone could enjoy this movie 0 
we are sending it back 0 
seriously its not worth wasting your or your kids time on 0 
totally believable 1 
the stories were as unbelievable as the actors 0 
then the film just dropped the ball 0 
very good stuff for the price 1 
why was this film made 0 
this one wants to surf on the small wave of space movies in 1998 deep impact and armageddon and this one fails everywhere 0 
i really recommend this faceplates since it looks very nice elegant and cool 1 
my husband and i ate lunch here and were very disappointed with the food and service 0 
it ranks highly as a great noircrimedrama incredible performances by belmondo and lino ventura 1 
which has more depth and character than the man underneath it 0 
then our food came out disappointment ensued 0 
lately they have been extremely nice and helpful on the phone 1 
the movie had you on the edge of your seat and made you somewhat afraid to go to your car at the end of the night 1 
i highly recommend this case 1 
its just painful 0 
do not buy do not buyit sucks 0 
however i recently watched the whole thing again on dvd and i was completely struck by how extremely stupid the storyline was how it contained holes inconsistencies and frankly a whole lot of crap and how horrid the dancing was 0 
i kept catching the cable on the seat and i had to pull the phone out to turn it on an off 0 
during several different 2 minute calls i experienced 5 drops and it was in an area that had 5 bars 0 
the meat was pretty dry i had the sliced brisket and pulled pork 0 
this movie is excellentangel is beautiful and scamp is adorablehis little yelps when hes scaredand the funniest parts are whenscamp is caught under the curtain and when angel and scamp are singing ive never had this feeling beforei totally recommend this movieits coming out on special edition on june 20the cover has scamp on a garbage can and angel underneath the lid 1 
filmiing was less expansive 0 
his use of the colours of the french flag in the three films was nothing short of incredible every shot every scene was like a work of art 1 
worst martini ever 0 
no ear loop needed its tiny and the sound is great 1 
i cannot make calls at certain places 0 
the cashew cream sauce was bland and the vegetables were undercooked 0 
the only good thing was our waiter he was very helpful and kept the bloddy marys coming 1 
i have to mention this and it is a huge spoiler i loved the ending how all the characters of the three films were the remaining survivors of the ferry disaster with valentine and the young judge together and the old man watching it on her tv solidifying his happiness over the suffering which he dealt with for those many years 1 
i dont have very many words to say about this place but it does everything pretty well 1 
will never ever go back and have told many people what had happened 0 
the charger arrived within the promised timeframe but it did not work 0 
great earpiece 1 
they will customize your order any way youd like my usual is eggplant with green bean stir fry love it 1 
wont work right or atleast for me 0 
it plays louder than any other speaker of this size the price is so low that most would think the quality is lacking however its not 1 
this is a very average phone with bad battery life that operates on a weak network 0 
do not buy do not buyit sucks 0 
see it with your kids if you have a chanceit will open up some amazing dialog about how far race relations have come in the last 50 years 1 
now the burgers arent as good the pizza which used to be amazing is doughy and flavorless 0 
its like a really sexy party in your mouth where youre outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party 1 
nothing special 0 
not worth it 0 
my boyfriend tried the mediterranean chicken salad and fell in love 1 
ive had this bluetoooth headset for some time now and still not comfortable with the way it fits on the ear 0 
their steaks are 100 recommended 1 
i had to wait over 30 minutes to get my drink and longer to get 2 arepas 0 
mobile phone tools are a must have 1 
bad script bad direction and horrible acting make this one plain bad 0 
all this movie does is make you sick watching all these slackers make excuses for their stupid actions for 90 minutes 0 
my boyfriend and i sat at the bar and had a completely delightful experience 1 
still i do like this movie for its empowerment of women theres not enough movies out there like this one 1 
battery is terrible 0 
razr battery good buy 1 
items stated as included from the description are not included 0 
i kept catching the cable on the seat and i had to pull the phone out to turn it on an off 0 
wed definitely go back here again 1 
it fits my ear well and is comfortable on 1 
best headset ever 1 
beware this is not a trashy cult movie this is trash period 0 
a great film by a great director 1 
the price is reasonable and the service is great 1 
i wasnt really impressed with strip steak 0 
but in any case the best part is you can download these pictures to your laptop using ir or even send pictures from your laptop to the phone 1 
and considering the two of us left there very full and happy for about 20 you just cant go wrong 1 
brilliance indeed 1 
i love my 350 headset my jabra350 bluetooth headset is great the reception is very good and the ear piece is a comfortable fit 1 
it is perfect for a sitdown family meal or get together with a few friends 1 
i just cant explain this movie more than romanticcharminghilariousand adorablethe junkyard scenes are funnyall the junkyard dogs have something specialtoo funny i laughedkids will love itbuy it when it comes outit has new features 1 
both do good jobs and are quite amusing 1 
i have been to very few places to eat that under no circumstances would i ever return to and this tops the list 0 
it sure does beat the nachos at the movies but i would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant 0 
they are so cool 1 
i took back my money and got outta there 0 
same evening him and i are both drastically sick 0 
the ending is so so perfect youll shed a tear 1 
i have yet to run this new battery below two bars and thats three days without charging 1 
i have to mention this and it is a huge spoiler i loved the ending how all the characters of the three films were the remaining survivors of the ferry disaster with valentine and the young judge together and the old man watching it on her tv solidifying his happiness over the suffering which he dealt with for those many years 1 
when i received my pita it was huge it did have a lot of meat in it so thumbs up there 1 
this battery is an excellent bargain 1 
the awful dialogue and hopeless overacting by everyone who gets shot top off a real waste of space and time 0 
i only hear garbage for audio 0 
it sure does beat the nachos at the movies but i would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant 0 
you need two hands to operate the screenthis software interface is decade old and cannot compete with new software designs 0 
the dialogue sucked 0 
setup went very smoothly 1 
i must say i have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again 1 
the problem was the script 0 
a very charming film with wonderful sentiment and heart 1 
i would recommend it 1 
i am far from a sushi connoisseur but i can definitely tell the difference between good food and bad food and this was certainly bad food 0 
cant say enough good things about this place 1 
works well 1 
this is just a great movie 1 
cant say enough good things about this place 1 
i will continue to come here on ladies night andddd date night highly recommend this place to anyone who is in the area 1 
and there wasnt a single sour note struck actingwise either some surprisingly solid casting here 1 
doesnt work 0 
i think the most wonderful parts literally full of wonder are the excerpts from his works 1 
the staff are great the ambiance is great 1 
the movie is not completely perfect but titta di girolamo will stay with you for a long time after the vision of the movie 1 
the ripped banana was not only ripped but petrified and tasteless 0 
is pretty funny 1 
the lines the cuts the audio everything is wrong 0 
really bad 0 
no im going to eat the potato that i found some strangers hair in it 0 
it is perfect for a sitdown family meal or get together with a few friends 1 
their rotating beers on tap is also a highlight of this place 1 
i used bitpim a free program you can find on the internetto transfer data to the phonethe price of the cable was excellent 1 
the script is was there a script 0 
fantastic earphones 1 
it was a very superficial movie and it gave me the feeling that i was watching play rather than a film 0 
comes with a strong light that you can use to light up your camera shots and even flash sos signals seriously 1 
penne vodka excellent 1 
unfortunately cover girl is an example of how hollywood used to exploit women for financial gain 0 
this is probably the most irritating show i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
the food was terrible 0 
we wont be going back anytime soon 0 
you can find better movies at youtube 0 
best tacos in town by far 1 
its too bad that everyone else involved didnt share crowes level of dedication to quality for if they did wed have a far better film on our hands than this subpar mess 0 
this blueant supertooth handsfree phone speaker is awesome 1 
tom wilkinson broke my heart at the end and everyone elses judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike 1 
its kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly its embarrassing how childlike the company is 0 
just really good so far probably the best bt headset i have ever had 1 
the script is bad very bad  it contains both cheesiness and unethical joke that you normally see in rated r or nc17 movie 0 
i had to wait over 30 minutes to get my drink and longer to get 2 arepas 0 
i checked out this place a couple years ago and was not impressed 0 
summary the witticisms werent witty 0 
the foreigner is not worth one second of your time 0 
my salad had a bland vinegrette on the baby greens and hearts of palm 0 
better than expected 1 
this blueant supertooth handsfree phone speaker is awesome 1 
it is not good 0 
this place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver 0 
first off the reception sucks i have never had more than 2 bars ever 0 
the pancake was also really good and pretty large at that 1 
it was forced like everything in this movie 0 
i was amazed at the quick arrival of the two original lg cell phone batteries and and at a fraction of the price 1 
ive missed numerous calls because of this reason 0 
i must say i have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again 1 
2 times very bad customer service 0 
not even good for camp value 0 
fans of the genre will be in heaven 1 
an extensive menu provides lots of options for breakfast 1 
there are the usual hitchcock logic flaws 0 
your staff spends more time talking to themselves than me 0 
i got to enjoy the seafood salad with a fabulous vinegrette 1 
this game rocks 1 
the cinematographyif it can be called thatsucked 0 
but what really made it unwatchable was the direction 0 
i just cant explain this movie more than romanticcharminghilariousand adorablethe junkyard scenes are funnyall the junkyard dogs have something specialtoo funny i laughedkids will love itbuy it when it comes outit has new features 1 
so i am here to warn youdo not rent this movie it is the dumbest thing you have never seen 0 
id say that would be the hardest decision honestly all of ms dishes taste how they are supposed to taste amazing 1 
i love being able to use one headset for both by landline and cell 1 
the entire audience applauded at the conclusion of the film 1 
i did not expect this to be so good 1 
but above all the exquisite visual composition of each moment with inventive and elegant use of closeup camera angle and lighting including pointillistic faux home movie footage is a wonder and joy to behold 1 
not loud enough and doesnt turn on like it should 0 
as many people complained i found this headsets microphone was very weak 0 
very slow at seating even with reservation 0 
this film tries to be a serious and sophisticated thrillerhorror flick and it fails miserably 0 
the staff was very attentive 1 
i thought errol flynn was brilliant as custer and has since become my favourite actor 1 
really ugly 0 
i really wanted the plantronics 510 to be the right one but it has too many issues for methe good 0 
never got it 0 
i have 23 bars on my cell phone when i am home but you cant not hear anything 0 
dont waste your time watching this rubbish nonresearched film 0 
ill give this film 10 out of 10 1 
used and dirty 0 
exceptionally bad 0 
just dont know why they were so slow 0 
as many people complained i found this headsets microphone was very weak 0 
for that price i can think of a few place i would have much rather gone 0 
this is the kind of money that is wasted properly 1 
the foreigner is not worth one second of your time 0 
however bt headsets are currently not good for real time games like firstperson shooters since the audio delay messes me up 0 
i love the camera its really pretty good quality 1 
in the summer you can dine in a charming outdoor patio so very delightful 1 
i am glad i purchased it 1 
disappointment i hate anything that goes in my ear 0 
i never come again 0 
there are many continuity errors one other user commented on different cars in the garage joes glassesthe one that got to me the most was the fact joes facial hair configuration seemed to change from scene to scene 0 
steamboat willie is an amazingly important film to our cinema history 1 
excellent 1 
not only did the software do a great job of this i could also make my own ringtones form my existing cds without an internet connection 1 
tonight i had the elk filet specialand it sucked 0 
it was so bad i had lost the heart to finish it 0 
an awesome new look for fall 2000 1 
i dont recommend unless your car breaks down in front of it and you are starving 0 
it presents a idyllic yet serious portrayal of the ups and downs of the characters lives 1 
well never go again 0 
i got to enjoy the seafood salad with a fabulous vinegrette 1 
freezes frequently4 0 
i dont have to be an accountant to know im getting screwed 0 
not as good as i had hoped 0 
this movie suffered because of the writing it needed more suspense 0 
the movie seemed a little slow at first 0 
were jerks on the phone 0 
it looses connection to the phone even when it is within a couple feet between the two 0 
the macarons here are insanely good 1 
this really is how vegas fine dining used to be right down to the menus handed to the ladies that have no prices listed 1 
better than expected 1 
this was such an awesome movie that i bought it off of ebay 1 
best fish ive ever had in my life 1 
but it is great i would really recommend it 1 
i believe that pitch black was done well 1 
items stated as included from the description are not included 0 
the problem i have is that they charge 1199 for a sandwich that is no bigger than a subway sub which offers better and more amount of vegetables 0 
things happen characters personalities change plot twists occur for no real reason other than that script calls for it 0 
nothing new there 0 
i struggle to find anything bad to say about it 1 
its reception is very very poor 0 
the death row scenes were entirely unmoving 0 
my friend loved the salmon tartar 1 
we literally sat there for 20 minutes with no one asking to take our order 0 
i like steiners because its dark and it feels like a bar 1 
one of the most disappointing aspects is the lack of notable gore 0 
overall i like this place a lot 1 
happy so far 1 
id say that would be the hardest decision honestly all of ms dishes taste how they are supposed to taste amazing 1 
cumbersome design 0 
there was a warm feeling with the service and i felt like their guest for a special treat 1 
seriously its not worth wasting your or your kids time on 0 
all in all an excellent restaurant highlighted by great service a unique menu and a beautiful setting 1 
brilliance indeed 1 
i also decided not to send it back because our waitress looked like she was on the verge of having a heart attack 0 
if youre not familiar check it out 1 
delicious 1 
started watching this but didnt believe in any of the characters 0 
very serious spoilers this movie was a huge disappointment 0 
this movie contained an allstar cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i havent seen before 1 
i do think tom hanks is a good actor 1 
this film and i use that word loosely is an insult to the moviegoing public 0 
the structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema 1 
the directing and the cinematography arent quite as good 0 
i got to enjoy the seafood salad with a fabulous vinegrette 1 
im not eating here 0 
also if your phone is dropped this case is not going to save it specially when dropped face down 0 
be sure to order dessert even if you need to pack it togo the tiramisu and cannoli are both to die for 1 
theres barely a boring moment in the film and there are plenty of humorous parts 1 
what a great double cheeseburger 1 
horrible 0 
good beer drink selection and good food selection 1 
very comfortable 1 
very unreliable service from tmobile 0 
say bye bye to your tip lady 0 
the food is good 1 
so absolutley fantastic 1 
setup couldnt have been simpler 1 
they dropped more than the ball 0 
greatno problems at all 1 
very very fun chef 1 
terrible my car will not accept this cassette 0 
its a campy sort of film thats a joy to watch 1 
hence the whole story lacks a certain energy 0 
after all the rave reviews i couldnt wait to eat herewhat a disappointment 0 
loved itfriendly servers great food wonderful and imaginative menu 1 
i believe that this place is a great stop for those with a huge belly and hankering for sushi 1 
problem is that the ear loops are made of weak material and break easily 0 
we had so much to say about the place before we walked in that he expected it to be amazing but was quickly disappointed 0 
timely shipment and quality product 1 
my ribeye steak was cooked perfectly and had great mesquite flavor 1 
the acting was decidely wooden though no worse than a period universal b movie 0 
the warm beer didnt help 0 
if you love authentic mexican food and want a whole bunch of interesting yet delicious meats to choose from you need to try this place 1 
after i pulled up my car i waited for another 15 minutes before being acknowledged 0 
there is nothing privileged about workingeating there 0 
everything captain howdy says is either laughable or just plain stupid 0 
there is no plot here to keep you going in the first place 0 
we sat another ten minutes and finally gave up and left 0 
it definitely was not as good as my s11 1 
so bad 0 
i contacted the company and they told me that although the unit was still under warranty if i couldnt produce my receipt i was out of luck 0 
ill put this gem up against any movie in terms of screenplay cinematography acting postproduction editing directing or any other aspect of filmmaking 1 
reception is terrible and full of static 0 
great product for the price 1 
the jerky camera movements were also annoying 0 
an hour seriously 0 
i love my 350 headset my jabra350 bluetooth headset is great the reception is very good and the ear piece is a comfortable fit 1 
hated it 0 
we were promptly greeted and seated 1 
i would not recommend this place 0 
anyways the food was definitely not filling at all and for the price you pay you should expect more 0 
otherwise easy to install and use clear sound 1 
then our food came out disappointment ensued 0 
the worst phone ive ever had only had it for a few months 0 
earbud piece breaks easily 0 
great product for the price 1 
the most annoying thing about cover girl is the way in which rita hayworth is put up on a pedestal 0 
will not be back 0 
very true to shakespear and a must for all shakespear fans 1 
i enjoyed it 1 
very good quality though 1 
the steak and the shrimp are in my opinion the best entrees at gc 1 
piece of trash 0 
great brunch spot 1 
poor product 0 
the only downside is the service 0 
good item low price 1 
total waste of time 0 
terrible product and waste of money 0 
it features an outlandish array of memorable psychotic but lovable nuts 1 
keep up the good work amazon 1 
the live music on fridays totally blows 0 
this isnt a small family restaurant this is a fine dining establishment 1 
think of the film being like a dream 1 
very disappointed in accessoryone 0 
i wont be back 0 
light weight i hardly notice it is there 1 
to those who find this movie intelligent or even masterful i can only say its your intelligence and your imagination you obviously used to try and make some sense of this pitiful attempt its in our human nature to try and make sense of things 0 
the construction of the headsets is poor 0 
terrible management 0 
the folks at otto always make us feel so welcome and special 1 
do not waste your time 0 
not recommended 0 
i have always used corded headsets and the freedom from the wireless is very helpful 1 
problem is that the ear loops are made of weak material and break easily 0 
the potatoes were great and so was the biscuit 1 
really good product 1 
then i exchanged for the same phone even that had the same problem 0 
and the beans and rice were mediocre at best 0 
im not impressed with the concept or the food 0 
i will never go back to this place and will never ever recommended this place to anyone 0 
one character is totally annoying with a voice that gives me the feeling of fingernails on a chalkboard 0 
the best phone in market 1 
sooooo good 1 
their frozen margaritas are way too sugary for my taste 0 
i love my 350 headset my jabra350 bluetooth headset is great the reception is very good and the ear piece is a comfortable fit 1 
i highly recommend these and encourage people to give them a try 1 
o my gosh the best phone i have ever had 1 
wow very spicy but delicious 1 
what a piece of junk i lose more calls on this phone 0 
doesnt do the job 0 
i cannot believe that the actors agreed to do this film 0 
this place is way too overpriced for mediocre food 0 
this blueant supertooth handsfree phone speaker is awesome 1 
its welldesigned and very sharp the blue is a very nice color 1 
think of the film being like a dream 1 
a truly truly bad film 0 
i wont be back 0 
when achille and philippa beautifully sing a duet from don giovanni that perfectly describes their situation in the movie you appreciate the subtle layers of this excellent film 1 
the only thing i wasnt too crazy about was their guacamole as i dont like it puréed 0 
i hate writing bad reviews about films especially those in which i really like the star but this film is so bad i dont believe for one second that anyone could have been proud of it 0 
the greek dressing was very creamy and flavorful 1 
the service was outshining i definitely recommend the halibut 1 
you will leave the theater wanting to go out and dance under the stars 1 
i kept looking at the time and it had soon become 35 minutes yet still no food 0 
i especially liked the noncliche choices with the parents in other movies i could predict the dialog verbatim but the writing in this movie made better selections 1 
cinematography the film was shot in an interesting way 1 
nobody identifies with these characters because theyre all cardboard cutouts and stereotypes or predictably reversestereotypes 0 
also its a real treat to see anthony quinn playing crazy horse 1 
i just saw this film and i recommend it 1 
crostini that came with the salad was stale 0 
its aggravating 0 
i didnt know pulled pork could be soooo delicious 1 
i found the product to be easy to set up and use 1 
it was a riot to see hugo weaving play a sexobsessed gay real estate salesman who uses his clients houses for his trysts with the flaming darren tom hollander 1 
the pancake was also really good and pretty large at that 1 
this pair of headphones is the worst that i have ever had soundwise 0 
kind of flops around 0 
i was seated immediately 1 
so good i am going to have to review this place twice once hereas a tribute to the place and once as a tribute to an event held here last night 1 
so i bought about 10 of these and saved alot of money 1 
not worth it 0 
best service and food ever maria our server was so good and friendly she made our day 1 
kind of hard to mess up a steak but they did 0 
server did a great job handling our large rowdy table 1 
often the dialogue doesnt really follow from one line to another or fit the surroundings 0 
this movie suffered because of the writing it needed more suspense 0 
of course the footage from the 70s was grainy but that only enhanced the film 1 
blue ant is easy to use 1 
i only hear garbage for audio 0 
i advise you to look out for it 1 
this place is like chipotle but better 1 
gotta love those closeups of slimy drooling teeth 1 
however paul schrader has indeed made a film about mishima that is both superb complex 1 
kris kristoffersen is good in this movie and really makes a difference 1 
the ripped banana was not only ripped but petrified and tasteless 0 
very very fun chef 1 
so i had to take the battery out of the phone put it all back together and then restart it 0 
after one bite i was hooked 1 
voice recognition is tremendous 1 
weird vibe from owners 0 
i was amazed at the quick arrival of the two original lg cell phone batteries and and at a fraction of the price 1 
i probably would not go here again 0 
i have 23 bars on my cell phone when i am home but you cant not hear anything 0 
if you are looking for a good quality motorola headset keep looking this isnt it 0 
it doesnt make you look cool 0 
i probably would not go here again 0 
sam shepards portrayal of a gung ho marine was sobering 1 
not impressed 0 
this was a different cut than the piece the other day but still wonderful and tender s well as well flavored 1 
the screen size is big key pad lit well enough and the camera quality is excellent for a camera phone 1 
what a waste 0 
the soundtrack wasnt terrible either 1 
we waited for forty five minutes in vain 0 
so they performed 1 
graphics is far from the best part of the game 0 
this phone is pretty sturdy and ive never had any large problems with it 1 
didnt laugh or even smile once 0 
this is hands down the best phone ive ever had 1 
similarly the delivery man did not say a word of apology when our food was 45 minutes late 0 
case was more or less an extra that i originally put on but later discarded because it scratched my ear 0 
id advise anyone to go and see it 1 
waiter was a jerk 0 
he is one of my favourite directors and one of the most talented directors in the history of cinema 1 
the goat taco didnt skimp on the meat and wow what flavor 1 
i really like this product over the motorola because it is allot clearer on the ear piece and the mic 1 
this film and i use that word loosely is an insult to the moviegoing public 0 
every time he opened his mouth you expect to hear you see kids pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show 0 
i wont say any more i dont like spoilers so i dont want to be one but i believe this film is worth your time 1 
my gyro was basically lettuce only 0 
it is the best charger i have seen on the market yet 1 
bland not a liking this place for a number of reasons and i dont want to waste time on bad reviewing ill leave it at that 0 
will not be back 0 
victor mclaglen was even bad and brian donlevy was almost unrecognizable 0 
woa talk about awful 0 
the script is horrendously stupid 0 
1010 1 
this is one of the better buffets that i have been to 1 
everything was good and tasty 1 
but what really made it unwatchable was the direction 0 
again lame 0 
only like 3 or 4 buildings used a couple of locations maybe poor hummh 0 
now i know that i made a wise decision 1 
razr battery good buy 1 
steve martin delivers a really funny performance of a middleaged upper class uptight white guy 1 
it really is impressive that the place hasnt closed down 0 
star trek v the final frontier is the worst in the series 0 
summary the witticisms werent witty 0 
this place is way too overpriced for mediocre food 0 
ive missed numerous calls because of this reason 0 
this one is simply a disappointment 0 
i never come again 0 
unfortunately cover girl is an example of how hollywood used to exploit women for financial gain 0 
this was my first and only vegas buffet and it did not disappoint 1 
at least think to refill my water before i struggle to wave you over for 10 minutes 0 
it was a huge awkward 15lb piece of cow that was 34ths gristle and fat 0 
the staff is always super friendly and helpful which is especially cool when you bring two small boys and a baby 1 
so far it has worked like a charm 1 
this movie is terrible 0 
lasted one day and then blew up 0 
i was left shattered from the experience of watching this film and i took a good two hours to fully recover 0 
one nice thing was that they added gratuity on the bill since our party was larger than 6 or 8 and they didnt expect more tip than that 1 
reaching for the bottom row is uncomfortable and the send and end keys are not where i expect them to be3 0 
nevertheless yet another wonderful film from the great masters stable 1 
i would recommend saving room for this 1 
lots of holes in the script 0 
beware this is not a trashy cult movie this is trash period 0 
this phone might well be the worst ive ever had in any brand 0 
avoid avoid avoid 0 
the battery is unreliable as well as the service use antena 0 
this was one of the worst films i have ever seen 0 
the performances are not improved by improvisation because the actors now have twice as much to worry about not only whether theyre delivering the line well but whether the line itself is any good 0 
very disappointing 0 
it sure does beat the nachos at the movies but i would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant 0 
so in a nutshell 1 the restaraunt smells like a combination of a dirty fish market and a sewer 0 
dont waste your money 0 
they are so cool 1 
there is nothing privileged about workingeating there 0 
the scenes are often funny and occasionally touching as the characters evaluate their lives and where they are going 1 
the servers are not pleasant to deal with and they dont always honor pizza hut coupons 0 
i had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get some relief 0 
spoilers whatever else can or cant be said about it surface is superbly crafted 1 
the phone loads super 1 
barney is definitely super de duper 1 
best fish ive ever had in my life 1 
trumbull on i love lucy 1 
however i needed some better instructions 0 
the story line is just awful 0 
ive dropped my phone more times than i can say even on concrete and my phone is still great knock on wood 1 
i felt insulted and disrespected how could you talk and judge another human being like that 0 
wont go back 0 
the chips and salsa were really good the salsa was very fresh 1 
the phone crashed completely and now i have to get it replaced 0 
the acting helps the writing along very well maybe the idiotsavant sister could have been played better and it is a real joy to watch 1 
unfortunately any virtue in this films production work was lost on a regrettable script 0 
i believe every one should see this movie as i think few people outside of south africa understand its past and what is being attempted in the truth and reconciliation process 1 
this was such an awesome movie that i bought it off of ebay 1 
rip off over charge shipping 0 
the directing seems too pretentious 0 
i got the aluminum case for my new palm vx and it worked really wellit has protected my handheld perfectly so far 1 
of course the acting is blah 0 
i could not stand to even watch it for very long for fear of losing iq 0 
i was very disappointed in the movie 0 
awesome selection of beer 1 
the show would begin with smart ass ed comments to each other that would be totally off the wall and uncalled for 0 
appetite instantly gone 0 
a truly truly bad film 0 
this was my first time and i cant wait until the next 1 
it looses connection to the phone even when it is within a couple feet between the two 0 
the stories were powerful explorations of the nature of man and of art 1 
the staff is great the food is delish and they have an incredible beer selection 1 
it fits my ear well and is comfortable on 1 
and generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode 0 
both actors truly understand and become their particular character delivering a convincing sincere performance 1 
however after finally watching this film i realized that not only had i had a closed mind to the brilliance it depicts i also found myself watching it over and over again 1 
the food is good 1 
and the beans and rice were mediocre at best 0 
the sets especially designed to work with the camera are amazingstylized beautiful and effective 1 
i love this cable it allows me to connect any miniusb device to my pc 1 
still i do like this movie for its empowerment of women theres not enough movies out there like this one 1 
were jerks on the phone 0 
i was amazed at the quick arrival of the two original lg cell phone batteries and and at a fraction of the price 1 
nice headset priced right 1 
great steak great sides great wine amazing desserts 1 
and the beans and rice were mediocre at best 0 
just does not work 0 
anne heche was utterly convincing 1 
he came running after us when he realized my husband had left his sunglasses on the table 1 
also the area where my unit broke im not too fond of the magnetic strap 0 
amazon sucks 0 
superb phone on a great network 1 
saw the movie today and thought it was a good effort good messages for kids 1 
but this movie is not funny considering the ridiculousness of it 0 
its still wild stuff though and is highly recommended to fans of giallo cinema 1 
if you havent gone here go now 1 
with great sound effects and impressive special effects i cant recommend this movie enough 1 
headset works great was packaged nicely to avoid any damage 1 
but the convoluted plot just didnt convince me and much of the film was watched with a weird questioning glance 0 
if it was to turn my good day feeling into a night of disturbing memories than i guess he succeeded 0 
this phone is very fast with sending any kind of messages and web browsing is significantly faster than previous phones i have used 1 
not sure who was more lost the flat characters or the audience nearly half of whom walked out 0 
damn good steak 1 
the vanilla ice cream was creamy and smooth while the profiterole choux pastry was fresh enough 1 
juano hernandez an exceptional actor who played supporting roles in many films of the era is a proud black man who is accused of murdering a white man in the south 1 
i like steiners because its dark and it feels like a bar 1 
service is friendly and inviting 1 
this phone might well be the worst ive ever had in any brand 0 
i dont like this nokia either 0 
this is a disgrace 0 
this is probably one of the least effective and utterly unoriginal films i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
i used bitpim a free program you can find on the internetto transfer data to the phonethe price of the cable was excellent 1 
motorola finally got the voice quality of a bluetooth headset right 1 
this is one of the better buffets that i have been to 1 
its not hard to make a decent hamburger 0 
it felt too light and tinny 0 
yes this film does require a rather significant amount of puzzlesolving but the pieces fit together to create a beautiful picture 1 
a piece of junk that broke after being on my phone for 2 days 0 
the waitresses are very friendly 1 
this results in the phone being either stuck at max volume or mute 0 
the service was terrible food was mediocre 0 
weird vibe from owners 0 
i had heard good things about this place but it exceeding every hope i could have dreamed of 1 
both actors truly understand and become their particular character delivering a convincing sincere performance 1 
this item is fantastic and works perfectly 1 
ive tried several different earpieces for my cell phone and this jabra one is the first one ive found that fits my ear comfortably 1 
it was so funny 1 
nothing new there 0 
food was really good and i got full petty fast 1 
utterly without merit on any level this is akin to torture 0 
never heard of any of them except cole who was totally unbelievable in the part 0 
this place is not worth your time let alone vegas 0 
with the originality and freshness of the first movie now spent this remake had little else to offer 0 
she ordered a toasted english muffin that came out untoasted 0 
my boyfriend tried the mediterranean chicken salad and fell in love 1 
first of all it doesnt wear well 0 
this device is great in several situations1 1 
weve tried to like this place but after 10 times i think were done with them 0 
a happy wonderful feel good ending 1 
sweetest phone 1 
mediocre food 0 
i could barely stomach the meal but didnt complain because it was a business lunch 0 
what a piece of junk i lose more calls on this phone 0 
the real disappointment was our waiter 0 
it didnt make me scared horrified or make me sympathetic towards the characters it was simply annoying 0 
i will not be eating there again 0 
damian is so talented and versatile in so many ways of writing and portraying different characters on screen 1 
its a case of so bad it is laughable 0 
it was an inexpensive piece but i would still have expected better quality 0 
i recently had problems where i could not stay connected for more than 10 minutes before being disconnected 0 
maybe if they werent cold they would have been somewhat edible 0 
good beer drink selection and good food selection 1 
worth every penny 1 
dont waste your on this one 0 
the secondary plot line is incomprehensible and its relation to the primary plot line is mystifying 0 
dont bother go to the store 0 
as many people complained i found this headsets microphone was very weak 0 
problem is that the ear loops are made of weak material and break easily 0 
but when someone strives for greatness and poetry but delivers a muddled and often ridiculous story a bunch of disparate scenes pretentious dialogue then you get the worst kind of a movie that some other reviewer very accurately defined as pretentious crap 0 
the plot doesnt hang together at all and the acting is absolutely appalling 0 
paolo sorrentino has written a wonderful story about loneliness and tony has built one of the most unforgettable characters seen in movies in recent years 1 
the feel of the dining room was more college cooking course than high class dining and the service was slow at best 0 
the waitresses are very friendly 1 
it was a long time that i didnt see a so charismatic actor on screen 1 
it probably would have been better if the director hadnt spent most of the movie showcasing his own art work which really isnt that noteworthy 0 
sounds good reasonably priced and effective its that simple 1 
totally different with loads of understatement and black comedy this is a film few get to see but those who do will remember it 1 
i wont be back 0 
the worst phone from samsungcrap this crappy samsung e715 is the worst i have ever seeen 0 
a film not easily forgotten 1 
its a piece of crap 0 
this is one of the best italian thrillers of the early 70s 1 
echo problemvery unsatisfactory 0 
spoilers whatever else can or cant be said about it surface is superbly crafted 1 
its the best headset i have used 1 
im very disappointed with my decision 0 
steamboat willie is an amazingly important film to our cinema history 1 
the last 15 minutes of movie are also not bad as well 1 
the burger i got the gold standard a 17 burger and was kind of disappointed 0 
product was excellent and works better than the verizon one and boy was it cheaper 1 
this game rocks 1 
really pleased with this product so far 1 
my phone doesnt slide around my car now and the grip prevents my phone from slipping out of my hand 1 
this particular model would not work with my motorola q smartphone 0 
not worth it 0 
for service i give them no stars 0 
im glad i found this product on amazon it is hard to find it wasnt high priced 1 
the tracfonewebsite is user friendly and makes it easy toactivate etc 1 
this is such a fun and funny movie 1 
the script is was there a script 0 
the scenery that the two daughters paint and photograph are beautiful 1 
as many people complained i found this headsets microphone was very weak 0 
horrible had to switch 3 times 0 
my only problem is i thought the actor playing the villain was a low rent michael ironside 0 
i cant wait to go back 1 
trumbull on i love lucy 1 
also the phone doesnt seem to accept anything except cbr mp3s preferably ripped by windows media player 0 
waaaaaayyyyyyyyyy over rated is all i am saying 0 
overall i was not impressed and would not go back 0 
was not happy 0 
hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in 0 
furthermore you cant even find hours of operation on the website 0 
the design is very odd as the ear clip is not very comfortable at all 0 
ill put this gem up against any movie in terms of screenplay cinematography acting postproduction editing directing or any other aspect of filmmaking 1 
it feels poorly constructed the menus are difficult to navigate and the buttons are so recessed that it is difficult to push them 0 
these are the central themes of the film and they are handled ineptly stereotypically and with no depth of imagination 0 
if you are reading this please dont go there 0 
i have two more years left in this contract and i hate this phone 0 
this case has passed the one year mark and while it shows signs of wear it is 100 functional 1 
doesnt last long 0 
food is way overpriced and portions are fucking small 0 
ive also had problems with the phone reading the memory card in which i always turn it on and then off again 0 
i keep watching it over and over 1 
we made the drive all the way from north scottsdale and i was not one bit disappointed 1 
the black eyed peas and sweet potatoes unreal 1 
food was good service was good prices were good 1 
its so stupid to have to keep buying new chargers car chargers cradles headphones and car kits every time a new phone comes out 0 
the potatoes were great and so was the biscuit 1 
i had high hopes for this place since the burgers are cooked over a charcoal grill but unfortunately the taste fell flat way flat 0 
is pretty funny 1 
the plot is nonsense that doesnt interest in the slightest way or have any uniqueness to it 0 
the food was barely lukewarm so it must have been sitting waiting for the server to bring it out to us 0 
its pure brilliance 1 
another thing i didnt really like is when a character got punched in the face a gallon of blood would spew forth soon after 0 
generally it just lacked imagination 0 
in a word it is embarrassing 0 
i use this product in a motor control center where there is a lot of high voltage humming from the equipment and it works great 1 
pretty cool i would say 1 
the bt headset was such a disapoinment 0 
food is way overpriced and portions are fucking small 0 
there were too many close ups 0 
i would recommend purchasing the jabra jx10 series 2 which works flawlessly with my moto q go figure 1 
i have bought this nokia cell phone a few weeks ago and it was a nightmare 0 
poor voice clarity 0 
not a pleasant voyage of selfdiscovery 0 
plug was the wrong size 0 
horrible phone 0 
all the pretty pictures in the world cannot make up for a piece of work that is flawed at the core 0 
there is no plot here to keep you going in the first place 0 
elias koteasjack palance play good roles angelina is hot and gets nakedbilly drago appears in this and is cool as usual a cameo by sven ole thorsen helps make this a very enjoyable movie with good acting and a decent budget 1 
i have been very happy with the 510 and have had no complaints from any one regarding my sound quality on their end 1 
low quality 0 
the food was very good 1 
my 5year old nokia 2160 from tracfone holds the charge a lot better than this 0 
very cheap plastic creaks like an old wooden floor 0 
exceptionally bad 0 
this little device has transformed my organizational capability and made my life a whole lot easier 1 
i would not recommend this place 0 
i would definitely recommend the jabra bt250v for those who are looking for comfort clarity and a great price 1 
never again will i be dining at this place 0 
steve martin delivers a really funny performance of a middleaged upper class uptight white guy 1 
everything stinks 0 
anyways the food was definitely not filling at all and for the price you pay you should expect more 0 
would not reccommend 0 
four stars for the food the guy in the blue shirt for his great vibe still letting us in to eat 1 
the only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive 1 
i would definitely recommend the jabra bt250v for those who are looking for comfort clarity and a great price 1 
everything was good and tasty 1 
plantronics bluetooth excelent buy 1 
stay away from the q 0 
very much disappointed with this company 0 
omg i felt like i had never eaten thai food until this dish 1 
one more thing i can tolerate political incorrectness very well im all for artistic freedom and suspension of disbelief but the slavic female character was just too much 0 
one of my favorite purchases ever 1 
excellent cast story line performances 1 
the ending is so so perfect youll shed a tear 1 
lange had become a great actress 1 
about ten minutes into this film i started having second thoughts 0 
i have had tmobile service for 2 or 3 years now and i am pretty happy with it 1 
wont work right or atleast for me 0 
food is way overpriced and portions are fucking small 0 
the meat was pretty dry i had the sliced brisket and pulled pork 0 
the performances are real and gripping the crocdodile is extremely well done indeed if the black water website is to be believed thats because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous 1 
the classic maine lobster roll was fantastic 1 
del taco is pretty nasty and should be avoided if possible 0 
i am not a filmmaker nor am i a director but i would hide my head in the sand if id spent whatever amount of money and time on this movie 0 
all in all ha long bay was a bit of a flop 0 
i like the fact that it rests lightly against your ear rather than inside 1 
i hate those things as much as cheap quality black olives 0 
babie bop is very cute 1 
frankly after cotton club and unfaithful it was kind of embarrassing to watch lane and gere in this film because it is bad 0 
plus it was wellpaced and suited its relatively short run time 1 
it will drive you barking mad 0 
this is probably the most irritating show i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
i sat riveted to the tv screen 1 
no complaints 1 
as i said abovepretty useless 0 
this is an extraordinary film 1 
it defeats the purpose of a bluetooth headset 0 
this is a great phone 1 
if i take a picture the battery drops a bar and starts beeping letting me know its dieing 0 
i bought this battery with a coupon from amazon and im very happy with my purchase 1 
i hate movies like that 0 
if you plan to use this in a car forget about it 0 
my boyfriend tried the mediterranean chicken salad and fell in love 1 
after 20 minutes wait i got a table 0 
its fits like a glove and is strong secure and durable 1 
their daily specials are always a hit with my group 1 
its worth driving up from tucson 1 
ordered an appetizer and took 40 minutes and then the pizza another 10 minutes 0 
this is a great restaurant at the mandalay bay 1 
not easy to watch 0 
you could only take 2 videos at a time and the quality was very poor 0 
you get extra minutes so that you can carry out the call and not get cut off 1 
it presents a idyllic yet serious portrayal of the ups and downs of the characters lives 1 
simple lightweight and great fit 1 
sending it back 0 
mediocre food 0 
i would not recommend this place 0 
the directing seems too pretentious 0 
how can that bethe audio quality is poor 0 
the scenery that the two daughters paint and photograph are beautiful 1 
have been going since 2007 and every meal has been awesome 1 
overall a delight 1 
i can think of no other film where something vitally important occurs every other minute 1 
it worked very well 1 
yes i am simplifying things here for the sake of brevity for this really is at the core of the problems with this film it has too much going on without any real fulfilling explanation 0 
the mic is great 1 
ive bought 5 wired headphones that sound better than these 0 
the cast was great 1 
horrible horrible protector 0 
all this movie does is make you sick watching all these slackers make excuses for their stupid actions for 90 minutes 0 
my only complaint is the standard sound volume is a little low even when turned up to 5of 5 0 
almost everyone involved must be return to school acting is utterly predictable and bad script is pile of garbage all round 0 
everything about this product is wrongfirst 0 
you get incredibly fresh fish prepared with care 1 
exactly what i wanted 1 
we sat another ten minutes and finally gave up and left 0 
the movie is terribly boring in places 0 
overall i like there food and the service 1 
absolutely great 1 
very good quality though 1 
everything about it is just bad 0 
there are many continuity errors one other user commented on different cars in the garage joes glassesthe one that got to me the most was the fact joes facial hair configuration seemed to change from scene to scene 0 
i do think tom hanks is a good actor 1 
the warm beer didnt help 0 
there are massive levels massive unlockable characters its just a massive game 1 
they never brought a salad we asked for 0 
secondly hitchcock pretty much perfected the thriller and chase movie 1 
alexander nevsky is a great film 1 
the sweet potato fries were very good and seasoned well 1 
its also great to see that renowned silent screenwriter frances marion hasnt missed a step going from silent to sound 1 
we ordered the duck rare and it was pink and tender on the inside with a nice char on the outside 1 
but now i was completely grossed out 0 
this film and i use that word loosely is an insult to the moviegoing public 0 
i am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this 1 
highquality chicken on the chicken caesar salad 1 
there was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters 0 
for that price i can think of a few place i would have much rather gone 0 
not impressed 0 
voice quality signal strength dropped calls 0 
i exchanged the sony ericson z500a for this and im pretty happy with that decision 1 
i purcashed this for the car charger and it does not work 0 
i literally vomited while watching this film 0 
krussel always good 1
