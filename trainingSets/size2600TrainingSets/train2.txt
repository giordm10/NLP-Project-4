anne heche was utterly convincing 1 
graphics is far from the best part of the game 0 
i love that they put their food in nice plastic containers as opposed to cramming it in little paper takeout boxes 1 
also difficult to put onid recommend avoiding this product 0 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
it really created a unique feeling though 1 
mobile phone tools are a must have 1 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
the waitress and manager are so friendly 1 
food was really boring 0 
after 20 minutes wait i got a table 0 
when a song could explain the emotions of the subjects better such as when jay adams unfortunate life was a subject of talk the song old man by neil young was played which evokes many emotions 1 
hated it 0 
item arrived quickly and works great with my metro pcs samsung schr450 slider phone and sony premium sound in ear plugs 1 
as a courtroom drama its compelling as an indictment on the american justice system its frightening 1 
good transmit audio 1 
he was very impressed when going from the original battery to the extended battery 1 
food was great and so was the serivce 1 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
his performance as awarded was stunning 1 
i believe the screenwriter did a good job of tying up the loose ends 1 
due to this happening on every call i was forced to stop using this headset 0 
the screen size is big key pad lit well enough and the camera quality is excellent for a camera phone 1 
in conclusion i will not bother with this movie because a volcano in los angeles is nothing but nonsense 0 
hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in 0 
great food and service huge portions and they give a military discount 1 
then theres the plot holes 0 
unless youre just out to visually collect all extant films of austens work you can skip this one 0 
i dont think i will be back for a very long time 0 
not loud enough and doesnt turn on like it should 0 
the owner used to work at nobu so this place is really similar for half the price 1 
we sat another ten minutes and finally gave up and left 0 
steer clear of this product and go with the genuine palm replacementr pens which come in a threepack 0 
works great 1 
not even good for camp value 0 
im not really sure how joeys was voted best hot dog in the valley by readers of phoenix magazine 0 
the kids are very cool too 1 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
same problem as others have mentioned 0 
the decor is nice and the piano music soundtrack is pleasant 1 
the yellowtail carpaccio was melt in your mouth fresh 1 
warning do not buy 0 
the attempts at humor were pitiful and story is so awful it dosent bear thinking about which basically involves a vulcan stealing the enterprise to find god seriously i just didnt care about any of this film and oh not to mention uhura does a belly dance to distract male guards 0 
i bought two of them and neither will charge 0 
but in terms of the writing its very fresh and bold 1 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
awesome service and food 1 
to summarize the food was incredible nay transcendant but nothing brings me joy quite like the memory of the pneumatic condiment dispenser 1 
i asked multiple times for the wine list and after some time of being ignored i went to the hostess and got one myself 0 
the pleather case doesnt fit 0 
i recently had problems where i could not stay connected for more than 10 minutes before being disconnected 0 
i get absolutely horrible reception in my apartment where with other phones i have not had this problem 0 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
clever and a real crowdpleaserthis film still ranks among mickeys best films even after 80 wonderful years 1 
oh the charger seems to work fine 1 
the update procedure is difficult and cumbersome 0 
worthwhile 1 
i cant see how this movie can be an inspiration to anyone to come out or overcome fear and rejection 0 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
terrible product and waste of money 0 
everything was gross 0 
comfortable fit you need your headset to be comfortable for at least an hour at a time if not for an entire day 1 
but the premise of the film was so ridiculous that the president of the us 0 
talk about useless customer service 0 
seriously its not worth wasting your or your kids time on 0 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
the malta settings are as dry and as barren as the dialogue 0 
its practically perfect in all of them  a true masterpiece in a sea of faux masterpieces 1 
maybe its just their vegetarian fare but ive been twice and i thought it was average at best 0 
ordered burger rare came in well done 0 
trying to make a call on these is an exercise in frustration 0 
the cast of veteran actors are more than just a nostalgia trip 1 
ill even say it again  this is torture 0 
to those who find this movie intelligent or even masterful i can only say its your intelligence and your imagination you obviously used to try and make some sense of this pitiful attempt its in our human nature to try and make sense of things 0 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
the attention given to every character and complex psychological portrayals detailing loyalty treachery love and hope are tremendous 1 
i would advise to not purchase this item it never worked very well 0 
all this movie does is make you sick watching all these slackers make excuses for their stupid actions for 90 minutes 0 
cooked to perfection and the service was impeccable 1 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
great audio 1 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
i would definitely recommend the jabra bt250v for those who are looking for comfort clarity and a great price 1 
no one at the table thought the food was above average or worth the wait that we had for it 0 
very poor service 0 
an awesome new look for fall 2000 1 
all the actors give a wonderful performance especially jennifer rubin as jamie harris who changes from the nervous starlet in the beginning through the strange events she is part of to the cool star 1 
you cant beat that 1 
great phone 1 
worth every penny 1 
it defeats the purpose of a bluetooth headset 0 
this is a good battery and it got here really fast 1 
we literally sat there for 20 minutes with no one asking to take our order 0 
portable and it works 1 
this is one of the best movies out there that shows such strong sibling bond for each other 1 
great product 1 
delicious and i will absolutely be back 1 
and it was way to expensive 0 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
they have been around for years and carries the highest quality of antiglare screen protector that i have found to date 1 
server did a great job handling our large rowdy table 1 
either way it sucks 0 
the roast beef sandwich tasted really good 1 
service is friendly and inviting 1 
great product 1 
i heart this place 1 
kids pizza is always a hit too with lots of great side dish options for the kiddos 1 
i received my orders well within the shipping timeframe everything was in good working order and overall i am very excited to have this source 1 
i kept catching the cable on the seat and i had to pull the phone out to turn it on an off 0 
the color is even prettier than i thought it would be and the graphics are incredibly sharp 1 
horrible had to switch 3 times 0 
plug was the wrong size 0 
worked very well paired with a treo 700w and as a skype headset on my pc using a usb bluetooth transceiver 1 
i have only had it for a few weeks but so far so good 1 
best service and food ever maria our server was so good and friendly she made our day 1 
good audio quality 1 
very clear quality sound and you dont have to mess with the sound on your ipod since you have the sound buttons on the headset 1 
the cast is always entertaining as usual 1 
the food was very good 1 
no complaints 1 
this is probably one of the least effective and utterly unoriginal films i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
great price also 1 
here in the wind and the lion we see a wonderful rendering of americas own imperial age 1 
the only consistent thread holding the series together were the amazing performances of leni parker and anita laselva as the two taelons in quiet idealogical conflict 0 
the reception is excellent 1 
went in for happy hour great list of wines 1 
treo and tmobile refused to replace it again and forced me to buy another phone without any kind of upgrade discount 0 
the jabra eargels fit my ears very well 1 
today the graphics are crap 0 
avoid at all costs 0 
but in terms of the writing its very fresh and bold 1 
i am very happy 1 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
i can think of no other film where something vitally important occurs every other minute 1 
the food is about on par with dennys which is to say not good at all 0 
perabo has a nice energy level and is obviously very comfortable in front of a camera 1 
this second appearance of mickey mouse following the silent plane crazy earlier that year is probably his most famous filmmostly because it was so groundbreaking 1 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
i tried the cape cod ravoli chickenwith cranberrymmmm 1 
stay away from the q 0 
great price also 1 
i like the fact that it rests lightly against your ear rather than inside 1 
this second appearance of mickey mouse following the silent plane crazy earlier that year is probably his most famous filmmostly because it was so groundbreaking 1 
at first glance it is a lovely bakery cafe nice ambiance clean friendly staff 1 
we enjoy their pizza and brunch 1 
i definitly recommend 1 
now i know that i made a wise decision 1 
its fits like a glove and is strong secure and durable 1 
this allows the possibility of double booking for the same date and time after the first 0 
very disappointing 0 
could not get strong enough signal 0 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
what a great double cheeseburger 1 
their chow mein is so good 1 
this place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver 0 
so badwellits just bad 0 
i would recommend this 1 
i love this device 1 
my friend loved the salmon tartar 1 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
my mother and brother had to do thiswhen i saw robert ryan portraying this type of man it was a very good imitation of this type of individual and i was impressed 1 
needless to say i wont be going back anytime soon 0 
i thought it was bad 0 
the film is well paced understated and one of the best courtroom documentaries ive seen 1 
same problem as others have mentioned 0 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
they have a really nice atmosphere 1 
dont waste your money 0 
i left with a stomach ache and felt sick the rest of the day 0 
this is a great deal 1 
i will be back many times soon 1 
artless camerawork endlessly presents us with the ugliest setting imaginable ie 0 
excellent sound quality 1 
the pizza selections are good 1 
great brunch spot 1 
it lasts less than 3o minutes if i actually try to use the phonemy wife has the same phone with the same problem 0 
i vomited in the bathroom mid lunch 0 
try them in the airport to experience some tasty food and speedy friendly service 1 
good service very clean and inexpensive to boot 1 
nice headset priced right 1 
lovely little thriller from hitchcock with lots of nice shenanigans surrounding a murdered spy a kidnapped child a nasty church a foreign plot and some random taxidermists 1 
this is a good battery and it got here really fast 1 
the battery works great 1 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
so flavorful and has just the perfect amount of heat 1 
due to this happening on every call i was forced to stop using this headset 0 
i just cant explain this movie more than romanticcharminghilariousand adorablethe junkyard scenes are funnyall the junkyard dogs have something specialtoo funny i laughedkids will love itbuy it when it comes outit has new features 1 
useless phone simply deaf 0 
the noise shield is incrediable 1 
too bad cause i know its family owned i really wanted to like this place 0 
their frozen margaritas are way too sugary for my taste 0 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
this is not moviemaking 0 
it was so boring 0 
it is worth the drive 1 
this is definitely a cult classic well worth viewing and sharing with others 1 
ill be looking for a new earpiece 0 
the story itself is just predictable and lazy 0 
they work about 2 weeks then break 0 
the burger i got the gold standard a 17 burger and was kind of disappointed 0 
i was very disappointed in the movie 0 
doesnt hold charge 0 
id like to return it 0 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
how can anyone in their right mind ask for anything more from a movie than this 1 
and considering the two of us left there very full and happy for about 20 you just cant go wrong 1 
tried to go here for lunch and it was a madhouse 0 
after 3 months screen just went black all of a sudden 0 
the ri style calamari was a joke 0 
the seller is very understanding and patient i would definitely buy from them again 1 
a must study for anyone interested in the worst sins of industrial design 0 
the han nan chicken was also very tasty 1 
highly unprofessional and rude to a loyal patron 0 
not much flavor to them and very poorly constructed 0 
but if you liked movies like the matrix and better yet their sequels i think youll appreciate the thought provoking mindblowing experience this film will give you 1 
the phone is sturdy and waterproof 1 
i hate those things as much as cheap quality black olives 0 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
totally different with loads of understatement and black comedy this is a film few get to see but those who do will remember it 1 
id love to go back 1 
there is no plot here to keep you going in the first place 0 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
generally it just lacked imagination 0 
the food was great as always compliments to the chef 1 
also notable is john baileys fine crisp beautifully colored cinematography and the great production design costumes by eiko ishioka who went on to do the memorable costumes for coppolas dracula for which she received a well deserved oscar 1 
so bad 0 
the kids are annoying 0 
penne vodka excellent 1 
for sushi on the strip this is the place to go 1 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
kind of hard to mess up a steak but they did 0 
i was shocked because no signs indicate cash only 0 
but storm trooper is not even bad enough to make it to the list of wonderfully terrible movies 0 
it is perfect for a sitdown family meal or get together with a few friends 1 
i wear it everyday and it holds up very well 1 
on the good side the staff was genuinely pleasant and enthusiastic a real treat 1 
i literally vomited while watching this film 0 
they made this case too small and is very difficult to install 0 
the classic maine lobster roll was fantastic 1 
i had the mac salad and it was pretty bland so i will not be getting that again 0 
not a good item it worked for a while then started having problems in my auto reverse tape player 0 
very good stuff for the price 1 
i saw it as a child on tv back in 1973 when it was the stranger and i loved it 1 
i wear glasses and it fits fine with them 1 
his losing his marbles so early in the proceedings is totally implausible and unconvincing 0 
highly recommended a 1 
product was excellent and works better than the verizon one and boy was it cheaper 1 
this is probably one of the least effective and utterly unoriginal films i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
bad purchase 0 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
small sleek impressive looking practical setup with ample storage in place 1 
i love this bluetooth 1 
none of the new ones have ever quite worked properly 0 
the dialogue sucked 0 
if youre not familiar check it out 1 
now this is a movie i really dislike 0 
but it does get better reception and clarity than any phone ive had before 1 
during several different 2 minute calls i experienced 5 drops and it was in an area that had 5 bars 0 
piece of trash 0 
server did a great job handling our large rowdy table 1 
i am also very happy with the price 1 
this item is great installed it let it charged up overnite and it has been working good every since with no problems 1 
at any rate this film stinks its not funny and fulci should have stayed with giallo and supernatural zombie movies 0 
poor voice clarity 0 
im still infatuated with this phone 1 
this place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver 0 
poor sound quality 0 
does everything it should and more 1 
my wife had the lobster bisque soup which was lukewarm 0 
that movie was bad 0 
this film and i use that word loosely is an insult to the moviegoing public 0 
this place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver 0 
its a little geeky but i think thats its sex on toast and it rocks and oozes sex right down to its battery embedded sleek stylish leather case 1 
i must say i have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again 1 
so just beware 0 
this movie is excellentangel is beautiful and scamp is adorablehis little yelps when hes scaredand the funniest parts are whenscamp is caught under the curtain and when angel and scamp are singing ive never had this feeling beforei totally recommend this movieits coming out on special edition on june 20the cover has scamp on a garbage can and angel underneath the lid 1 
there was a warm feeling with the service and i felt like their guest for a special treat 1 
the sound quality for the device is unacceptableunless you are in a really quiet area you almost hear nothing 0 
perabo has a nice energy level and is obviously very comfortable in front of a camera 1 
helen baxendale is a very credible lady macbeth who can be very cheerfull at times and sometimes she just looks like a naughty girl but deadly in her taste for blood and evil 1 
be sure to order dessert even if you need to pack it togo the tiramisu and cannoli are both to die for 1 
his performance as awarded was stunning 1 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
all i have to say is the food was amazing 1 
highly recommended a 1 
the food was terrible 0 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
overall a delight 1 
clear skype calls long battery life long range 1 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
left very frustrated 0 
the bt headset was such a disapoinment 0 
the opening sequence of this gem is a classic and the cat n mouse games that follow are a delight to watch 1 
here in the wind and the lion we see a wonderful rendering of americas own imperial age 1 
voice quality signal strength dropped calls 0 
dee snider just plain sucks 0 
no ear loop needed its tiny and the sound is great 1 
generous portions and great taste 1 
the design is very odd as the ear clip is not very comfortable at all 0 
you wont regret it 1 
putting the race card aside lets look at the major flaw in the film they destroy latifas character 0 
dont buy it 0 
a must study for anyone interested in the worst sins of industrial design 0 
avoid at any and all costs 0 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
this film offers many delights and surprises 1 
simple lightweight and great fit 1 
the food was terrible 0 
works for me 1 
the bose noise cancelling is amazing which is very important for a nyc commuter 1 
disapointing results 0 
this place is awesome if you want something light and healthy during the summer 1 
today was my first taste of a buldogis gourmet hot dog and i have to tell you it was more than i ever thought possible 1 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
end of days is one of the worst bigbudget action movies ive ever seen 0 
the script is bad very bad  it contains both cheesiness and unethical joke that you normally see in rated r or nc17 movie 0 
glad i didnt pay to see it 0 
we made the drive all the way from north scottsdale and i was not one bit disappointed 1 
i would avoid this place if you are staying in the mirage 0 
seems like a good quick place to grab a bite of some familiar pub food but do yourself a favor and look elsewhere 0 
i work in the hospitality industry in paradise valley and have refrained from recommending cibo any longer 0 
i received my supposedly new motorola 375 and apparently there was not a match between the phone and the charger 0 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
jamie foxx absolutely is ray charles 1 
it feels poorly constructed the menus are difficult to navigate and the buttons are so recessed that it is difficult to push them 0 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
my mother and brother had to do thiswhen i saw robert ryan portraying this type of man it was a very good imitation of this type of individual and i was impressed 1 
rude inconsiderate management 0 
on the ground right next to our table was a large smeared beensteppedinandtrackedeverywhere pile of green bird poop 0 
in summary this was a largely disappointing dining experience 0 
i sat riveted to the tv screen 1 
talk about great customer service of course we will be back 1 
top line dont waste your time and money on this one its as bad as it comes 0 
also if your phone is dropped this case is not going to save it specially when dropped face down 0 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
this second appearance of mickey mouse following the silent plane crazy earlier that year is probably his most famous filmmostly because it was so groundbreaking 1 
works for me 1 
the fries were not hot and neither was my burger 0 
excellent product for the price 1 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
their daily specials are always a hit with my group 1 
much more interesting more action more suspense and less of the unneeded controversy 1 
they could be used as exemplars for any set designer 1 
would not recommend to others 0 
conclusion very filling meals 1 
do not buy do not buyit sucks 0 
if you love authentic mexican food and want a whole bunch of interesting yet delicious meats to choose from you need to try this place 1 
but the duet between the astronaut and his doctor at the beginning of the movie is a perfect exchange if one considers that this movie was made well into the cold war and the astronauts biggest fear is that he has crashed in the ussr 1 
also its slim enough to fit into my alarm clock docking station without removing the case 1 
best headset ever 1 
if you plan to use this in a car forget about it 0 
used and dirty 0 
the film is way too long 0 
in other words the content level of this film is enough to easily fill a dozen other films 1 
frozen pucks of disgust with some of the worst people behind the register 0 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
great character actors telly savalas and peter boyle 1 
they could be used as exemplars for any set designer 1 
it was a bit too sweet not really spicy enough and lacked flavor 0 
i love this thing 1 
this blueant supertooth handsfree phone speaker is awesome 1 
it is an insane game 1 
it didnt charge for me 0 
their rotating beers on tap is also a highlight of this place 1 
having to humour him just to get by and get through the day was so apt 1 
i really like this product over the motorola because it is allot clearer on the ear piece and the mic 1 
the nokia ca42 usb cable did not work with my phone 0 
i bought this battery with a coupon from amazon and im very happy with my purchase 1 
i was deeply impressed with the character he played 1 
i wish i could return the unit and get back my money 0 
the only suspense i was feeling was the frustration at just how retarded the girls were 0 
this movie is so awesome 1 
the cashier had no care what so ever on what i had to say it still ended up being wayyy overpriced 0 
great for ipods too 1 
as always the evening was wonderful and the food delicious 1 
poor product 0 
i live in the neighborhood so i am disappointed i wont be back here because it is a convenient location 0 
oh and i forgot to also mention the weird color effect it has on your phone 0 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
unless youre just out to visually collect all extant films of austens work you can skip this one 0 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
kind of flops around 0 
needless to say i wont be going back anytime soon 0 
the only good thing was that it fits comfortably on small ears 1 
the waitresses are very friendly 1 
very good phone 1 
pretty awesome place 1 
the sound quality for the device is unacceptableunless you are in a really quiet area you almost hear nothing 0 
the only thing i wasnt too crazy about was their guacamole as i dont like it puréed 0 
i think i was one of the people who found this another one of roths pearls 1 
i saw mirrormask last night and it was an unsatisfactory experience 0 
its a case of so bad it is laughable 0 
a very good film indeed about great and unconditional love 1 
after arguing with verizon regarding the dropped calls we returned the phones after two days 0 
i want to first say our server was great and we had perfect service 1 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
you wont regret it 1 
you can find better movies at youtube 0 
some may say this buffet is pricey but i think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot 1 
needless to say i wont be going back anytime soon 0 
pricing is a bit of a concern at mellow mushroom 0 
they could serve it with just the vinaigrette and it may make for a better overall dish but it was still very good 1 
terrible service 0 
the food was terrible 0 
the acting was bad the dialogs were extremely shallow and insincere 0 
i got this phone on reccomendation from a relative and im glad i did 1 
was not happy 0 
after the disappointing dinner we went elsewhere for dessert 0 
waited 2 hours never got either of our pizzas as many other around us who came in later did 0 
seriously flavorful delights folks 1 
the music in the film is really nice too 1 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
truly awful 0 
just as good as when i had it more than a year ago 1 
having to humour him just to get by and get through the day was so apt 1 
so dont go there if you are looking for good food 0 
food was so gooodd 1 
del taco is pretty nasty and should be avoided if possible 0 
my phone doesnt slide around my car now and the grip prevents my phone from slipping out of my hand 1 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
im not sure what he was trying to do with this film 0 
the vegetables are so fresh and the sauce feels like authentic thai 1 
this is definitely one of the better documentaries i have seen looking at family relationships and marriage 1 
was not happy 0 
my brother in law who works at the mall ate here same day and guess what he was sick all night too 0 
battery has no life 0 
so bad 0 
the battery life is highly unacceptable 0 
comfortable nice range good battery life 1 
works great 1 
food was good service was good prices were good 1 
omg the food was delicioso 1 
by the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant i was bored and didnt care what happened next and so i switched off 0 
the directing seems too pretentious 0 
i dont each much pasta but i love the homemade hand made pastas and thin pizzas here 1 
it was clear that she had the range and ability to pull off this part 1 
headset works great was packaged nicely to avoid any damage 1 
but it picked up speed and got right to the point 1 
the attractive set used throughout most of the film is an eyepleasing gem 1 
john wayne did an incredible job for being so young in the movie industry 1 
the decor is nice and the piano music soundtrack is pleasant 1 
very good phone 1 
not recommended 0 
the restaurant is very clean and has a family restaurant feel to it 1 
i went to bachi burger on a friends recommendation and was not disappointed 1 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
great phone 1 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
call me a nut but i think this is one of the best movies ever 1 
i wont spoil it but the ending in pretty amazing 1 
now the pizza itself was good the peanut sauce was very tasty 1 
not easy to watch 0 
i found a six inch long piece of wire in my salsa 0 
horrible dont waste your time and money 0 
i particularly remember my senses being assaulted by strident cords of music that would blare out with very little warning and even less meaning 0 
emily watsons character is very strong and she has only to give a quick glance and you understand everything 1 
the servers are not pleasant to deal with and they dont always honor pizza hut coupons 0 
the story is lame not interesting and never really explains the sinister origins of the puppets 0 
everything from acting to cinematography was solid 1 
macbeth jason connery moved me to tears with his final monolog out brief candle outhe gave the sphere of moral decay and dark forces a human face which makes it the more interesting 1 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
the plot has more holes than a pair of fishnet stockings and the direction and editing is astonishingly ham fisted 0 
battery is holding up well 1 
but when i check voice mail at night the keypad backlight turns off a few seconds into the first message and then im lost 0 
i want my money back 0 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
this totally unfunny movie is so over the top and pathetic and unrealistic that throughout the whole 90 minutes of utter torture i probably looked at my watch about 70000 times 0 
horrible horrible protector 0 
much more interesting more action more suspense and less of the unneeded controversy 1 
it was either too cold not enough flavor or just bad 0 
this was like the final blow 0 
dont buy this product 0 
he cant act one of the least scary villains i have ever seen he cant write did he write this damn movie in his sleep 0 
very funny 1 
plus it was wellpaced and suited its relatively short run time 1 
i probably would not go here again 0 
better than expected 1 
trumbull on i love lucy 1 
i love the ownerchef his one authentic japanese cool dude 1 
very windresistant 1 
i did not expect this to be so good 1 
nine out of ten for a truly lovely film 1 
i cannot believe that the actors agreed to do this film 0 
each day of the week they have a different deal and its all so delicious 1 
maybe there would be a reasonable explanation for this atrocity 0 
very satisifed with that 1 
which has more depth and character than the man underneath it 0 
if she had not rolled the eyes we may have stayed not sure if we will go back and try it again 0 
the point is the journey a journey that touches every member of the family 1 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
comfort for our whole family 1 
what a waste of time 0 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
great place fo take out or eat in 1 
i literally vomited while watching this film 0 
then theres the plot holes 0 
i dont think there are any redeeming qualities in this remake 0 
not as good as i had hoped 0 
the spaghetti is nothing special whatsoever 0 
so good i am going to have to review this place twice once hereas a tribute to the place and once as a tribute to an event held here last night 1 
perhaps i caught them on an off night judging by the other reviews but im not inspired to go back 0 
i am very impressed with this headset from plantronics 1 
all the actors give a wonderful performance especially jennifer rubin as jamie harris who changes from the nervous starlet in the beginning through the strange events she is part of to the cool star 1 
after my phone got to be about a year old its been slowly breaking despite much care on my part 0 
it is rare when a filmmaker takes the time to tell a worthy moral tale with care and love that doesnt fall into the trap of being overly syrupy or over indulgent 1 
worst thai ever 0 
however i needed some better instructions 0 
this is hands down the best phone ive ever had 1 
it also took her forever to bring us the check when we asked for it 0 
all this movie does is make you sick watching all these slackers make excuses for their stupid actions for 90 minutes 0 
long whiny and pointless 0 
this is probably one of the least effective and utterly unoriginal films i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
the films sole bright spot was jonah hill who will look almost unrecognizable to fans of the recent superbad due to the amount of weight he lost in the interim 1 
how awful she is 0 
my headset works just peachykeen 1 
nothing at all to recommend 0 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
this product is great it makes working a lot easier i can go to the copier while waiting on hold for something 1 
i will be back many times soon 1 
product is exactly as described 1 
excellent product for the price 1 
some great music and terrific scenery 1 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
this is a really fantastic thai restaurant which is definitely worth a visit 1 
this is probably one of the least effective and utterly unoriginal films i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
this is one of the best movies out there that shows such strong sibling bond for each other 1 
if you want healthy authentic or ethic food try this place 1 
the casting is also horrible cause all you see is a really really bad actors period 0 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
the restaurant atmosphere was exquisite 1 
the problem i have is that they charge 1199 for a sandwich that is no bigger than a subway sub which offers better and more amount of vegetables 0 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
they keep getting better and better this is my third one and ive had numerous palms too 1 
jawbone era is awesome too 1 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
its extremely slow and takes forever to do anything with it 0 
definitely not worth the 3 i paid 0 
and those baby owls were adorable 1 
perfect for the ps3 1 
sweetest phone 1 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
i will not return 0 
my friend did not like his bloody mary 0 
the acting sucked 0 
he is almost unbearable to watch on screen he has little to no charisma and terrible comedic timing 0 
when i opened the sandwich i was impressed but not in a good way 0 
i guess i should have known that this place would suck because it is inside of the excalibur but i didnt use my common sense 0 
the attempts at humor were pitiful and story is so awful it dosent bear thinking about which basically involves a vulcan stealing the enterprise to find god seriously i just didnt care about any of this film and oh not to mention uhura does a belly dance to distract male guards 0 
i mean really how do you get so famous for your fish and chips when its so terrible 0 
it is wonderful and inspiring to watch and i hope that it gets released again on to video or dvd 1 
i never walked out of a movie faster 0 
ordered a double cheeseburger got a single patty that was falling apart picture uploaded yeah still sucks 0 
avoid at all costs 0 
this phone is slim and light and the display is beautiful 1 
the salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop which was perfectly cooked 1 
this short film certainly pulls no punches 0 
it is zillion times away from reality 0 
very good quality though 1 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
last time buying from you 0 
long whiny and pointless 0 
ive dropped my phone more times than i can say even on concrete and my phone is still great knock on wood 1 
the staff is friendly and the joint is always clean 1 
crust is not good 0 
the worst one of the series 0 
the dialogue is composed of things that make little sense 0 
its just lame 0 
product is exactly as described 1 
the opening sequence of this gem is a classic and the cat n mouse games that follow are a delight to watch 1 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
wasted two hours 0 
light weight i hardly notice it is there 1 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
this movie totally grates on my nerves 0 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
i have been to very few places to eat that under no circumstances would i ever return to and this tops the list 0 
the camera on the phone may be used as a dustpan when indoors id rather be using a disposable then this 0 
the explosion of the gas tanks at the end was just as awful 0 
however the ear pads come off easily and after only one week i lost one 0 
so far it has worked like a charm 1 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
worked very well paired with a treo 700w and as a skype headset on my pc using a usb bluetooth transceiver 1 
thank you for wasting my money 0 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
the only place good for this film is in the garbage 0 
i consider this theft 0 
go rent it 1 
all the actors give a wonderful performance especially jennifer rubin as jamie harris who changes from the nervous starlet in the beginning through the strange events she is part of to the cool star 1 
nice ambiance 1 
the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach 0 
the visual effects were awful 0 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
but the actingeven that of such professionals as drago and debbie rochonwas terrible the directing worse perhaps contributory to the former the dialog chimplike and the camera work barely tolerable 0 
none of the new ones have ever quite worked properly 0 
very bad performance plays angela bennett a computer expert who is at home all the time 0 
we watched our waiter pay a lot more attention to other tables and ignore us 0 
it was attached to a gas station and that is rarely a good sign 0 
i as well wouldve given godfathers zero stars if possible 0 
he came running after us when he realized my husband had left his sunglasses on the table 1 
its like a really sexy party in your mouth where youre outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party 1 
took an hour to get our food only 4 tables in restaurant my food was luke warm our sever was running around like he was totally overwhelmed 0 
also its a real treat to see anthony quinn playing crazy horse 1 
the volume switch rocketed out of the unit to a destination unknown 0 
thanks good a movie like this was done and released 1 
the real disappointment was our waiter 0 
camera color balance is awful 0 
the story which was told so eloquently by francis ford coppola 25 years earlier really unfolds gradually and leaves room for the characters to develop 1 
the ear buds only play music in one ear 0 
its practically perfect in all of them  a true masterpiece in a sea of faux masterpieces 1 
phone falls out easily 0 
battery chargelife is quite long 1 
feelings thoughtsgabriels discomfort during the danceall these intangibles leap to life and come within the viewers grasp in hustons portrayal 1 
ive seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie 0 
plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job 1 
there is so much good food in vegas that i feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to rice and company 0 
we thought youd have to venture further away to get good sushi but this place really hit the spot that night 1 
nothing short of magnificent photographycinematography in this film 1 
omg the food was delicioso 1 
not a good item it worked for a while then started having problems in my auto reverse tape player 0 
the chips and sals a here is amazing 1 
great phone 1 
there is no plot or storyline 0 
walked in and the place smelled like an old grease trap and only 2 others there eating 0 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
add betty white and jean smart and you have a great cast everyone played their parts really well 1 
he also came back to check on us regularly excellent service 1 
hayao miyazakis latest and eighth film for studio ghibili gake no ue no ponyo ponyo on the cliff by the sea is a wonderfully fun and imaginative look at childhood 1 
it fits my ear well and is comfortable on 1 
i liked it 1 
if you simply want a small flip phone look elsewhere as the extra bells whistles are mediocre 0 
the sangria was about half of a glass wine full and was 12 ridiculous 0 
helen baxendale is a very credible lady macbeth who can be very cheerfull at times and sometimes she just looks like a naughty girl but deadly in her taste for blood and evil 1 
id love to go back 1 
poorly contstruct hinge 0 
on the negative its insipid enough to cause regret for another 2 hours of life wasted in front of the screen 0 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
this totally unfunny movie is so over the top and pathetic and unrealistic that throughout the whole 90 minutes of utter torture i probably looked at my watch about 70000 times 0 
the feel of the dining room was more college cooking course than high class dining and the service was slow at best 0 
the yellowtail carpaccio was melt in your mouth fresh 1 
bluetooth range is good a few days ago i left my phone in the trunk got a call and carried the conversation without a hitch 1 
it was attached to a gas station and that is rarely a good sign 0 
i saw this short film on hbo the other day and absolutely loved it 1 
which is precisely why i am giving it such a bad review 0 
bluetooth does not work phone locks up screens just flash up and now it just makes calls randomly while in my pocket locked 0 
we got sitting fairly fast but ended up waiting 40 minutes just to place our order another 30 minutes before the food arrived 0 
i dont think well be going back anytime soon 0 
it looks very nice 1 
it was pretty gross 0 
voice quality signal strength dropped calls 0 
the majority of the logitech earbud headsets failed 0 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
as a sushi lover avoid this place by all means 0 
o my gosh the best phone i have ever had 1 
not recommended 0 
ive bought 5 wired headphones that sound better than these 0 
cute quaint simple honest 1 
love this product 1 
later i found myself lost in the power of the film 1 
initially the local sites in the film which was filmed here in buffalo intrigued me 1 
this is was due to the fact that it took 20 minutes to be acknowledged then another 35 minutes to get our foodand they kept forgetting things 0 
the two main characters may be two of the most believable children i ever saw put on screen 1 
when i saw it in the theater i thought i was going to be sick 0 
overall i am psyched to have a phone which has all my appointments and contacts in and gets great reception 1 
and sometimes it was so embarrassing that i had to look away 0 
but the service was beyond bad 0 
woa talk about awful 0 
both rickman and stowe play their roles to the hilt in this tale of a childrens book writer who maybe has written a subversive tract 1 
you wont regret it 1 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
i ordered the voodoo pasta and it was the first time id had really excellent pasta since going gluten free several years ago 1 
highly recommended for all ages although the younger set will probably not appreciate some of the more subtle references they will certainly appreciate one galley scene in particular 1 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
this place has it 1 
i received my orders well within the shipping timeframe everything was in good working order and overall i am very excited to have this source 1 
if you look for authentic thai food go else where 0 
of all the dishes the salmon was the best but all were great 1 
host staff were for lack of a better word bitches 0 
i really like this product over the motorola because it is allot clearer on the ear piece and the mic 1 
weve tried to like this place but after 10 times i think were done with them 0 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
by the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant i was bored and didnt care what happened next and so i switched off 0 
i had a pretty satifying experience 1 
the only consistent thread holding the series together were the amazing performances of leni parker and anita laselva as the two taelons in quiet idealogical conflict 0 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
the worst sappiest dialogue i could go on and on 0 
what i really like there is the crepe station 1 
i wish i could return the unit and get back my money 0 
so i basically threw my money out the window for nothing 0 
the acting sucks the music sucks the script sucks the pacing sucks the special fx suck the directing sucks basically this movie sucks 0 
he also came back to check on us regularly excellent service 1 
the result is a powerhouse achievement made more timely now perhaps because of our cultures disturbing fascination with celebrity and its distorted interpretations of fame 1 
we started with the tuna sashimi which was brownish in color and obviously wasnt fresh 0 
all the characters in this film are tremendously well played 1 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
the only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port irda 0 
service is quick and even to go orders are just like we like it 1 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
they could be used as exemplars for any set designer 1 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
which is precisely why i am giving it such a bad review 0 
the fries were great too 1 
it feels poorly constructed the menus are difficult to navigate and the buttons are so recessed that it is difficult to push them 0 
at first glance it is a lovely bakery cafe nice ambiance clean friendly staff 1 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
yet plantronincs continues to use the same flawed charger design 0 
you also cannot take pictures with it in the case because the lense is covered 0 
go rent it 1 
this place is handsdown one of the best places to eat in the phoenix metro area 1 
food was so gooodd 1 
i dont think well be going back anytime soon 0 
it has everything i need and i couldnt ask for more 1 
tom wilkinson broke my heart at the end and everyone elses judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike 1 
great service and food 1 
it rocked my world and is certainly a must see for anyone with no social or physical outlets 1 
a standout scene 1 
if you simply want a small flip phone look elsewhere as the extra bells whistles are mediocre 0 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
very good food great atmosphere1 1 
brilliant 1 
its not user friendly 0 
rude inconsiderate management 0 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
this film offers many delights and surprises 1 
i ended up sliding it on the edge of my pants or back pockets instead 1 
so badwellits just bad 0 
the inside is really quite nice and very clean 1 
this is one of the best movies out there that shows such strong sibling bond for each other 1 
my sanyo has survived dozens of drops on blacktop without ill effect 1 
it is simple to use and i like it 1 
after 3 months screen just went black all of a sudden 0 
the most annoying thing about cover girl is the way in which rita hayworth is put up on a pedestal 0 
a very good film indeed about great and unconditional love 1 
it presents a idyllic yet serious portrayal of the ups and downs of the characters lives 1 
the battery is unreliable as well as the service use antena 0 
and there wasnt a single sour note struck actingwise either some surprisingly solid casting here 1 
yet plantronincs continues to use the same flawed charger design 0 
the chains which im no fan of beat this place easily 0 
he was extremely rude and really there are so many other restaurants i would love to dine at during a weekend in vegas 0 
reasonably priced also 1 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
the calls drop the phone comes on and off at will the screen goes black and the worst of all it stops ringing intermittently 0 
great hands free device 1 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
then theres the plot holes 0 
sprint charges for this service 0 
excellent starter wireless headset 0 
what a waste of money and time 0 
spend your money and time some place else 0 
i am so tired of clichés that is just lazy writing and here they come in thick and fast 0 
love this place hits the spot when i want something healthy but not lacking in quantity or flavor 1 
we loved the biscuits 1 
the restaurant atmosphere was exquisite 1 
good beer drink selection and good food selection 1 
this is not moviemaking 0 
the only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port irda 0 
exactly what i wanted 1 
the instruction manual is lacking 0 
i was hoping for more 0 
i definitly recommend 1 
the selection on the menu was great and so were the prices 1 
the microphone also works well but according to people i have called it applifies everything 1 
love this phone 1 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
i dont know exactly what it is about this movie but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our familys memories 1 
food was so gooodd 1 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
i recommend igo to anyone with different brand cell phonesmp3 players in the family 1 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
excellent sound battery life and inconspicuous to boot 1 
poor reliability 0 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
this item is great installed it let it charged up overnite and it has been working good every since with no problems 1 
its a gloriously fun fast paced and fairly accurate portrayal of the night of a raver 1 
this is was due to the fact that it took 20 minutes to be acknowledged then another 35 minutes to get our foodand they kept forgetting things 0 
if there was ever an indication of a writer and a directors ability to meld two highly volatile temperaments into a seamless union of creativity then this is it 1 
i think that it is a must see older john wayne film 1 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
the plot doesnt hang together at all and the acting is absolutely appalling 0 
the potatoes were great and so was the biscuit 1 
it really is impressive that the place hasnt closed down 0 
im not sure how long we stood there but it was long enough for me to begin to feel awkwardly out of place 0 
when i placed my treo into the case not only was it not snug but there was a lot of extra room on the sides 0 
same problem as others have mentioned 0 
first of all there are enough racial stereotypes and racial jokes to offend everyone 0 
a piece of cinematic garbage captured on celluloid 0 
i can think of no other film where something vitally important occurs every other minute 1 
the only good thing was our waiter he was very helpful and kept the bloddy marys coming 1 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
i ate there twice on my last visit and especially enjoyed the salmon salad 1 
we have tried 2 units and they both failed within 2 months pros 0 
will not be back 0 
everything about this movie is stupid 0 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
everyone is very attentive providing excellent customer service 1 
best ive found so far ive tried 2 other bluetooths and this one has the best quality for both me and the listener as well as ease of using 1 
all the pretty pictures in the world cannot make up for a piece of work that is flawed at the core 0 
i will never go back to this place and will never ever recommended this place to anyone 0 
phone now holds charge like it did when it was new 1 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
i received my orders well within the shipping timeframe everything was in good working order and overall i am very excited to have this source 1 
what a great double cheeseburger 1 
this movie now joins revenge of the boogeyman and zombiez as part of the hellish trinity of horror films 0 
so in a nutshell 1 the restaraunt smells like a combination of a dirty fish market and a sewer 0 
i love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it 1 
their daily specials are always a hit with my group 1 
i was not happy with this item 0 
this is one of the worst sandra bullock movie since speed 2 but not quite that bad 0 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
elias koteasjack palance play good roles angelina is hot and gets nakedbilly drago appears in this and is cool as usual a cameo by sven ole thorsen helps make this a very enjoyable movie with good acting and a decent budget 1 
the battery runs down quickly 0 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
the warm beer didnt help 0 
it was equally awful 0 
great food and great service in a clean and friendly setting 1 
it looked like a wonderful story 1 
insults profound deuchebaggery and had to go outside for a smoke break while serving just to solidify it 0 
overall a delight 1 
the problem was the script 0 
great time family dinner on a sunday night 1 
first time going but i think i will quickly become a regular 1 
everything about this product is wrongfirst 0 
a lot of websites have been rating this a very good phone and so do i 1 
the cashier was friendly and even brought the food out to me 1 
mobile phone tools are a must have 1 
all in all ha long bay was a bit of a flop 0 
unreliable im giving up 0 
i get absolutely horrible reception in my apartment where with other phones i have not had this problem 0 
the camera really likes her in this movie 1 
you can even take self portraits with the outside exterior display very cool 1 
worthwhile 1 
the film has great actors a master director a significant themeat least a wouldbe significant theme undertone of fifties existential worldweariness aerial scenes that ought to have thrilled both senses and imagination and characters about which one might deeply care 1 
fans of the genre will be in heaven 1 
the steak and the shrimp are in my opinion the best entrees at gc 1 
if you havent gone here go now 1 
what a waste of money and time 0 
the food was very good 1 
definitely not worth the 3 i paid 0 
save your money ive had this item for 11 months now 0 
if you look for authentic thai food go else where 0 
the chains which im no fan of beat this place easily 0 
and if that isnt enough of a mess of a movie for you the picture is also marred with a constant use of studio sets and indoor exteriors 0 
conclusion very filling meals 1 
the bt headset was such a disapoinment 0 
if you love death and decay and shakespears lyrics this is the one 1 
perhaps my phone is defective but people cannot hear me when i use this 0 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
not much seafood and like 5 strings of pasta at the bottom 0 
i would not recommend this place 0 
the scallop dish is quite appalling for value as well 0 
your brain will attempt to shutdown as part of a primal impulse of selfpreservation 0 
avoid avoid avoid 0 
both do good jobs and are quite amusing 1 
bt50 battery junk 0 
its uncomfortable and the sound quality is quite poor compared with the phone razr or with my previous wired headset that plugged into an lg 0 
as a sushi lover avoid this place by all means 0 
meredith m was better than all right 1 
this movie suffered because of the writing it needed more suspense 0 
seems like a good quick place to grab a bite of some familiar pub food but do yourself a favor and look elsewhere 0 
if it was to turn my good day feeling into a night of disturbing memories than i guess he succeeded 0 
the ambience is wonderful and there is music playing 1 
good case 1 
i love this thing 1 
kind of flops around 0 
the lead man is charismafree 0 
disappointing accessory from a good manufacturer 0 
the only possible way this movie could be redeemed would be as mst3k fodder 0 
that one didnt work either 0 
and i really did find them funny 1 
top line dont waste your time and money on this one its as bad as it comes 0 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
you need two hands to operate the screenthis software interface is decade old and cannot compete with new software designs 0 
o my gosh the best phone i have ever had 1 
the scallop dish is quite appalling for value as well 0 
still waiting im sure this item would work well if i ever recieve it 0 
both rickman and stowe play their roles to the hilt in this tale of a childrens book writer who maybe has written a subversive tract 1 
come hungry leave happy and stuffed 1 
the movie is terribly boring in places 0 
another thing i didnt really like is when a character got punched in the face a gallon of blood would spew forth soon after 0 
the awful dialogue and hopeless overacting by everyone who gets shot top off a real waste of space and time 0 
this is my new fav vegas buffet spot 1 
your staff spends more time talking to themselves than me 0 
food was average at best 0 
first time there and might just be the last 0 
the ambiance was incredible 1 
macbeth jason connery moved me to tears with his final monolog out brief candle outhe gave the sphere of moral decay and dark forces a human face which makes it the more interesting 1 
after two i felt disgusting 0 
this movie is terrible 0 
just does not work 0 
the plantains were the worst ive ever tasted 0 
great service and food 1 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
love the margaritas too 1 
however my girl was complain that some time the phone doesnt wake up like normal phone does 0 
clever and a real crowdpleaserthis film still ranks among mickeys best films even after 80 wonderful years 1 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
its a great item 1 
kids pizza is always a hit too with lots of great side dish options for the kiddos 1 
i love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it 1 
i wouldnt return 0 
i was totally fascinated by the music the dancing everything 1 
setup couldnt have been simpler 1 
food was below average 0 
it had some average acting from the main person and it was a low budget as you clearly can see 0 
loved itfriendly servers great food wonderful and imaginative menu 1 
i highly recommend this case 1 
i love the pho and the spring rolls oh so yummy you have to try 1 
worst ever 0 
they know how to make them here 1 
and it was way to expensive 0 
it was horrible 0 
kieslowski never ceases to amaze me 1 
its like a bad two hour tv movie 0 
earbud piece breaks easily 0 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
as always the evening was wonderful and the food delicious 1 
today was my first taste of a buldogis gourmet hot dog and i have to tell you it was more than i ever thought possible 1 
during several different 2 minute calls i experienced 5 drops and it was in an area that had 5 bars 0 
the poor actors 0 
the steak was amazingrge fillet relleno was the best seafood plate i have ever had 1 
five star plus plus 1 
it was horrendous 0 
there was no chemistry between ben affleck and sandra bullock in this film and i couldnt understand why he would consider even leaving his wifetobe for this chick that he supposedly was knocked out by 0 
we would recommend these to others 1 
perhaps i caught them on an off night judging by the other reviews but im not inspired to go back 0 
then our food came out disappointment ensued 0 
top line dont waste your time and money on this one its as bad as it comes 0 
i wasnt the least bit interested 0 
im trying to return it for a refund 0 
the only possible way this movie could be redeemed would be as mst3k fodder 0 
a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it 1 
the characters are fleshed out surprisingly well particularly grimes and blake and all the actors deliver their sharply scripted lines with just the right amount of deadpan tongue in cheek to make the dialogue both hilarious and realistic 1 
totally believable 1 
kieslowski never ceases to amaze me 1 
that company is a joke 0 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
nargile i think you are great 1 
all the bread is made inhouse 1 
i highly recommend this device to everyone 1 
i was hoping for more 0 
meredith m was better than all right 1 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
whatever the producer was going for he missed entirely 0 
the scallop dish is quite appalling for value as well 0 
all the bread is made inhouse 1 
its extremely slow and takes forever to do anything with it 0 
dont do it 0 
maybe there would be a reasonable explanation for this atrocity 0 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
nothing new there 0 
the story unfolds in 18th century jutland and the use of period music played on period instruments is just one more fine touch 1 
the phone gets extremely hot 0 
10 out of 10 stars 1 
its like a really sexy party in your mouth where youre outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party 1 
if you are looking for a good quality motorola headset keep looking this isnt it 0 
do not buy for d807wrongly advertised for d807 0 
it did not work in my cell phone plug i am very up set with the charger 0 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
however i needed some better instructions 0 
chinese forgeries abound 0 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
definitely worth seeing its the sort of thought provoking film that forces you to question your own threshold of loneliness 1 
what did bother me was the slow service 0 
good case 1 
i sat riveted to the tv screen 1 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
i probably would not go here again 0 
this hole in the wall has great mexican street tacos and friendly staff 1 
great for the jawbone 1 
instead we got a bore fest about a whiny spoiled brat babysitting 0 
using all earpieces left or right this thing will not stay on my ear 0 
it presents a idyllic yet serious portrayal of the ups and downs of the characters lives 1 
it wasnt busy either also the building was freezing cold 0 
it failed to convey the broad sweep of landscapes that were a great part of the original 0 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
its very slow 0 
speaking of the music it is unbearably predictably and kitchy 0 
my boyfriend and i came here for the first time on a recent trip to vegas and could not have been more pleased with the quality of food and service 1 
editing the editing of this film was phenomenal in my opinion 1 
took an hour to get our food only 4 tables in restaurant my food was luke warm our sever was running around like he was totally overwhelmed 0 
i totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is 1 
i love the pho and the spring rolls oh so yummy you have to try 1 
her lines seem to have been written by a fifteen year old though they are trying oh so so hard to sound like how a fifteen year old would really um you know well talk 0 
an awesome new look for fall 2000 1 
we sat another ten minutes and finally gave up and left 0 
but it does get better reception and clarity than any phone ive had before 1 
poor reliability 0 
as a sushi lover avoid this place by all means 0 
magical help 1 
and the sound quality is great 1 
disappointing accessory from a good manufacturer 0 
great atmosphere friendly and fast service 1 
both great 1 
spend your money and time some place else 0 
the service here is fair at best 0 
nice headset priced right 1 
they have a really nice atmosphere 1 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
the building itself seems pretty neat the bathroom is pretty trippy but i wouldnt eat here again 0 
i got it because it was so small and adorable 1 
ive had this bluetoooth headset for some time now and still not comfortable with the way it fits on the ear 0 
this is a great deal 1 
the camera really likes her in this movie 1 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
after a year the battery went completely dead on my headset 0 
only pros large seating area nice bar area great simple drink menu the best brick oven pizza with homemade dough 1 
50 down the drain 0 
it didnt make me scared horrified or make me sympathetic towards the characters it was simply annoying 0 
dont make the same mistake i did 0 
this movie is greatespecially if you enjoy visual arts 1 
i saw this movie and i thought this is a stupid movie 0 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
they have great dinners 1 
i do not know if this was emilio estevezs directorial debut but the pacing the interplay and development of the characters as well as some clever camera work surrounding the character estevez plays all suggest a natural eye 1 
crash is a depressing little nothing that provokes emotion but teaches you nothing if you already know racism and prejudice are bad things 0 
for that price i can think of a few place i would have much rather gone 0 
the only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive 1 
i really enjoyed eating here 1 
this case has passed the one year mark and while it shows signs of wear it is 100 functional 1 
the seller is very understanding and patient i would definitely buy from them again 1 
the screen does get smudged easily because it touches your ear and face 0 
this place is horrible and way overpriced 0 
the food was very good 1 
dont go here 0 
this movie is also revealing 1 
if that bug never showed up i would have given a 4 for sure but on the other side of the wall where this bug was climbing was the kitchen 0 
the guys all had steaks and our steak loving son who has had steak at the best and worst places said it was the best steak hes ever eaten 1 
oh the charger seems to work fine 1 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
i have had this phone for over a year now and i will tell you its not that great 0 
if you havent choked in your own vomit by the end by all the cheap drama and worthless dialogue youve must have bored yourself to death with this waste of time 0 
best tacos in town by far 1 
however bt headsets are currently not good for real time games like firstperson shooters since the audio delay messes me up 0 
furthermore you cant even find hours of operation on the website 0 
terrible management 0 
the sweet potato tots were good but the onion rings were perfection or as close as i have had 1 
when i received my pita it was huge it did have a lot of meat in it so thumbs up there 1 
disappointing 0 
woa talk about awful 0 
my husband and i ate lunch here and were very disappointed with the food and service 0 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
a good quality bargain i bought this after i bought a cheapy from big lots that sounded awful and people on the other end couldnt hear me 1 
unreliable im giving up 0 
another thing i didnt really like is when a character got punched in the face a gallon of blood would spew forth soon after 0 
and his subtle connections between the three films are awesome 1 
this is an extraordinary film 1 
i checked everywhere and there is no feature for it which is really disappointing 0 
her role was played well 1 
stay away from this store be careful 0 
i love being able to use one headset for both by landline and cell 1 
about ten minutes into this film i started having second thoughts 0 
setup couldnt have been simpler 1 
too bad cause i know its family owned i really wanted to like this place 0 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
the food is about on par with dennys which is to say not good at all 0 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
their steaks are 100 recommended 1 
this is a great restaurant at the mandalay bay 1 
i recently tried caballeros and i have been back every week since 1 
highly recommended 1 
i paid the bill but did not tip because i felt the server did a terrible job 0 
i hate movies like that 0 
about ten minutes into this film i started having second thoughts 0 
it was also the right balance of war and love 1 
definitely a bargain 1 
product was excellent and works better than the verizon one and boy was it cheaper 1 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
the ngage is still lacking in earbuds 0 
i saw this movie and i thought this is a stupid movie 0 
there is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again 0 
very friendly staff 1 
the concert sequences just sucked 0 
great service and food 1 
the flat reenactments dont hold your attention because they are emotionally adrift and stagy 0 
it is rare when a filmmaker takes the time to tell a worthy moral tale with care and love that doesnt fall into the trap of being overly syrupy or over indulgent 1 
only had this a month but its worked flawlessly so far 1 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
it definitely was not as good as my s11 1 
perhaps i caught them on an off night judging by the other reviews but im not inspired to go back 0 
really bad 0 
the food was very good 1 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
generally it just lacked imagination 0 
i love this thing 1 
nargile i think you are great 1 
obviously they have a terrible customer service so you get what you pay for 0 
what a disappointment 0 
they brought a fresh batch of fries and i was thinking yay something warm but no 0 
the acting helps the writing along very well maybe the idiotsavant sister could have been played better and it is a real joy to watch 1 
almost everyone involved must be return to school acting is utterly predictable and bad script is pile of garbage all round 0 
i had a pretty satifying experience 1 
but in any case the best part is you can download these pictures to your laptop using ir or even send pictures from your laptop to the phone 1 
service was good and the company was better 1 
all in all a great disappointment 0 
this one wants to surf on the small wave of space movies in 1998 deep impact and armageddon and this one fails everywhere 0 
this battery is an excellent bargain 1 
i got to enjoy the seafood salad with a fabulous vinegrette 1 
it didnt charge for me 0 
i dont think ive ever gone to a movie and disliked it as much 0 
jamie foxx absolutely is ray charles 1 
i will be back many times soon 1 
dessert panna cotta was amazing 1 
it is the best charger i have seen on the market yet 1 
so there is no way for me to plug it in here in the us unless i go by a converter 0 
i bought this phone as a replacement for my startac and have regretted it since 0 
weve have gotten a much better service from the pizza place next door than the services we received from this restaurant 0 
then our food came out disappointment ensued 0 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
this place was such a nice surprise 1 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
worst customer service 0 
battery is holding up well 1 
this place is horrible and way overpriced 0 
probably not in a hurry to go back 0 
its fits like a glove and is strong secure and durable 1 
prosgood camera very nice pictures also has cool styles like black and white and more 1 
the server was very negligent of our needs and made us feel very unwelcome i would not suggest this place 0 
i promise they wont disappoint 1 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
i got to enjoy the seafood salad with a fabulous vinegrette 1 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
the result is a powerhouse achievement made more timely now perhaps because of our cultures disturbing fascination with celebrity and its distorted interpretations of fame 1 
im glad i found this product on amazon it is hard to find it wasnt high priced 1 
the chains which im no fan of beat this place easily 0 
the food is not tasty at all not to say its real traditional hunan style 0 
i even dropped this phone into a stream and it was submerged for 15 seconds and it still works great 1 
furthermore you cant even find hours of operation on the website 0 
highly unprofessional and rude to a loyal patron 0 
what a great double cheeseburger 1 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
nice spicy and tender 1 
all things considered a job very well done 1 
then i watched it again two sundays ago march 20th 2005 and i began to really enjoy it and this time i taped the entire thing 1 
punishment park is a brilliant piece of cinema 1 
the scenes are often funny and occasionally touching as the characters evaluate their lives and where they are going 1 
worst martini ever 0 
this is some seriously good pizza and im an expertconnisseur on the topic 1 
theres barely a boring moment in the film and there are plenty of humorous parts 1 
end of days is one of the worst bigbudget action movies ive ever seen 0 
helen baxendale is a very credible lady macbeth who can be very cheerfull at times and sometimes she just looks like a naughty girl but deadly in her taste for blood and evil 1 
happy so far 1 
i love this place 1 
im not really sure how joeys was voted best hot dog in the valley by readers of phoenix magazine 0 
fantastic earphones 1 
bad quality 0 
disappointed with battery 0 
beware this is not a trashy cult movie this is trash period 0 
the script is a big flawed mess 0 
my order was not correct 0 
but then they came back cold 0 
the chefs were friendly and did a good job 1 
this may be the only bad film he ever made 0 
helen baxendale is a very credible lady macbeth who can be very cheerfull at times and sometimes she just looks like a naughty girl but deadly in her taste for blood and evil 1 
cooked to perfection and the service was impeccable 1 
i was not happy with this item 0 
service is perfect and the family atmosphere is nice to see 1 
the most annoying thing about cover girl is the way in which rita hayworth is put up on a pedestal 0 
his losing his marbles so early in the proceedings is totally implausible and unconvincing 0 
do not waste your money here 0 
what possesed me to get this junk i have no idea 0 
this review is long overdue since i consider a tale of two sisters to be the single greatest film ever made 1 
also notable is john baileys fine crisp beautifully colored cinematography and the great production design costumes by eiko ishioka who went on to do the memorable costumes for coppolas dracula for which she received a well deserved oscar 1 
i hate those things as much as cheap quality black olives 0 
the accompanied software is almost brilliant 1 
definitely not worth the 3 i paid 0 
over rated 0 
sucked most of the stuff does not work with my phone 0 
i love this place 1 
excellent product 1 
if only someone involved with it knew how to string together narrative 0 
i started this review with two stars but im editing it to give it only one 0 
funny clever hip just like prays previous film hype 1 
this short film certainly pulls no punches 0 
this is one of the better buffets that i have been to 1 
i really loved the story line and the poler bear was kinda cutebut if anyone has a question about fort steele just ask away 1 
the only place good for this film is in the garbage 0 
i received my orders well within the shipping timeframe everything was in good working order and overall i am very excited to have this source 1 
i waited and waited 0 
what on earth is irons doing in this film 0 
mic doesnt work 0 
very tough and very short on flavor 0 
you wont regret it 1 
we sat another ten minutes and finally gave up and left 0 
very disappointed and wondered how it could be in the oscar shortlist 0 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
nice spicy and tender 1 
plantronics bluetooth excelent buy 1 
my girlfriends veal was very bad 0 
it was that year however that reminded us that huston was still at the top of his game as evinced by his faithful adaptation of james joyces acclaimed novella the dead 1 
you share general loewenhielms exquisite joy in his partaking of the cailles en sarcophage even though you are just watching a movie but you do wish for just a small sample to savor 1 
artless camerawork endlessly presents us with the ugliest setting imaginable ie 0 
i highly recommend this movie for anyone interested in art poetry theater politics or japanese history 1 
this scene is very strong and unpleasant 0 
waste of money 0 
the seller is very understanding and patient i would definitely buy from them again 1 
if you do go see this movie bring a pillow or a girlfriendboyfriend to keep you occupied through out 0 
this was one of the worst films i have ever seen 0 
regrettably the film fails 0 
the instructions didnt explain that a microphone jack could be used 0 
if i take a picture the battery drops a bar and starts beeping letting me know its dieing 0 
same problem as others have mentioned 0 
a piece of cinematic garbage captured on celluloid 0 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
the warm beer didnt help 0 
we waited for forty five minutes in vain 0 
lovely little thriller from hitchcock with lots of nice shenanigans surrounding a murdered spy a kidnapped child a nasty church a foreign plot and some random taxidermists 1 
today the graphics are crap 0 
the soundtrack wasnt terrible either 1 
will not be back 0 
and considering the two of us left there very full and happy for about 20 you just cant go wrong 1 
when my mom and i got home she immediately got sick and she only had a few bites of salad 0 
i immediately said i wanted to talk to the manager but i did not want to talk to the guy who was doing shots of fireball behind the bar 0 
someone shouldve invented this sooner 1 
yes its that bad 0 
if you love death and decay and shakespears lyrics this is the one 1 
your staff spends more time talking to themselves than me 0 
the volume for the ringer is real good you have choices how loud 1 
excellent performance 1 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
its a fresh subtle and rather sublime effect 1 
my fiancé and i came in the middle of the day and we were greeted and seated right away 1 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
waitress was a little slow in service 0 
never heard of any of them except cole who was totally unbelievable in the part 0 
is it possible for a movie to get any worse than this 0 
i asked multiple times for the wine list and after some time of being ignored i went to the hostess and got one myself 0 
it is perfect for a sitdown family meal or get together with a few friends 1 
magical help 1 
my girlfriends veal was very bad 0 
reasonably priced also 1 
then i exchanged for the same phone even that had the same problem 0 
soggy and not good 0 
star trek v the final frontier is the worst in the series 0 
best service and food ever maria our server was so good and friendly she made our day 1 
i love this cable it allows me to connect any miniusb device to my pc 1 
this was reflected not only in the cast but also in the belowpar script which borrowed much from the earlier classic 0 
the steak was amazingrge fillet relleno was the best seafood plate i have ever had 1 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
there is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again 0 
it crackles with an unpredictable youthful energy but honestly i found it hard to follow and concentrate on it meanders so badly 0 
the result is a powerhouse achievement made more timely now perhaps because of our cultures disturbing fascination with celebrity and its distorted interpretations of fame 1 
furthermore you cant even find hours of operation on the website 0 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
best of luck to the rude and noncustomer service focused new management 0 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
rip off over charge shipping 0 
very windresistant 1 
i have been in more than a few bars in vegas and do not ever recall being charged for tap water 0 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
i was very disappointed in the movie 0 
what a big waste of time 0 
the flat reenactments dont hold your attention because they are emotionally adrift and stagy 0 
im pleased 1 
a good time 1 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
this may be the only bad film he ever made 0 
it seems completely secure both holding on to my belt and keeping the iphone inside 1 
also great directing and photography 1 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
spend your money and time some place else 0 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
this is a simple little phone to use but the breakage is unacceptible 0 
works fine 1 
the plot well i said id let that one go 0 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
the chains which im no fan of beat this place easily 0 
delicious 1 
definitely not worth the 3 i paid 0 
the ripped banana was not only ripped but petrified and tasteless 0 
its uncomfortable and the sound quality is quite poor compared with the phone razr or with my previous wired headset that plugged into an lg 0 
battery chargelife is quite long 1 
chinese forgeries abound 0 
the scenes with the ohsomature neighbourgirl are a misplace 0 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
what makes this story different are the terrific production values faultless photography composition and editing the terrific casting the underappreciated brian keith playing a bully teddy and vivid history 1 
this particular model would not work with my motorola q smartphone 0 
waste of money 0 
id say that would be the hardest decision honestly all of ms dishes taste how they are supposed to taste amazing 1 
it rocked my world and is certainly a must see for anyone with no social or physical outlets 1 
the ngage is still lacking in earbuds 0 
the kids are very cool too 1 
utterly without merit on any level this is akin to torture 0 
50 down the drain 0 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
i own 2 of these cases and would order another 1 
great sound and service 1 
my mother and brother had to do thiswhen i saw robert ryan portraying this type of man it was a very good imitation of this type of individual and i was impressed 1 
then i exchanged for the same phone even that had the same problem 0 
the plot well i said id let that one go 0 
the worst phone from samsungcrap this crappy samsung e715 is the worst i have ever seeen 0 
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
dont waste your time 0 
a lot of websites have been rating this a very good phone and so do i 1 
she ordered a toasted english muffin that came out untoasted 0 
the battery is unreliable as well as the service use antena 0 
the feel of the dining room was more college cooking course than high class dining and the service was slow at best 0 
crisp and clear 1 
cheap but hey it works was pleasantly suprised given the low cost of this item 1 
when im on this side of town this will definitely be a spot ill hit up again 1 
i probably wont be coming back here 0 
as a sushi lover avoid this place by all means 0 
works as described 1 
fantastic food 1 
pretty awesome place 1 
nicest chinese restaurant ive been in a while 1 
service was good and the company was better 1 
this is definitely one of the better documentaries i have seen looking at family relationships and marriage 1 
yet i enjoy watching it 1 
this mostly routine factbased tv drama gets a boost from the fine performance by cole 1 
those phones are working just fine now 1 
the real disappointment was our waiter 0 
also great directing and photography 1 
service is quick and even to go orders are just like we like it 1 
its pure brilliance 1 
this is a disgrace 0 
the staff was very attentive 1 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
is it possible for a movie to get any worse than this 0 
i own a jabra earset and was very happy with it but the sound quality especially outgoing on this is better 1 
bad fit way too big 0 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
worst foodservice ive had in a while 0 
very clear quality sound and you dont have to mess with the sound on your ipod since you have the sound buttons on the headset 1 
not enough volume 0 
i cant believe theres even a sequel to this 0 
this isnt a small family restaurant this is a fine dining establishment 1 
awsome device works great 1 
fantastic service here 1 
maybe its just their vegetarian fare but ive been twice and i thought it was average at best 0 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
they will customize your order any way youd like my usual is eggplant with green bean stir fry love it 1 
best tacos in town by far 1 
bluetooth range is good a few days ago i left my phone in the trunk got a call and carried the conversation without a hitch 1 
this early film from future goremeister lucio fulci is a very good addition to the giallo subgenre 1 
i really do recommend this place you can go wrong with this donut place 1 
one of the most disappointing aspects is the lack of notable gore 0 
i liked this movie way too much 1 
this phone is slim and light and the display is beautiful 1 
best service and food ever maria our server was so good and friendly she made our day 1 
great food and great service in a clean and friendly setting 1 
the movie in movie situations in the beginning and through the game that is played with her by the acting coach are fascinating 1 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
this is a good joint 1 
this movie does an excellent job of revealing the complexity of the task and the incredible challenges facing south africa 1 
1 hour 54 minutes of sheer tedium melodrama and horrible acting a mess of a script and a sinking feeling of good lord what were they thinking 0 
but in terms of the writing its very fresh and bold 1 
this phone tries very hard to do everything but fails at its very ability to be a phone 0 
the vegetables are so fresh and the sauce feels like authentic thai 1 
it is cheap and it feel and look just as cheap 0 
it was a very superficial movie and it gave me the feeling that i was watching play rather than a film 0 
poorly contstruct hinge 0 
i love their fries and their beans 1 
service stinks here 0 
very disappointed and wondered how it could be in the oscar shortlist 0 
your staff spends more time talking to themselves than me 0 
good case excellent value 1 
we walked away stuffed and happy about our first vegas buffet experience 1 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
there is no plot or storyline 0 
this is the phone to get for 2005 i just bought my s710a and all i can say is wow 1 
as for the service im a fan because its quick and youre being served by some nice folks 1 
considering the relations off screen between taylor and stanwyck it was surprising how little chemistry there was on screen between the two of them 0 
this is a great deal 1 
worst customer service 0 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
perhaps my phone is defective but people cannot hear me when i use this 0 
unfortunately it did not work 0 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
excellent product for the price 1 
an hour and a half i wish i could bring back 0 
a good film by a great director 1 
once your food arrives its meh 0 
avoid this one if you can 0 
a good quality bargain i bought this after i bought a cheapy from big lots that sounded awful and people on the other end couldnt hear me 1 
both do good jobs and are quite amusing 1 
very comfortable 1 
the acting was bad 0 
its a piece of crap 0 
the buffet at bellagio was far from what i anticipated 0 
the acting is fantastic the stories are seamlessly woven together and the dogs are splendid a must rent view or see 1 
they were goldencrispy and delicious 1 
very windresistant 1 
definitely not worth the 3 i paid 0 
you learn a lot about the real inside emotions of people in this movie and a lot about the movie business itself 1 
it also took her forever to bring us the check when we asked for it 0 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
in a word it is embarrassing 0 
each track commands sentiment actually contributing to the scenes and characters 1 
much better than the other ayce sushi place i went to in vegas 1 
i took back my money and got outta there 0 
it has a very good plot it holds your complete attention the acting is superb tom wilkinson was fantastic and emily watson was also very good 1 
there is no real plot 0 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
it is a very well acted and done tv movie 1 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
i came back today since they relocated and still not impressed 0 
a good time 1 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
poor talk time performance 0 
funny clever hip just like prays previous film hype 1 
disapointing results 0 
the battery is working well as a replacement for the original that came with the phone over 2 years ago 1 
the film is well paced understated and one of the best courtroom documentaries ive seen 1 
it has a great camera thats 2mp and the pics are nice and clear with great picture quality 1 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
this blueant supertooth handsfree phone speaker is awesome 1 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
the cow tongue and cheek tacos are amazing 1 
very good though 1 
i did not expect this to be so good 1 
things happen characters personalities change plot twists occur for no real reason other than that script calls for it 0 
john garfield ann revere lilli plmer william conrad canada leeand filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screenjames wong howe 1 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
this was utterly confusing at first which caused me to lose a couple of very very important contacts 0 
the only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port irda 0 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
the good cinematography also makes her and monica bellucci look very beautiful 1 
see it with your kids if you have a chanceit will open up some amazing dialog about how far race relations have come in the last 50 years 1 
but then they came back cold 0 
great movie 1 
he surely doesnt know how to make a coherent action movie from the screenwriter of air force one who was only obliged to write the script just for a big sum of money 0 
just really good so far probably the best bt headset i have ever had 1 
she ordered a toasted english muffin that came out untoasted 0 
the speaker is of low quality so as making the ring tones sound very cheap 0 
cant get the software to work with my computer 0 
thanks again to amazon for having the things i need for a good price 1 
i love that they put their food in nice plastic containers as opposed to cramming it in little paper takeout boxes 1 
great place to relax and have an awesome burger and beer 1 
all the pretty pictures in the world cannot make up for a piece of work that is flawed at the core 0 
the bose noise cancelling is amazing which is very important for a nyc commuter 1 
yes its shiny on front side and i love it 1 
there was no chemistry between ben affleck and sandra bullock in this film and i couldnt understand why he would consider even leaving his wifetobe for this chick that he supposedly was knocked out by 0 
i wasnt expecting oscar material but this 0 
he owns the film just as spacek owned coal miners daughter and quaid owned great balls of fire 1 
i have had this phone for over a year now and i will tell you its not that great 0 
it was a huge awkward 15lb piece of cow that was 34ths gristle and fat 0 
really really good rice all the time 1 
im using it with an iriver spinn with case and it fits fine 1 
this is so embarassing and also my ears hurt if i try to push the ear plug into my ear 0 
just does not work 0 
what a waste 0 
reversible plug works great 1 
today the graphics are crap 0 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
but whatever it was that cost them so much it didnt translate to quality thats for sure 0 
i love this phone it is very handy and has a lot of features 1 
what happened next was prettyoff putting 0 
its worth driving up from tucson 1 
i was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar not only because the quality is great but the service is fast and the food impeccable 1 
so far so good 1 
its like a bad two hour tv movie 0 
last time buying from you 0 
pricing is a bit of a concern at mellow mushroom 0 
these headphones were a great find and i think they are perhaps the best purchase ive made in the last several years seriously 1 
on the negative its insipid enough to cause regret for another 2 hours of life wasted in front of the screen 0 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
if youre not familiar check it out 1 
the cashier had no care what so ever on what i had to say it still ended up being wayyy overpriced 0 
this place is not worth your time let alone vegas 0 
pretty cool i would say 1 
i dont think you will be disappointed 1 
i would highly recommend this 1 
hard to judge whether these sides were good because we were grossed out by the melted styrofoam and didnt want to eat it for fear of getting sick 0 
i know he was a contract player with little control over his scripts but the acting was as bad as the script 0 
level 5 spicy was perfect where spice didnt overwhelm the soup 1 
great phone 1 
generally it just lacked imagination 0 
del taco is pretty nasty and should be avoided if possible 0 
great audio 1 
service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is vegas and located inside the crystals shopping mall by aria 1 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
you have to hold the phone at a particular angle for the other party to hear you clearly 0 
took an hour to get our food only 4 tables in restaurant my food was luke warm our sever was running around like he was totally overwhelmed 0 
i love this phone 1 
we loved the biscuits 1 
i wont say any more i dont like spoilers so i dont want to be one but i believe this film is worth your time 1 
light weight i hardly notice it is there 1 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
fantastic earphones 1 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
we loved the biscuits 1 
i hate movies like that 0 
the characters are fleshed out surprisingly well particularly grimes and blake and all the actors deliver their sharply scripted lines with just the right amount of deadpan tongue in cheek to make the dialogue both hilarious and realistic 1 
i got the car charger and not even after a week the charger was brokeni went to plug it in and it started smoking 0 
i highly recommend this case 1 
conclusion i loved it 1 
the movie in movie situations in the beginning and through the game that is played with her by the acting coach are fascinating 1 
the battery is completely useless to me 0 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
light weight i hardly notice it is there 1 
then i had to continue pairing it periodically since it somehow kept dropping 0 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
the acting was bad 0 
the memories are murky but i can only say that i enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show 1 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
i would not recommend this place 0 
much better than the other ayce sushi place i went to in vegas 1 
it even has its sweet moments 1 
it dit not work most of the time with my nokia 5320 0 
ill definitely be in soon again 1 
the service was extremely slow 0 
lot of holes in the plot theres nothing about how he became the emperor nothing about where he spend 20 years between his childhood and mature age 0 
it was pretty gross 0 
i dont have very many words to say about this place but it does everything pretty well 1 
id love to go back 1 
end of days is one of the worst bigbudget action movies ive ever seen 0 
all the characters in this film are tremendously well played 1 
great service and food 1 
a good quality bargain i bought this after i bought a cheapy from big lots that sounded awful and people on the other end couldnt hear me 1 
add betty white and jean smart and you have a great cast everyone played their parts really well 1 
this is one of the worst sandra bullock movie since speed 2 but not quite that bad 0 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
then the film just dropped the ball 0 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
also great directing and photography 1 
item does not match picture 0 
it came free with a dvd player i bought but i still turned the thing off halfway through because i was embarrassed for howell 0 
what should have been a hilarious yummy christmas eve dinner to remember was the biggest fail of the entire trip for us 0 
you wont regret it 1 
i love it 1 
still its quite interesting and entertaining to follow 1 
the plot is nonsense that doesnt interest in the slightest way or have any uniqueness to it 0 
a standout scene 1 
editing the editing of this film was phenomenal in my opinion 1 
lame would be the best way to describe it 0 
works well 1 
worst foodservice ive had in a while 0 
i dont think ive ever gone to a movie and disliked it as much 0 
clever and a real crowdpleaserthis film still ranks among mickeys best films even after 80 wonderful years 1 
the accompanied software is almost brilliant 1 
he is an amazing film artist one of the most important whoever lived 1 
disappointed 0 
i found the product to be easy to set up and use 1 
this is definitely a cult classic well worth viewing and sharing with others 1 
this was my first time and i cant wait until the next 1 
it clicks into place in a way that makes you wonder how long that mechanism would last 0 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
i like the fact that it rests lightly against your ear rather than inside 1 
the seasonal fruit was fresh white peach puree 1 
the shipping time was also very quick 1 
i received my supposedly new motorola 375 and apparently there was not a match between the phone and the charger 0 
i left the theater with a lilt in my step joy in my heart and hope for the human race 1 
there are so many problems i dont know where to start 0 
the battery works great 1 
this scene is very strong and unpleasant 0 
its this pandering to the audience that sabotages most of his films 0 
excellent service 1 
he is one of my favourite directors and one of the most talented directors in the history of cinema 1 
del taco is pretty nasty and should be avoided if possible 0 
for a self proclaimed coffee cafe i was wildly disappointed 0 
the good cinematography also makes her and monica bellucci look very beautiful 1 
doesnt last long 0 
both of the egg rolls were fantastic 1 
this phone works great 1 
i great reception all the time 1 
the nachos are a must have 1 
the sides are delish mixed mushrooms yukon gold puree white corn beateous 1 
not good by any stretch of the imagination 0 
you wont regret it 1 
integrated seamlessly with the motorola razr phone 1 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
improper description i had to return it 0 
piece of junk 0 
hell no will i go back 0 
even worse than ticker 0 
he deserves 5 stars 1 
then i exchanged for the same phone even that had the same problem 0 
the poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying 0 
all the actors give a wonderful performance especially jennifer rubin as jamie harris who changes from the nervous starlet in the beginning through the strange events she is part of to the cool star 1 
characters are onedimensional even the good guys and especially the bad guys 0 
very good food great atmosphere1 1 
how stupid is that 0 
it isnt even an achievement as a sobaditsgood or sobaditsmemorable movie 0 
both the hot sour the egg flower soups were absolutely 5 stars 1 
prosgood camera very nice pictures also has cool styles like black and white and more 1 
its a great item 1 
bland not a liking this place for a number of reasons and i dont want to waste time on bad reviewing ill leave it at that 0 
yeah the movie pretty much sucked 0 
their onscreen chemistry critical to the entire film is genuine 1 
his performance is simply genius 1 
but it is great i would really recommend it 1 
the acting was bad 0 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
im trying to return it for a refund 0 
painful on the ear 0 
good food good service 1 
this place is horrible and way overpriced 0 
about ten minutes into this film i started having second thoughts 0 
avoid this establishment 0 
you need at least 3 mins to get to your phone book from the time you first turn on the phonebattery life is short 0 
tom wilkinson broke my heart at the end and everyone elses judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike 1 
the calls drop the phone comes on and off at will the screen goes black and the worst of all it stops ringing intermittently 0 
they are so easy to love but even more easy to identify with 1 
i checked out this place a couple years ago and was not impressed 0 
i bought two of them and neither will charge 0 
main thing i didnt enjoy is that the crowd is of older crowd around mid 30s and up 0 
delicious and i will absolutely be back 1 
this is was due to the fact that it took 20 minutes to be acknowledged then another 35 minutes to get our foodand they kept forgetting things 0 
i would definitely recommend the jabra bt250v for those who are looking for comfort clarity and a great price 1 
so bad 0 
today was my first taste of a buldogis gourmet hot dog and i have to tell you it was more than i ever thought possible 1 
i never walked out of a movie faster 0 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
the structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema 1 
i ordered the voodoo pasta and it was the first time id had really excellent pasta since going gluten free several years ago 1 
phone now holds charge like it did when it was new 1 
buyer beware you could flush money right down the toilet 0 
crust is not good 0 
its just lame 0 
the most annoying thing about cover girl is the way in which rita hayworth is put up on a pedestal 0 
loved the casting of jimmy buffet as the science teacher 1 
restored my phone to like new performance 1 
unfortunately it was not good 0 
i was sitting in my vehicle with the cradle on my belt and the headset lost signal 0 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
the majority of the logitech earbud headsets failed 0 
is it possible for a movie to get any worse than this 0 
the salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop which was perfectly cooked 1 
truly awful 0 
ill definitely be in soon again 1 
delete this film from your mind 0 
this place is like chipotle but better 1 
a good time 1 
must have been an off night at this place 0 
both the hot sour the egg flower soups were absolutely 5 stars 1 
very satisifed with that 1 
setup went very smoothly 1 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
its this pandering to the audience that sabotages most of his films 0 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
definitely worth checking out 1 
i highly recommend this movie for anyone interested in art poetry theater politics or japanese history 1 
i wear glasses and it fits fine with them 1 
works great 1 
unfortunately this is a bad movie that is just plain bad 0 
it was an inexpensive piece but i would still have expected better quality 0 
what a great double cheeseburger 1 
the sweet potato fries were very good and seasoned well 1 
these are fabulous 1 
you cant beat the price on these 1 
it is zillion times away from reality 0 
my gyro was basically lettuce only 0 
prosgood camera very nice pictures also has cool styles like black and white and more 1 
not too screamy not to masculine but just right 1 
nice headphones for the price and they work great 1 
their chow mein is so good 1 
unreliable im giving up 0 
but now that it is out of warranty the same problems reoccurebottom line put your money somewhere else cingular will not support it 0 
this is definitely one of the better documentaries i have seen looking at family relationships and marriage 1 
great steak great sides great wine amazing desserts 1 
highly entertaining at all angles 1 
he owns the film just as spacek owned coal miners daughter and quaid owned great balls of fire 1 
i went to bachi burger on a friends recommendation and was not disappointed 1 
i ordered the lemon raspberry ice cocktail which was also incredible 1 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
i love it 1 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
this mostly routine factbased tv drama gets a boost from the fine performance by cole 1 
jabra ear gels r the best 1 
honeslty it didnt taste that fresh 0 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
very pleased with this headset 1 
i wasnt expecting oscar material but this 0 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
the bose noise cancelling is amazing which is very important for a nyc commuter 1 
it rocked my world and is certainly a must see for anyone with no social or physical outlets 1 
the server was very negligent of our needs and made us feel very unwelcome i would not suggest this place 0 
the characters were all funny and had the peculiarity of not having a true lead character 1 
we waited for forty five minutes in vain 0 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
it is worth the drive 1 
the scenes are often funny and occasionally touching as the characters evaluate their lives and where they are going 1 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
bluetooth does not work phone locks up screens just flash up and now it just makes calls randomly while in my pocket locked 0 
but then they came back cold 0 
great movie 1 
avoid this establishment 0 
any grandmother can make a roasted chicken better than this one 0 
the only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port irda 0 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
the phone crashed completely and now i have to get it replaced 0 
very disappointed and wondered how it could be in the oscar shortlist 0 
i think i was one of the people who found this another one of roths pearls 1 
i would recommend saving room for this 1 
it also took her forever to bring us the check when we asked for it 0 
its just painful 0 
theres barely a boring moment in the film and there are plenty of humorous parts 1 
works great 1 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
if you do go see this movie bring a pillow or a girlfriendboyfriend to keep you occupied through out 0 
but now i was completely grossed out 0 
the phone takes forever to charge like 2 to 5 hours literally 0 
delicious and i will absolutely be back 1 
for that price i can think of a few place i would have much rather gone 0 
i love this cable it allows me to connect any miniusb device to my pc 1 
it is a very well acted and done tv movie 1 
however after finally watching this film i realized that not only had i had a closed mind to the brilliance it depicts i also found myself watching it over and over again 1 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
the film is way too long 0 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
i did not expect this to be so good 1 
the first time i ever came here i had an amazing experience i still tell people how awesome the duck was 1 
sucked most of the stuff does not work with my phone 0 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
it presents a idyllic yet serious portrayal of the ups and downs of the characters lives 1 
would not recommend to others 0 
but it wasnt anything at all just one big yawn 0 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
the waitresses are very friendly 1 
poor construction 0 
used and dirty 0 
motorola finally got the voice quality of a bluetooth headset right 1 
i dont think ill be running back to carlys anytime soon for food 0 
piece of trash 0 
even when the women finally show up there is no sign of improvement the most expected things happen and by the time the film is over you might be far asleep 0 
i really enjoyed eating here 1 
voice quality signal strength dropped calls 0 
but in terms of the writing its very fresh and bold 1 
great product for the price 1 
the jalapeno bacon is soooo good 1 
unfortunately any virtue in this films production work was lost on a regrettable script 0 
but this movie really got to me 1 
the writers were smack on and i think the best actors and actresses were a bonus to the showthese characters were so real 1 
total waste of time 0 
i would advise to not purchase this item it never worked very well 0 
i was shocked because no signs indicate cash only 0 
the phone takes forever to charge like 2 to 5 hours literally 0 
god and i can never get that 90 minutes back 0 
it clicks into place in a way that makes you wonder how long that mechanism would last 0 
be sure to order dessert even if you need to pack it togo the tiramisu and cannoli are both to die for 1 
i seriously cannot believe that the owner has so many unexperienced employees that all are running around like chickens with their heads cut off 0 
you need two hands to operate the screenthis software interface is decade old and cannot compete with new software designs 0 
poor sound quality 0 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
utter crap sound quality is terrible 0 
item does not match picture 0 
unfortunately it did not work 0 
kind of hard to mess up a steak but they did 0 
i hate those things as much as cheap quality black olives 0 
the yellowtail carpaccio was melt in your mouth fresh 1 
when i opened the sandwich i was impressed but not in a good way 0 
battery chargelife is quite long 1 
bela lugosi was totally extraneous intoning odd lines 0 
returned 8 hours later 0 
at a time when it seems that film animation has been dominated by disneypixars cgi masterpieces it is both refreshing and comforting to know that miyazaki is still relying on traditional handdrawn animation to tell his charming and enchanting stories 1 
we are so glad we found this place 1 
light weight i hardly notice it is there 1 
great pizza and salads 1 
when my mom and i got home she immediately got sick and she only had a few bites of salad 0 
i know that sounds funny but to me it seemed like sketchy technology that wouldnt work wellwell this one works great 1 
the design is very odd as the ear clip is not very comfortable at all 0 
sooooo good 1 
this movie now joins revenge of the boogeyman and zombiez as part of the hellish trinity of horror films 0 
highly recommend for any one who has a blue tooth phone 1 
the nachos are a must have 1 
as for the killer dont expect anything original or even remotely frightening 0 
in the span of an hour i had two people exclaim whoa is that the new phone on tv 1 
i took back my money and got outta there 0 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
i love it 1 
i have been very happy with the 510 and have had no complaints from any one regarding my sound quality on their end 1 
nevertheless yet another wonderful film from the great masters stable 1 
and the sound quality is great 1 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
these products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet 0 
plantronics bluetooth excelent buy 1 
pretty good beer selection too 1 
an hour seriously 0 
great product fast shipping 1 
having trouble with volume 0 
avoid at all costs 0 
this was a different cut than the piece the other day but still wonderful and tender s well as well flavored 1 
not nearly as good looking as the amazon picture makes it look 0 
then scene where they debated whether or not to sack the trumpeter who falsely was accused for the murder is pure horror really stupid 0 
its been my choice headset for yearsgreat sound good volume good noise cancellation 1 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
worst hour and a half of my lifeoh my gosh 0 
worst ever 0 
crust is not good 0 
we had so much to say about the place before we walked in that he expected it to be amazing but was quickly disappointed 0 
i think i was one of the people who found this another one of roths pearls 1 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
he is almost unbearable to watch on screen he has little to no charisma and terrible comedic timing 0 
i saw this movie and i thought this is a stupid movie 0 
if you love death and decay and shakespears lyrics this is the one 1 
i was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar not only because the quality is great but the service is fast and the food impeccable 1 
all the actors give a wonderful performance especially jennifer rubin as jamie harris who changes from the nervous starlet in the beginning through the strange events she is part of to the cool star 1 
it was horrible 0 
then our food came out disappointment ensued 0 
great time family dinner on a sunday night 1 
being a 90s child i truly enjoyed this show and i can proudly say that i enjoyed it big time and even more than the classical wb cartoons 1 
it did not work in my cell phone plug i am very up set with the charger 0 
once your food arrives its meh 0 
its very attractive and appears to be of good quality 1 
these products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet 0 
initially the local sites in the film which was filmed here in buffalo intrigued me 1 
the dialogue sucked 0 
my gyro was basically lettuce only 0 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
i wouldnt return 0 
i dont recommend unless your car breaks down in front of it and you are starving 0 
both do good jobs and are quite amusing 1 
i just dont know how this place managed to served the blandest food i have ever eaten when they are preparing indian cuisine 0 
great product 1 
sounds good reasonably priced and effective its that simple 1 
steer clear of this product and go with the genuine palm replacementr pens which come in a threepack 0 
basically the service was very bad 0 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
you learn a lot about the real inside emotions of people in this movie and a lot about the movie business itself 1 
the acting sucks the music sucks the script sucks the pacing sucks the special fx suck the directing sucks basically this movie sucks 0 
definitely a turn off for me i doubt ill be back unless someone else is buying 0 
the holster that arrived did not match the photo in the ad 0 
i would not recommend this place 0 
these are the central themes of the film and they are handled ineptly stereotypically and with no depth of imagination 0 
very pleased with this headset 1 
the jalapeno bacon is soooo good 1 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
graphics is far from the best part of the game 0 
the budget was evidently very limited 0 
its quite simply the highest most superlative form of cinema imaginable 1 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
thank you for wasting my money 0 
all in all im quite satisfied with this purchase 1 
total brunch fail 0 
works for me 1 
server did a great job handling our large rowdy table 1 
it was either too cold not enough flavor or just bad 0 
excellent sound quality 1 
same evening him and i are both drastically sick 0 
i give it 2 thumbs down 0 
disappointing 0 
i own a jabra earset and was very happy with it but the sound quality especially outgoing on this is better 1 
if the food isnt bad enough for you then enjoy dealing with the worlds worstannoying drunk people 0 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
it presents a idyllic yet serious portrayal of the ups and downs of the characters lives 1 
the camera really likes her in this movie 1 
ill even say it again  this is torture 0 
as for the mains also uninspired 0 
its the one movie that never ceases to interest me simply because it keeps me alert as i try to attempt to decipher its meanings 1 
it doesnt work in europe or asia 0 
doesnt work at all i bougth it for my l7c and its not working 0 
ps the only scene in the movie that was cool is when the central character finds her room blown up 1 
there are the usual hitchcock logic flaws 0 
every thing on phone work perfectly she like it 1 
extremely tasty 1 
the reception is excellent 1 
highquality chicken on the chicken caesar salad 1 
we asked for the bill to leave without eating and they didnt bring that either 0 
bt50 battery junk 0 
the seller is very understanding and patient i would definitely buy from them again 1 
the goat taco didnt skimp on the meat and wow what flavor 1 
this product had a strong rubberpetroleum smell that was unbearable after a while and caused me to return it 0 
i have to use the smallest earpieces provided but it stays on pretty well 1 
the story is also both funny and poignant at times 1 
on a positive note our server was very attentive and provided great service 1 
before i go in to why i gave a 1 star rating please know that this was my third time eating at bachi burger before writing a review 0 
it looks very nice 1 
the vegetables are so fresh and the sauce feels like authentic thai 1 
seafood was limited to boiled shrimp and crab legs but the crab legs definitely did not taste fresh 0 
it was a pale color instead of nice and char and has no flavor 0 
bad characters bad story and bad acting 0 
i purchased this and within 2 days it was no longer working 0 
it just blew 0 
ive bought 5 wired headphones that sound better than these 0 
this wonderful experience made this place a muststop whenever we are in town again 1 
phone falls out easily 0 
but then they came back cold 0 
favorite place in town for shawarrrrrrma 1 
i love the camera its really pretty good quality 1 
i went to bachi burger on a friends recommendation and was not disappointed 1 
the service was poor and thats being nice 0 
i felt asleep the first time i watched it so i can recommend it for insomniacs 0 
ive seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie 0 
this movie suffered because of the writing it needed more suspense 0 
conclusion i loved it 1 
the lead man is charismafree 0 
the attention given to every character and complex psychological portrayals detailing loyalty treachery love and hope are tremendous 1 
krussel always good 1 
what is even more stupid is that who had thought an idea that there should be a volcano in los angeles 0 
i would recommend purchasing the jabra jx10 series 2 which works flawlessly with my moto q go figure 1 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
a very good film indeed about great and unconditional love 1 
considering the relations off screen between taylor and stanwyck it was surprising how little chemistry there was on screen between the two of them 0 
they could be used as exemplars for any set designer 1 
the most annoying thing about cover girl is the way in which rita hayworth is put up on a pedestal 0 
punishment park is a brilliant piece of cinema 1 
my phone doesnt slide around my car now and the grip prevents my phone from slipping out of my hand 1 
i have tried these cables with my computer and my ipod and it works just fine 1 
their onscreen chemistry critical to the entire film is genuine 1 
if this premise sound stupid thats because it is 0 
i dont think there are any redeeming qualities in this remake 0 
unfortunately it did not work 0 
we would recommend these to others 1 
our server was very nice and even though he looked a little overwhelmed with all of our needs he stayed professional and friendly until the end 1 
that one didnt work either 0 
the cast is always entertaining as usual 1 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
it isnt even an achievement as a sobaditsgood or sobaditsmemorable movie 0 
a good time 1 
very good lunch spot 1 
bad characters bad story and bad acting 0 
the movie was so boring that i sometimes found myself occupied peaking in the paper instead of watching never happened during a columbo movie before 0 
great food and service huge portions and they give a military discount 1 
waitress was good though 1 
it is zillion times away from reality 0 
ps the only scene in the movie that was cool is when the central character finds her room blown up 1 
one of the most disappointing aspects is the lack of notable gore 0 
i saw this movie and i thought this is a stupid movie 0 
one more thing i can tolerate political incorrectness very well im all for artistic freedom and suspension of disbelief but the slavic female character was just too much 0 
by this time our side of the restaurant was almost empty so there was no excuse 0 
highly entertaining at all angles 1 
this wonderful experience made this place a muststop whenever we are in town again 1 
started watching this but didnt believe in any of the characters 0 
i bought two of them and neither will charge 0 
which is precisely why i am giving it such a bad review 0 
considering the relations off screen between taylor and stanwyck it was surprising how little chemistry there was on screen between the two of them 0 
the performances are real and gripping the crocdodile is extremely well done indeed if the black water website is to be believed thats because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous 1 
special mention should be made of the superb music score and sound effects which are an integral element in helping to make this such a memorable and enjoyable cartoon 1 
an italian reviewer called this a small great film and thats right 1 
the burger had absolutely no flavor the meat itself was totally bland the burger was overcooked and there was no charcoal flavor 0 
my fella got the huevos rancheros and they didnt look too appealing 0 
this frog phone charm is adorable and very eye catching 1 
totally different with loads of understatement and black comedy this is a film few get to see but those who do will remember it 1 
call me a nut but i think this is one of the best movies ever 1 
i love this bluetooth 1 
pretty good beer selection too 1 
if you want a real scare rent this one 1 
so good i am going to have to review this place twice once hereas a tribute to the place and once as a tribute to an event held here last night 1 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
i really loved the story line and the poler bear was kinda cutebut if anyone has a question about fort steele just ask away 1 
also difficult to put onid recommend avoiding this product 0 
i came over from verizon because cingulair has nicer cell phones the first thing i noticed was the really bad service 0 
loved itfriendly servers great food wonderful and imaginative menu 1 
my fella got the huevos rancheros and they didnt look too appealing 0 
if there is a wind it is completely useless 0 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
if you love authentic mexican food and want a whole bunch of interesting yet delicious meats to choose from you need to try this place 1 
im super pissd 0 
motorola finally got the voice quality of a bluetooth headset right 1 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
wont work right or atleast for me 0 
one of my favorite purchases ever 1 
dont go here 0 
i had the chicken pho and it tasted very bland 0 
it has kept up very well 1 
i had the mac salad and it was pretty bland so i will not be getting that again 0 
this battery is an excellent bargain 1 
it is a joy to use 1 
my boyfriend tried the mediterranean chicken salad and fell in love 1 
do not buy if you want to use the holster 0 
lovely little thriller from hitchcock with lots of nice shenanigans surrounding a murdered spy a kidnapped child a nasty church a foreign plot and some random taxidermists 1 
this is probably the most irritating show i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
the eargels channel the sound directly into your ear and seem to increase the sound volume and clarity 1 
works for me 1 
food was really boring 0 
im not sure how long we stood there but it was long enough for me to begin to feel awkwardly out of place 0 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
i didnt want the clip going over the top of my ear causing discomfort 0 
i have had mine for about a year and this christmas i bought some for the rest of the family 1 
but if you liked movies like the matrix and better yet their sequels i think youll appreciate the thought provoking mindblowing experience this film will give you 1 
the food was outstanding and the prices were very reasonable 1 
cute quaint simple honest 1 
i love their fries and their beans 1 
the only downside is the service 0 
the movie seemed a little slow at first 0 
the lighting is awful 0 
ive also had problems with the phone reading the memory card in which i always turn it on and then off again 0 
and there wasnt a single sour note struck actingwise either some surprisingly solid casting here 1 
ive seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie 0 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
the instruction manual is lacking 0 
we literally sat there for 20 minutes with no one asking to take our order 0 
this is infuriating 0 
its pretty surprising that this wonderful film was made in 1949 as hollywood generally had its collective heads in the sand concerning black and white issues at that time 1 
the management is rude 0 
appears to actually outperform the original battery from china that came with my v325i 1 
it is easy to turn on and off when you are in the car and the volume controls are quite accessable 1 
the performances are not improved by improvisation because the actors now have twice as much to worry about not only whether theyre delivering the line well but whether the line itself is any good 0 
i left the theater with a lilt in my step joy in my heart and hope for the human race 1 
the performances are real and gripping the crocdodile is extremely well done indeed if the black water website is to be believed thats because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous 1 
the feel of the dining room was more college cooking course than high class dining and the service was slow at best 0 
very much disappointed with this company 0 
if only someone involved with it knew how to string together narrative 0 
it fits so securely that the ear hook does not even need to be used and the sound is better directed through your ear canal 1 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
i love this device 1 
but in any case the best part is you can download these pictures to your laptop using ir or even send pictures from your laptop to the phone 1 
if only someone involved with it knew how to string together narrative 0 
a fantastic neighborhood gem 1 
for readers who have already seen one of miyazakis films he is still in top form and made another worthwhile experience 1 
then as if i hadnt wasted enough of my life there they poured salt in the wound by drawing out the time it took to bring the check 0 
the only consistent thread holding the series together were the amazing performances of leni parker and anita laselva as the two taelons in quiet idealogical conflict 0 
and considering the two of us left there very full and happy for about 20 you just cant go wrong 1 
but in terms of the writing its very fresh and bold 1 
seriously killer hot chai latte 1 
i can assure you that you wont be disappointed 1 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
i wear it everyday and it holds up very well 1 
beware this is not a trashy cult movie this is trash period 0 
there arent death scenes like in previous movies and the fx are terrible 0 
both of them were truly unbelievably good and i am so glad we went back 1 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
as for the service im a fan because its quick and youre being served by some nice folks 1 
the desserts were a bit strange 0 
do not buy do not buyit sucks 0 
some highlights great quality nigiri here 1 
my mother and brother had to do thiswhen i saw robert ryan portraying this type of man it was a very good imitation of this type of individual and i was impressed 1 
very prompt service 1 
the scenes are often funny and occasionally touching as the characters evaluate their lives and where they are going 1 
this was such an awesome movie that i bought it off of ebay 1 
the chips and sals a here is amazing 1 
this little device has transformed my organizational capability and made my life a whole lot easier 1 
youll love how thin it is 1 
so i bought about 10 of these and saved alot of money 1 
this is a very average phone with bad battery life that operates on a weak network 0 
there are so many problems i dont know where to start 0 
the headset fulfills my requirements so i am happy with my purchase 1 
not a good bargain 0 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
this particular model would not work with my motorola q smartphone 0 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
it always cuts out and makes a beep beep beep sound then says signal failed 0 
my only problem is i thought the actor playing the villain was a low rent michael ironside 0 
but when someone strives for greatness and poetry but delivers a muddled and often ridiculous story a bunch of disparate scenes pretentious dialogue then you get the worst kind of a movie that some other reviewer very accurately defined as pretentious crap 0 
the menu had so much good stuff on it i could not decide 1 
nice sound 1 
raw and sublimely moving 1 
the movie is full of wonderful dancing hence the title 1 
very tough and very short on flavor 0 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
a happy wonderful feel good ending 1 
as an earlier review noted plug in this charger and nothing happens 0 
that one didnt work either 0 
the phone was unusable and was not new 0 
its very attractive and appears to be of good quality 1 
very good quality though 1 
but i definitely would not eat here again 0 
i dont think you will be disappointed 1 
pretty piece of junk 0 
i wasnt expecting oscar material but this 0 
waiter was a jerk 0 
i connected my wifes bluetoothmotorola hs850 to my phone and it worked like a charm whether the phone was in my pocket or the case 1 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
as for the service i thought it was good 1 
do not buy if you want to use the holster 0 
i know he was a contract player with little control over his scripts but the acting was as bad as the script 0 
service was fantastic 1 
i was amazed at the quick arrival of the two original lg cell phone batteries and and at a fraction of the price 1 
in my house i was getting dropped coverage upstairs and no coverage in my basement 0 
this was a poor remake of my best friends wedding 0 
sam shepards portrayal of a gung ho marine was sobering 1 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
this short film certainly pulls no punches 0 
would not recommend to others 0 
works great when my cat attacked the phone he scratched the protective strip instead of destroying the screen 1 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
your brain will attempt to shutdown as part of a primal impulse of selfpreservation 0 
you could only take 2 videos at a time and the quality was very poor 0 
considering the relations off screen between taylor and stanwyck it was surprising how little chemistry there was on screen between the two of them 0 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
both of the egg rolls were fantastic 1 
this review is long overdue since i consider a tale of two sisters to be the single greatest film ever made 1 
i couldnt think of a better way to end the film but a smile on my face great way to wrap up an amazing film and trilogy 1 
still waiting im sure this item would work well if i ever recieve it 0 
not a pleasant voyage of selfdiscovery 0 
how awful she is 0 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
the yellowtail carpaccio was melt in your mouth fresh 1 
i probably would not go here again 0 
the seller is very understanding and patient i would definitely buy from them again 1 
nothing new there 0 
i as well wouldve given godfathers zero stars if possible 0 
im not sure how long we stood there but it was long enough for me to begin to feel awkwardly out of place 0 
the live music on fridays totally blows 0 
the only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port irda 0 
the story which was told so eloquently by francis ford coppola 25 years earlier really unfolds gradually and leaves room for the characters to develop 1 
i thought it was bad 0 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
the wind and the lion is well written and superbly acted 1 
the cow tongue and cheek tacos are amazing 1 
im very disappointed with my decision 0 
trumbull on i love lucy 1 
great service and food 1 
this place is overpriced not consistent with their boba and it really is overpriced 0 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
makes it easier to keep up with my bluetooth when im not wearing it 0 
some may say this buffet is pricey but i think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot 1 
the pizza selections are good 1 
everything about this movie is stupid 0 
im trying to return it for a refund 0 
even if you love bad movies do not watch this movie 0 
great product 1 
the company shipped my product very promptly and it works well 1 
the charger worked for about a week and then completely stopped charging my phone 0 
this was utterly confusing at first which caused me to lose a couple of very very important contacts 0 
the shrimp tender and moist 1 
for a self proclaimed coffee cafe i was wildly disappointed 0 
great product and price 1 
the grilled chicken was so tender and yellow from the saffron seasoning 1 
it is worth the drive 1 
this was like the final blow 0 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
very easy to use 1 
nice headset priced right 1 
this movie now joins revenge of the boogeyman and zombiez as part of the hellish trinity of horror films 0 
worst thai ever 0 
i use this product in a motor control center where there is a lot of high voltage humming from the equipment and it works great 1 
even the squibs look awful 0 
im translating movies for a living and this is the first movie in my 5year working experience that i found offensive to my intelligence 0 
this hole in the wall has great mexican street tacos and friendly staff 1 
buttons are too small 0 
overpriced for what you are getting 0 
we had fantastic service and were pleased by the atmosphere 1 
i highly recommend this modest priced cellular phone 1 
we recently witnessed her poor quality of management towards other guests as well 0 
battery has no life 0 
however my girl was complain that some time the phone doesnt wake up like normal phone does 0 
meredith m was better than all right 1 
doesnt hold charge 0 
they have horrible attitudes towards customers and talk down to each one when customers dont enjoy their food 0 
there was a warm feeling with the service and i felt like their guest for a special treat 1 
pretty piece of junk 0 
the attention given to every character and complex psychological portrayals detailing loyalty treachery love and hope are tremendous 1 
the flair bartenders are absolutely amazing 1 
however bt headsets are currently not good for real time games like firstperson shooters since the audio delay messes me up 0 
i had high hopes for this place since the burgers are cooked over a charcoal grill but unfortunately the taste fell flat way flat 0 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
elias koteasjack palance play good roles angelina is hot and gets nakedbilly drago appears in this and is cool as usual a cameo by sven ole thorsen helps make this a very enjoyable movie with good acting and a decent budget 1 
i know this is not like the other restaurants at all something is very off here 0 
the battery is working well as a replacement for the original that came with the phone over 2 years ago 1 
the first thing that happened was that the tracking was off 0 
what this film lacks is a convincing script 0 
im really disappointed all i have now is a charger that doesnt work 0 
headset works great was packaged nicely to avoid any damage 1 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
it was so funny 1 
brilliant 1 
this place was such a nice surprise 1 
my boyfriend and i sat at the bar and had a completely delightful experience 1 
ambience is perfect 1 
i felt asleep the first time i watched it so i can recommend it for insomniacs 0 
but storm trooper is not even bad enough to make it to the list of wonderfully terrible movies 0 
not much flavor to them and very poorly constructed 0 
frankly after cotton club and unfaithful it was kind of embarrassing to watch lane and gere in this film because it is bad 0 
i find wasting food to be despicable but this just wasnt food 0 
totally believable 1 
the staff was very attentive 1 
it really is impressive that the place hasnt closed down 0 
what makes this story different are the terrific production values faultless photography composition and editing the terrific casting the underappreciated brian keith playing a bully teddy and vivid history 1 
everything stinks 0 
soggy and not good 0 
he came running after us when he realized my husband had left his sunglasses on the table 1 
last time buying from you 0 
delete this film from your mind 0 
it was so bad i had lost the heart to finish it 0 
but other than that the movie seemed to drag and the heroes didnt really work for their freedom 0 
a great way to finish a great 1 
i also decided not to send it back because our waitress looked like she was on the verge of having a heart attack 0 
i always order from the vegetarian menu during dinner which has a wide array of options to choose from 1 
horrible dont waste your time and money 0 
this place is great 1 
i went on motorolas website and followed all directions but could not get it to pair again 0 
i had verizon 2 years ago and really liked their service 1 
the scripting of the subtle comedy is unmatched by any movie in recent years 1 
cinematography the film was shot in an interesting way 1 
lordy the khao soi is a dish that is not to be missed for curry lovers 1 
del taco is pretty nasty and should be avoided if possible 0 
it was forced like everything in this movie 0 
the staff is friendly and the joint is always clean 1 
everything on the menu is terrific and we were also thrilled that they made amazing accommodations for our vegetarian daughter 1 
i highly recommend this modest priced cellular phone 1 
what the hell kind of crap is that 0 
it dit not work most of the time with my nokia 5320 0 
the only place good for this film is in the garbage 0 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
i mean really how do you get so famous for your fish and chips when its so terrible 0 
the battery runs down quickly 0 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
there is really nothing for me at postinos hope your experience is better 0 
all the pretty pictures in the world cannot make up for a piece of work that is flawed at the core 0 
four stars for the food the guy in the blue shirt for his great vibe still letting us in to eat 1 
kind of hard to mess up a steak but they did 0 
the plot was the same as pretty much every other cheap horror 0 
service stinks here 0 
worst customer service 0 
very funny 1 
i rate this movie 910 1 
the structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema 1 
sam shepards portrayal of a gung ho marine was sobering 1 
in my house i was getting dropped coverage upstairs and no coverage in my basement 0 
i could not stand to even watch it for very long for fear of losing iq 0 
she ordered a toasted english muffin that came out untoasted 0 
hence the whole story lacks a certain energy 0 
does not work for listening to music with the cingular 8125 0 
i dont know what kind it is but they have the best iced tea 1 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
if you look for authentic thai food go else where 0 
the success of the film depends on the casting of sydney greenstreet as the alexander yardley character 1 
i as well wouldve given godfathers zero stars if possible 0 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
restored my phone to like new performance 1 
i probably wont be coming back here 0 
im not sure what he was trying to do with this film 0 
10 out of 10 stars 1 
the pan cakes everyone are raving about taste like a sugary disaster tailored to the palate of a six year old 0 
nice quality build unlike some cheap s out there 1 
very tough and very short on flavor 0 
ill be looking for a new earpiece 0 
again no plot at all 0 
good case 1 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
the manager was the worst 0 
you have to hold the phone at a particular angle for the other party to hear you clearly 0 
i was very pleased to see that i could replace my well travled swivel holster for my blackberry flip 1 
great place fo take out or eat in 1 
when i opened the sandwich i was impressed but not in a good way 0 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
i paid too much 0 
if you check the directors filmography on this site you will see why this film didnt have a chance 0 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
the staff is friendly and the joint is always clean 1 
for service i give them no stars 0 
the fried rice was dry as well 0 
great product for the price 1 
so far it has worked like a charm 1 
a great touch 1 
dont waste your time 0 
aailiyah was pretty good as akasha in places compelling her first entrance and mini dance scene 1 
i liked it 1 
for the price on amazon it is an excellent product which i would highly recommend 1 
ive had no trouble accessing the internet downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions 1 
plantronics bluetooth excelent buy 1 
to sum the film up breeders is a terrible cheaply made horror movie that should be avoided like the ebola virus 0 
the camera although rated at an impressive 13 megapixels renders images that fall well below expectations of such a relatively high resolution 0 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
works for me 1 
excellent sound quality 1 
the plot was the same as pretty much every other cheap horror 0 
i really loved the story line and the poler bear was kinda cutebut if anyone has a question about fort steele just ask away 1 
its a piece of crap 0 
the yellowtail carpaccio was melt in your mouth fresh 1 
service is friendly and inviting 1 
it feels poorly constructed the menus are difficult to navigate and the buttons are so recessed that it is difficult to push them 0 
the lighting is just dark enough to set the mood 1 
i love this device 1 
having trouble with volume 0 
the plot simply rumbles on like a machine desperately depending on the addition of new scenes 0 
very tough and very short on flavor 0 
not much seafood and like 5 strings of pasta at the bottom 0 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
the fact is this film is a wonderful heartwarming tale about two people chasing their dreams 1 
great place to eat reminds me of the little mom and pop shops in the san francisco bay area 1 
the story which was told so eloquently by francis ford coppola 25 years earlier really unfolds gradually and leaves room for the characters to develop 1 
theres barely a boring moment in the film and there are plenty of humorous parts 1 
would not recommend to others 0 
sprint charges for this service 0 
terrible product and waste of money 0 
the roast beef sandwich tasted really good 1 
the phone crashed completely and now i have to get it replaced 0 
the live music on fridays totally blows 0 
im so sorry but i really cant recommend it to anyone 0 
the live music on fridays totally blows 0 
i did not have any problem with this item and would order it again if needed 1 
it had some average acting from the main person and it was a low budget as you clearly can see 0 
very pleased with this headset 1 
i love the ownerchef his one authentic japanese cool dude 1 
the burger had absolutely no flavor the meat itself was totally bland the burger was overcooked and there was no charcoal flavor 0 
i had verizon 2 years ago and really liked their service 1 
but it picked up speed and got right to the point 1 
server did a great job handling our large rowdy table 1 
people who like european films and art movies will like this movie 1 
camera color balance is awful 0 
appears to actually outperform the original battery from china that came with my v325i 1 
gets the job done 1 
great time family dinner on a sunday night 1 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
i received my orders well within the shipping timeframe everything was in good working order and overall i am very excited to have this source 1 
i was totally fascinated by the music the dancing everything 1 
but what really made it unwatchable was the direction 0 
i could barely stomach the meal but didnt complain because it was a business lunch 0 
they refuse to refund or replace 0 
good food good service 1 
battery lasts only a few hours 0 
the cashier had no care what so ever on what i had to say it still ended up being wayyy overpriced 0 
also its a real treat to see anthony quinn playing crazy horse 1 
fast service 1 
the warmth it generates is in contrast to its austere backdrop 1 
the voice recognition thru the handset is excellent 1 
the plot is nonsense that doesnt interest in the slightest way or have any uniqueness to it 0 
im pleased 1 
it has a great camera thats 2mp and the pics are nice and clear with great picture quality 1 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
food was so gooodd 1 
it makes very strange ticking noises before it ends the call 0 
the menu had so much good stuff on it i could not decide 1 
this is a good joint 1 
rating 1 out of 10 0 
the steaks are all well trimmed and also perfectly cooked 1

its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
i believe the screenwriter did a good job of tying up the loose ends 1 
i kept catching the cable on the seat and i had to pull the phone out to turn it on an off 0 
star trek v the final frontier is the worst in the series 0 
i immediately said i wanted to talk to the manager but i did not want to talk to the guy who was doing shots of fireball behind the bar 0 
i especially liked the noncliche choices with the parents in other movies i could predict the dialog verbatim but the writing in this movie made better selections 1 
this place has it 1 
highly recommended a 1 
setup went very smoothly 1 
it is wonderful and inspiring to watch and i hope that it gets released again on to video or dvd 1 
one nice thing was that they added gratuity on the bill since our party was larger than 6 or 8 and they didnt expect more tip than that 1 
it was a great phone 1 
plug was the wrong size 0 
my sanyo has survived dozens of drops on blacktop without ill effect 1 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1

the keyboard is a nice compromise between a full qwerty and the basic cell phone number keypad 1 
i tried the cape cod ravoli chickenwith cranberrymmmm 1 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
i like the fact that it rests lightly against your ear rather than inside 1 
this is was due to the fact that it took 20 minutes to be acknowledged then another 35 minutes to get our foodand they kept forgetting things 0 
i came over from verizon because cingulair has nicer cell phones the first thing i noticed was the really bad service 0 
when achille and philippa beautifully sing a duet from don giovanni that perfectly describes their situation in the movie you appreciate the subtle layers of this excellent film 1 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
really bad 0 
i took back my money and got outta there 0 
the death row scenes were entirely unmoving 0 
comfort for our whole family 1 
your brain will attempt to shutdown as part of a primal impulse of selfpreservation 0 
so just beware 0 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
why was this film made 0 
we ordered some old classics and some new dishes after going there a few times and were sorely disappointed with everything 0 
i got the aluminum case for my new palm vx and it worked really wellit has protected my handheld perfectly so far 1

otherwise easy to install and use clear sound 1 
join the club and get awesome offers via email 1 
how awesome is that 1 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
the 12 mega pixel camera being a part of a phone is reasonably good7 1 
it presents a idyllic yet serious portrayal of the ups and downs of the characters lives 1 
very funny 1 
definitely will come back here again 1 
everything stinks 0 
and his subtle connections between the three films are awesome 1 
i used bitpim a free program you can find on the internetto transfer data to the phonethe price of the cable was excellent 1 
this is one of the better buffets that i have been to 1 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
this is one of the best movies out there that shows such strong sibling bond for each other 1 
i tried the cape cod ravoli chickenwith cranberrymmmm 1 
this is the kind of money that is wasted properly 1 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
a week later after i activated it it suddenly died 0 
i have been in more than a few bars in vegas and do not ever recall being charged for tap water 0 
i wont be back 0 
we arent ones to make a scene at restaurants but i just dont get itdefinitely lost the love after this one 0 
on the negative its insipid enough to cause regret for another 2 hours of life wasted in front of the screen 0 
but in terms of the writing its very fresh and bold 1 
a piece of junk that broke after being on my phone for 2 days 0 
this is a great product sure beats using your fingers 1 
i connected my wifes bluetoothmotorola hs850 to my phone and it worked like a charm whether the phone was in my pocket or the case 1 
works as described 1 
wont ever go here again 0 
utter crap sound quality is terrible 0 
do not buy do not buyit sucks 0 
not good enough for the price 0 
the live music on fridays totally blows 0 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
about 30 minutes of footage is wasted to show mediocre elderly actors awkwardly babbling overwrought pseudosatanic gibberish corny enough to make a teen goth blush almost always in olde english and sometimes in latin that may or may not be made up words 0 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
bluetooth range is good a few days ago i left my phone in the trunk got a call and carried the conversation without a hitch 1 
however after finally watching this film i realized that not only had i had a closed mind to the brilliance it depicts i also found myself watching it over and over again 1 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
we waited for forty five minutes in vain 0 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
these were so good we ordered them twice 1 
the charger arrived within the promised timeframe but it did not work 0 
our server was very nice and even though he looked a little overwhelmed with all of our needs he stayed professional and friendly until the end 1 
bad choice 0 
it dit not work most of the time with my nokia 5320 0 
and considering the two of us left there very full and happy for about 20 you just cant go wrong 1 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
spoilers whatever else can or cant be said about it surface is superbly crafted 1 
comfortable fit you need your headset to be comfortable for at least an hour at a time if not for an entire day 1 
the restaurant atmosphere was exquisite 1 
four stars for the food the guy in the blue shirt for his great vibe still letting us in to eat 1 
they work about 2 weeks then break 0 
there was hardly any meat 0 
schrader has made a resume full of lousy amateurish films 0 
my side greek salad with the greek dressing was so tasty and the pita and hummus was very refreshing 1 
i have had tmobile service for 2 or 3 years now and i am pretty happy with it 1 
very disappointing 0 
battery is terrible 0 
this was a different cut than the piece the other day but still wonderful and tender s well as well flavored 1 
ray charles is legendary 1 
i have tried these cables with my computer and my ipod and it works just fine 1 
this is was due to the fact that it took 20 minutes to be acknowledged then another 35 minutes to get our foodand they kept forgetting things 0 
linksys should have some way to exchange a bad phone for a refurb unit or something 0 
it is well made easy to access the phone and has a handy detachable belt clip 1 
its a little geeky but i think thats its sex on toast and it rocks and oozes sex right down to its battery embedded sleek stylish leather case 1 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
ive only had my bluetooth for a few weeks but i really like it 1 
its kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly its embarrassing how childlike the company is 0 
what possesed me to get this junk i have no idea 0 
the performances are real and gripping the crocdodile is extremely well done indeed if the black water website is to be believed thats because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous 1 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
but this movie is definitely a below average rent 0 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
it is shameful 0 
i dont have to be an accountant to know im getting screwed 0 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
the construction of the headsets is poor 0 
i could not recommend these more 0 
everything stinks 0 
the fact is this film is a wonderful heartwarming tale about two people chasing their dreams 1 
i have purchased these for both family and friends and all enjoy their clarity and ease of use 1 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
when im on this side of town this will definitely be a spot ill hit up again 1 
definitely worth checking out 1 
highly recommended a 1 
there is so much good food in vegas that i feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to rice and company 0 
the concert sequences just sucked 0 
i would advise to not purchase this item it never worked very well 0 
very pleased with this headset 1 
however bt headsets are currently not good for real time games like firstperson shooters since the audio delay messes me up 0 
and there wasnt a single sour note struck actingwise either some surprisingly solid casting here 1 
as a sushi lover avoid this place by all means 0 
the visual effects were awful 0 
the bose noise cancelling is amazing which is very important for a nyc commuter 1 
the sound quality is excellent as well 1 
cinematography the film was shot in an interesting way 1 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
must have been an off night at this place 0 
plantronics bluetooth excelent buy 1 
mishima is extremely uninteresting 0 
its too bad that everyone else involved didnt share crowes level of dedication to quality for if they did wed have a far better film on our hands than this subpar mess 0 
the service here is fair at best 0 
tried to go here for lunch and it was a madhouse 0 
the majority of the logitech earbud headsets failed 0 
lange had become a great actress 1 
everything about it is just bad 0 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
not good by any stretch of the imagination 0 
cinematography noteworthy including fine views of barcelona and its famed gaudi towers 1 
incredible 1 
will definitely be back 1 
this place has it 1 
the fried rice was dry as well 0 
avoid this one if you can 0 
tom wilkinson broke my heart at the end and everyone elses judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike 1 
i like design and look of jabra behing the ear headsets and 5020 is pretty comfortible to wear 24 hours a day without pain in the ear 1 
a truly truly bad film 0 
sending it back 0 
all the characters in this film are tremendously well played 1 
i started this review with two stars but im editing it to give it only one 0 
the awful dialogue and hopeless overacting by everyone who gets shot top off a real waste of space and time 0 
a great way to finish a great 1 
it is simple to use and i like it 1 
then i had to continue pairing it periodically since it somehow kept dropping 0 
one thing i hate is the mode set button at the side 0 
i was very excited to get this headset because i thought it was really cute 1 
it was that year however that reminded us that huston was still at the top of his game as evinced by his faithful adaptation of james joyces acclaimed novella the dead 1 
this second appearance of mickey mouse following the silent plane crazy earlier that year is probably his most famous filmmostly because it was so groundbreaking 1 
it is light has plenty of battery capacity and is very confortable to wear for somewhat extended periods of time 1 
the phone crashed completely and now i have to get it replaced 0 
that being said for a phone the camera is very nice many cool effects to play with and video is decent as well 1 
delicious nyc bagels good selections of cream cheese real lox with capers even 1 
good food good service 1 
the staff is always super friendly and helpful which is especially cool when you bring two small boys and a baby 1 
good value great food great service 1 
john wayne did an incredible job for being so young in the movie industry 1 
best breakfast buffet 1 
the kids are annoying 0 
its not what it says it is 0 
i hate writing bad reviews about films especially those in which i really like the star but this film is so bad i dont believe for one second that anyone could have been proud of it 0 
the script is bad very bad  it contains both cheesiness and unethical joke that you normally see in rated r or nc17 movie 0 
i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
he deserves 5 stars 1 
the movie is littered with overt racial slurs towards the black cast members and in return the whites are depicted as morons and boobs 0 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
what possesed me to get this junk i have no idea 0 
i couldnt think of a better way to end the film but a smile on my face great way to wrap up an amazing film and trilogy 1 
the acting sucked 0 
saw the movie today and thought it was a good effort good messages for kids 1 
i had absolutely no problem with this headset linking to my 8530 blackberry curve 1 
personally i think it shows that people should learn to find a compromise them self without involving other people into issue 1 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
his performance is simply genius 1 
the nachos are a must have 1 
how can you call yourself a steakhouse if you cant properly cook a steak i dont understand 0 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
there is no plot here to keep you going in the first place 0 
conclusion i loved it 1 
it is cheap and it feel and look just as cheap 0 
highly recommend for any one who has a blue tooth phone 1 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
everyone is very attentive providing excellent customer service 1 
the hockey scenes are terrible defensemen playing like theyre 5 years old goalies diving at shots that are 10 feet wide of the net etc 0 
sending it back 0 
as for the mains also uninspired 0 
absolutel junk 0 
another note about this phones appearance is that it really looks rather bland especially in the all black model 0 
there is so much good food in vegas that i feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to rice and company 0 
i loved it it was really scary 1 
its a mediocre miserable hollow laughable and predictable piece of garbage 0 
excellent bluetooth headset 1 
and the sound quality is great 1 
im still infatuated with this phone 1 
this is cool because most cases are just open there allowing the screen to get all scratched up 1 
we had 7 at our table and the service was pretty fast 1 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
on the up side their cafe serves really good food 1 
buyer beware you could flush money right down the toilet 0 
food was great and so was the serivce 1 
i know he was a contract player with little control over his scripts but the acting was as bad as the script 0 
i believe that this place is a great stop for those with a huge belly and hankering for sushi 1 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
either way it sucks 0 
then theres the plot holes 0 
i wont spoil it but the ending in pretty amazing 1 
ryans bar is definitely one edinburgh establishment i wont be revisiting 0 
the portion was huge 1 
my only problem is i thought the actor playing the villain was a low rent michael ironside 0 
not easy to watch 0 
i love it 1 
not what i wanted 0 
this was my first time and i cant wait until the next 1 
it doesnt make you look cool 0 
i ordered the voodoo pasta and it was the first time id had really excellent pasta since going gluten free several years ago 1 
works good 1 
due to this happening on every call i was forced to stop using this headset 0 
the macarons here are insanely good 1 
the sets especially designed to work with the camera are amazingstylized beautiful and effective 1 
just spicy enough perfect actually 1 
dessert panna cotta was amazing 1 
at least think to refill my water before i struggle to wave you over for 10 minutes 0 
their rotating beers on tap is also a highlight of this place 1 
for readers who have already seen one of miyazakis films he is still in top form and made another worthwhile experience 1 
long whiny and pointless 0 
110 and only because there is no setting for 010 0 
i did not bother contacting the company for few dollar product but i learned the lesson that i should not have bought this form online anyway 0 
i had to go to a store and bought a new nokia phone which is working great 1 
the story is beyond stupid 0 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
i wish i could return the unit and get back my money 0 
service was very prompt 1 
comfortable fit you need your headset to be comfortable for at least an hour at a time if not for an entire day 1 
great hands free device 1 
though the wind and the lion is told largely through the eyes of the son every member of the family can identify with one of the characters whether it be sean connerys noble brigand candace bergens feisty heroine john hustons wily john hay or steve kanalys spiffy radiant ruthless cando lieutenant roosevelts big stick 1 
crisp and clear 1 
dont bother go to the store 0 
the food was terrible 0 
the staff is friendly and the joint is always clean 1 
i use this product in a motor control center where there is a lot of high voltage humming from the equipment and it works great 1 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
you could only take 2 videos at a time and the quality was very poor 0 
seller shipped quickly and much cheaper than the competitors 1 
the charger arrived within the promised timeframe but it did not work 0 
this is hands down the best phone ive ever had 1 
also the area where my unit broke im not too fond of the magnetic strap 0 
poor talk time performance 0 
its an empty hollow shell of a movie 0 
he owns the film just as spacek owned coal miners daughter and quaid owned great balls of fire 1 
the sound quality is good and functionality is awesome 1 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
50 down the drain 0 
this is a chilly unremarkable movie about an author livingworking in a chilly abstruse culture 0 
the server was very negligent of our needs and made us feel very unwelcome i would not suggest this place 0 
the food was terrible 0 
great for ipods too 1 
this is by far the worst purchase ive made on amazon 0 
i would have casted her in that role after ready the script 1 
i wish i could enter negative values admins 0 
maybe if they werent cold they would have been somewhat edible 0
