you also cannot take pictures with it in the case because the lense is covered 0 
it defeats the purpose of a bluetooth headset 0 
if the food isnt bad enough for you then enjoy dealing with the worlds worstannoying drunk people 0 
it was way over fried 0 
this short film certainly pulls no punches 0 
the plot has more holes than a pair of fishnet stockings and the direction and editing is astonishingly ham fisted 0 
babie bop is very cute 1 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
the film has great actors a master director a significant themeat least a wouldbe significant theme undertone of fifties existential worldweariness aerial scenes that ought to have thrilled both senses and imagination and characters about which one might deeply care 1 
the pizza selections are good 1 
never been to hard rock casino before will never ever step forward in it again 0 
the sound is clear and the people i talk to on it are amazed at the quality too 1 
it is cheap and it feel and look just as cheap 0 
freezes frequently4 0 
in an interesting part of town this place is amazing 1 
of all the dishes the salmon was the best but all were great 1 
however paul schrader has indeed made a film about mishima that is both superb complex 1 
the battery is working well as a replacement for the original that came with the phone over 2 years ago 1 
the cg opening sequence in space looked like it could have been created on microsoft slideshow for gods sake 0 
the building itself seems pretty neat the bathroom is pretty trippy but i wouldnt eat here again 0 
these are the nicest restaurant owners ive ever come across 1 
it was pretty gross 0 
must have been an off night at this place 0 
when my order arrived one of the gyros was missing 0 
performed awful muffled tinny incoming sound and severe echo for those on the other end of the call 0 
go to place for gyros 1 
its a feelgood film and thats how i felt when i came out of the cinema 1 
i wasted my little money with this earpiece 0 
all the characters in this film are tremendously well played 1 
the phone takes forever to charge like 2 to 5 hours literally 0 
their regular toasted bread was equally satisfying with the occasional pats of butter mmmm 1 
easily none other cartoon made me laugh in a tender way before getting into dark sitcoms oriented for teenagers 1 
mishima is extremely uninteresting 0 
every element of this story was so over the top excessively phony and contrived that it was painful to sit through 0 
great software for motorolas 1 
its just lame 0 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
this battery is an excellent bargain 1 
considering the relations off screen between taylor and stanwyck it was surprising how little chemistry there was on screen between the two of them 0 
they refuse to refund or replace 0 
if you see it you should probably just leave it on the shelf 0 
i ate there twice on my last visit and especially enjoyed the salmon salad 1 
mic doesnt work 0 
service was exceptional and food was a good as all the reviews 1 
its very slow 0 
this item worked great but it broke after 6 months of use 0 
the tracfonewebsite is user friendly and makes it easy toactivate etc 1 
worked very well paired with a treo 700w and as a skype headset on my pc using a usb bluetooth transceiver 1 
dont make the same mistake that i did and please dont buy this phone 0 
def coming back to bowl next time 1 
item does not match picture 0 
this phone is slim and light and the display is beautiful 1 
ive had no trouble accessing the internet downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions 1 
of course the footage from the 70s was grainy but that only enhanced the film 1 
i paid too much 0 
this game rocks 1 
love it great armband 1 
i guess i should have known that this place would suck because it is inside of the excalibur but i didnt use my common sense 0 
you get what you pay for i guess 0 
i had to wait over 30 minutes to get my drink and longer to get 2 arepas 0 
voice recognition is tremendous 1 
about half way through this film i started to dislike it 0 
everything is appalling 0 
the problem was the script 0 
bad reception 0 
not a good item it worked for a while then started having problems in my auto reverse tape player 0 
waited and waited and waited 0 
this was my first and only vegas buffet and it did not disappoint 1 
i was mortified 0 
lovely little thriller from hitchcock with lots of nice shenanigans surrounding a murdered spy a kidnapped child a nasty church a foreign plot and some random taxidermists 1 
from what my dinner companions told meeverything was very fresh with nice texture and taste 1 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
horrible 0 
krussel always good 1 
there is nothing privileged about workingeating there 0 
this product is great it makes working a lot easier i can go to the copier while waiting on hold for something 1 
w810i is just superb 1 
its a great item 1 
for the price on amazon it is an excellent product which i would highly recommend 1 
clear crisp sound 1 
price is good too 1 
horrible 0 
owners are really great people 1 
good value works fine power via usb car or wall outlet 1 
i really enjoyed eating here 1 
new battery works great in phone 1 
works great when my cat attacked the phone he scratched the protective strip instead of destroying the screen 1 
i would advise to not purchase this item it never worked very well 0 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
best headset ever 1 
piece of junk 0 
now the pizza itself was good the peanut sauce was very tasty 1 
i could not stand to even watch it for very long for fear of losing iq 0 
its pure brilliance 1 
alexander nevsky is a great film 1 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
im translating movies for a living and this is the first movie in my 5year working experience that i found offensive to my intelligence 0 
great time family dinner on a sunday night 1 
you can even take self portraits with the outside exterior display very cool 1 
ive had no trouble accessing the internet downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions 1 
but this movie really got to me 1 
i cannot believe that the actors agreed to do this film 0 
nobody identifies with these characters because theyre all cardboard cutouts and stereotypes or predictably reversestereotypes 0 
it even has its sweet moments 1 
this film has no redeeming features 0 
dont buy this product 0 
dont buy this product it fails 0 
over rated 0 
exactly what i wanted 1 
very funny 1 
the best electronics of the available fm transmitters 1 
the story is also both funny and poignant at times 1 
he came running after us when he realized my husband had left his sunglasses on the table 1 
great product 1 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
i checked everywhere and there is no feature for it which is really disappointing 0 
i waited and waited 0 
steer clear of this product and go with the genuine palm replacementr pens which come in a threepack 0 
his costars dont fare much better with people like morgan freeman jonah hill and ed helms just wasted 0 
good transmit audio 1 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
fantastic food 1 
im not sure what he was trying to do with this film 0 
we watched our waiter pay a lot more attention to other tables and ignore us 0 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
great product and price 1 
black water is a thriller that manages to completely transcend its limitations its an indie flick by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience 1 
this company charge me a restocking fee and still not given me my refund back 0 
this movie has a cutting edge to it 1 
its so stupid to have to keep buying new chargers car chargers cradles headphones and car kits every time a new phone comes out 0 
there is a lot of beautiful places 1 
the service was terrible though 0 
very windresistant 1 
this place is not quality sushi it is not a quality restaurant 0 
i wasnt really impressed with strip steak 0 
would recommend this item 1 
camerawork again bad 0 
i have bought this nokia cell phone a few weeks ago and it was a nightmare 0 
this pda rocks 1 
now we were chosen to be tortured with this disgusting piece of blatant american propaganda 0 
the menu is always changing food quality is going down service is extremely slow 0 
the han nan chicken was also very tasty 1 
as a sushi lover avoid this place by all means 0 
its kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly its embarrassing how childlike the company is 0 
no actress has been worse used that june allison in this movie 0 
everything about this product is wrongfirst 0 
all it took was one drop from about 6 inches above the kitchen counter and it was crackedi am not impressed and i am not laughing 0 
its quite simply the highest most superlative form of cinema imaginable 1 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
battery life is real good 1 
i dont know what the big deal is about this place but i wont be back yaall 0 
the script is bad very bad Â– it contains both cheesiness and unethical joke that you normally see in rated r or nc17 movie 0 
the selection of food was not the best 0 
the chips that came out were dripping with grease and mostly not edible 0 
back to good bbq lighter fare reasonable pricing and tell the public they are back to the old ways 1 
as for the mains also uninspired 0 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
i own 2 of these cases and would order another 1 
i would definitely recommend the jabra bt250v for those who are looking for comfort clarity and a great price 1 
the fact is this film is a wonderful heartwarming tale about two people chasing their dreams 1 
its a sad movie but very good 1 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
not recommended 0 
i could care less the interior is just beautiful 1 
it was a long time that i didnt see a so charismatic actor on screen 1 
i could not stand to even watch it for very long for fear of losing iq 0 
they keep getting better and better this is my third one and ive had numerous palms too 1 
so for our enjoyment we get to see them run around play games and be dangerous 1 
all in all id expected a better consumer experience from motorola 0 
for service i give them no stars 0 
i would recommend this 1 
i keep watching it over and over 1 
all i have to say is the food was amazing 1 
dont buy it 0 
very good though 1 
they could serve it with just the vinaigrette and it may make for a better overall dish but it was still very good 1 
this blueant supertooth handsfree phone speaker is awesome 1 
i advise you to look out for it 1 
the film succeeds despite or perhaps because of an obviously meagre budget 1 
the movie was very interesting from beginning to the end 1 
there is no real plot 0 
do not purchase this phone 0 
easy to pair with my samsung cell 1 
i love this bluetooth 1 
steamboat willie is an amazingly important film to our cinema history 1 
the decor is nice and the piano music soundtrack is pleasant 1 
regrettably the film fails 0 
this pda rocks 1 
i wear glasses and it fits fine with them 1 
however i needed some better instructions 0 
if you are razr owneryou must have this 1 
food was so gooodd 1 
i dont understand how this garbage got on the shelves of the movie store its not even a real movie 0 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
it was forced like everything in this movie 0 
rating 1 out of 10 0 
i have been very happy with the 510 and have had no complaints from any one regarding my sound quality on their end 1 
great case and price 1 
good quality 1 
the performances are real and gripping the crocdodile is extremely well done indeed if the black water website is to be believed thats because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous 1 
dont bother go to the store 0 
anne heche was utterly convincing 1 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
love this product 1 
i want to first say our server was great and we had perfect service 1 
dont buy it 0 
the cow tongue and cheek tacos are amazing 1 
i went to bachi burger on a friends recommendation and was not disappointed 1 
i just cant explain this movie more than romanticcharminghilariousand adorablethe junkyard scenes are funnyall the junkyard dogs have something specialtoo funny i laughedkids will love itbuy it when it comes outit has new features 1 
the restaurant is very clean and has a family restaurant feel to it 1 
which are small and not worth the price 0 
i ordered the lemon raspberry ice cocktail which was also incredible 1 
my rating just 3 out of 10 0 
anyways the food was definitely not filling at all and for the price you pay you should expect more 0 
but kevin spacey is an excellent verbal tsunami as buddy ackerman Â– and totally believable because he is a great actor 1 
this place is not worth your time let alone vegas 0 
motorola finally got the voice quality of a bluetooth headset right 1 
i love the ringtones because they are so upbeat 1 
dont buy this product 0 
this company charge me a restocking fee and still not given me my refund back 0 
all i have to say is the food was amazing 1 
this movie has a cutting edge to it 1 
not even good for camp value 0 
i guess it was supposed to be clever twist then shed some light on the situation but it was just stupid 0 
the chefs were friendly and did a good job 1 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
all this movie does is make you sick watching all these slackers make excuses for their stupid actions for 90 minutes 0 
im a big fan of this series mostly due to anne rices style sensitivities and treatments 1 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
waaaaaayyyyyyyyyy over rated is all i am saying 0 
the film is well paced understated and one of the best courtroom documentaries ive seen 1 
absolutel junk 0 
i work in the hospitality industry in paradise valley and have refrained from recommending cibo any longer 0 
summary the witticisms werent witty 0 
down the drain because of a weak snap 0 
elias koteasjack palance play good roles angelina is hot and gets nakedbilly drago appears in this and is cool as usual a cameo by sven ole thorsen helps make this a very enjoyable movie with good acting and a decent budget 1 
im still infatuated with this phone 1 
the server was very negligent of our needs and made us feel very unwelcome i would not suggest this place 0 
you have to hold the phone at a particular angle for the other party to hear you clearly 0 
i like the fact that it rests lightly against your ear rather than inside 1 
ill give this film 10 out of 10 1 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
the best part about nurse betty is its unpredictability 1 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
lousy product 0 
everything about this movie is stupid 0 
a drive thru means you do not want to wait around for half an hour for your food but somehow when we end up going here they make us wait and wait 0 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
it was also the right balance of war and love 1 
this movie is also revealing 1 
one of my favorite purchases ever 1 
what makes this story different are the terrific production values faultless photography composition and editing the terrific casting the underappreciated brian keith playing a bully teddy and vivid history 1 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
it clicks into place in a way that makes you wonder how long that mechanism would last 0 
generally it just lacked imagination 0 
long whiny and pointless 0 
totally believable 1 
im really disappointed all i have now is a charger that doesnt work 0 
i just wanted to leave 0 
owners are really great people 1 
disappointment i hate anything that goes in my ear 0 
his use of the colours of the french flag in the three films was nothing short of incredible every shot every scene was like a work of art 1 
i came over from verizon because cingulair has nicer cell phones the first thing i noticed was the really bad service 0 
the first thing that happened was that the tracking was off 0 
i am pairing this with my iphone and i could not be happier with it so far 1 
this place is handsdown one of the best places to eat in the phoenix metro area 1 
the battery is completely useless to me 0 
horrible 0 
as i said abovepretty useless 0 
then as if i hadnt wasted enough of my life there they poured salt in the wound by drawing out the time it took to bring the check 0 
sweetest phone 1 
the burger i got the gold standard a 17 burger and was kind of disappointed 0 
i gave it 5 stars because of the sound quality 1 
the best scene in the movie was when gerardo is trying to find a song that keeps running through his head 1 
in addition it feels amp looks as if the phone is all lightweight cheap plastic 0 
not only did the software do a great job of this i could also make my own ringtones form my existing cds without an internet connection 1 
wow what a bad film 0 
oh the charger seems to work fine 1 
i love being able to use one headset for both by landline and cell 1 
timely shipment and quality product 1 
that movie was bad 0 
there are the usual hitchcock logic flaws 0 
im not impressed with the concept or the food 0 
if you do go see this movie bring a pillow or a girlfriendboyfriend to keep you occupied through out 0 
youll love how thin it is 1 
couldnt figure it out 0 
if she had not rolled the eyes we may have stayed not sure if we will go back and try it again 0 
hence the whole story lacks a certain energy 0 
and finally after all that we get to an ending that wouldve been great had it been handled by competent people and not jerry falwell 0 
dont go here 0 
its very attractive and appears to be of good quality 1 
you share general loewenhielms exquisite joy in his partaking of the cailles en sarcophage even though you are just watching a movie but you do wish for just a small sample to savor 1 
the visual effects were awful 0 
service is quick and even to go orders are just like we like it 1 
all of the main players are mesmerising 1 
im still trying to get over how bad it was 0 
very slow at seating even with reservation 0 
this is some seriously good pizza and im an expertconnisseur on the topic 1 
im returning them 0 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
this is the first phone ive had that has been so cheaply made 0 
this is not moviemaking 0 
from what my dinner companions told meeverything was very fresh with nice texture and taste 1 
plus it was wellpaced and suited its relatively short run time 1 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
excellent product for the price 1 
the most annoying thing about cover girl is the way in which rita hayworth is put up on a pedestal 0 
it was so cool 1 
i like armand assante my cable companys summary sounded interesting so i watched it twice already and probably will again 1 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
today the graphics are crap 0 
its really easy 1 
i am very impressed with this headset from plantronics 1 
the cashew cream sauce was bland and the vegetables were undercooked 0 
it sure does beat the nachos at the movies but i would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant 0 
all in all ha long bay was a bit of a flop 0 
level 5 spicy was perfect where spice didnt overwhelm the soup 1 
so anyone near you will hear part of your conversation 0 
my brother in law who works at the mall ate here same day and guess what he was sick all night too 0 
i guess it was supposed to be clever twist then shed some light on the situation but it was just stupid 0 
it is practically useless and did not add any kind of boost to my reception after i bought it 0 
his use of the colours of the french flag in the three films was nothing short of incredible every shot every scene was like a work of art 1 
amazon sucks 0 
soggy and not good 0 
woa talk about awful 0 
dont waste your money 0 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
see it with your kids if you have a chanceit will open up some amazing dialog about how far race relations have come in the last 50 years 1 
the poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying 0 
the cashier was friendly and even brought the food out to me 1 
my husband and i ate lunch here and were very disappointed with the food and service 0 
as an earlier review noted plug in this charger and nothing happens 0 
youll love it 1 
i really hope the team behind this movie makes more movies and that they will continue to do so in their own some kinda weird style 1 
i had a pretty satifying experience 1 
this is one of peter watkins most accessible films 1 
the food is about on par with dennys which is to say not good at all 0 
disapointing results 0 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
i am very happy 1 
i had strawberry tea which was good 1 
the servers are not pleasant to deal with and they dont always honor pizza hut coupons 0 
excellent hands free tool 1 
i really enjoyed eating here 1 
now you know why i gave it a 10 1 
save your money ive had this item for 11 months now 0 
this is a good joint 1 
the service was great even the manager came and helped with our table 1 
all the bread is made inhouse 1 
each track commands sentiment actually contributing to the scenes and characters 1 
fans of the genre will be in heaven 1 
phone is sturdy as all nokia bar phones are 1 
everything about this film is simply incredible 1 
after all the rave reviews i couldnt wait to eat herewhat a disappointment 0 
again lame 0 
at no point in the proceedings does it look remotely like america 0 
see it 1 
as a courtroom drama its compelling as an indictment on the american justice system its frightening 1 
but now that it is out of warranty the same problems reoccurebottom line put your money somewhere else cingular will not support it 0 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
yes its shiny on front side and i love it 1 
i paid the bill but did not tip because i felt the server did a terrible job 0 
this pda rocks 1 
using all earpieces left or right this thing will not stay on my ear 0 
later i found myself lost in the power of the film 1 
the success of the film depends on the casting of sydney greenstreet as the alexander yardley character 1 
not much seafood and like 5 strings of pasta at the bottom 0 
now we were chosen to be tortured with this disgusting piece of blatant american propaganda 0 
over rated 0 
just what i wanted 1 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
i understand that its supposed to be a cheap popcorn comedy but that doesnt mean that it has to completely insult our intelligence and have writing so incredibly hackneyed that it borders on offensive 0 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
my phone doesnt slide around my car now and the grip prevents my phone from slipping out of my hand 1 
dont buy it 0 
highquality chicken on the chicken caesar salad 1 
its a shame to see good actors like thomerson and james make a living in a mess like this 0 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
its quite simply the highest most superlative form of cinema imaginable 1 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
i cannot believe that the actors agreed to do this film 0 
the bt headset was such a disapoinment 0 
i have to jiggle the plug to get it to line up right to get decent volume 0 
i asked multiple times for the wine list and after some time of being ignored i went to the hostess and got one myself 0 
item does not match picture 0 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
there were several moments in the movie that just didnt need to be there and were excruciatingly slow moving 0 
in summary this was a largely disappointing dining experience 0 
they have a plethora of salads and sandwiches and everything ive tried gets my seal of approval 1 
nice design and quality 1 
is it possible for a movie to get any worse than this 0 
bad characters bad story and bad acting 0 
you can even take self portraits with the outside exterior display very cool 1 
we wont be going back 0 
i got it because it was so small and adorable 1 
the food was terrible 0 
not only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic but it also managed to give away the entire movie and im not exaggerating every moment every plot point every joke is told in the trailer 0 
highly unprofessional and rude to a loyal patron 0 
but the duet between the astronaut and his doctor at the beginning of the movie is a perfect exchange if one considers that this movie was made well into the cold war and the astronauts biggest fear is that he has crashed in the ussr 1 
plus its only 8 bucks 1 
interesting decor 1 
the instructions didnt explain that a microphone jack could be used 0 
also the fries are without a doubt the worst fries ive ever had 0 
the cashier was friendly and even brought the food out to me 1 
well never go again 0 
very cheap plastic creaks like an old wooden floor 0 
this is a witty and delightful adaptation of the dr seuss book brilliantly animated by upas finest and thoroughly deserving of its academy award 1 
the file browser offers all the options that one needshandsfree is great 1 
the cashew cream sauce was bland and the vegetables were undercooked 0 
i mean in a realistic world she would never have gotten into that ballet repertory the whole thing was quite pathetic 0 
stay away from the q 0 
i had a pretty satifying experience 1 
highly recommended 1 
the food sucked which we expected but it sucked more than we could have imagined 0 
that just screams legit in my booksomethats also pretty rare here in vegas 1 
highly recommended 1 
works great 1 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
makes it easier to keep up with my bluetooth when im not wearing it 0 
food was so gooodd 1 
the food was great as always compliments to the chef 1 
this place is great 1 
no actress has been worse used that june allison in this movie 0 
its not hard to make a decent hamburger 0 
waaaaaayyyyyyyyyy over rated is all i am saying 0 
my side greek salad with the greek dressing was so tasty and the pita and hummus was very refreshing 1 
worth every penny 1 
i have purchased these for both family and friends and all enjoy their clarity and ease of use 1 
in an interesting part of town this place is amazing 1 
it definitely was not as good as my s11 1 
ill definitely be in soon again 1 
so i basically threw my money out the window for nothing 0 
lot of holes in the plot theres nothing about how he became the emperor nothing about where he spend 20 years between his childhood and mature age 0 
none of the new ones have ever quite worked properly 0 
i cannot believe that the actors agreed to do this film 0 
i could care less the interior is just beautiful 1 
this little device has transformed my organizational capability and made my life a whole lot easier 1 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
will order from them again 1 
go to place for gyros 1 
not good when wearing a hat or sunglasses 0 
a very good film indeed about great and unconditional love 1 
case was more or less an extra that i originally put on but later discarded because it scratched my ear 0 
the owners really really need to quit being soooooo cheap let them wrap my freaking sandwich in two papers not one 0 
im trying to return it for a refund 0 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
great pocket pc phone combination 1 
the food is rich so order accordingly 1 
the use of slowmotion needlessly repeats itself throughout the movie but is well backed up by bad acting and bad is a kind word here no continuity scenes that are thrown in for no reason whatsoever vehicles that looked like they were made from a corn flakes box and a directorial style that bordered on stupidity 0 
this was reflected not only in the cast but also in the belowpar script which borrowed much from the earlier classic 0 
horrible dont waste your time and money 0 
we sat another ten minutes and finally gave up and left 0 
you wont regret it 1 
the problem was the script 0 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
the film has an ultracheap look to it 0 
the most annoying thing about cover girl is the way in which rita hayworth is put up on a pedestal 0 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
it works 1 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
both of the egg rolls were fantastic 1 
the only very disappointing thing was there was no speakerphone 0 
the film is well paced understated and one of the best courtroom documentaries ive seen 1 
this is by far the worst purchase ive made on amazon 0 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
owners are really great people 1 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
also great directing and photography 1 
trumbull on i love lucy 1 
i think i was one of the people who found this another one of roths pearls 1 
im not sure what he was trying to do with this film 0 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
at first i thought i was grtting a good deal at 744 until i plugged it into my phone v3c razr 0 
an extensive menu provides lots of options for breakfast 1 
i loved their mussels cooked in this wine reduction the duck was tender and their potato dishes were delicious 1 
down the drain because of a weak snap 0 
waitress was a little slow in service 0 
if you look for authentic thai food go else where 0 
love this phone 1 
totally believable 1 
very serious spoilers this movie was a huge disappointment 0 
will order from them again 1 
the spaghetti is nothing special whatsoever 0 
we also ordered the spinach and avocado salad the ingredients were sad and the dressing literally had zero taste 0 
great place fo take out or eat in 1 
its a gloriously fun fast paced and fairly accurate portrayal of the night of a raver 1 
the plot well i said id let that one go 0 
avoid at all costs 0 
the staff is always super friendly and helpful which is especially cool when you bring two small boys and a baby 1 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
for the price this was a great deal 1 
i understand that its supposed to be a cheap popcorn comedy but that doesnt mean that it has to completely insult our intelligence and have writing so incredibly hackneyed that it borders on offensive 0 
aside from its terrible lead this film has loads of other debits 0 
there are so many problems i dont know where to start 0 
i guess it was supposed to be clever twist then shed some light on the situation but it was just stupid 0 
one character is totally annoying with a voice that gives me the feeling of fingernails on a chalkboard 0 
the vegetables are so fresh and the sauce feels like authentic thai 1 
it also had a new problem 0 
if you hate earbugs avoid this phone by all means 0 
battery has no life 0 
the movie showed a lot of florida at its best made it look very appealing 1 
this is definitely one of the better documentaries i have seen looking at family relationships and marriage 1 
trumbull on i love lucy 1 
rip off over charge shipping 0 
if there was ever a movie that needed wordofmouth to promote this is it 1 
if you check the directors filmography on this site you will see why this film didnt have a chance 0 
in summary this was a largely disappointing dining experience 0 
i never come again 0 
hence the whole story lacks a certain energy 0 
damian is so talented and versatile in so many ways of writing and portraying different characters on screen 1 
i really enjoyed eating here 1 
it is shameful 0 
setup went very smoothly 1 
the sets especially designed to work with the camera are amazingstylized beautiful and effective 1 
the restaurant atmosphere was exquisite 1 
i mean this in a terrible way 0 
the worst piece of crap ever along with the verizon customer service 0 
shes poised and amazing 1 
the jamaican mojitos are delicious 1 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
i like design and look of jabra behing the ear headsets and 5020 is pretty comfortible to wear 24 hours a day without pain in the ear 1 
as for the service im a fan because its quick and youre being served by some nice folks 1 
there is nothing authentic about this place 0 
you get extra minutes so that you can carry out the call and not get cut off 1 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
dee snider just plain sucks 0 
if the food isnt bad enough for you then enjoy dealing with the worlds worstannoying drunk people 0 
dont waste your time 0 
i guess that nobody at the network that aired this dribble watched it before putting it on 0 
down the drain because of a weak snap 0 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
works for me 1 
however after finally watching this film i realized that not only had i had a closed mind to the brilliance it depicts i also found myself watching it over and over again 1 
i would highly recommend this product 1 
from here on the widmark character turns unintentionally comical 0 
oh yeah and the storyline was pathetic too 0 
while i managed to bend the leaf spring back in place the metal now has enough stress that it will break on the next drop 0 
this place is handsdown one of the best places to eat in the phoenix metro area 1 
and then tragedy struck 0 
i really wanted the plantronics 510 to be the right one but it has too many issues for methe good 0 
i agree with jessica this movie is pretty bad 0 
its a great item 1 
the script is horrendously stupid 0 
conclusion i loved it 1 
and the accents are absolutely abysmal 0 
unfortunately we must have hit the bakery on leftover day because everything we ordered was stale 0 
ill give this film 10 out of 10 1 
unless youre just out to visually collect all extant films of austens work you can skip this one 0 
simple lightweight and great fit 1 
i ate there twice on my last visit and especially enjoyed the salmon salad 1 
there is no real plot 0 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
i dont understand how this garbage got on the shelves of the movie store its not even a real movie 0 
not good when wearing a hat or sunglasses 0 
the service was poor and thats being nice 0 
this phone is slim and light and the display is beautiful 1 
emily watsons character is very strong and she has only to give a quick glance and you understand everything 1 
but what really made it unwatchable was the direction 0 
took an hour to get our food only 4 tables in restaurant my food was luke warm our sever was running around like he was totally overwhelmed 0 
so just beware 0 
i great reception all the time 1 
i promise they wont disappoint 1 
go watch it 1 
and i just love the colors 1 
could not get strong enough signal 0 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
things happen characters personalities change plot twists occur for no real reason other than that script calls for it 0 
generous portions and great taste 1 
best ive found so far ive tried 2 other bluetooths and this one has the best quality for both me and the listener as well as ease of using 1 
oh this is such a thing of beauty this restaurant 1 
phenomenal food service and ambiance 1 
mediocre food 0 
worst hour and a half of my lifeoh my gosh 0 
it has a very good plot it holds your complete attention the acting is superb tom wilkinson was fantastic and emily watson was also very good 1 
great brunch spot 1 
i particularly remember my senses being assaulted by strident cords of music that would blare out with very little warning and even less meaning 0 
the foreigner is not worth one second of your time 0 
if you do watch it however there are small consolations the actresses playing annes sisters each do a wonderful job with their roles 1 
this movie suffered because of the writing it needed more suspense 0 
this is an unbelievable bargain 1 
this film has no redeeming features 0 
lucy bell is so much higher than this crap and for her to sink this low is quite depressing 0 
and i just love the colors 1 
sooooo good 1 
i had high hopes for this place since the burgers are cooked over a charcoal grill but unfortunately the taste fell flat way flat 0 
it really created a unique feeling though 1 
every time he opened his mouth you expect to hear you see kids pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show 0 
his performance is simply genius 1 
total brunch fail 0 
horrible phone 0 
all the bread is made inhouse 1 
good value great food great service 1 
how awful she is 0 
i was particularly pleased with the acting ability of dwight schultz 1 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
youll love how thin it is 1 
its a case of so bad it is laughable 0 
it was delicious 1 
the plot doesnt hang together at all and the acting is absolutely appalling 0 
the company shipped my product very promptly and it works well 1 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
freezes frequently4 0 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
aside from its terrible lead this film has loads of other debits 0 
all the bread is made inhouse 1 
never got it 0 
disapointing results 0 
unfortunately this is a bad movie that is just plain bad 0 
a lot of websites have been rating this a very good phone and so do i 1 
110 and only because there is no setting for 010 0 
the warm beer didnt help 0 
now the pizza itself was good the peanut sauce was very tasty 1 
our server was very nice and even though he looked a little overwhelmed with all of our needs he stayed professional and friendly until the end 1 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
john garfield ann revere lilli plmer william conrad canada leeand filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screenjames wong howe 1 
love the margaritas too 1 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
doesnt hold charge 0 
you wont regret it 1 
bela lugosi was totally extraneous intoning odd lines 0 
the sangria was about half of a glass wine full and was 12 ridiculous 0 
howeverthe riingtones are not the best and neither are the games 0 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
this wonderful experience made this place a muststop whenever we are in town again 1 
ive only had my bluetooth for a few weeks but i really like it 1 
another note about this phones appearance is that it really looks rather bland especially in the all black model 0 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
sweetest phone 1 
utterly without merit on any level this is akin to torture 0 
imdb ratings only go as low 1 for awful its time to get some negative numbers in there for cases such as these 0 
no real improvement 0 
but then they came back cold 0 
with the originality and freshness of the first movie now spent this remake had little else to offer 0 
unless youre just out to visually collect all extant films of austens work you can skip this one 0 
it is an excellent drama an excellent thriller and an excellent film 1 
better than new 1 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
worst hour and a half of my lifeoh my gosh 0 
to call this movie a drama is ridiculous 0 
at any rate this film stinks its not funny and fulci should have stayed with giallo and supernatural zombie movies 0 
lately they have been extremely nice and helpful on the phone 1 
voice quality signal strength dropped calls 0 
the real disappointment was our waiter 0 
mediocre food 0 
dont waste your money 0 
this pda rocks 1 
service was exceptional and food was a good as all the reviews 1 
nice headphones for the price and they work great 1 
youd have to have the iq of particularly stupid mollusk not to see that one coming 0 
the company shipped my product very promptly and it works well 1 
ordered burger rare came in well done 0 
the ripped banana was not only ripped but petrified and tasteless 0 
it definitely was not as good as my s11 1 
i waited and waited 0 
the han nan chicken was also very tasty 1 
has been working great 1 
overall the film is interesting and thoughtprovoking 1 
this greedy corporation will never see another dime from me 0 
much better than the other ayce sushi place i went to in vegas 1 
this one is simply a disappointment 0 
ive had this for nearly 2 years and it has worked great for me 1 
it was packed 0 
this is by far the worst purchase ive made on amazon 0 
thanks good a movie like this was done and released 1 
it didnt make me scared horrified or make me sympathetic towards the characters it was simply annoying 0 
kieslowski never ceases to amaze me 1 
this is a chilly unremarkable movie about an author livingworking in a chilly abstruse culture 0 
linksys should have some way to exchange a bad phone for a refurb unit or something 0 
the real killer is the volume and of course it breaking 0 
very windresistant 1 
there is nothing privileged about workingeating there 0 
it was a drive to get there 0 
with the originality and freshness of the first movie now spent this remake had little else to offer 0 
the building itself seems pretty neat the bathroom is pretty trippy but i wouldnt eat here again 0 
wont work right or atleast for me 0 
yes its shiny on front side and i love it 1 
it was too predictable even for a chick flick 0 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
they brought a fresh batch of fries and i was thinking yay something warm but no 0 
i want to first say our server was great and we had perfect service 1 
the staff are great the ambiance is great 1 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
the sets especially designed to work with the camera are amazingstylized beautiful and effective 1 
all in all i give this one a resounding 9 out of 10 1 
the story unfolds in 18th century jutland and the use of period music played on period instruments is just one more fine touch 1 
you cant beat the price on these 1 
there are massive levels massive unlockable characters its just a massive game 1 
have been going since 2007 and every meal has been awesome 1 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
nice docking station for home or work 1 
there was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters 0 
his use of the colours of the french flag in the three films was nothing short of incredible every shot every scene was like a work of art 1 
i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
the majority of the logitech earbud headsets failed 0 
this gets a 1 out of 10 simply because theres nothing lower 0 
i really liked that 1 
from here on the widmark character turns unintentionally comical 0 
it was a good thing that the tickets only cost five dollars because i would be mad if id have paid 750 to see this crap 0 
couldnt use the unit with sunglasses not good in texas 0 
they have been around for years and carries the highest quality of antiglare screen protector that i have found to date 1 
10 out of 10 stars 1 
like the other reviewer said you couldnt pay me to eat at this place again 0 
the food sucked which we expected but it sucked more than we could have imagined 0 
i saw this film over christmas and what a great film it was 1 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
the movie has almost no action scenes in it and very little comedy 0 
my order was not correct 0 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
but storm trooper is not even bad enough to make it to the list of wonderfully terrible movies 0 
we ordered the duck rare and it was pink and tender on the inside with a nice char on the outside 1 
also were served hot bread and butter and home made potato chips with bacon bits on topvery original and very good 1 
all this movie does is make you sick watching all these slackers make excuses for their stupid actions for 90 minutes 0 
i hate writing bad reviews about films especially those in which i really like the star but this film is so bad i dont believe for one second that anyone could have been proud of it 0 
i really do recommend this place you can go wrong with this donut place 1 
also the fries are without a doubt the worst fries ive ever had 0 
thats how id describe this painfully dreary timewaster of a film 0 
we had a group of 70 when we claimed we would only have 40 and they handled us beautifully 1 
it was attached to a gas station and that is rarely a good sign 0 
this is a chilly unremarkable movie about an author livingworking in a chilly abstruse culture 0 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
everything stinks 0 
there arent death scenes like in previous movies and the fx are terrible 0 
a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it 1 
we had fantastic service and were pleased by the atmosphere 1 
keep up the good work amazon 1 
this place is not worth your time let alone vegas 0 
i would avoid this place if you are staying in the mirage 0 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
absolutel junk 0 
there is no real plot 0 
same evening him and i are both drastically sick 0 
i dont each much pasta but i love the homemade hand made pastas and thin pizzas here 1 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
absolutely great 1 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
we wont be returning 0 
this place is way too overpriced for mediocre food 0 
we ordered some old classics and some new dishes after going there a few times and were sorely disappointed with everything 0 
does not fit 0 
not to mention the combination of pears almonds and bacon is a big winner 1 
the music in the film is really nice too 1 
not much seafood and like 5 strings of pasta at the bottom 0 
both great 1 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
wont ever go here again 0 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
works fine 1 
pricing is a bit of a concern at mellow mushroom 0 
kind of hard to mess up a steak but they did 0 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
this is my new fav vegas buffet spot 1 
i even dropped this phone into a stream and it was submerged for 15 seconds and it still works great 1 
what a mistake that was 0 
i mean in a realistic world she would never have gotten into that ballet repertory the whole thing was quite pathetic 0 
last night was my second time dining here and i was so happy i decided to go back 1 
you cant beat that 1 
worse theres an incredibly weak subplot thrown in that follows a little band of latterday mansonites as they go after a reporter whos working on a story on the anniversary of the killings 0 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
and his subtle connections between the three films are awesome 1 
what a mistake that was 0 
nice blanket of moz over top but i feel like this was done to cover up the subpar food 1 
last time buying from you 0 
comfortable fit you need your headset to be comfortable for at least an hour at a time if not for an entire day 1 
with the originality and freshness of the first movie now spent this remake had little else to offer 0 
i had verizon 2 years ago and really liked their service 1 
please dont waste your money 0 
my mother and brother had to do thiswhen i saw robert ryan portraying this type of man it was a very good imitation of this type of individual and i was impressed 1 
it lasts less than 3o minutes if i actually try to use the phonemy wife has the same phone with the same problem 0 
but i thought his acting was skilled 1 
excellent sound quality 1 
good works fine 1 
battery has no life 0 
a piece of cinematic garbage captured on celluloid 0 
for 40 bucks a head i really expect better food 0 
i have always used corded headsets and the freedom from the wireless is very helpful 1 
the script is was there a script 0 
overall the film is interesting and thoughtprovoking 1 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
the acting is beyond abysmal 0 
would not go back 0 
i dont have very many words to say about this place but it does everything pretty well 1 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
worth every penny 1 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
i received my headset in good time and was happy with it 1 
battery is holding up well 1 
they were goldencrispy and delicious 1 
ive only had my bluetooth for a few weeks but i really like it 1 
no additional ear gels provided and no instructions whatsoever 0 
so absolutley fantastic 1 
i hope this place sticks around 1 
we arent ones to make a scene at restaurants but i just dont get itdefinitely lost the love after this one 0 
comes with a strong light that you can use to light up your camera shots and even flash sos signals seriously 1 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
i wont say any more i dont like spoilers so i dont want to be one but i believe this film is worth your time 1 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
fast service 1 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
dont buy it 0 
the songs were the best and the muppets were so hilarious 1 
the battery is completely useless to me 0 
i know this is not like the other restaurants at all something is very off here 0 
wow loved this place 1 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
we were promptly greeted and seated 1 
and then tragedy struck 0 
it was a pale color instead of nice and char and has no flavor 0 
this is one of the best movies out there that shows such strong sibling bond for each other 1 
all of the main players are mesmerising 1 
bluetooth does not work phone locks up screens just flash up and now it just makes calls randomly while in my pocket locked 0 
it fits my ear well and is comfortable on 1 
service was good and the company was better 1 
the fries were great too 1 
i found this move beautiful enjoyable and uplifting 1 
perhaps i caught them on an off night judging by the other reviews but im not inspired to go back 0 
perhaps my phone is defective but people cannot hear me when i use this 0 
it is easy to turn on and off when you are in the car and the volume controls are quite accessable 1 
a happy wonderful feel good ending 1 
i rate this movie 910 1 
it was that loudglad to say that the plantronics 510 maintains a flawless connection to my cell and with no static during normal use 1 
the majority of the logitech earbud headsets failed 0 
the movie was so boring that i sometimes found myself occupied peaking in the paper instead of watching never happened during a columbo movie before 0 
i wasnt expecting oscar material but this 0 
camerawork again bad 0 
the cashew cream sauce was bland and the vegetables were undercooked 0 
fast service 1 
it even has its sweet moments 1 
but the actingeven that of such professionals as drago and debbie rochonwas terrible the directing worse perhaps contributory to the former the dialog chimplike and the camera work barely tolerable 0 
again no plot at all 0 
the script is a big flawed mess 0 
lastly the mozzarella sticks they were the best thing we ordered 1 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
the stories were as unbelievable as the actors 0 
mishima is extremely uninteresting 0 
rude inconsiderate management 0 
i am very happy 1 
the wind and the lion is well written and superbly acted 1 
if the food isnt bad enough for you then enjoy dealing with the worlds worstannoying drunk people 0 
the eargels channel the sound directly into your ear and seem to increase the sound volume and clarity 1 
for those that havent seen it dont waste your time 0 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
the plug did not work very well 0 
rip off over charge shipping 0 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
the holster that arrived did not match the photo in the ad 0 
i would advise to not purchase this item it never worked very well 0 
this totally unfunny movie is so over the top and pathetic and unrealistic that throughout the whole 90 minutes of utter torture i probably looked at my watch about 70000 times 0 
i always order from the vegetarian menu during dinner which has a wide array of options to choose from 1 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
great pocket pc phone combination 1 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
none of them are engaging or exciting 0 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
this place is horrible and way overpriced 0 
however this didnt make up for the fact that overall this was a tremendously boring movie 0 
we enjoy their pizza and brunch 1 
needless to say i wont be going back anytime soon 0 
would not go back 0 
greatno problems at all 1 
beware this is not a trashy cult movie this is trash period 0 
my side greek salad with the greek dressing was so tasty and the pita and hummus was very refreshing 1 
they know how to make them here 1 
however after finally watching this film i realized that not only had i had a closed mind to the brilliance it depicts i also found myself watching it over and over again 1 
a fantastic neighborhood gem 1 
this was my first time and i cant wait until the next 1 
this is by far the worst purchase ive made on amazon 0 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
i dont have very many words to say about this place but it does everything pretty well 1 
on the up side their cafe serves really good food 1 
the worst phone ive ever had only had it for a few months 0 
i wasnt really impressed with strip steak 0 
the service was a little slow considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace 0 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
it is super charged up for use as a small hybrid palmtopcameracellphone and excels in those roles 1 
its so stupid to have to keep buying new chargers car chargers cradles headphones and car kits every time a new phone comes out 0 
the flat reenactments dont hold your attention because they are emotionally adrift and stagy 0 
our server was super nice and checked on us many times 1 
what makes this story different are the terrific production values faultless photography composition and editing the terrific casting the underappreciated brian keith playing a bully teddy and vivid history 1 
after i pulled up my car i waited for another 15 minutes before being acknowledged 0 
i love the ringtones because they are so upbeat 1 
worse theres an incredibly weak subplot thrown in that follows a little band of latterday mansonites as they go after a reporter whos working on a story on the anniversary of the killings 0 
these headphones were a great find and i think they are perhaps the best purchase ive made in the last several years seriously 1 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
the staff is friendly and the joint is always clean 1 
the acting was bad 0 
hayao miyazakis latest and eighth film for studio ghibili gake no ue no ponyo ponyo on the cliff by the sea is a wonderfully fun and imaginative look at childhood 1 
hayao miyazakis latest and eighth film for studio ghibili gake no ue no ponyo ponyo on the cliff by the sea is a wonderfully fun and imaginative look at childhood 1 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
and considering the two of us left there very full and happy for about 20 you just cant go wrong 1 
but kevin spacey is an excellent verbal tsunami as buddy ackerman Â– and totally believable because he is a great actor 1 
ill give this film 10 out of 10 1 
all it took was one drop from about 6 inches above the kitchen counter and it was crackedi am not impressed and i am not laughing 0 
in fact im going to round up to 4 stars just because she was so awesome 1 
my ribeye steak was cooked perfectly and had great mesquite flavor 1 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
magical help 1 
dont waste your on this one 0 
when my mom and i got home she immediately got sick and she only had a few bites of salad 0 
all in all a great disappointment 0 
would come back again if i had a sushi craving while in vegas 1 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
highquality chicken on the chicken caesar salad 1 
in addition it feels amp looks as if the phone is all lightweight cheap plastic 0 
the story itself is just predictable and lazy 0 
everything about this movie is stupid 0 
there were several moments in the movie that just didnt need to be there and were excruciatingly slow moving 0 
not a good bargain 0 
excellent sound battery life and inconspicuous to boot 1 
i was deeply impressed with the character he played 1 
why was this film made 0 
great hands free device 1 
for a product that costs as much as this one does i expect it to work far better and with greater ease than this thing does 0 
my husband said she was very rude did not even apologize for the bad food or anything 0 
worthless product 0 
sending it back 0 
the menu is always changing food quality is going down service is extremely slow 0 
magical help 1 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
then i had to continue pairing it periodically since it somehow kept dropping 0 
the ambiance isnt much better 0 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
by the time the film ended i not only disliked it i despised it 0 
i never walked out of a movie faster 0 
if it were possible to give them zero stars theyd have it 0 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
del taco is pretty nasty and should be avoided if possible 0 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
the mic there is a joke and the volume is quite low 0 
the lead man is charismafree 0 
third the cheese on my friends burger was cold 0 
the interplay between martin and emilio contains the same wonderful chemistry we saw in wall street with martin and charlie 1 
unfortunately inexperience of direction meant that scene after scene passed with little in the way of dramatic tension or conflict 0 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
unfortunately it will not recharge my iphone 4s despite connecting it from multiple power sources imac external battery wall outlet etc 0 
the movie in movie situations in the beginning and through the game that is played with her by the acting coach are fascinating 1 
im in az all the time and now have my new spot 1 
the owner used to work at nobu so this place is really similar for half the price 1 
i sat riveted to the tv screen 1 
integrated seamlessly with the motorola razr phone 1 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
10 out of 10 stars 1 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
this is actually a very smart movie 1 
great brunch spot 1 
characters are onedimensional even the good guys and especially the bad guys 0 
none of it works just dont buy it 0 
the place was fairly clean but the food simply wasnt worth it 0 
it was a waste of my money 0 
this phone works great 1 
waiter was a jerk 0 
it works fine on my motorola 325 cellphone and a lot better than the wornout battery did 1 
my only problem is i thought the actor playing the villain was a low rent michael ironside 0 
not to mention the combination of pears almonds and bacon is a big winner 1 
i love this thing 1 
the cashew cream sauce was bland and the vegetables were undercooked 0 
there were several moments in the movie that just didnt need to be there and were excruciatingly slow moving 0 
this movie creates its own universe and is fascinating in every way 1 
i love it 1 
best of all is the rotating feature very helpful 1 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
the bottowm lineanother worthless cheap gimmick from sprint 0 
the dialogue sucked 0 
yes i am simplifying things here for the sake of brevity for this really is at the core of the problems with this film it has too much going on without any real fulfilling explanation 0 
he was terrible 0 
excellent service 1 
i had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get some relief 0 
they brought a fresh batch of fries and i was thinking yay something warm but no 0 
this is not moviemaking 0 
also great directing and photography 1 
this place deserves one star and 90 has to do with the food 0 
i dont have very many words to say about this place but it does everything pretty well 1 
all of the tapas dishes were delicious 1 
weve have gotten a much better service from the pizza place next door than the services we received from this restaurant 0 
went for lunch service was slow 0 
all the bread is made inhouse 1 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
the warm beer didnt help 0 
this is some seriously good pizza and im an expertconnisseur on the topic 1 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
you will leave the theater wanting to go out and dance under the stars 1 
i got to enjoy the seafood salad with a fabulous vinegrette 1 
great phone 1 
horrible had to switch 3 times 0 
on the negative its insipid enough to cause regret for another 2 hours of life wasted in front of the screen 0 
did not like at all 0 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
so for our enjoyment we get to see them run around play games and be dangerous 1 
then i exchanged for the same phone even that had the same problem 0 
clear crisp sound 1 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
however this didnt make up for the fact that overall this was a tremendously boring movie 0 
took an hour to get our food only 4 tables in restaurant my food was luke warm our sever was running around like he was totally overwhelmed 0 
exactly what i wanted 1 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
i enjoyed it 1 
the volume switch rocketed out of the unit to a destination unknown 0 
rude inconsiderate management 0 
kris kristoffersen is good in this movie and really makes a difference 1 
my wife had the lobster bisque soup which was lukewarm 0 
battery is holding up well 1 
if it were possible to give them zero stars theyd have it 0 
damian is so talented and versatile in so many ways of writing and portraying different characters on screen 1 
its not what it says it is 0 
i would recommend this 1 
better than new 1 
i hate to disagree with my fellow yelpers but my husband and i were so disappointed with this place 0 
my rating just 3 out of 10 0 
an extensive menu provides lots of options for breakfast 1 
lucy bell is so much higher than this crap and for her to sink this low is quite depressing 0 
wed definitely go back here again 1 
well never go again 0 
just reading on the specs alone makes you say wow 1 
great food and service huge portions and they give a military discount 1 
total brunch fail 0 
this film highlights the fundamental flaws of the legal process that its not about discovering guilt or innocence but rather is about who presents better in court 1 
steamboat willie is an amazingly important film to our cinema history 1 
i could not recommend these more 0 
really good product 1 
our server was very nice and even though he looked a little overwhelmed with all of our needs he stayed professional and friendly until the end 1 
oh this is such a thing of beauty this restaurant 1 
it fits my ear well and is comfortable on 1 
i dont think it would hold it too securly on your belt 0 
all this movie does is make you sick watching all these slackers make excuses for their stupid actions for 90 minutes 0 
comfortable fit you need your headset to be comfortable for at least an hour at a time if not for an entire day 1 
this place was such a nice surprise 1 
omelets are to die for 1 
her lines seem to have been written by a fifteen year old though they are trying oh so so hard to sound like how a fifteen year old would really um you know well talk 0 
the battery life is highly unacceptable 0 
a standout scene 1 
come hungry leave happy and stuffed 1 
will order from them again 1 
the battery life is highly unacceptable 0 
brilliance indeed 1 
horrible dont waste your time and money 0 
the story itself is just predictable and lazy 0 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
amazon sucks 0 
its not hard to make a decent hamburger 0 
do not waste your money here 0 
rip off over charge shipping 0 
mic doesnt work 0 
the first thing that happened was that the tracking was off 0 
the food was great as always compliments to the chef 1 
we enjoy their pizza and brunch 1 
just as good as when i had it more than a year ago 1 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
poor construction 0 
battery lasts only a few hours 0 
try them in the airport to experience some tasty food and speedy friendly service 1 
there was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth but it didnt really work into the rest of the plot 0 
on the ground right next to our table was a large smeared beensteppedinandtrackedeverywhere pile of green bird poop 0 
it presents a idyllic yet serious portrayal of the ups and downs of the characters lives 1 
great character actors telly savalas and peter boyle 1 
he is an amazing film artist one of the most important whoever lived 1 
duris has a wholesome appearance and gives a fine performance 1 
the budget was evidently very limited 0 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
i definitly recommend 1 
the fries were not hot and neither was my burger 0 
i really liked that 1 
nice ambiance 1 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
see it 1 
interesting decor 1 
this place is way too overpriced for mediocre food 0 
it crackles with an unpredictable youthful energy but honestly i found it hard to follow and concentrate on it meanders so badly 0 
o my gosh the best phone i have ever had 1 
i cant see how this movie can be an inspiration to anyone to come out or overcome fear and rejection 0 
this movie does an excellent job of revealing the complexity of the task and the incredible challenges facing south africa 1 
it works 1 
its one of the most boring horror movies from the 90s mainly because it starts slow and centers in a boring atmosphere 0 
tom wilkinson broke my heart at the end and everyone elses judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike 1 
good product incredible value 1 
lately they have been extremely nice and helpful on the phone 1 
in an interesting part of town this place is amazing 1 
the service was not up to par either 0 
strike 2 who wants to be rushed 0 
there were several moments in the movie that just didnt need to be there and were excruciatingly slow moving 0 
the writer gorman bechard undoubtedly did his homework because all references are industry and characterage appropriate 1 
my drink was never empty and he made some really great menu suggestions 1 
filmiing was less expansive 0 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
performed awful muffled tinny incoming sound and severe echo for those on the other end of the call 0 
dont buy it 0 
best tacos in town by far 1 
i am very happy 1 
i had verizon 2 years ago and really liked their service 1 
i found this move beautiful enjoyable and uplifting 1 
the script is horrendously stupid 0 
worthless product 0 
bought mainly for the charger which broke soon after purchasing 0 
its too bad the food is so damn generic 0 
the food came out at a good pace 1 
all i can do is whine on the internet so here it goesthe more i use the thing the less i like it 0 
lightweight and works well 1 
i can take a little bad service but the food sucks 0 
fantastic food 1 
the reception has been generally good 1 
waitress was good though 1 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
im not eating here 0 
last time buying from you 0 
worst hour and a half of my lifeoh my gosh 0 
special thanks to dylan t for the recommendation on what to order all yummy for my tummy 1 
worst customer service ever 0 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
cool phone 1 
in the summer you can dine in a charming outdoor patio so very delightful 1 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
i really enjoyed crema cafÃ© before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
we got the food and apparently they have never heard of salt and the batter on the fish was chewy 0 
all in all its an insult to ones intelligence and a huge waste of money 0 
i wear glasses and it fits fine with them 1 
timely shipment and quality product 1 
all i can do is whine on the internet so here it goesthe more i use the thing the less i like it 0 
it has all the features i want 1 
so i am here to warn youdo not rent this movie it is the dumbest thing you have never seen 0 
i only hear garbage for audio 0 
this is the kind of money that is wasted properly 1 
it is super charged up for use as a small hybrid palmtopcameracellphone and excels in those roles 1 
the bartender was also nice 1 
they have horrible attitudes towards customers and talk down to each one when customers dont enjoy their food 0 
if there is a wind it is completely useless 0 
it does everything the description said it would 1 
from here on the widmark character turns unintentionally comical 0 
the soundtrack sucked 0 
nice headphones for the price and they work great 1 
the flair bartenders are absolutely amazing 1 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
pretty good beer selection too 1 
i didnt know pulled pork could be soooo delicious 1 
this review is long overdue since i consider a tale of two sisters to be the single greatest film ever made 1 
the cast was great 1 
sweetest phone 1 
wow very spicy but delicious 1 
i had the mac salad and it was pretty bland so i will not be getting that again 0 
terrible management 0 
i will not be eating there again 0 
this place is disgusting 0 
though the wind and the lion is told largely through the eyes of the son every member of the family can identify with one of the characters whether it be sean connerys noble brigand candace bergens feisty heroine john hustons wily john hay or steve kanalys spiffy radiant ruthless cando lieutenant roosevelts big stick 1 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
kieslowski never ceases to amaze me 1 
comfortable fit you need your headset to be comfortable for at least an hour at a time if not for an entire day 1 
i understand that its supposed to be a cheap popcorn comedy but that doesnt mean that it has to completely insult our intelligence and have writing so incredibly hackneyed that it borders on offensive 0 
the buttons for on and off are bad 0 
unfortunately inexperience of direction meant that scene after scene passed with little in the way of dramatic tension or conflict 0 
the reception is excellent 1 
the acting is terrible and the writing is worse 0 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
i received it quickly and it works great 1 
10 out of 10 stars 1 
crash is a depressing little nothing that provokes emotion but teaches you nothing if you already know racism and prejudice are bad things 0 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
the sides are delish mixed mushrooms yukon gold puree white corn beateous 1 
mediocre food 0 
the food is good 1 
eclectic selection 1 
i dont know what the big deal is about this place but i wont be back yaall 0 
i recently tried caballeros and i have been back every week since 1 
best breakfast buffet 1 
weve have gotten a much better service from the pizza place next door than the services we received from this restaurant 0 
the instruction manual is lacking 0 
over rated 0 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
so i bought about 10 of these and saved alot of money 1 
any grandmother can make a roasted chicken better than this one 0 
it is an excellent drama an excellent thriller and an excellent film 1 
i bought this battery with a coupon from amazon and im very happy with my purchase 1 
the writer gorman bechard undoubtedly did his homework because all references are industry and characterage appropriate 1 
i had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get some relief 0 
pretty good beer selection too 1 
lets start with all the problemsÂ—the acting especially from the lead professor was very very bad 0 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
i really liked that 1 
best headset ever 1 
he really didnt seem to want to be hosting his voiceovers were monotonous didnt get involved with the guests 0 
the staff are also very friendly and efficient 1 
i exchanged the sony ericson z500a for this and im pretty happy with that decision 1 
not as good as i had hoped 0 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
kieslowski never ceases to amaze me 1 
when my mom and i got home she immediately got sick and she only had a few bites of salad 0 
all in all ha long bay was a bit of a flop 0 
everything about it is just bad 0 
much less than the jawbone i was going to replace it with 1 
the cow tongue and cheek tacos are amazing 1 
how awesome is that 1 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
i hate those things as much as cheap quality black olives 0 
lightweight and works well 1 
mark my words this is one of those cult films like evil dead 2 or phantasm that people will still be discovering and falling in love with 20 30 40 years down the line 1 
even worse than ticker 0 
interesting decor 1 
it features an outlandish array of memorable psychotic but lovable nuts 1 
the fries were not hot and neither was my burger 0 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
it was a drive to get there 0 
he cant act one of the least scary villains i have ever seen he cant write did he write this damn movie in his sleep 0 
they do not last forever but is not overly expensive to replaceeasy to operate and the sound is much better than others i have tried 1 
the phone crashed completely and now i have to get it replaced 0 
the poor actors 0 
although i very much liked the look and sound of this place the actual experience was a bit disappointing 0 
battery life is also great 1 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
this is hands down the best phone ive ever had 1 
but whatever it was that cost them so much it didnt translate to quality thats for sure 0 
the story unfolds in 18th century jutland and the use of period music played on period instruments is just one more fine touch 1 
my rating just 3 out of 10 0 
there are the usual hitchcock logic flaws 0 
on a positive note our server was very attentive and provided great service 1 
awful service 0 
i have always used corded headsets and the freedom from the wireless is very helpful 1 
the acting is terrible and the writing is worse 0 
i was particularly pleased with the acting ability of dwight schultz 1 
there is a totally unnecessary trainroller coaster scene 0 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
i paid too much 0 
definitely a bargain 1 
the meat was pretty dry i had the sliced brisket and pulled pork 0 
greatno problems at all 1 
i have been very happy with the 510 and have had no complaints from any one regarding my sound quality on their end 1 
id rather eat airline food seriously 0 
waiter was a jerk 0 
the soundtrack sucked 0 
the first thing that happened was that the tracking was off 0 
their chow mein is so good 1 
some applause should be given to the prelude however 1 
when a song could explain the emotions of the subjects better such as when jay adams unfortunate life was a subject of talk the song old man by neil young was played which evokes many emotions 1 
con spotty service 0 
comes with a strong light that you can use to light up your camera shots and even flash sos signals seriously 1 
the success of the film depends on the casting of sydney greenstreet as the alexander yardley character 1 
ive only had my bluetooth for a few weeks but i really like it 1 
attempting artiness with black white and clever camera angles the movie disappointed became even more ridiculous as the acting was poor and the plot and lines almost nonexistent 0 
this is a great deal 1 
awful 0 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
the point is the journey a journey that touches every member of the family 1 
the results well are a shame 0 
it failed to convey the broad sweep of landscapes that were a great part of the original 0 
helen baxendale is a very credible lady macbeth who can be very cheerfull at times and sometimes she just looks like a naughty girl but deadly in her taste for blood and evil 1 
definitely worth seeing its the sort of thought provoking film that forces you to question your own threshold of loneliness 1 
i own a jabra earset and was very happy with it but the sound quality especially outgoing on this is better 1 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
the selection of food was not the best 0 
the acting helps the writing along very well maybe the idiotsavant sister could have been played better and it is a real joy to watch 1 
victor mclaglen was even bad and brian donlevy was almost unrecognizable 0 
i advise you to look out for it 1 
the owners are super friendly and the staff is courteous 1 
the food was excellent and service was very good 1 
excellent phone 1 
the plot such as it is is so derivative and predictable that the ending is like a mercy killing 0 
i would recommend saving room for this 1 
saggy floppy piece of junk 0 
i did not expect this to be so good 1 
i can think of no other film where something vitally important occurs every other minute 1 
sam shepards portrayal of a gung ho marine was sobering 1 
thank you for such great service 1 
the movie is not completely perfect but titta di girolamo will stay with you for a long time after the vision of the movie 1 
artless camerawork endlessly presents us with the ugliest setting imaginable ie 0 
service sucks 0 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
phone is sturdy as all nokia bar phones are 1 
in addition it feels amp looks as if the phone is all lightweight cheap plastic 0 
what did bother me was the slow service 0 
everything was good and tasty 1 
i sat riveted to the tv screen 1 
frozen pucks of disgust with some of the worst people behind the register 0 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
i am going to have to be the first to negatively review this product 0 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
i especially liked the noncliche choices with the parents in other movies i could predict the dialog verbatim but the writing in this movie made better selections 1 
no real improvement 0 
works great 1 
he is an amazing film artist one of the most important whoever lived 1 
it showed exactly how the government and the scientist argued for humanity and the reasons of the gadget 1 
not worth it 0 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
the things that the four kids get themselves into is absolutely hilarious to watch 1 
the cast is good 1 
gets the job done 1 
easily none other cartoon made me laugh in a tender way before getting into dark sitcoms oriented for teenagers 1 
the movie has almost no action scenes in it and very little comedy 0 
the servers went back and forth several times not even so much as an are you being helped 0 
im glad the film didnt go for the most obvious choice as a lesser film certainly would have 1 
absolutely great 1 
bland and flavorless is a good way of describing the barely tepid meat 0 
maybe its just their vegetarian fare but ive been twice and i thought it was average at best 0 
she carries the movie well 1 
its worth driving up from tucson 1 
the only suspense i was feeling was the frustration at just how retarded the girls were 0 
no real improvement 0 
worked perfectly 1 
this gets a 1 out of 10 simply because theres nothing lower 0 
when my order arrived one of the gyros was missing 0 
they keep getting better and better this is my third one and ive had numerous palms too 1 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
ordered burger rare came in well done 0 
later i found myself lost in the power of the film 1 
that company is a joke 0 
in fact its hard to remember that the part of ray charles is being acted and not played by the man himself 1 
no actress has been worse used that june allison in this movie 0 
wow loved this place 1 
i guess i liked the details of his dysfunctionhe was believable 1 
the chicken i got was definitely reheated and was only ok the wedges were cold and soggy 0 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
the acting is fantastic the stories are seamlessly woven together and the dogs are splendid a must rent view or see 1 
lasted one day and then blew up 0 
i got to enjoy the seafood salad with a fabulous vinegrette 1 
i ate there twice on my last visit and especially enjoyed the salmon salad 1 
if you love authentic mexican food and want a whole bunch of interesting yet delicious meats to choose from you need to try this place 1 
see both films if you can 1 
a truly truly bad film 0 
we are so glad we found this place 1 
you cant beat that 1 
works well 1 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
we wont be going back 0 
this is an unbelievable bargain 1 
brilliant 1 
but even the talented carrell cant save this 0 
then our food came out disappointment ensued 0 
this is an outstanding little restaurant with some of the best food i have ever tasted 1 
i exchanged the sony ericson z500a for this and im pretty happy with that decision 1 
this is one of the best movies out there that shows such strong sibling bond for each other 1 
battery chargelife is quite long 1 
it is a true classic 1 
again lame 0 
reaching for the bottom row is uncomfortable and the send and end keys are not where i expect them to be3 0 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
the only thing worse than taylors acting was stanwycks singing 0 
very disappointed and wondered how it could be in the oscar shortlist 0 
this is an unbelievable bargain 1 
it sure does beat the nachos at the movies but i would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant 0 
works for me 1 
i dont have to be an accountant to know im getting screwed 0 
keep up the good work amazon 1 
very good lunch spot 1 
exactly what i wanted 1 
i have to use the smallest earpieces provided but it stays on pretty well 1 
and it was way to expensive 0 
the ambiance isnt much better 0 
the food is rich so order accordingly 1 
i asked multiple times for the wine list and after some time of being ignored i went to the hostess and got one myself 0 
it is a joy to use 1 
the speaker is of low quality so as making the ring tones sound very cheap 0 
star trek v the final frontier is the worst in the series 0 
some applause should be given to the prelude however 1 
the range is very decent ive been able to roam around my house with the phone in the living room with no receptionsound quality issues 1 
lightweight and works well 1 
there is so much good food in vegas that i feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to rice and company 0 
the interplay between martin and emilio contains the same wonderful chemistry we saw in wall street with martin and charlie 1 
dont miss it 1 
same problem as others have mentioned 0 
i purcashed this for the car charger and it does not work 0 
try them in the airport to experience some tasty food and speedy friendly service 1 
then i had to continue pairing it periodically since it somehow kept dropping 0 
simple lightweight and great fit 1 
that said our mouths and bellies were still quite pleased 1 
i really enjoyed eating here 1 
its a sad movie but very good 1 
personally i think it shows that people should learn to find a compromise them self without involving other people into issue 1 
i never walked out of a movie faster 0 
from what my dinner companions told meeverything was very fresh with nice texture and taste 1 
the scenery that the two daughters paint and photograph are beautiful 1 
its also great to see that renowned silent screenwriter frances marion hasnt missed a step going from silent to sound 1 
all this movie does is make you sick watching all these slackers make excuses for their stupid actions for 90 minutes 0 
price is good too 1 
this movie has a cutting edge to it 1 
same evening him and i are both drastically sick 0 
it looks very nice 1 
lately they have been extremely nice and helpful on the phone 1 
all in all ha long bay was a bit of a flop 0 
everything stinks 0 
the whole experience was underwhelming and i think well just go to ninja sushi next time 0 
this is an extraordinary film 1 
the film deserves strong kudos for taking this stand for having exceptional acting from its mostly lesserknown cast and for the superintelligent script that doesnt insult the audience or take the easy way out when it comes to white racism 1 
mishima is extremely uninteresting 0 
the volume for the ringer is real good you have choices how loud 1 
first the bathrooms at this location were dirty seat covers were not replenished just plain yucky 0 
your brain will attempt to shutdown as part of a primal impulse of selfpreservation 0 
go to place for gyros 1 
best service and food ever maria our server was so good and friendly she made our day 1 
you get what you pay for i guess 0 
this is actually a very smart movie 1 
the pizza selections are good 1 
this particular model would not work with my motorola q smartphone 0 
food was good service was good prices were good 1 
if you havent choked in your own vomit by the end by all the cheap drama and worthless dialogue youve must have bored yourself to death with this waste of time 0 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
talk about useless customer service 0 
this place is awesome if you want something light and healthy during the summer 1 
on a positive note our server was very attentive and provided great service 1 
see it 1 
2 thumbs up to this seller 1 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
unfortunately cover girl is an example of how hollywood used to exploit women for financial gain 0 
the range is very decent ive been able to roam around my house with the phone in the living room with no receptionsound quality issues 1 
i wont be back 0 
so i basically threw my money out the window for nothing 0 
but what really made it unwatchable was the direction 0 
we definately enjoyed ourselves 1 
love the margaritas too 1 
the films sole bright spot was jonah hill who will look almost unrecognizable to fans of the recent superbad due to the amount of weight he lost in the interim 1 
verizons bills however are difficult to understand even though their pricing plans are simple 0 
all the bread is made inhouse 1 
it came free with a dvd player i bought but i still turned the thing off halfway through because i was embarrassed for howell 0 
i had heard good things about this place but it exceeding every hope i could have dreamed of 1 
i wasnt expecting oscar material but this 0 
very good though 1 
phone now holds charge like it did when it was new 1 
the movie is not completely perfect but titta di girolamo will stay with you for a long time after the vision of the movie 1 
the roast beef sandwich tasted really good 1 
this may be the only bad film he ever made 0 
the decor is nice and the piano music soundtrack is pleasant 1 
what should have been a hilarious yummy christmas eve dinner to remember was the biggest fail of the entire trip for us 0 
this place is good 1 
does everything it should and more 1 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
the first thing that happened was that the tracking was off 0 
in an interesting part of town this place is amazing 1 
the flair bartenders are absolutely amazing 1 
i love lane but ive never seen her in a movie this lousy 0 
as for the service i thought it was good 1 
god and i can never get that 90 minutes back 0 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
this is hands down the best phone ive ever had 1 
its so stupid to have to keep buying new chargers car chargers cradles headphones and car kits every time a new phone comes out 0 
this case seems well made 1 
delicious and i will absolutely be back 1 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
nice case feels good in your hands 1 
whatever the producer was going for he missed entirely 0 
they refuse to refund or replace 0 
they have horrible attitudes towards customers and talk down to each one when customers dont enjoy their food 0 
very friendly staff 1 
my gyro was basically lettuce only 0 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
i own 2 of these cases and would order another 1 
however paul schrader has indeed made a film about mishima that is both superb complex 1 
yet i enjoy watching it 1 
okay i like to consider myself a fair critic so ill give credit where credits duethe creature effects were actually pretty cool 1 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
i had a pretty satifying experience 1 
there arent death scenes like in previous movies and the fx are terrible 0 
the scenes with the ohsomature neighbourgirl are a misplace 0 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
rating 1 out of 10 0 
yes its shiny on front side and i love it 1 
last night was my second time dining here and i was so happy i decided to go back 1 
everything about this film is simply incredible 1 
from here on the widmark character turns unintentionally comical 0 
the food amazing 1 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
i would definitely recommend the jabra bt250v for those who are looking for comfort clarity and a great price 1 
its extremely slow and takes forever to do anything with it 0 
i had the mac salad and it was pretty bland so i will not be getting that again 0 
this place is way too overpriced for mediocre food 0 
kris kristoffersen is good in this movie and really makes a difference 1 
this was a different cut than the piece the other day but still wonderful and tender s well as well flavored 1 
easy to use 1 
graphics is far from the best part of the game 0 
this short film certainly pulls no punches 0 
dee snider just plain sucks 0 
these were so good we ordered them twice 1 
after the first charge kept going dead after 12 minutes 0 
this is an unbelievable bargain 1 
everything from acting to cinematography was solid 1 
poorly contstruct hinge 0 
a must study for anyone interested in the worst sins of industrial design 0 
pretty awesome place 1 
i used bitpim a free program you can find on the internetto transfer data to the phonethe price of the cable was excellent 1 
the plot simply rumbles on like a machine desperately depending on the addition of new scenes 0 
dont bother go to the store 0 
im not sure how long we stood there but it was long enough for me to begin to feel awkwardly out of place 0 
have been going since 2007 and every meal has been awesome 1 
i was so insulted 0 
all of the main players are mesmerising 1 
they do not last forever but is not overly expensive to replaceeasy to operate and the sound is much better than others i have tried 1 
the only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive 1 
you need at least 3 mins to get to your phone book from the time you first turn on the phonebattery life is short 0 
not much dialogue not much music the whole film was shot as elaborately and aesthetically like a sculpture 1 
the nokia ca42 usb cable did not work with my phone 0 
the acting by the whole cast could be put on a scale and balanced perfectly between overacting and underacting 0 
there were too many close ups 0 
we wont be returning 0 
the calls drop the phone comes on and off at will the screen goes black and the worst of all it stops ringing intermittently 0 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
the real killer is the volume and of course it breaking 0 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
sooooo good 1 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
works as described 1 
ive had this bluetoooth headset for some time now and still not comfortable with the way it fits on the ear 0 
she carries the movie well 1 
the result is a powerhouse achievement made more timely now perhaps because of our cultures disturbing fascination with celebrity and its distorted interpretations of fame 1 
excellent sound quality 1 
how stupid is that 0 
cinematography noteworthy including fine views of barcelona and its famed gaudi towers 1 
now we were chosen to be tortured with this disgusting piece of blatant american propaganda 0 
this frog phone charm is adorable and very eye catching 1 
excellent starter wireless headset 0 
i hate those things as much as cheap quality black olives 0 
definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly will return next time im in vegas 1 
hell no will i go back 0 
ordered an appetizer and took 40 minutes and then the pizza another 10 minutes 0 
the acting was bad the dialogs were extremely shallow and insincere 0 
i am very happy 1 
this is the first phone ive had that has been so cheaply made 0 
the sergeant pepper beef sandwich with auju sauce is an excellent sandwich as well 1 
excellent hands free tool 1 
i cant see how this movie can be an inspiration to anyone to come out or overcome fear and rejection 0 
this is an extraordinary film 1 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
how stupid is that 0 
tom wilkinson broke my heart at the end and everyone elses judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike 1 
when my order arrived one of the gyros was missing 0 
it has been a winner for us 1 
go to place for gyros 1 
it always cuts out and makes a beep beep beep sound then says signal failed 0 
ive only had my bluetooth for a few weeks but i really like it 1 
poor product 0 
he also came back to check on us regularly excellent service 1 
i could not understand what kind of idiot would produce this mess in the first place not to mention several season 0 
big disappointment with calendar sync 0 
this place is not worth your time let alone vegas 0 
again lame 0 
this gets a 1 out of 10 simply because theres nothing lower 0 
gets the job done 1 
for sushi on the strip this is the place to go 1 
not much seafood and like 5 strings of pasta at the bottom 0 
if you see it you should probably just leave it on the shelf 0 
you cant beat the price on these 1 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
if there was ever an indication of a writer and a directors ability to meld two highly volatile temperaments into a seamless union of creativity then this is it 1 
this is actually a very smart movie 1 
soggy and not good 0 
all in all i can assure you ill be back 1 
there is no plot here to keep you going in the first place 0 
perfect for the ps3 1 
the scenery that the two daughters paint and photograph are beautiful 1 
oh this is such a thing of beauty this restaurant 1 
bacon is hella salty 1 
an amazing finale to possibly the best trilogy of all time 1 
i dont each much pasta but i love the homemade hand made pastas and thin pizzas here 1 
really awful 0 
the food is not tasty at all not to say its real traditional hunan style 0 
trumbull on i love lucy 1 
love this headset 1 
gets the job done 1 
its a great item 1 
my only complaint is the standard sound volume is a little low even when turned up to 5of 5 0 
this is a good battery and it got here really fast 1 
i can say that the desserts were yummy 1 
i really do recommend this place you can go wrong with this donut place 1 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
everything was gross 0 
the sides are delish mixed mushrooms yukon gold puree white corn beateous 1 
i want my money back 0 
by this time our side of the restaurant was almost empty so there was no excuse 0 
i am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this 1 
its practically perfect in all of them Â– a true masterpiece in a sea of faux masterpieces 1 
as for the mains also uninspired 0 
i am also very happy with the price 1 
by the time the film ended i not only disliked it i despised it 0 
this movie is possibly one of the most creative works of horror ever 1 
lately they have been extremely nice and helpful on the phone 1 
cool phone 1 
i didnt realize how wonderful the short really is until the last two scenes 1 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
its a shame to see good actors like thomerson and james make a living in a mess like this 0 
the puppets look really cheesy not in a good way like in the puppet master 80s flicks 0 
the food was great as always compliments to the chef 1 
everything was good and tasty 1 
all of the tapas dishes were delicious 1 
a pretty good product 1 
its one of the most boring horror movies from the 90s mainly because it starts slow and centers in a boring atmosphere 0 
this phone is slim and light and the display is beautiful 1 
better than new 1 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
very cheap plastic creaks like an old wooden floor 0 
i dont understand how this garbage got on the shelves of the movie store its not even a real movie 0 
the biggest complaint i have is the battery drains superfast 0 
cant say enough good things about this place 1 
come hungry leave happy and stuffed 1 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
nice case feels good in your hands 1 
this is hands down the best phone ive ever had 1 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
after arguing with verizon regarding the dropped calls we returned the phones after two days 0 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
ill be looking for a new earpiece 0 
the opening sequence of this gem is a classic and the cat n mouse games that follow are a delight to watch 1 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
horrible phone 0 
does not work for listening to music with the cingular 8125 0 
but now that it is out of warranty the same problems reoccurebottom line put your money somewhere else cingular will not support it 0 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
great food 1 
i paid too much 0 
both do good jobs and are quite amusing 1 
the biggest complaint i have is the battery drains superfast 0 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
the staff is great the food is delish and they have an incredible beer selection 1 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
unfortunately this is a bad movie that is just plain bad 0 
but this movie is definitely a below average rent 0 
we also ordered the spinach and avocado salad the ingredients were sad and the dressing literally had zero taste 0 
it deserves strong love 1 
hence the whole story lacks a certain energy 0 
then our food came out disappointment ensued 0 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
the plug did not work very well 0 
portable and it works 1 
the phone was unusable and was not new 0 
the script is horrendously stupid 0 
again lame 0 
the plot has more holes than a pair of fishnet stockings and the direction and editing is astonishingly ham fisted 0 
what should have been a hilarious yummy christmas eve dinner to remember was the biggest fail of the entire trip for us 0 
bela lugosi was totally extraneous intoning odd lines 0 
i had strawberry tea which was good 1 
he is one of my favourite directors and one of the most talented directors in the history of cinema 1 
its welldesigned and very sharp the blue is a very nice color 1 
the foreigner is not worth one second of your time 0 
the instructions didnt explain that a microphone jack could be used 0 
i really like this product over the motorola because it is allot clearer on the ear piece and the mic 1 
the pleather case doesnt fit 0 
the meat was pretty dry i had the sliced brisket and pulled pork 0 
also makes it easier to hold on to 1 
so badwellits just bad 0 
it was quite comfortable in the ear 1 
i just dont know how this place managed to served the blandest food i have ever eaten when they are preparing indian cuisine 0 
service sucks 0 
i dont think there are any redeeming qualities in this remake 0 
otherwise easy to install and use clear sound 1 
my friend did not like his bloody mary 0 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
imdb ratings only go as low 1 for awful its time to get some negative numbers in there for cases such as these 0 
definitely a bargain 1 
i kept looking at the time and it had soon become 35 minutes yet still no food 0 
this movie is possibly one of the most creative works of horror ever 1 
hence the whole story lacks a certain energy 0 
the seller is very understanding and patient i would definitely buy from them again 1 
very slow at seating even with reservation 0 
the film has great actors a master director a significant themeat least a wouldbe significant theme undertone of fifties existential worldweariness aerial scenes that ought to have thrilled both senses and imagination and characters about which one might deeply care 1 
it plays louder than any other speaker of this size the price is so low that most would think the quality is lacking however its not 1 
bland and flavorless is a good way of describing the barely tepid meat 0 
i connected my wifes bluetoothmotorola hs850 to my phone and it worked like a charm whether the phone was in my pocket or the case 1 
one of the best mexican movies ever and one of the less understood even by mexican themselves no matter how identified the should have felt with it 1 
food was great and so was the serivce 1 
awesome service and food 1 
add betty white and jean smart and you have a great cast everyone played their parts really well 1 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
it defeats the purpose of a bluetooth headset 0 
it was too predictable even for a chick flick 0 
overall i wasnt very impressed with noca 0 
dont bother go to the store 0 
i love the camera its really pretty good quality 1 
it just blew 0 
later i found myself lost in the power of the film 1 
it holds a charge for a long time is reasonably comfortable under longwearing conditions and the quality of sound is tremendous 1 
it is a true classic 1 
the acting is fantastic the stories are seamlessly woven together and the dogs are splendid a must rent view or see 1 
if the food isnt bad enough for you then enjoy dealing with the worlds worstannoying drunk people 0 
the servers are not pleasant to deal with and they dont always honor pizza hut coupons 0 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
kris kristoffersen is good in this movie and really makes a difference 1 
i was mortified 0 
i like armand assante my cable companys summary sounded interesting so i watched it twice already and probably will again 1 
soyo technology sucks 0 
all the bread is made inhouse 1 
perabo has a nice energy level and is obviously very comfortable in front of a camera 1 
really ugly 0 
50 down the drain 0 
conclusion i loved it 1 
this is definitely one of the better documentaries i have seen looking at family relationships and marriage 1 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
i love the look and feel of samsung flipphones 1 
the crÃªpe was delicate and thin and moist 1 
a fly was in my apple juice a fly 0 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
this is one of peter watkins most accessible films 1 
the igo chargers and tips are really great 1 
crostini that came with the salad was stale 0 
this is high adventure at its best 1 
no plot whatsoever 0 
very tough and very short on flavor 0 
point your finger at any item on the menu order it and you wont be disappointed 1 
this phone is pretty sturdy and ive never had any large problems with it 1 
i wont be back 0 
horrible 0 
i started this review with two stars but im editing it to give it only one 0 
great food 1 
we ordered the duck rare and it was pink and tender on the inside with a nice char on the outside 1 
my boyfriend and i came here for the first time on a recent trip to vegas and could not have been more pleased with the quality of food and service 1 
light weight i hardly notice it is there 1 
this mostly routine factbased tv drama gets a boost from the fine performance by cole 1 
i seriously cannot believe that the owner has so many unexperienced employees that all are running around like chickens with their heads cut off 0 
any ring toneoverall good phone to buy 1 
i felt as though her going to ireland did absolutely nothing whatsoever 0 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
i was able to do voice dialing in the car with no problem 1 
fits comfortably came with three sizes of earbud tips 1 
crisp and clear 1 
unfortunately it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees 0 
i love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it 1 
at any rate this film stinks its not funny and fulci should have stayed with giallo and supernatural zombie movies 0 
it was just too horrible 0 
blue ant is easy to use 1 
the goat taco didnt skimp on the meat and wow what flavor 1 
host staff were for lack of a better word bitches 0 
this film tries to be a serious and sophisticated thrillerhorror flick and it fails miserably 0 
i would recommend it 1 
i love all the features and form factor 1 
damn good steak 1 
steamboat willie is an amazingly important film to our cinema history 1 
would recommend this item 1 
before i go in to why i gave a 1 star rating please know that this was my third time eating at bachi burger before writing a review 0 
the chicken dishes are ok the beef is like shoe leather 0 
it has everything i need and i couldnt ask for more 1 
i left the theater with a lilt in my step joy in my heart and hope for the human race 1 
but the premise of the film was so ridiculous that the president of the us 0 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
dont buy this product 0 
these are the central themes of the film and they are handled ineptly stereotypically and with no depth of imagination 0 
waited 2 hours never got either of our pizzas as many other around us who came in later did 0 
each day of the week they have a different deal and its all so delicious 1 
comes with a strong light that you can use to light up your camera shots and even flash sos signals seriously 1 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
the descriptions said yum yum sauce and another said eel sauce yet another said spicy mayowell none of the rolls had sauces on them 0 
if you check the directors filmography on this site you will see why this film didnt have a chance 0 
returned 8 hours later 0 
last time buying from you 0 
the movie in movie situations in the beginning and through the game that is played with her by the acting coach are fascinating 1 
it was a huge awkward 15lb piece of cow that was 34ths gristle and fat 0 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
artless camerawork endlessly presents us with the ugliest setting imaginable ie 0 
food was good service was good prices were good 1 
and sometimes it was so embarrassing that i had to look away 0 
excellent hands free tool 1 
the movie was very interesting from beginning to the end 1 
not sure who was more lost the flat characters or the audience nearly half of whom walked out 0 
the music in the film is really nice too 1 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
i love this place 1 
trouble is the writing and directing make it impossible to establish those things that make a movie watchable like character story theme and so on 0 
i ended up sliding it on the edge of my pants or back pockets instead 1 
but kevin spacey is an excellent verbal tsunami as buddy ackerman Â– and totally believable because he is a great actor 1 
only had this a month but its worked flawlessly so far 1 
a good film by a great director 1 
incredible 1 
it was quite comfortable in the ear 1 
returned 8 hours later 0 
i own a jabra earset and was very happy with it but the sound quality especially outgoing on this is better 1 
i had heard good things about this place but it exceeding every hope i could have dreamed of 1 
i really like this product over the motorola because it is allot clearer on the ear piece and the mic 1 
one of the best mexican movies ever and one of the less understood even by mexican themselves no matter how identified the should have felt with it 1 
thank you for such great service 1 
the transfers are very good 1 
the jabra eargels fit my ears very well 1 
this is one of the worst sandra bullock movie since speed 2 but not quite that bad 0 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
lifetime does not air it enough so if anyone knows what store sells it let me know because this is a musthave 1 
the potato chip order was sad i could probably count how many chips were in that box and it was probably around 12 0 
it is super charged up for use as a small hybrid palmtopcameracellphone and excels in those roles 1 
i use this product in a motor control center where there is a lot of high voltage humming from the equipment and it works great 1 
mic doesnt work 0 
for sushi on the strip this is the place to go 1 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
so for our enjoyment we get to see them run around play games and be dangerous 1 
this isnt a small family restaurant this is a fine dining establishment 1 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
hence the whole story lacks a certain energy 0 
the flair bartenders are absolutely amazing 1 
and the red curry had so much bamboo shoots and wasnt very tasty to me 0 
all the characters in this film are tremendously well played 1 
too politically correct 0 
not sure who was more lost the flat characters or the audience nearly half of whom walked out 0 
worst customer service ever 0 
i wont say any more i dont like spoilers so i dont want to be one but i believe this film is worth your time 1 
that was nice 1 
horrible phone 0 
i hope this place sticks around 1 
i particularly remember my senses being assaulted by strident cords of music that would blare out with very little warning and even less meaning 0 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
the descriptions said yum yum sauce and another said eel sauce yet another said spicy mayowell none of the rolls had sauces on them 0 
truly awful 0 
110 and only because there is no setting for 010 0 
in other words the content level of this film is enough to easily fill a dozen other films 1 
the characters were all funny and had the peculiarity of not having a true lead character 1 
i did not bother contacting the company for few dollar product but i learned the lesson that i should not have bought this form online anyway 0 
just dont know why they were so slow 0 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
returned 8 hours later 0 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
this movie is also revealing 1 
recommend with confidence 1 
they have been around for years and carries the highest quality of antiglare screen protector that i have found to date 1 
the food was terrible 0 
im really disappointed all i have now is a charger that doesnt work 0 
same problem as others have mentioned 0 
its reception is very very poor 0 
the jalapeno bacon is soooo good 1 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
a bit predictable 0 
aailiyah was pretty good as akasha in places compelling her first entrance and mini dance scene 1 
it is a true classic 1 
terrible management 0 
initially the local sites in the film which was filmed here in buffalo intrigued me 1 
you truly take this journey through the eyes and soul of a child 1 
duris has a wholesome appearance and gives a fine performance 1 
the eargels channel the sound directly into your ear and seem to increase the sound volume and clarity 1 
think it over when you plan to own this onethis sure is the last moto phone for me 0 
being a 90s child i truly enjoyed this show and i can proudly say that i enjoyed it big time and even more than the classical wb cartoons 1 
phone now holds charge like it did when it was new 1 
no shifting no bubbling no peeling not even a scratch nothingi couldnt be more happier with my new one for the droid 1 
i checked out this place a couple years ago and was not impressed 0 
an awesome new look for fall 2000 1 
i found the product to be easy to set up and use 1 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
the malta settings are as dry and as barren as the dialogue 0 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
regrettably the film fails 0 
good show samsung 1 
great product fast shipping 1 
furthermore you cant even find hours of operation on the website 0 
very cheap plastic creaks like an old wooden floor 0 
its not hard to make a decent hamburger 0 
but kevin spacey is an excellent verbal tsunami as buddy ackerman Â– and totally believable because he is a great actor 1 
the shipping time was also very quick 1 
definitely worth checking out 1 
however the keypads are so tinny that i sometimes reach the wrong buttons 0 
an amazing finale to possibly the best trilogy of all time 1 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
otherwise easy to install and use clear sound 1 
poor construction 0 
the staff is great the food is delish and they have an incredible beer selection 1 
the only consistent thread holding the series together were the amazing performances of leni parker and anita laselva as the two taelons in quiet idealogical conflict 0 
the cow tongue and cheek tacos are amazing 1 
i love this place 1 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
made very sturdy 1 
artless camerawork endlessly presents us with the ugliest setting imaginable ie 0 
if you hate earbugs avoid this phone by all means 0 
we have tried 2 units and they both failed within 2 months pros 0 
the jerky camera movements were also annoying 0 
the transfers are very good 1 
i love this place 1 
his use of the colours of the french flag in the three films was nothing short of incredible every shot every scene was like a work of art 1 
ive had better not only from dedicated boba tea spots but even from jenni pho 0 
none of them are engaging or exciting 0 
the staff are great the ambiance is great 1 
this place is overpriced not consistent with their boba and it really is overpriced 0 
as many people complained i found this headsets microphone was very weak 0 
brilliant 1 
it even has its sweet moments 1 
it isnt even an achievement as a sobaditsgood or sobaditsmemorable movie 0 
the plot has more holes than a pair of fishnet stockings and the direction and editing is astonishingly ham fisted 0 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
reaching for the bottom row is uncomfortable and the send and end keys are not where i expect them to be3 0 
unfortunately cover girl is an example of how hollywood used to exploit women for financial gain 0 
so good i am going to have to review this place twice once hereas a tribute to the place and once as a tribute to an event held here last night 1 
the films sole bright spot was jonah hill who will look almost unrecognizable to fans of the recent superbad due to the amount of weight he lost in the interim 1 
the acting was bad the dialogs were extremely shallow and insincere 0 
dont waste your on this one 0 
a greasy unhealthy meal 0 
fast service 1 
for the price this was a great deal 1 
although i very much liked the look and sound of this place the actual experience was a bit disappointing 0 
every time he opened his mouth you expect to hear you see kids pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show 0 
the desserts were a bit strange 0 
i love the ringtones because they are so upbeat 1 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
that movie was bad 0 
i find this inexcusable and so will probably be returning this phone and perhaps changing carriers 0 
conclusion very filling meals 1 
i did not have any problem with this item and would order it again if needed 1 
lame would be the best way to describe it 0 
they know how to make them here 1 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
dee snider just plain sucks 0 
bad fit way too big 0 
the food amazing 1 
plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job 1 
this mostly routine factbased tv drama gets a boost from the fine performance by cole 1 
about 30 minutes of footage is wasted to show mediocre elderly actors awkwardly babbling overwrought pseudosatanic gibberish corny enough to make a teen goth blush almost always in olde english and sometimes in latin that may or may not be made up words 0 
the ripped banana was not only ripped but petrified and tasteless 0 
the building itself seems pretty neat the bathroom is pretty trippy but i wouldnt eat here again 0 
for 40 bucks a head i really expect better food 0 
down the drain because of a weak snap 0 
i have tried these cables with my computer and my ipod and it works just fine 1 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
audio quality is poor very poor 0 
the story starts too fast with absolutely no suspense or buildup in the slightest 0 
special mention should be made of the superb music score and sound effects which are an integral element in helping to make this such a memorable and enjoyable cartoon 1 
this wonderful experience made this place a muststop whenever we are in town again 1 
we have tried 2 units and they both failed within 2 months pros 0 
the service was terrible food was mediocre 0 
works for me 1 
the acting is terrible and the writing is worse 0 
this movie suffered because of the writing it needed more suspense 0 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
generally it just lacked imagination 0 
fantastic earphones 1 
a very very very slowmoving aimless movie about a distressed drifting young man 0 
it is cheap and it feel and look just as cheap 0 
plantronics bluetooth excelent buy 1 
this place is awesome if you want something light and healthy during the summer 1 
great product and price 1 
eclectic selection 1 
it was a great phone 1 
1 long lasting battery you dont have to recharge it as frequentyly as some of the flip phones2 0 
i left the theater with a lilt in my step joy in my heart and hope for the human race 1 
very disappointing 0 
disappointment i hate anything that goes in my ear 0 
very pleased with this headset 1 
the food was very good 1 
i use this product in a motor control center where there is a lot of high voltage humming from the equipment and it works great 1 
i only hear garbage for audio 0 
they do not last forever but is not overly expensive to replaceeasy to operate and the sound is much better than others i have tried 1 
i got the aluminum case for my new palm vx and it worked really wellit has protected my handheld perfectly so far 1 
phone falls out easily 0 
great food and awesome service 1 
i highly recommend this modest priced cellular phone 1 
i guess i should have known that this place would suck because it is inside of the excalibur but i didnt use my common sense 0 
not only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic but it also managed to give away the entire movie and im not exaggerating every moment every plot point every joke is told in the trailer 0 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
overall i rate this movie a 10 out of a 110 scale 1 
i am very impressed with the job that motorola did on the sturdiness of this phone 1 
then as if i hadnt wasted enough of my life there they poured salt in the wound by drawing out the time it took to bring the check 0 
anne heche was utterly convincing 1 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
dont bother go to the store 0 
if she had not rolled the eyes we may have stayed not sure if we will go back and try it again 0 
its a great tool for entertainment communication and data managementoh be sure to use activesync 42 for optimal data synchronization results 1 
unfortunately this is a bad movie that is just plain bad 0 
my ribeye steak was cooked perfectly and had great mesquite flavor 1 
i wouldnt see this movie again for free 0 
all in all i think it was a good investment 1 
i recently tried caballeros and i have been back every week since 1 
i used bitpim a free program you can find on the internetto transfer data to the phonethe price of the cable was excellent 1 
how awesome is that 1 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
when achille and philippa beautifully sing a duet from don giovanni that perfectly describes their situation in the movie you appreciate the subtle layers of this excellent film 1 
after a year the battery went completely dead on my headset 0 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
this movie is bad 0 
the service was great even the manager came and helped with our table 1 
for that price i can think of a few place i would have much rather gone 0 
penne vodka excellent 1 
the acting was decidely wooden though no worse than a period universal b movie 0 
the nano stated itmy son was dissapointed 0 
i got home to see the driest damn wings ever 0 
very bad performance plays angela bennett a computer expert who is at home all the time 0 
it was a long time that i didnt see a so charismatic actor on screen 1 
down the drain because of a weak snap 0 
i love this bluetooth 1 
i do not know if this was emilio estevezs directorial debut but the pacing the interplay and development of the characters as well as some clever camera work surrounding the character estevez plays all suggest a natural eye 1 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
any grandmother can make a roasted chicken better than this one 0 
my sanyo has survived dozens of drops on blacktop without ill effect 1 
i dont think you will be disappointed 1 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
it lasts less than 3o minutes if i actually try to use the phonemy wife has the same phone with the same problem 0 
well packaged arrived on time and works as intended 1 
ive also had problems with the phone reading the memory card in which i always turn it on and then off again 0 
it probably would have been better if the director hadnt spent most of the movie showcasing his own art work which really isnt that noteworthy 0 
very good though 1 
do not waste your money here 0 
the only thing i did like was the prime rib and dessert section 1 
wow very spicy but delicious 1 
a fantastic neighborhood gem 1 
much better than the other ayce sushi place i went to in vegas 1 
10 out of 10 stars 1 
i was shocked because no signs indicate cash only 0 
i also decided not to send it back because our waitress looked like she was on the verge of having a heart attack 0 
pricing is a bit of a concern at mellow mushroom 0 
i like the fact that it rests lightly against your ear rather than inside 1 
the film is well paced understated and one of the best courtroom documentaries ive seen 1 
judith light is one of my favorite actresses and i think she does a superb job in this film 1 
these were so good we ordered them twice 1 
its very slow 0 
the servers are not pleasant to deal with and they dont always honor pizza hut coupons 0 
also notable is john baileys fine crisp beautifully colored cinematography and the great production design costumes by eiko ishioka who went on to do the memorable costumes for coppolas dracula for which she received a well deserved oscar 1 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
this is definitely a cult classic well worth viewing and sharing with others 1 
some applause should be given to the prelude however 1 
come hungry leave happy and stuffed 1 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
oh the charger seems to work fine 1 
tried to go here for lunch and it was a madhouse 0 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
the screen size is big key pad lit well enough and the camera quality is excellent for a camera phone 1 
i am so tired of clichÃ©s that is just lazy writing and here they come in thick and fast 0 
their chow mein is so good 1 
in fact this stinker smells like a directtovideo release 0 
very nice and relaxing late night viewing 1 
def coming back to bowl next time 1 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
highly unprofessional and rude to a loyal patron 0 
the food is good 1 
the films sole bright spot was jonah hill who will look almost unrecognizable to fans of the recent superbad due to the amount of weight he lost in the interim 1 
this place is not worth your time let alone vegas 0 
if you do go see this movie bring a pillow or a girlfriendboyfriend to keep you occupied through out 0 
conclusion very filling meals 1 
its really easy 1 
they do not last forever but is not overly expensive to replaceeasy to operate and the sound is much better than others i have tried 1 
then as if i hadnt wasted enough of my life there they poured salt in the wound by drawing out the time it took to bring the check 0 
this is a very average phone with bad battery life that operates on a weak network 0 
must have been an off night at this place 0 
its kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly its embarrassing how childlike the company is 0 
the staff is always super friendly and helpful which is especially cool when you bring two small boys and a baby 1 
this device is great in several situations1 1 
you learn a lot about the real inside emotions of people in this movie and a lot about the movie business itself 1 
this is so embarassing and also my ears hurt if i try to push the ear plug into my ear 0 
the food is rich so order accordingly 1 
the cast is good 1 
i vomited in the bathroom mid lunch 0 
up there with the best of melville 1 
treo and tmobile refused to replace it again and forced me to buy another phone without any kind of upgrade discount 0 
i love this thing 1 
friends pasta also bad he barely touched it 0 
they could be used as exemplars for any set designer 1 
1 long lasting battery you dont have to recharge it as frequentyly as some of the flip phones2 0 
back to good bbq lighter fare reasonable pricing and tell the public they are back to the old ways 1 
plantronics bluetooth excelent buy 1 
good works fine 1 
on three different occasions i asked for well done or medium well and all three times i got the bloodiest piece of meat on my plate 0 
the visual effects were awful 0 
its welldesigned and very sharp the blue is a very nice color 1 
definitely a turn off for me i doubt ill be back unless someone else is buying 0 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
keep up the good work amazon 1 
honeslty it didnt taste that fresh 0 
the only good thing was that it fits comfortably on small ears 1 
this one works and was priced right 1 
it features an outlandish array of memorable psychotic but lovable nuts 1 
this phone tries very hard to do everything but fails at its very ability to be a phone 0 
horrible had to switch 3 times 0 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
what did bother me was the slow service 0 
the scenes are often funny and occasionally touching as the characters evaluate their lives and where they are going 1 
no complaints 1 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
reversible plug works great 1 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
they have a really nice atmosphere 1 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
the range is very decent ive been able to roam around my house with the phone in the living room with no receptionsound quality issues 1 
he deserves 5 stars 1 
its reception is very very poor 0 
con spotty service 0 
great character actors telly savalas and peter boyle 1 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
but this movie really got to me 1 
the cast is always entertaining as usual 1 
if you see it you should probably just leave it on the shelf 0 
the cable looks so thin and flimsy it is scary 0 
i really like this product over the motorola because it is allot clearer on the ear piece and the mic 1 
i love this cable it allows me to connect any miniusb device to my pc 1 
not impressed 0 
dont buy it 0 
best of luck to the rude and noncustomer service focused new management 0 
i got to enjoy the seafood salad with a fabulous vinegrette 1 
im in az all the time and now have my new spot 1 
the restaurant atmosphere was exquisite 1 
these are the central themes of the film and they are handled ineptly stereotypically and with no depth of imagination 0 
service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is vegas and located inside the crystals shopping mall by aria 1 
the service was poor and thats being nice 0 
battery is terrible 0 
the worst one of the series 0 
the plot was the same as pretty much every other cheap horror 0 
in fact im going to round up to 4 stars just because she was so awesome 1 
they were goldencrispy and delicious 1 
it really created a unique feeling though 1 
i gave it a 10 1 
went for lunch service was slow 0 
great food 1 
to those who find this movie intelligent or even masterful i can only say its your intelligence and your imagination you obviously used to try and make some sense of this pitiful attempt its in our human nature to try and make sense of things 0 
join the club and get awesome offers via email 1 
the stories were powerful explorations of the nature of man and of art 1 
i am very happy 1 
in other words the content level of this film is enough to easily fill a dozen other films 1 
plantronics bluetooth excelent buy 1 
also the story and acting were weak 0 
the aerial scenes were welldone 1 
will order from them again 1 
works for me 1 
the service was terrible though 0 
today was my first taste of a buldogis gourmet hot dog and i have to tell you it was more than i ever thought possible 1 
what happened next was prettyoff putting 0 
doesnt last long 0 
you wont regret it 1 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
some applause should be given to the prelude however 1 
my sanyo has survived dozens of drops on blacktop without ill effect 1 
the movie is terribly boring in places 0 
it just blew 0 
i bought this phone as a replacement for my startac and have regretted it since 0 
i wont be back 0 
i wouldnt see this movie again for free 0 
im so happy to be here 1 
it also took her forever to bring us the check when we asked for it 0 
bought mainly for the charger which broke soon after purchasing 0 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
the burger is good beef cooked just right 1 
dont go here 0 
disappointing 0 
i guess i should have known that this place would suck because it is inside of the excalibur but i didnt use my common sense 0 
the only very disappointing thing was there was no speakerphone 0 
drinks took close to 30 minutes to come out at one point 0 
i know he was a contract player with little control over his scripts but the acting was as bad as the script 0 
good prices 1 
the death row scenes were entirely unmoving 0 
better than new 1 
victor mclaglen was even bad and brian donlevy was almost unrecognizable 0 
good quality 1 
very slow at seating even with reservation 0 
now imagine that every single one of those decisions was made wrong 0 
great food and service huge portions and they give a military discount 1 
the malta settings are as dry and as barren as the dialogue 0 
the most annoying thing about cover girl is the way in which rita hayworth is put up on a pedestal 0 
the art style has the appearance of crayonpencil drawings and is wonderfully colorful and fanciful 1 
for 40 bucks a head i really expect better food 0 
otherwise easy to install and use clear sound 1 
i even fully charged it before i went to bed and turned off blue tooth and wifi and noticed that it only had 20 left in the morning 0 
this convention never worked well in the past and certainly doesnt work here 0 
the soundtrack wasnt terrible either 1 
hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in 0 
bought mainly for the charger which broke soon after purchasing 0 
we made the drive all the way from north scottsdale and i was not one bit disappointed 1 
ive tried several different earpieces for my cell phone and this jabra one is the first one ive found that fits my ear comfortably 1 
i was very disappointed in the movie 0 
but what really made it unwatchable was the direction 0 
try them in the airport to experience some tasty food and speedy friendly service 1 
this is one of the best italian thrillers of the early 70s 1 
customer service was terrible 0 
my experience was terrible this was my fourth bluetooth headset and while it was much more comfortable than my last jabra which i hated 0 
comfortable in my hand 1 
so i bought about 10 of these and saved alot of money 1 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
the service was a little slow considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace 0 
the scenes with the ohsomature neighbourgirl are a misplace 0 
there are the usual hitchcock logic flaws 0 
warning stay away 0 
this is a masterful piece of filmmaking with many themes simmering and occasionally boiling over in this warts and all study of the poets bohemian selfindulgent wartime years that span the aerial bombardments of london and the outward tranquillity of a welsh coastal retreat the borderlines between friendship lust and love dedication to art and experience versus practical concerns jealousy rivalry cowardice and egotism versus heroism and selfsacrifice and more 1 
the ambiance isnt much better 0 
waitress was a little slow in service 0 
works fine 1 
headset works great was packaged nicely to avoid any damage 1 
i purcashed this for the car charger and it does not work 0 
cant get the software to work with my computer 0 
paolo sorrentino has written a wonderful story about loneliness and tony has built one of the most unforgettable characters seen in movies in recent years 1 
gets the job done 1 
i put the latest os on it v115g and it now likes to slow to a crawl and lock up every once in a while 0 
not only did the software do a great job of this i could also make my own ringtones form my existing cds without an internet connection 1 
the staff is always super friendly and helpful which is especially cool when you bring two small boys and a baby 1 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
i went on motorolas website and followed all directions but could not get it to pair again 0 
horrible 0 
lot of holes in the plot theres nothing about how he became the emperor nothing about where he spend 20 years between his childhood and mature age 0 
personally i think it shows that people should learn to find a compromise them self without involving other people into issue 1 
however i needed some better instructions 0 
the microphone also works well but according to people i have called it applifies everything 1 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
i have bought this nokia cell phone a few weeks ago and it was a nightmare 0 
another thing i didnt really like is when a character got punched in the face a gallon of blood would spew forth soon after 0 
the manager was the worst 0 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
all in all ha long bay was a bit of a flop 0 
using all earpieces left or right this thing will not stay on my ear 0 
appears to actually outperform the original battery from china that came with my v325i 1 
this phone might well be the worst ive ever had in any brand 0 
this film and i use that word loosely is an insult to the moviegoing public 0 
then i exchanged for the same phone even that had the same problem 0 
perhaps i caught them on an off night judging by the other reviews but im not inspired to go back 0 
obviously they have a terrible customer service so you get what you pay for 0 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
the 12 mega pixel camera being a part of a phone is reasonably good7 1 
do not buy for d807wrongly advertised for d807 0 
it had some average acting from the main person and it was a low budget as you clearly can see 0 
the service was not up to par either 0 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
they brought a fresh batch of fries and i was thinking yay something warm but no 0 
treo and tmobile refused to replace it again and forced me to buy another phone without any kind of upgrade discount 0 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
back to good bbq lighter fare reasonable pricing and tell the public they are back to the old ways 1 
just dont know why they were so slow 0 
wow loved this place 1 
ill definitely be in soon again 1 
hands down my favorite italian restaurant 1 
i had a seriously solid breakfast here 1 
the acting is terrible and the writing is worse 0 
the 12 mega pixel camera being a part of a phone is reasonably good7 1 
although i very much liked the look and sound of this place the actual experience was a bit disappointing 0 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
this is infuriating 0 
reception is terrible and full of static 0 
over rated 0 
i hate movies like that 0 
so absolutley fantastic 1 
now this is a movie i really dislike 0 
the foreigner is not worth one second of your time 0 
if you hate earbugs avoid this phone by all means 0 
at around 4 pm i bought it at around 8pm i started to watch at around 815pm i fast forwarded the remaining film to see if there was anything left watchable for a human being with a brain but there wasnt 0 
considering the relations off screen between taylor and stanwyck it was surprising how little chemistry there was on screen between the two of them 0 
these products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet 0 
the characters were all funny and had the peculiarity of not having a true lead character 1 
i cant believe theres even a sequel to this 0 
the food is rich so order accordingly 1 
there is simply no excuse for something this poorly done 0 
they keep getting better and better this is my third one and ive had numerous palms too 1 
nice case feels good in your hands 1 
great pocket pc phone combination 1 
spend your money and time some place else 0 
id rather eat airline food seriously 0 
a pretty good product 1 
it was probably dirt 0 
i am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this 1 
the fries were not hot and neither was my burger 0 
i enjoyed reading this book to my children when they were little 1 
but its just not funny 0 
i bought this battery with a coupon from amazon and im very happy with my purchase 1 
setup went very smoothly 1 
the worst sappiest dialogue i could go on and on 0 
the reception has been generally good 1 
strike 2 who wants to be rushed 0 
this is one of the best movies out there that shows such strong sibling bond for each other 1 
none of it works just dont buy it 0 
if there was ever an indication of a writer and a directors ability to meld two highly volatile temperaments into a seamless union of creativity then this is it 1 
considering the relations off screen between taylor and stanwyck it was surprising how little chemistry there was on screen between the two of them 0 
drinks took close to 30 minutes to come out at one point 0 
you can even take self portraits with the outside exterior display very cool 1 
fits comfortably came with three sizes of earbud tips 1 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
damian is so talented and versatile in so many ways of writing and portraying different characters on screen 1 
do not buy do not buyit sucks 0 
this is was due to the fact that it took 20 minutes to be acknowledged then another 35 minutes to get our foodand they kept forgetting things 0 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
good service very clean and inexpensive to boot 1 
at no point in the proceedings does it look remotely like america 0 
it worked very well 1 
the eargels channel the sound directly into your ear and seem to increase the sound volume and clarity 1 
the food was terrible 0 
they could be used as exemplars for any set designer 1 
you learn a lot about the real inside emotions of people in this movie and a lot about the movie business itself 1 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
the cast of veteran actors are more than just a nostalgia trip 1 
incredible 1 
really ugly 0 
it is zillion times away from reality 0 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
one thing i hate is the mode set button at the side 0 
it worked very well 1 
perfect for someone me who only likes beer ice cold or in this case even colder 1 
avoid avoid avoid 0 
great character actors telly savalas and peter boyle 1 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
their regular toasted bread was equally satisfying with the occasional pats of butter mmmm 1 
it kept getting worse and worse so now im officially done 0 
the sides are delish mixed mushrooms yukon gold puree white corn beateous 1 
this is a great phone 1 
all this movie does is make you sick watching all these slackers make excuses for their stupid actions for 90 minutes 0 
lucy bell is so much higher than this crap and for her to sink this low is quite depressing 0 
the dining space is tiny but elegantly decorated and comfortable 1 
this mostly routine factbased tv drama gets a boost from the fine performance by cole 1 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
i hate movies like that 0 
i just saw this film and i recommend it 1 
the acting from all involved and that includes those like shatner and nimoy is bad and washed out and making them seem as old as they look in real life the special effects are tacky like when spock has to rescue kirk on a jet pack when he falls down from a mountain 0 
crust is not good 0 
but the service was beyond bad 0 
first the bathrooms at this location were dirty seat covers were not replenished just plain yucky 0 
the ear buds only play music in one ear 0 
the script is a big flawed mess 0 
very good quality though 1 
this is an outstanding little restaurant with some of the best food i have ever tasted 1 
elias koteasjack palance play good roles angelina is hot and gets nakedbilly drago appears in this and is cool as usual a cameo by sven ole thorsen helps make this a very enjoyable movie with good acting and a decent budget 1 
i put the latest os on it v115g and it now likes to slow to a crawl and lock up every once in a while 0 
it is a very well acted and done tv movie 1 
gets the job done 1 
i do love sushi but i found kabuki to be overpriced overhip and underservices 0 
so anyone near you will hear part of your conversation 0 
kind of hard to mess up a steak but they did 0 
and the sound quality is great 1 
constantine gives everything the right intensity and seems to have a good understanding of the underlying psychological motivations 1 
the sweet potato tots were good but the onion rings were perfection or as close as i have had 1 
i was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar not only because the quality is great but the service is fast and the food impeccable 1 
i kept looking at the time and it had soon become 35 minutes yet still no food 0 
always a great time at dos gringos 1 
i also decided not to send it back because our waitress looked like she was on the verge of having a heart attack 0 
weve tried to like this place but after 10 times i think were done with them 0 
his losing his marbles so early in the proceedings is totally implausible and unconvincing 0 
its very attractive and appears to be of good quality 1 
the construction of the headsets is poor 0 
we arent ones to make a scene at restaurants but i just dont get itdefinitely lost the love after this one 0 
go to place for gyros 1 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
they know how to make them here 1 
very good though 1 
its a campy sort of film thats a joy to watch 1 
yes i am simplifying things here for the sake of brevity for this really is at the core of the problems with this film it has too much going on without any real fulfilling explanation 0 
i ended up sliding it on the edge of my pants or back pockets instead 1 
i had heard good things about this place but it exceeding every hope i could have dreamed of 1 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
everyone is treated equally special 1 
my salad had a bland vinegrette on the baby greens and hearts of palm 0 
yeah the movie pretty much sucked 0 
all in all i can assure you ill be back 1 
im translating movies for a living and this is the first movie in my 5year working experience that i found offensive to my intelligence 0 
elias koteasjack palance play good roles angelina is hot and gets nakedbilly drago appears in this and is cool as usual a cameo by sven ole thorsen helps make this a very enjoyable movie with good acting and a decent budget 1 
but i thought his acting was skilled 1 
the vanilla ice cream was creamy and smooth while the profiterole choux pastry was fresh enough 1 
one character is totally annoying with a voice that gives me the feeling of fingernails on a chalkboard 0 
this isnt a small family restaurant this is a fine dining establishment 1 
the only very disappointing thing was there was no speakerphone 0 
it ranks highly as a great noircrimedrama incredible performances by belmondo and lino ventura 1 
the sangria was about half of a glass wine full and was 12 ridiculous 0 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
i found this place by accident and i could not be happier 1 
ive owned this phone for 7 months now and can say that its the best mobile phone ive had 1 
interesting decor 1 
att is not clear sound is very distorted and you have to yell when you talk 0 
i will continue to come here on ladies night andddd date night highly recommend this place to anyone who is in the area 1 
their regular toasted bread was equally satisfying with the occasional pats of butter mmmm 1 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
very very fun chef 1 
110 and only because there is no setting for 010 0 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
my sanyo has survived dozens of drops on blacktop without ill effect 1 
i think i was one of the people who found this another one of roths pearls 1 
its very slow 0 
if that bug never showed up i would have given a 4 for sure but on the other side of the wall where this bug was climbing was the kitchen 0 
it was a great phone 1 
recommend with confidence 1 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
highly recommended 1 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
she carries the movie well 1 
all in all im quite satisfied with this purchase 1 
star trek v the final frontier is the worst in the series 0 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
please dont waste your money 0 
after 20 minutes wait i got a table 0 
now the pizza itself was good the peanut sauce was very tasty 1 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
one thing i hate is the mode set button at the side 0 
almost all of the songs in cover girl are oldfashioned and not very tuneful 0 
i really recommend this faceplates since it looks very nice elegant and cool 1 
i even fully charged it before i went to bed and turned off blue tooth and wifi and noticed that it only had 20 left in the morning 0 
it was horrendous 0 
the cable looks so thin and flimsy it is scary 0 
babie bop is very cute 1 
blue ant is easy to use 1 
for the price on amazon it is an excellent product which i would highly recommend 1

excellent product for the price 1 
editing the editing of this film was phenomenal in my opinion 1 
this phone works great 1 
clever and a real crowdpleaserthis film still ranks among mickeys best films even after 80 wonderful years 1 
think of the film being like a dream 1 
seems like a good quick place to grab a bite of some familiar pub food but do yourself a favor and look elsewhere 0 
the first thing that happened was that the tracking was off 0 
very good stuff for the price 1 
its so bad its actually worth seeing just for that reason 0 
just does not work 0 
what the hell kind of crap is that 0 
it plays louder than any other speaker of this size the price is so low that most would think the quality is lacking however its not 1 
this would not even be good as a made for tv flick 0 
they could be used as exemplars for any set designer 1 
for readers who have already seen one of miyazakis films he is still in top form and made another worthwhile experience 1 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
friends pasta also bad he barely touched it 0 
what a waste of money and time 0 
and then tragedy struck 0 
this place is handsdown one of the best places to eat in the phoenix metro area 1 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
i waited and waited 0 
meredith m was better than all right 1 
about half way through this film i started to dislike it 0 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
my first visit to hiro was a delight 1 
the only good thing was that it fits comfortably on small ears 1 
so badwellits just bad 0 
just reading on the specs alone makes you say wow 1 
after my phone got to be about a year old its been slowly breaking despite much care on my part 0 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
yes its that bad 0 
this is the kind of money that is wasted properly 1 
the owners really really need to quit being soooooo cheap let them wrap my freaking sandwich in two papers not one 0 
we enjoy their pizza and brunch 1 
these headphones were a great find and i think they are perhaps the best purchase ive made in the last several years seriously 1 
seems like a good quick place to grab a bite of some familiar pub food but do yourself a favor and look elsewhere 0 
product was excellent and works better than the verizon one and boy was it cheaper 1 
victor mclaglen was even bad and brian donlevy was almost unrecognizable 0 
this is one of the worst sandra bullock movie since speed 2 but not quite that bad 0 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
alexander nevsky is a great film 1 
always a great time at dos gringos 1 
the story line is totally predictable 0 
the phone is sturdy and waterproof 1 
i dont have very many words to say about this place but it does everything pretty well 1 
good audio quality 1 
magical help 1 
i love this bluetooth 1 
we have tried 2 units and they both failed within 2 months pros 0 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
but whatever it was that cost them so much it didnt translate to quality thats for sure 0 
this is one of the best italian thrillers of the early 70s 1 
cant store anything but phone numbers to sim 0 
the basic premise is wasted since it is sidelined by the inexplicable focus on the documentary crew 0 
bad script bad direction and horrible acting make this one plain bad 0 
verizon tech support walked my through a few procedures none of which worked and i ended up having to do a hard reset wiping out all my data 0 
very unreliable service from tmobile 0 
it is wonderful and inspiring to watch and i hope that it gets released again on to video or dvd 1 
then i had to continue pairing it periodically since it somehow kept dropping 0 
an extensive menu provides lots of options for breakfast 1 
a greasy unhealthy meal 0 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
this is a chilly unremarkable movie about an author livingworking in a chilly abstruse culture 0 
lasted one day and then blew up 0 
the story line is just awful 0 
i just cant explain this movie more than romanticcharminghilariousand adorablethe junkyard scenes are funnyall the junkyard dogs have something specialtoo funny i laughedkids will love itbuy it when it comes outit has new features 1 
probably not in a hurry to go back 0 
it was so bad i had lost the heart to finish it 0 
the macarons here are insanely good 1 
very good product well made 1 
doesnt hold charge 0 
its the best headset i have used 1 
finally after three or four times the spring of the latch broke and i could not use it any longer on the visor 0 
it has a great camera thats 2mp and the pics are nice and clear with great picture quality 1 
we loved the place 1 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
but it does get better reception and clarity than any phone ive had before 1 
strike 2 who wants to be rushed 0 
walked in and the place smelled like an old grease trap and only 2 others there eating 0 
i exchanged the sony ericson z500a for this and im pretty happy with that decision 1 
the inside is really quite nice and very clean 1 
if you are razr owneryou must have this 1 
very nice and relaxing late night viewing 1 
the movie seemed a little slow at first 0 
bad choice 0 
pricing is a bit of a concern at mellow mushroom 0 
voice quality signal strength dropped calls 0 
cinematography noteworthy including fine views of barcelona and its famed gaudi towers 1 
if it were possible to give them zero stars theyd have it 0 
this phone is very fast with sending any kind of messages and web browsing is significantly faster than previous phones i have used 1 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
this is one of the worst sandra bullock movie since speed 2 but not quite that bad 0 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
i wont say any more i dont like spoilers so i dont want to be one but i believe this film is worth your time 1 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
very good though 1 
i really like this product over the motorola because it is allot clearer on the ear piece and the mic 1 
what a piece of junk i lose more calls on this phone 0 
both films are terrible but to the credit of the 1986 version it was watchable 0 
my husband said she was very rude did not even apologize for the bad food or anything 0 
delicious and i will absolutely be back 1 
nevertheless yet another wonderful film from the great masters stable 1 
i just cant explain this movie more than romanticcharminghilariousand adorablethe junkyard scenes are funnyall the junkyard dogs have something specialtoo funny i laughedkids will love itbuy it when it comes outit has new features 1 
both do good jobs and are quite amusing 1 
again no plot at all 0 
the speaker is of low quality so as making the ring tones sound very cheap 0 
terrible my car will not accept this cassette 0 
i can think of no other film where something vitally important occurs every other minute 1 
great place to relax and have an awesome burger and beer 1 
it had some average acting from the main person and it was a low budget as you clearly can see 0 
i think i was one of the people who found this another one of roths pearls 1 
the ambiance isnt much better 0 
the acting was bad the dialogs were extremely shallow and insincere 0 
i couldnt think of a better way to end the film but a smile on my face great way to wrap up an amazing film and trilogy 1 
there was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth but it didnt really work into the rest of the plot 0 
it also took her forever to bring us the check when we asked for it 0 
all in all id expected a better consumer experience from motorola 0 
it was pretty gross 0 
the battery is completely useless to me 0 
this company charge me a restocking fee and still not given me my refund back 0 
worse theres an incredibly weak subplot thrown in that follows a little band of latterday mansonites as they go after a reporter whos working on a story on the anniversary of the killings 0 
what the hell kind of crap is that 0 
the battery works great 1 
what a big waste of time 0 
it was clear that she had the range and ability to pull off this part 1 
this convention never worked well in the past and certainly doesnt work here 0 
however the ear pads come off easily and after only one week i lost one 0 
he deserves 5 stars 1 
yes its shiny on front side and i love it 1 
arrived quickly and much less expensive than others being sold 1 
if this premise sound stupid thats because it is 0 
you could only take 2 videos at a time and the quality was very poor 0 
great sound and service 1 
if that bug never showed up i would have given a 4 for sure but on the other side of the wall where this bug was climbing was the kitchen 0 
dont waste your money 0 
every element of this story was so over the top excessively phony and contrived that it was painful to sit through 0 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
and the red curry had so much bamboo shoots and wasnt very tasty to me 0 
lange had become a great actress 1 
youll love how thin it is 1 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
if you love death and decay and shakespears lyrics this is the one 1 
woa talk about awful 0 
she ordered a toasted english muffin that came out untoasted 0 
food quality has been horrible 0 
i was shocked because no signs indicate cash only 0 
worst service to boot but that is the least of their worries 0 
the movie is terribly boring in places 0 
very prompt service 1 
it didnt work people can not hear me when i talk 0 
a drive thru means you do not want to wait around for half an hour for your food but somehow when we end up going here they make us wait and wait 0 
kris kristoffersen is good in this movie and really makes a difference 1 
i have to jiggle the plug to get it to line up right to get decent volume 0 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
i would recommend this 1 
food arrived quickly 1 
still its quite interesting and entertaining to follow 1 
this is the kind of money that is wasted properly 1 
plug was the wrong size 0 
the movie lacks visual interest drama expression of feeling and celebration of the very patriotism that underlines the narrative 0 
watching washing machine twirling around wouldnt hurt your eyes as much as this show 0 
nice headset priced right 1 
the phone was unusable and was not new 0 
im glad i found this product on amazon it is hard to find it wasnt high priced 1 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
i had heard good things about this place but it exceeding every hope i could have dreamed of 1 
great hands free device 1 
soggy and not good 0 
they will customize your order any way youd like my usual is eggplant with green bean stir fry love it 1 
i exchanged the sony ericson z500a for this and im pretty happy with that decision 1 
it was a pale color instead of nice and char and has no flavor 0 
talk about useless customer service 0 
lousy product 0 
very good quality though 1 
we wont be returning 0 
the desserts were a bit strange 0 
dont buy it 0 
this phone tries very hard to do everything but fails at its very ability to be a phone 0 
the battery works great 1 
my fiancÃ© and i came in the middle of the day and we were greeted and seated right away 1 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
and those baby owls were adorable 1 
i guess i liked the details of his dysfunctionhe was believable 1 
it was equally awful 0 
food quality has been horrible 0 
it was delicious 1 
you will leave the theater wanting to go out and dance under the stars 1 
if you do watch it however there are small consolations the actresses playing annes sisters each do a wonderful job with their roles 1 
the food is rich so order accordingly 1 
bad script bad direction and horrible acting make this one plain bad 0 
he also came back to check on us regularly excellent service 1 
i probably wont be coming back here 0 
the movie in movie situations in the beginning and through the game that is played with her by the acting coach are fascinating 1 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
it was quite comfortable in the ear 1 
i especially liked the noncliche choices with the parents in other movies i could predict the dialog verbatim but the writing in this movie made better selections 1 
this movie is greatespecially if you enjoy visual arts 1 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
im happy about this purchase good quality and low price 1 
saw the movie today and thought it was a good effort good messages for kids 1 
not good for the money 0 
ive dropped my phone more times than i can say even on concrete and my phone is still great knock on wood 1 
reasonably priced also 1 
comfortable in my hand 1 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
this short film certainly pulls no punches 0 
avoid this film at all costs 0 
food arrived quickly 1 
before i go in to why i gave a 1 star rating please know that this was my third time eating at bachi burger before writing a review 0 
long whiny and pointless 0 
if it were possible to give them zero stars theyd have it 0 
the charger worked for about a week and then completely stopped charging my phone 0 
the igo chargers and tips are really great 1 
excellent short film 1 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
the food was excellent and service was very good 1 
all of the tapas dishes were delicious 1 
buy a different phone but not this 0
