the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
both films are terrible but to the credit of the 1986 version it was watchable 0 
i love their fries and their beans 1 
battery lasts only a few hours 0 
i went on motorolas website and followed all directions but could not get it to pair again 0 
it isnt even an achievement as a sobaditsgood or sobaditsmemorable movie 0 
i love this cable it allows me to connect any miniusb device to my pc 1 
the chains which im no fan of beat this place easily 0 
good quality 1 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
doesnt last long 0 
think of the film being like a dream 1 
its too bad the food is so damn generic 0 
aailiyah was pretty good as akasha in places compelling her first entrance and mini dance scene 1 
these products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet 0 
kind of hard to mess up a steak but they did 0 
it really is impressive that the place hasnt closed down 0 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
her lines seem to have been written by a fifteen year old though they are trying oh so so hard to sound like how a fifteen year old would really um you know well talk 0 
i wish i could return the unit and get back my money 0 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
seriously its not worth wasting your or your kids time on 0 
im not really sure how joeys was voted best hot dog in the valley by readers of phoenix magazine 0 
linked to my phone without effort 1 
love this phone 1 
cumbersome design 0 
good price 1 
overall the film is interesting and thoughtprovoking 1 
nice quality build unlike some cheap s out there 1 
we thought youd have to venture further away to get good sushi but this place really hit the spot that night 1 
i did not bother contacting the company for few dollar product but i learned the lesson that i should not have bought this form online anyway 0 
the selection was probably the worst ive seen in vegasthere was none 0 
this movie contained an allstar cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i havent seen before 1 
i was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar not only because the quality is great but the service is fast and the food impeccable 1 
the acting is fantastic the stories are seamlessly woven together and the dogs are splendid a must rent view or see 1 
during several different 2 minute calls i experienced 5 drops and it was in an area that had 5 bars 0 
i could not recommend these more 0 
great choice 1 
macbeth jason connery moved me to tears with his final monolog out brief candle outhe gave the sphere of moral decay and dark forces a human face which makes it the more interesting 1 
when it opens the battery connection is broken and the device is turned off 0 
i still maintain that monkeys shouldnt make headphones we just obviously dont share enough dna to copy the design over to humans 0 
i would advise to not purchase this item it never worked very well 0 
pretty awesome place 1 
they were excellent 1 
the chains which im no fan of beat this place easily 0 
so flavorful and has just the perfect amount of heat 1 
very good product well made 1 
this product is great it makes working a lot easier i can go to the copier while waiting on hold for something 1 
ryans bar is definitely one edinburgh establishment i wont be revisiting 0 
this film highlights the fundamental flaws of the legal process that its not about discovering guilt or innocence but rather is about who presents better in court 1 
ordered a double cheeseburger got a single patty that was falling apart picture uploaded yeah still sucks 0 
it was a good thing that the tickets only cost five dollars because i would be mad if id have paid 750 to see this crap 0 
this is a chilly unremarkable movie about an author livingworking in a chilly abstruse culture 0 
the soundtrack sucked 0 
the only suspense i was feeling was the frustration at just how retarded the girls were 0 
the lines the cuts the audio everything is wrong 0 
i love this phone 1 
its just adorable seeing mickey playing turkey in the straw in a highly imaginative if occasionally cruel way 1 
thats how id describe this painfully dreary timewaster of a film 0 
i like steiners because its dark and it feels like a bar 1 
if you check the directors filmography on this site you will see why this film didnt have a chance 0 
the delivery was on time 1 
worst thai ever 0 
constantine gives everything the right intensity and seems to have a good understanding of the underlying psychological motivations 1 
i was very excited to get this headset because i thought it was really cute 1 
if you havent choked in your own vomit by the end by all the cheap drama and worthless dialogue youve must have bored yourself to death with this waste of time 0 
i give wirefly 1 stari will contact cingularatt and inform them of this practice 0 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
the phone gets extremely hot 0 
dont waste your time watching this rubbish nonresearched film 0 
this phone works great 1 
this frog phone charm is adorable and very eye catching 1 
if it were possible to give them zero stars theyd have it 0 
not my thing 0 
the ambience is wonderful and there is music playing 1 
worst martini ever 0 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
my girlfriends veal was very bad 0 
easy to pair with my samsung cell 1 
this movie is terrible 0 
there is a brilliant twist ending 1 
the scallop dish is quite appalling for value as well 0 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
i even dropped this phone into a stream and it was submerged for 15 seconds and it still works great 1 
so far it has worked like a charm 1 
the charger arrived within the promised timeframe but it did not work 0 
this is a great deal 1 
this movie is possibly one of the most creative works of horror ever 1 
how stupid is that 0 
unfortunately cover girl is an example of how hollywood used to exploit women for financial gain 0 
very nice and relaxing late night viewing 1 
it was just not a fun experience 1 
overall a delight 1 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
unreliable im giving up 0 
at first i thought i was grtting a good deal at 744 until i plugged it into my phone v3c razr 0 
i believe that this place is a great stop for those with a huge belly and hankering for sushi 1 
i was bored throughout the whole damn thing 0 
hayao miyazakis latest and eighth film for studio ghibili gake no ue no ponyo ponyo on the cliff by the sea is a wonderfully fun and imaginative look at childhood 1 
poor talk time performance 0 
excellent performance 1 
the movie showed a lot of florida at its best made it look very appealing 1 
and his subtle connections between the three films are awesome 1 
we enjoy their pizza and brunch 1 
the block was amazing 1 
secondly hitchcock pretty much perfected the thriller and chase movie 1 
painful on the ear 0 
this was a different cut than the piece the other day but still wonderful and tender s well as well flavored 1 
gets a signal when other verizon phones wont 1 
will go back next trip out 1 
the casting is also horrible cause all you see is a really really bad actors period 0 
nice spicy and tender 1 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
as for the killer dont expect anything original or even remotely frightening 0 
rating 1 out of 10 0 
the nano stated itmy son was dissapointed 0 
the construction of the headsets is poor 0 
the story is lame not interesting and never really explains the sinister origins of the puppets 0 
this review is long overdue since i consider a tale of two sisters to be the single greatest film ever made 1 
it has a very good plot it holds your complete attention the acting is superb tom wilkinson was fantastic and emily watson was also very good 1 
service was good and the company was better 1 
the presentation of the food was awful 0 
i can say that the desserts were yummy 1 
at first glance it is a lovely bakery cafe nice ambiance clean friendly staff 1 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
finally after three or four times the spring of the latch broke and i could not use it any longer on the visor 0 
i might have gotten a defect but i would not risk buying it again because of the built quality alone 0 
the cable looks so thin and flimsy it is scary 0 
my fiancé and i came in the middle of the day and we were greeted and seated right away 1 
i have only had it for a few weeks but so far so good 1 
this convention never worked well in the past and certainly doesnt work here 0 
we waited for forty five minutes in vain 0 
very disappointing 0 
i received it quickly and it works great 1 
incredible 1 
one of the most disappointing aspects is the lack of notable gore 0 
the cast is always entertaining as usual 1 
furthermore you cant even find hours of operation on the website 0 
same evening him and i are both drastically sick 0 
it was awesome 1 
delicious 1 
highly unrecommended 0 
the only thing worse than taylors acting was stanwycks singing 0 
i was very pleased to see that i could replace my well travled swivel holster for my blackberry flip 1 
just what i wanted 1 
we waited for forty five minutes in vain 0 
the potatoes were great and so was the biscuit 1 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
the burger is good beef cooked just right 1 
i will never go back to this place and will never ever recommended this place to anyone 0 
the writers were smack on and i think the best actors and actresses were a bonus to the showthese characters were so real 1 
this film offers many delights and surprises 1 
i was disgusted because i was pretty sure that was human hair 0 
the cinematography is simply stunning to say the least and the fx are nothing if not stateoftheart 1 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
product is exactly as described 1 
if you have several dozen or several hundred contacts then imagine the fun of sending each of them one by one 0 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
nothing special 0 
the only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port irda 0 
babie bop is very cute 1 
im pleased 1 
this is a chilly unremarkable movie about an author livingworking in a chilly abstruse culture 0 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
the charger worked for about a week and then completely stopped charging my phone 0 
gave up trying to eat any of the crust teeth still sore 0 
these are the central themes of the film and they are handled ineptly stereotypically and with no depth of imagination 0 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
the majority of the logitech earbud headsets failed 0 
the plug did not work very well 0 
give this one a look 1 
the warmth it generates is in contrast to its austere backdrop 1 
the greek dressing was very creamy and flavorful 1 
seriously its not worth wasting your or your kids time on 0 
last night was my second time dining here and i was so happy i decided to go back 1 
the worst sappiest dialogue i could go on and on 0 
not sure who was more lost the flat characters or the audience nearly half of whom walked out 0 
i find this inexcusable and so will probably be returning this phone and perhaps changing carriers 0 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
i can take a little bad service but the food sucks 0 
however the ear pads come off easily and after only one week i lost one 0 
a world better than 95 of the garbage in the theatres today 1 
this gets a 1 out of 10 simply because theres nothing lower 0 
only like 3 or 4 buildings used a couple of locations maybe poor hummh 0 
but other than that the movie seemed to drag and the heroes didnt really work for their freedom 0 
the screen size is big key pad lit well enough and the camera quality is excellent for a camera phone 1 
product is exactly as described 1 
when i saw it in the theater i thought i was going to be sick 0 
the service was great even the manager came and helped with our table 1 
just what i wanted 1 
i dont think you will be disappointed 1 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
the scripting of the subtle comedy is unmatched by any movie in recent years 1 
the show would begin with smart ass ed comments to each other that would be totally off the wall and uncalled for 0 
so dont go there if you are looking for good food 0 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
this film has no redeeming features 0 
the ngage is still lacking in earbuds 0 
and i just love the colors 1 
what the hell kind of crap is that 0 
today the graphics are crap 0 
the sergeant pepper beef sandwich with auju sauce is an excellent sandwich as well 1 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
the warm beer didnt help 0 
my headset works just peachykeen 1 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
i had to go to a store and bought a new nokia phone which is working great 1 
it is practically useless and did not add any kind of boost to my reception after i bought it 0 
the hockey scenes are terrible defensemen playing like theyre 5 years old goalies diving at shots that are 10 feet wide of the net etc 0 
not good when wearing a hat or sunglasses 0 
i hate those things as much as cheap quality black olives 0 
5 stars for the brick oven bread app 1 
this is a great little item 1 
if you simply want a small flip phone look elsewhere as the extra bells whistles are mediocre 0 
this is a chilly unremarkable movie about an author livingworking in a chilly abstruse culture 0 
the phone was unusable and was not new 0 
this is the first phone ive had that has been so cheaply made 0 
an interesting premise and billy drago is always good as a dangerous nutbag side note id love to see drago stephen mchattie and lance hendrikson in a flick together talk about raging cheekbones 1 
this would not even be good as a made for tv flick 0 
i connected my wifes bluetoothmotorola hs850 to my phone and it worked like a charm whether the phone was in my pocket or the case 1 
on the up side their cafe serves really good food 1 
basically the service was very bad 0 
we made the drive all the way from north scottsdale and i was not one bit disappointed 1 
the acting is fantastic the stories are seamlessly woven together and the dogs are splendid a must rent view or see 1 
after 3 months screen just went black all of a sudden 0 
this is one of the best movies out there that shows such strong sibling bond for each other 1 
dont make the same mistake i did 0 
looks great and is strong 1 
however i needed some better instructions 0 
great audio 1 
food was delicious 1 
not what i wanted 0 
there is nothing authentic about this place 0 
this movie is greatespecially if you enjoy visual arts 1 
there was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters 0 
mic doesnt work 0 
now we were chosen to be tortured with this disgusting piece of blatant american propaganda 0 
this place is good 1 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
the plot has more holes than a pair of fishnet stockings and the direction and editing is astonishingly ham fisted 0 
unfortunately it was not good 0 
the incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film 1 
so far it has worked like a charm 1 
if you are razr owneryou must have this 1 
food was really good and i got full petty fast 1 
i hate to disagree with my fellow yelpers but my husband and i were so disappointed with this place 0 
one of my favorite purchases ever 1 
if you are reading this please dont go there 0 
lightweight and works well 1 
editing the editing of this film was phenomenal in my opinion 1 
all i can do is whine on the internet so here it goesthe more i use the thing the less i like it 0 
great food and awesome service 1 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
the color is even prettier than i thought it would be and the graphics are incredibly sharp 1 
rating 1 out of 10 0 
cheap but hey it works was pleasantly suprised given the low cost of this item 1 
i seriously cannot believe that the owner has so many unexperienced employees that all are running around like chickens with their heads cut off 0 
i saw mirrormask last night and it was an unsatisfactory experience 0 
both great 1 
this is was due to the fact that it took 20 minutes to be acknowledged then another 35 minutes to get our foodand they kept forgetting things 0 
good case excellent value 1 
the attractive set used throughout most of the film is an eyepleasing gem 1 
we arent ones to make a scene at restaurants but i just dont get itdefinitely lost the love after this one 0 
tasted like dirt 0 
not a good item it worked for a while then started having problems in my auto reverse tape player 0 
the only suspense i was feeling was the frustration at just how retarded the girls were 0 
why are these sad little vegetables so overcooked 0 
the headset fulfills my requirements so i am happy with my purchase 1 
im surprised this is a good quality car charger and theres not much reviews about it 1 
this film tries to be a serious and sophisticated thrillerhorror flick and it fails miserably 0 
mark my words this is one of those cult films like evil dead 2 or phantasm that people will still be discovering and falling in love with 20 30 40 years down the line 1 
the service was poor and thats being nice 0 
not much seafood and like 5 strings of pasta at the bottom 0 
highly entertaining at all angles 1 
the food was barely lukewarm so it must have been sitting waiting for the server to bring it out to us 0 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
then the film just dropped the ball 0 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
i bought two of them and neither will charge 0 
again lame 0 
they work about 2 weeks then break 0 
this was utterly confusing at first which caused me to lose a couple of very very important contacts 0 
wasted two hours 0 
very good though 1 
i highly recommend this movie for anyone interested in art poetry theater politics or japanese history 1 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
go watch it 1 
i loved it it was really scary 1 
in short dont bother with this movie 0 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
a piece of junk that broke after being on my phone for 2 days 0 
i gave it 5 stars then and im giving it 5 stars now 1 
i know this is not like the other restaurants at all something is very off here 0 
that company is a joke 0 
great case and price 1 
great price also 1 
in summary this was a largely disappointing dining experience 0 
i swung in to give them a try but was deeply disappointed 0 
this place is pretty good nice little vibe in the restaurant 1 
it is cheap and it feel and look just as cheap 0 
regardless the film fails on most levels 0 
i had heard good things about this place but it exceeding every hope i could have dreamed of 1 
sweetest phone 1 
however my girl was complain that some time the phone doesnt wake up like normal phone does 0 
lifetime does not air it enough so if anyone knows what store sells it let me know because this is a musthave 1 
everything about this movie is stupid 0 
good value great food great service 1 
generally it just lacked imagination 0 
it felt too light and tinny 0 
will be back again 1 
a lot of websites have been rating this a very good phone and so do i 1 
overall i like there food and the service 1 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
if you love death and decay and shakespears lyrics this is the one 1 
there was hardly any meat 0 
the nachos are a must have 1 
it is not good 0 
although i very much liked the look and sound of this place the actual experience was a bit disappointing 0 
i do think tom hanks is a good actor 1 
i hate writing bad reviews about films especially those in which i really like the star but this film is so bad i dont believe for one second that anyone could have been proud of it 0 
i wish i could return the unit and get back my money 0 
its a fresh subtle and rather sublime effect 1 
the stories were as unbelievable as the actors 0 
i like the fact that it rests lightly against your ear rather than inside 1 
horrible phone 0 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
my husband said she was very rude did not even apologize for the bad food or anything 0 
if you havent choked in your own vomit by the end by all the cheap drama and worthless dialogue youve must have bored yourself to death with this waste of time 0 
this place is overpriced not consistent with their boba and it really is overpriced 0 
the cocktails are all handmade and delicious 1 
things that went wrong they burned the saganaki 0 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
camera color balance is awful 0 
the ambiance isnt much better 0 
the acting was decidely wooden though no worse than a period universal b movie 0 
what should have been a hilarious yummy christmas eve dinner to remember was the biggest fail of the entire trip for us 0 
made very sturdy 1 
doesnt work at all i bougth it for my l7c and its not working 0 
i could care less the interior is just beautiful 1 
the service was meh 0 
when achille and philippa beautifully sing a duet from don giovanni that perfectly describes their situation in the movie you appreciate the subtle layers of this excellent film 1 
very tough and very short on flavor 0 
this place is disgusting 0 
a piece of junk that broke after being on my phone for 2 days 0 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
the acting is like watching wooden puppets moving around and reading from a book thats how bad it is 0 
ordered an appetizer and took 40 minutes and then the pizza another 10 minutes 0 
excellent product 1 
this gets a 1 out of 10 simply because theres nothing lower 0 
i got home to see the driest damn wings ever 0 
you could drive a semi truck into these holes 0 
i ordered this for sony ericsson w810i but i think it only worked once thats when i first used it 0 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
the service here is fair at best 0 
battery life is real good 1 
a film not easily forgotten 1 
i will be back many times soon 1 
trying to make a call on these is an exercise in frustration 0 
there was no chemistry between ben affleck and sandra bullock in this film and i couldnt understand why he would consider even leaving his wifetobe for this chick that he supposedly was knocked out by 0 
the vegetables are so fresh and the sauce feels like authentic thai 1 
blue ant is easy to use 1 
rating 1 out of 10 0 
lots of holes in the script 0 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
we had a group of 70 when we claimed we would only have 40 and they handled us beautifully 1 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
that was done in the second movie 0 
great food 1 
awful 0 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
painful on the ear 0 
someone shouldve invented this sooner 1 
the results well are a shame 0 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
think it over when you plan to own this onethis sure is the last moto phone for me 0 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
the best place to go for a tasty bowl of pho 1 
i would recommend it 1 
a week later after i activated it it suddenly died 0 
frozen pucks of disgust with some of the worst people behind the register 0 
i am a fan of his this movie sucked really bad 0 
good food good service 1 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
so bad 0 
is pretty funny 1 
this phone might well be the worst ive ever had in any brand 0 
for service i give them no stars 0 
it doesnt work in europe or asia 0 
the inside is really quite nice and very clean 1 
great software for motorolas 1 
bela lugosi was totally extraneous intoning odd lines 0 
cant say enough good things about this place 1 
when my order arrived one of the gyros was missing 0 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
the service was extremely slow 0 
the fries were great too 1 
however paul schrader has indeed made a film about mishima that is both superb complex 1 
if only someone involved with it knew how to string together narrative 0 
the acting was bad the dialogs were extremely shallow and insincere 0 
their steaks are 100 recommended 1 
would not reccommend 0 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
dont make the same mistake i did 0 
brilliance indeed 1 
jawbone era is awesome too 1 
their onscreen chemistry critical to the entire film is genuine 1 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
everything about this movie is stupid 0 
first time there and might just be the last 0 
i had to wait over 30 minutes to get my drink and longer to get 2 arepas 0 
plus its only 8 bucks 1 
its a shame to see good actors like thomerson and james make a living in a mess like this 0 
this is an unbelievable bargain 1 
its a total package 1 
the biggest complaint i have is the battery drains superfast 0 
their rotating beers on tap is also a highlight of this place 1 
bad choice 0 
this one wants to surf on the small wave of space movies in 1998 deep impact and armageddon and this one fails everywhere 0 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
the plot doesnt hang together at all and the acting is absolutely appalling 0 
a bit predictable 0 
works fine 1 
the plot doesnt hang together at all and the acting is absolutely appalling 0 
and sometimes it was so embarrassing that i had to look away 0 
very disappointing 0 
wont go back 0 
predictable but not a bad watch 1 
overall a great experience 1 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
couldnt ask for a more satisfying meal 1 
they have been around for years and carries the highest quality of antiglare screen protector that i have found to date 1 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
only pros large seating area nice bar area great simple drink menu the best brick oven pizza with homemade dough 1 
if you want a real scare rent this one 1 
its a fresh subtle and rather sublime effect 1 
a cheap and cheerless heist movie with poor characterisation lots of underbite style stoic emoting think chow yun fat in a better tomorrow and some cheesy clichés thrown into an abandoned factory ready for a few poorly executed flying judo rolls a la john woo 0 
the descriptions said yum yum sauce and another said eel sauce yet another said spicy mayowell none of the rolls had sauces on them 0 
lucy bell is so much higher than this crap and for her to sink this low is quite depressing 0 
we have tried 2 units and they both failed within 2 months pros 0 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
very disappointed and wondered how it could be in the oscar shortlist 0 
the earpiece on this is too large or too heavyit keeps falling out of my ear 0 
a week later after i activated it it suddenly died 0 
this phone is pretty sturdy and ive never had any large problems with it 1 
hackneyed writing certainly but made even worse by the bad directing 0 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
i just wanted to leave 0 
they have been around for years and carries the highest quality of antiglare screen protector that i have found to date 1 
this place is pretty good nice little vibe in the restaurant 1 
to sum the film up breeders is a terrible cheaply made horror movie that should be avoided like the ebola virus 0 
the screen does get smudged easily because it touches your ear and face 0 
good value works fine power via usb car or wall outlet 1 
performed awful muffled tinny incoming sound and severe echo for those on the other end of the call 0 
all the actors give a wonderful performance especially jennifer rubin as jamie harris who changes from the nervous starlet in the beginning through the strange events she is part of to the cool star 1 
i gave it a 10 1 
not even a hello we will be right with you 0 
this place is like chipotle but better 1 
service is quick and even to go orders are just like we like it 1 
its so bad its actually worth seeing just for that reason 0 
defective crap 0 
i have bought this nokia cell phone a few weeks ago and it was a nightmare 0 
the worst one of the series 0 
a piece of junk that broke after being on my phone for 2 days 0 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
it was just not a fun experience 1 
this is such a fun and funny movie 1 
waitress was sweet and funny 1 
there is simply no excuse for something this poorly done 0 
disappointing experience 0 
all it took was one drop from about 6 inches above the kitchen counter and it was crackedi am not impressed and i am not laughing 0 
it never condescends all the characters have good genuine hearts and believable problems 1 
disappointed 0 
not only did the software do a great job of this i could also make my own ringtones form my existing cds without an internet connection 1 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
this place is great 1 
i wasnt the least bit interested 0 
it really is impressive that the place hasnt closed down 0 
all i can do is whine on the internet so here it goesthe more i use the thing the less i like it 0 
delicious nyc bagels good selections of cream cheese real lox with capers even 1 
unfortunately it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees 0 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
when achille and philippa beautifully sing a duet from don giovanni that perfectly describes their situation in the movie you appreciate the subtle layers of this excellent film 1 
i own 2 of these cases and would order another 1 
only pros large seating area nice bar area great simple drink menu the best brick oven pizza with homemade dough 1 
would recommend this item 1 
i work in the hospitality industry in paradise valley and have refrained from recommending cibo any longer 0 
the kids are very cool too 1 
the bartender was also nice 1 
this results in the phone being either stuck at max volume or mute 0 
great phone 1 
those burgers were amazing 1 
tasted like dirt 0 
wow what a bad film 0 
i had a pretty satifying experience 1 
painful on the ear 0 
my boyfriend and i sat at the bar and had a completely delightful experience 1 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
i had to wait over 30 minutes to get my drink and longer to get 2 arepas 0 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
it quit working after id used it for about 18 months so i just purchased another one because this is the best headset ive ever owned 1 
it was too predictable even for a chick flick 0 
the seller is very understanding and patient i would definitely buy from them again 1 
a bit predictable 0 
but storm trooper is not even bad enough to make it to the list of wonderfully terrible movies 0 
yes its that bad 0 
the bt headset was such a disapoinment 0 
i connected my wifes bluetoothmotorola hs850 to my phone and it worked like a charm whether the phone was in my pocket or the case 1 
i believe that pitch black was done well 1 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
i bought this to use with my kindle fire and absolutely loved it 1 
i have been in more than a few bars in vegas and do not ever recall being charged for tap water 0 
i could care less the interior is just beautiful 1 
an awesome new look for fall 2000 1 
portable and it works 1 
best ive found so far ive tried 2 other bluetooths and this one has the best quality for both me and the listener as well as ease of using 1 
my only complaint is the standard sound volume is a little low even when turned up to 5of 5 0 
the structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema 1 
punishment park is a brilliant piece of cinema 1 
it isnt even an achievement as a sobaditsgood or sobaditsmemorable movie 0 
he cant act one of the least scary villains i have ever seen he cant write did he write this damn movie in his sleep 0 
it is practically useless and did not add any kind of boost to my reception after i bought it 0 
when my order arrived one of the gyros was missing 0 
battery has no life 0 
if you do go see this movie bring a pillow or a girlfriendboyfriend to keep you occupied through out 0 
after a year the battery went completely dead on my headset 0 
mishima is extremely uninteresting 0 
damn good steak 1 
reception is terrible and full of static 0 
not recommended 0 
nice leather 1 
the atmosphere was great with a lovely duo of violinists playing songs we requested 1 
now the burgers arent as good the pizza which used to be amazing is doughy and flavorless 0 
the plot has more holes than a pair of fishnet stockings and the direction and editing is astonishingly ham fisted 0 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
delicious nyc bagels good selections of cream cheese real lox with capers even 1 
while i managed to bend the leaf spring back in place the metal now has enough stress that it will break on the next drop 0 
the block was amazing 1 
bland and flavorless is a good way of describing the barely tepid meat 0 
i give it 2 thumbs down 0 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
i used bitpim a free program you can find on the internetto transfer data to the phonethe price of the cable was excellent 1 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
o my gosh the best phone i have ever had 1 
overall i wasnt very impressed with noca 0 
other than that the leather is nice and soft the fit is very tight the cut out for the face is a good shape 1 
it was probably dirt 0 
delicious and i will absolutely be back 1 
but this movie really got to me 1 
strike 2 who wants to be rushed 0 
you cant go wrong with any of the food here 1 
reception is terrible and full of static 0 
it doesnt work in europe or asia 0 
kind of flops around 0 
at first i thought i was grtting a good deal at 744 until i plugged it into my phone v3c razr 0 
aside from its terrible lead this film has loads of other debits 0 
i got the aluminum case for my new palm vx and it worked really wellit has protected my handheld perfectly so far 1 
worst hour and a half of my lifeoh my gosh 0 
it looses connection to the phone even when it is within a couple feet between the two 0 
there is really nothing for me at postinos hope your experience is better 0 
talk about great customer service of course we will be back 1 
also its a real treat to see anthony quinn playing crazy horse 1 
my ribeye steak was cooked perfectly and had great mesquite flavor 1 
we definately enjoyed ourselves 1 
a great film by a great director 1 
the fact is this film is a wonderful heartwarming tale about two people chasing their dreams 1 
if you have several dozen or several hundred contacts then imagine the fun of sending each of them one by one 0 
this movie is bad 0 
you wont forget this movie 1 
i vomited in the bathroom mid lunch 0 
its fits like a glove and is strong secure and durable 1 
i guess that nobody at the network that aired this dribble watched it before putting it on 0 
you share general loewenhielms exquisite joy in his partaking of the cailles en sarcophage even though you are just watching a movie but you do wish for just a small sample to savor 1 
very disappointed 0 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
much more interesting more action more suspense and less of the unneeded controversy 1 
this convention never worked well in the past and certainly doesnt work here 0 
the phone is sturdy and waterproof 1 
in other words the content level of this film is enough to easily fill a dozen other films 1 
i recommend igo to anyone with different brand cell phonesmp3 players in the family 1 
wed definitely go back here again 1 
at least think to refill my water before i struggle to wave you over for 10 minutes 0 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
the chips and sals a here is amazing 1 
item does not match picture 0 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
it will drive you barking mad 0 
im not really sure how joeys was voted best hot dog in the valley by readers of phoenix magazine 0 
it was not good 0 
this game rocks 1 
would not go back 0 
tom wilkinson broke my heart at the end and everyone elses judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike 1 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
i did not have any problem with this item and would order it again if needed 1 
dont make the same mistake i did 0 
the staff is friendly and the joint is always clean 1 
this is a good joint 1 
very good though 1 
very dissapointing performance 0 
and those baby owls were adorable 1 
if that bug never showed up i would have given a 4 for sure but on the other side of the wall where this bug was climbing was the kitchen 0 
you wont regret it 1 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
there was no chemistry between ben affleck and sandra bullock in this film and i couldnt understand why he would consider even leaving his wifetobe for this chick that he supposedly was knocked out by 0 
i dont think i will be back for a very long time 0 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
a greasy unhealthy meal 0 
i cannot make calls at certain places 0 
and i just love the colors 1 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
adapter does not provide enough charging current 0 
treo and tmobile refused to replace it again and forced me to buy another phone without any kind of upgrade discount 0 
the ending is so so perfect youll shed a tear 1 
great character actors telly savalas and peter boyle 1 
unfortunately it did not work 0 
i can barely ever hear on it and am constantly saying what 0 
everyone is very attentive providing excellent customer service 1 
i mean really how do you get so famous for your fish and chips when its so terrible 0 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
setup couldnt have been simpler 1 
1010 1 
a disappointment 0 
lifetime does not air it enough so if anyone knows what store sells it let me know because this is a musthave 1 
this blueant supertooth handsfree phone speaker is awesome 1 
highly recommended for all ages although the younger set will probably not appreciate some of the more subtle references they will certainly appreciate one galley scene in particular 1 
this was like the final blow 0 
the first thing that happened was that the tracking was off 0 
while you dont yet hear mickey speak there are tons of sound effects and music throughout the filmsomething we take for granted now but which was a huge crowd pleaser in 1928 1 
i think i was one of the people who found this another one of roths pearls 1 
best service and food ever maria our server was so good and friendly she made our day 1 
conclusion i loved it 1 
item does not match picture 0 
however the keypads are so tinny that i sometimes reach the wrong buttons 0 
however after seeing the short again after about 25 years i was amazed at how timeless the film actually is 1 
this is one of peter watkins most accessible films 1 
good value works fine power via usb car or wall outlet 1 
it does everything the description said it would 1 
this company charge me a restocking fee and still not given me my refund back 0 
an awesome new look for fall 2000 1 
clever and a real crowdpleaserthis film still ranks among mickeys best films even after 80 wonderful years 1 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
we ordered some old classics and some new dishes after going there a few times and were sorely disappointed with everything 0 
i paid too much 0 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
this film and i use that word loosely is an insult to the moviegoing public 0 
my girlfriends veal was very bad 0 
so dont go there if you are looking for good food 0 
i heart this place 1 
delicious and i will absolutely be back 1 
it is just the sort of pap that is screened in the afternoon to punish the unemployed for not having jobs 0 
say bye bye to your tip lady 0 
i cant believe theres even a sequel to this 0 
a truly truly bad film 0 
i received my supposedly new motorola 375 and apparently there was not a match between the phone and the charger 0 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
it was attached to a gas station and that is rarely a good sign 0 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
ordered an appetizer and took 40 minutes and then the pizza another 10 minutes 0 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
poor construction 0 
seriously flavorful delights folks 1 
you need at least 3 mins to get to your phone book from the time you first turn on the phonebattery life is short 0 
exactly what i wanted 1 
no real improvement 0 
overall a great experience 1 
and the red curry had so much bamboo shoots and wasnt very tasty to me 0 
food was average at best 0 
freezes frequently4 0 
cool phone 1 
definitely a turn off for me i doubt ill be back unless someone else is buying 0 
new battery works great in phone 1 
this pair of headphones is the worst that i have ever had soundwise 0 
i believe every one should see this movie as i think few people outside of south africa understand its past and what is being attempted in the truth and reconciliation process 1 
youll love it 1 
i cant see how this movie can be an inspiration to anyone to come out or overcome fear and rejection 0 
if you check the directors filmography on this site you will see why this film didnt have a chance 0 
absolutel junk 0 
the descriptions said yum yum sauce and another said eel sauce yet another said spicy mayowell none of the rolls had sauces on them 0 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
there was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters 0 
service was fantastic 1 
avoid this one if you can 0 
someone shouldve invented this sooner 1 
i agree with jessica this movie is pretty bad 0 
its a fresh subtle and rather sublime effect 1 
my 810 score is mostly for the plot 1 
then a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use 0 
shrimp when i unwrapped it i live only 12 a mile from brushfire it was literally ice cold 0 
rating 010 grade z note the show is so bad that even mother of the cast pull her daughter out of the show 0 
when my mom and i got home she immediately got sick and she only had a few bites of salad 0 
both films are terrible but to the credit of the 1986 version it was watchable 0 
at least think to refill my water before i struggle to wave you over for 10 minutes 0 
the file browser offers all the options that one needshandsfree is great 1 
worked great 1 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
i am going to have to be the first to negatively review this product 0 
the best example of how dumb the writing is when its established that you can turn the zombiestudents back into humans by removing a necklace containing a piece of the meteorite 0 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
graphics is far from the best part of the game 0 
the shower area is outside so you can only rinse not take a full shower unless you dont mind being nude for everyone to see 0 
when a song could explain the emotions of the subjects better such as when jay adams unfortunate life was a subject of talk the song old man by neil young was played which evokes many emotions 1 
total waste of time 0 
but kevin spacey is an excellent verbal tsunami as buddy ackerman  and totally believable because he is a great actor 1 
it was too predictable even for a chick flick 0 
although i very much liked the look and sound of this place the actual experience was a bit disappointing 0 
definitely a turn off for me i doubt ill be back unless someone else is buying 0 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
the phone gets extremely hot 0 
never been to hard rock casino before will never ever step forward in it again 0 
very good stuff for the price 1 
elias koteasjack palance play good roles angelina is hot and gets nakedbilly drago appears in this and is cool as usual a cameo by sven ole thorsen helps make this a very enjoyable movie with good acting and a decent budget 1 
the problem was the script 0 
it sure does beat the nachos at the movies but i would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant 0 
none of it works just dont buy it 0 
but the premise of the film was so ridiculous that the president of the us 0 
the live music on fridays totally blows 0 
it is zillion times away from reality 0 
you will leave the theater wanting to go out and dance under the stars 1 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
they are so cool 1 
very true to shakespear and a must for all shakespear fans 1 
the live music on fridays totally blows 0 
as for the mains also uninspired 0 
i dont think it would hold it too securly on your belt 0 
probably not in a hurry to go back 0 
i own 2 of these cases and would order another 1 
ive missed numerous calls because of this reason 0 
today the graphics are crap 0 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
so they performed 1 
setup went very smoothly 1 
overall i wasnt very impressed with noca 0 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
i just saw this film and i recommend it 1 
its really easy 1 
the entire audience applauded at the conclusion of the film 1 
the color is even prettier than i thought it would be and the graphics are incredibly sharp 1 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
the results well are a shame 0 
if you do go see this movie bring a pillow or a girlfriendboyfriend to keep you occupied through out 0 
the lines the cuts the audio everything is wrong 0 
dont waste your money 0 
the performances are not improved by improvisation because the actors now have twice as much to worry about not only whether theyre delivering the line well but whether the line itself is any good 0 
i cant wait to go back 1 
filmiing was less expansive 0 
so good i am going to have to review this place twice once hereas a tribute to the place and once as a tribute to an event held here last night 1 
and i really did find them funny 1 
and i just love the colors 1 
as a courtroom drama its compelling as an indictment on the american justice system its frightening 1 
the soundtrack sucked 0 
it makes very strange ticking noises before it ends the call 0 
cool phone 1 
this early film from future goremeister lucio fulci is a very good addition to the giallo subgenre 1 
weve tried to like this place but after 10 times i think were done with them 0 
initially the local sites in the film which was filmed here in buffalo intrigued me 1 
it also took her forever to bring us the check when we asked for it 0 
hayao miyazakis latest and eighth film for studio ghibili gake no ue no ponyo ponyo on the cliff by the sea is a wonderfully fun and imaginative look at childhood 1 
each track commands sentiment actually contributing to the scenes and characters 1 
its a total package 1 
reaching for the bottom row is uncomfortable and the send and end keys are not where i expect them to be3 0 
i was seated immediately 1 
im very disappointed with my decision 0 
the pizza selections are good 1 
its uncomfortable and the sound quality is quite poor compared with the phone razr or with my previous wired headset that plugged into an lg 0 
the food was great as always compliments to the chef 1 
and there wasnt a single sour note struck actingwise either some surprisingly solid casting here 1 
your servers suck wait correction our server heimer sucked 0 
today was my first taste of a buldogis gourmet hot dog and i have to tell you it was more than i ever thought possible 1 
same evening him and i are both drastically sick 0 
the fact is this film is a wonderful heartwarming tale about two people chasing their dreams 1 
internet is excrutiatingly slow 0 
the telephone repair man was really funny and his reactions to the nuts and bitchy boss were truly genuine 1 
it is unusable in a moving car at freeway speed 0 
we received a white colored battery that goes dead after a couple hoursthe original used to last a week but still lasts longer than thereplacement 0 
their daily specials are always a hit with my group 1 
the movie had you on the edge of your seat and made you somewhat afraid to go to your car at the end of the night 1 
it kept getting worse and worse so now im officially done 0 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
never been to hard rock casino before will never ever step forward in it again 0 
i started this review with two stars but im editing it to give it only one 0 
this short film certainly pulls no punches 0 
i couldnt think of a better way to end the film but a smile on my face great way to wrap up an amazing film and trilogy 1 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
it was awesome 1 
anyway the plot flowed smoothly and the malebonding scenes were a hoot 1 
clear skype calls long battery life long range 1 
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1 
all the actors give a wonderful performance especially jennifer rubin as jamie harris who changes from the nervous starlet in the beginning through the strange events she is part of to the cool star 1 
it is super charged up for use as a small hybrid palmtopcameracellphone and excels in those roles 1 
problem is that the ear loops are made of weak material and break easily 0 
john garfield ann revere lilli plmer william conrad canada leeand filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screenjames wong howe 1 
great price also 1 
but when i check voice mail at night the keypad backlight turns off a few seconds into the first message and then im lost 0 
a very charming film with wonderful sentiment and heart 1 
i enjoyed it 1 
the phone was unusable and was not new 0 
would recommend this item 1 
these are the nicest restaurant owners ive ever come across 1 
to sum the film up breeders is a terrible cheaply made horror movie that should be avoided like the ebola virus 0 
tonight i had the elk filet specialand it sucked 0 
this is an unbelievable bargain 1 
the burger is good beef cooked just right 1 
the phone is sturdy and waterproof 1 
having trouble with volume 0 
i even dropped this phone into a stream and it was submerged for 15 seconds and it still works great 1 
black water is a thriller that manages to completely transcend its limitations its an indie flick by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience 1 
the food amazing 1 
very disappointed in accessoryone 0 
bad quality 0 
ive missed numerous calls because of this reason 0 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
heres where the movie really pied me off 0 
the secondary plot line is incomprehensible and its relation to the primary plot line is mystifying 0 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
the chips and sals a here is amazing 1 
it was awesome 1 
and the beans and rice were mediocre at best 0 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
i could not recommend these more 0 
im not impressed with the concept or the food 0 
my 5year old nokia 2160 from tracfone holds the charge a lot better than this 0 
very good quality though 1 
doesnt last long 0 
he was terrible 0 
the majority of the logitech earbud headsets failed 0 
it was that year however that reminded us that huston was still at the top of his game as evinced by his faithful adaptation of james joyces acclaimed novella the dead 1 
the incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film 1 
the film gives meaning to the phrase never in the history of human conflict has so much been owed by so many to so few 1 
this device is great in several situations1 1 
the food wasnt good 0 
i have never had such bland food which surprised me considering the article we read focused so much on their spices and flavor 0 
the desserts were a bit strange 0 
the ending is so so perfect youll shed a tear 1 
it was a drive to get there 0 
if you want a real scare rent this one 1 
the songs were the best and the muppets were so hilarious 1 
it was clear that she had the range and ability to pull off this part 1 
this results in the phone being either stuck at max volume or mute 0 
the earpiece on this is too large or too heavyit keeps falling out of my ear 0 
the ending is so so perfect youll shed a tear 1 
my drink was never empty and he made some really great menu suggestions 1 
i will continue to come here on ladies night andddd date night highly recommend this place to anyone who is in the area 1 
no complaints 1 
this results in the phone being either stuck at max volume or mute 0 
i would recommend this 1 
does not fit 0 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
i was disgusted because i was pretty sure that was human hair 0 
a very very very slowmoving aimless movie about a distressed drifting young man 0 
here in the wind and the lion we see a wonderful rendering of americas own imperial age 1 
youll love how thin it is 1 
the bus boy on the other hand was so rude 0 
but it picked up speed and got right to the point 1 
do not buy do not buyit sucks 0 
shes poised and amazing 1 
it quit working after id used it for about 18 months so i just purchased another one because this is the best headset ive ever owned 1 
terrible service 0 
omit watching this 0 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
you wont regret it 1 
the worst sappiest dialogue i could go on and on 0 
good service very clean and inexpensive to boot 1 
voice quality signal strength dropped calls 0 
improper description i had to return it 0 
this item worked great but it broke after 6 months of use 0 
i think i was one of the people who found this another one of roths pearls 1 
i really loved the story line and the poler bear was kinda cutebut if anyone has a question about fort steele just ask away 1 
drinks took close to 30 minutes to come out at one point 0 
we have gotten a lot of compliments on it 1 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
both films are terrible but to the credit of the 1986 version it was watchable 0 
the entire audience applauded at the conclusion of the film 1 
talk about useless customer service 0 
i love this thing 1 
steve martin delivers a really funny performance of a middleaged upper class uptight white guy 1 
it doesnt work in europe or asia 0 
i felt asleep the first time i watched it so i can recommend it for insomniacs 0 
went in for happy hour great list of wines 1 
great sound and service 1 
exceptionally bad 0 
i got to enjoy the seafood salad with a fabulous vinegrette 1 
i have been very happy with the 510 and have had no complaints from any one regarding my sound quality on their end 1 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
you never know if you pushed it hard enough or the right number of times for the function you want or not 0 
fans of the genre will be in heaven 1 
much better than the other ayce sushi place i went to in vegas 1 
fans of the genre will be in heaven 1 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
excellent hands free tool 1 
love this phone 1 
i am a fan of his this movie sucked really bad 0 
not a weekly haunt but definitely a place to come back to every once in a while 1 
bela lugosi was totally extraneous intoning odd lines 0 
the battery is working well as a replacement for the original that came with the phone over 2 years ago 1 
i hate those things as much as cheap quality black olives 0 
not too screamy not to masculine but just right 1 
there was so much hype over this phone that i assumed it was the best my mistake 0 
now this is a movie i really dislike 0 
we got sitting fairly fast but ended up waiting 40 minutes just to place our order another 30 minutes before the food arrived 0 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
juano hernandez an exceptional actor who played supporting roles in many films of the era is a proud black man who is accused of murdering a white man in the south 1 
these are the nicest restaurant owners ive ever come across 1 
service was good and the company was better 1 
service was very prompt 1 
service sucks 0 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
oh and i forgot to also mention the weird color effect it has on your phone 0 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
2 thumbs up 1 
waiter was a jerk 0 
you wont forget this movie 1 
the accompanied software is almost brilliant 1 
i think not again 0 
you wont regret it 1 
also makes it easier to hold on to 1 
this device is great in several situations1 1 
they refuse to refund or replace 0 
this was my first time and i cant wait until the next 1 
yet plantronincs continues to use the same flawed charger design 0 
the cinematography is simply stunning to say the least and the fx are nothing if not stateoftheart 1 
exceptionally bad 0 
the story is lame not interesting and never really explains the sinister origins of the puppets 0 
the worst sappiest dialogue i could go on and on 0 
i love the scream movies and all horror movies and this one ranks way up there 1 
now the pizza itself was good the peanut sauce was very tasty 1 
this frog phone charm is adorable and very eye catching 1 
if it were possible to give them zero stars theyd have it 0 
terrible service 0 
it defeats the purpose of a bluetooth headset 0 
this would not even be good as a made for tv flick 0 
overall a great experience 1 
after 3 months screen just went black all of a sudden 0 
the servers are not pleasant to deal with and they dont always honor pizza hut coupons 0 
the plot was the same as pretty much every other cheap horror 0 
went for lunch service was slow 0 
they do not care about the consumer one bit 0 
they work about 2 weeks then break 0 
it felt too light and tinny 0 
shes poised and amazing 1 
the characters are interesting and you want to find out more about them the longer the movie goes on and i think people will be surprised by who does and doesnt make it 1 
these are the central themes of the film and they are handled ineptly stereotypically and with no depth of imagination 0 
the battery is completely useless to me 0 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
great earpiece 1 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
there was no chemistry between ben affleck and sandra bullock in this film and i couldnt understand why he would consider even leaving his wifetobe for this chick that he supposedly was knocked out by 0 
but this movie is not funny considering the ridiculousness of it 0 
the ripped banana was not only ripped but petrified and tasteless 0 
the food is good 1 
clear skype calls long battery life long range 1 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
camerawork again bad 0 
i love their fries and their beans 1 
the plot has more holes than a pair of fishnet stockings and the direction and editing is astonishingly ham fisted 0 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
the volume for the ringer is real good you have choices how loud 1 
they have been around for years and carries the highest quality of antiglare screen protector that i have found to date 1 
trouble is the writing and directing make it impossible to establish those things that make a movie watchable like character story theme and so on 0 
plus its only 8 bucks 1 
i would give this television series a 10 plus if i could 1 
i would highly recommend this 1 
great product and price 1 
my 810 score is mostly for the plot 1 
just dont know why they were so slow 0 
i get absolutely horrible reception in my apartment where with other phones i have not had this problem 0 
just really good so far probably the best bt headset i have ever had 1 
comfortable nice range good battery life 1 
his use of the colours of the french flag in the three films was nothing short of incredible every shot every scene was like a work of art 1 
the charger arrived within the promised timeframe but it did not work 0 
im probably one of the few people to ever go to ians and not like it 0 
the owner used to work at nobu so this place is really similar for half the price 1 
w810i is just superb 1 
i tried talking real loud but shouting on the telephone gets old and i was still told it wasnt great 0 
funny clever hip just like prays previous film hype 1 
i was very excited to get this headset because i thought it was really cute 1 
this movie is bad 0 
we watched our waiter pay a lot more attention to other tables and ignore us 0 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
it has a very good plot it holds your complete attention the acting is superb tom wilkinson was fantastic and emily watson was also very good 1 
coming here is like experiencing an underwhelming relationship where both parties cant wait for the other person to ask to break up 0 
it was horrendous 0 
the story which was told so eloquently by francis ford coppola 25 years earlier really unfolds gradually and leaves room for the characters to develop 1 
the ambience is wonderful and there is music playing 1 
ive never been more insulted or felt disrespected 0 
i seriously cannot believe that the owner has so many unexperienced employees that all are running around like chickens with their heads cut off 0 
it is cheap and it feel and look just as cheap 0 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
it is light has plenty of battery capacity and is very confortable to wear for somewhat extended periods of time 1 
i liked the patio and the service was outstanding 1 
on three different occasions i asked for well done or medium well and all three times i got the bloodiest piece of meat on my plate 0 
ive never been treated so bad 0 
there are so many problems i dont know where to start 0 
ill give this film 10 out of 10 1 
my first visit to hiro was a delight 1 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
i really recommend this faceplates since it looks very nice elegant and cool 1 
yes its that bad 0 
this was my first time and i cant wait until the next 1 
their frozen margaritas are way too sugary for my taste 0 
the story starts too fast with absolutely no suspense or buildup in the slightest 0 
awesome service and food 1 
not good enough for the price 0 
i had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get some relief 0 
do not purchase this phone 0 
cute quaint simple honest 1 
they do not last forever but is not overly expensive to replaceeasy to operate and the sound is much better than others i have tried 1 
i had to wait over 30 minutes to get my drink and longer to get 2 arepas 0 
my side greek salad with the greek dressing was so tasty and the pita and hummus was very refreshing 1 
the wind and the lion is well written and superbly acted 1 
totally different with loads of understatement and black comedy this is a film few get to see but those who do will remember it 1 
very disappointed in accessoryone 0 
great price also 1 
the chips and salsa were really good the salsa was very fresh 1 
great place to eat reminds me of the little mom and pop shops in the san francisco bay area 1 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
i didnt want the clip going over the top of my ear causing discomfort 0 
the food was terrible 0 
cinematography noteworthy including fine views of barcelona and its famed gaudi towers 1 
ambience is perfect 1 
you wont be disappointed 1 
do not waste your time 0 
the songs were the best and the muppets were so hilarious 1 
ive had this for nearly 2 years and it has worked great for me 1 
this phone works great 1 
as an earlier review noted plug in this charger and nothing happens 0 
great phone 1 
cant upload ringtones from a third party 0 
go watch it 1 
yet plantronincs continues to use the same flawed charger design 0 
for that its worth checking out 1 
lastly the mozzarella sticks they were the best thing we ordered 1 
the budget was evidently very limited 0 
does not work 0 
it has kept up very well 1 
both of them were truly unbelievably good and i am so glad we went back 1 
i was deeply impressed with the character he played 1 
the chips and salsa were really good the salsa was very fresh 1 
if only someone involved with it knew how to string together narrative 0 
it was equally awful 0 
the plastic breaks really easy on this clip 0 
i am very impressed with this headset from plantronics 1 
the aerial scenes were welldone 1 
black water is a thriller that manages to completely transcend its limitations its an indie flick by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience 1 
20th century foxs road house 1948 is not only quite a silly noir but is an implausible unmitigated bore of a movie 0 
i vomited in the bathroom mid lunch 0 
i as well wouldve given godfathers zero stars if possible 0 
and there wasnt a single sour note struck actingwise either some surprisingly solid casting here 1 
it doesnt make you look cool 0 
the phone gets extremely hot 0 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
so dont go there if you are looking for good food 0 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
and the chef was generous with his time even came around twice so we can take pictures with him 1 
the 12 mega pixel camera being a part of a phone is reasonably good7 1 
i would recommend this 1 
it is practically useless and did not add any kind of boost to my reception after i bought it 0 
however after seeing the short again after about 25 years i was amazed at how timeless the film actually is 1 
the death row scenes were entirely unmoving 0 
probably never coming back and wouldnt recommend it 0 
this place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver 0 
overall the film is interesting and thoughtprovoking 1 
on the ground right next to our table was a large smeared beensteppedinandtrackedeverywhere pile of green bird poop 0 
if it was to turn my good day feeling into a night of disturbing memories than i guess he succeeded 0 
very satisifed with that 1 
and the red curry had so much bamboo shoots and wasnt very tasty to me 0 
this pda rocks 1 
absolutely great 1 
plantronics bluetooth excelent buy 1 
i would have given no star if i was able 0 
the calls drop the phone comes on and off at will the screen goes black and the worst of all it stops ringing intermittently 0 
often the dialogue doesnt really follow from one line to another or fit the surroundings 0 
of all the dishes the salmon was the best but all were great 1 
appetite instantly gone 0 
1010 1 
i get absolutely horrible reception in my apartment where with other phones i have not had this problem 0 
i was seated immediately 1 
was not happy 0 
using all earpieces left or right this thing will not stay on my ear 0 
it does everything the description said it would 1 
always a great time at dos gringos 1 
ill definitely be in soon again 1 
this film and i use that word loosely is an insult to the moviegoing public 0 
i loved it 1 
a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it 1 
delicious nyc bagels good selections of cream cheese real lox with capers even 1 
its also great to see that renowned silent screenwriter frances marion hasnt missed a step going from silent to sound 1 
howeverthe riingtones are not the best and neither are the games 0 
lucy bell is so much higher than this crap and for her to sink this low is quite depressing 0 
my girlfriends veal was very bad 0 
i had the chicken pho and it tasted very bland 0 
ive missed numerous calls because of this reason 0 
the first thing that happened was that the tracking was off 0 
meredith m was better than all right 1 
up there with the best of melville 1 
this is hands down the best phone ive ever had 1 
after trying many many handsfree gadgets this is the one that finally works well 1 
so in a nutshell 1 the restaraunt smells like a combination of a dirty fish market and a sewer 0 
unfortunately it did not work 0 
when i received my pita it was huge it did have a lot of meat in it so thumbs up there 1 
the holster that arrived did not match the photo in the ad 0 
great software for motorolas 1 
highly recommend for any one who has a blue tooth phone 1 
i went to bachi burger on a friends recommendation and was not disappointed 1 
all i have to say is the food was amazing 1 
i rate this movie 910 1 
this place is like chipotle but better 1 
food was really good and i got full petty fast 1 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
disappointing accessory from a good manufacturer 0 
this place is handsdown one of the best places to eat in the phoenix metro area 1 
my breakfast was perpared great with a beautiful presentation of 3 giant slices of toast lightly dusted with powdered sugar 1 
i love all the features and form factor 1 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
waste of money 0 
good service very clean and inexpensive to boot 1 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
not a good bargain 0 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
verizon tech support walked my through a few procedures none of which worked and i ended up having to do a hard reset wiping out all my data 0 
much more interesting more action more suspense and less of the unneeded controversy 1 
and generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode 0 
shrimp when i unwrapped it i live only 12 a mile from brushfire it was literally ice cold 0 
even in my bmw 3 series which is fairly quiet i have trouble hearing what the other person is saying 0 
the turkey and roast beef were bland 0 
down the drain because of a weak snap 0 
a film not easily forgotten 1 
then our food came out disappointment ensued 0 
this movie is greatespecially if you enjoy visual arts 1 
its a great tool for entertainment communication and data managementoh be sure to use activesync 42 for optimal data synchronization results 1 
great case and price 1 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
i am so tired of clichés that is just lazy writing and here they come in thick and fast 0 
sending it back 0 
we ordered some old classics and some new dishes after going there a few times and were sorely disappointed with everything 0 
avoid at all cost 0 
while i managed to bend the leaf spring back in place the metal now has enough stress that it will break on the next drop 0 
nice sound 1 
excellent hands free tool 1 
their steaks are 100 recommended 1 
loved itfriendly servers great food wonderful and imaginative menu 1 
i as well wouldve given godfathers zero stars if possible 0 
bland and flavorless is a good way of describing the barely tepid meat 0 
our server was very nice and even though he looked a little overwhelmed with all of our needs he stayed professional and friendly until the end 1 
for that its worth checking out 1 
actually the graphics were good at the time 1 
you can watch them preparing the delicious food 1 
long whiny and pointless 0 
its a sad movie but very good 1 
and generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode 0 
exactly what i wanted 1 
all things considered a job very well done 1 
these are the central themes of the film and they are handled ineptly stereotypically and with no depth of imagination 0 
you could drive a semi truck into these holes 0 
this was such an awesome movie that i bought it off of ebay 1 
i really do recommend this place you can go wrong with this donut place 1 
its like a bad two hour tv movie 0 
im trying to return it for a refund 0 
lordy the khao soi is a dish that is not to be missed for curry lovers 1 
why was this film made 0 
it is perfect for a sitdown family meal or get together with a few friends 1 
not nearly as good looking as the amazon picture makes it look 0 
recommend with confidence 1 
i had heard good things about this place but it exceeding every hope i could have dreamed of 1 
but the service was beyond bad 0 
very good quality though 1 
will not be back 0 
the instruction manual is lacking 0 
my brother in law who works at the mall ate here same day and guess what he was sick all night too 0 
why was this film made 0 
i am going to have to be the first to negatively review this product 0 
everything about it is fine and reasonable for the price ie 1 
i found this place by accident and i could not be happier 1 
this short film certainly pulls no punches 0 
highly recommended for all ages although the younger set will probably not appreciate some of the more subtle references they will certainly appreciate one galley scene in particular 1 
overall a great experience 1 
anyways the food was definitely not filling at all and for the price you pay you should expect more 0 
the best phone in market 1 
i really wanted the plantronics 510 to be the right one but it has too many issues for methe good 0 
it felt too light and tinny 0 
chinese forgeries abound 0 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
after charging overnight these batteries work great 1 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
i did not expect this to be so good 1 
wow loved this place 1 
today the graphics are crap 0 
i dressed up to be treated so rudely 0 
when i received my pita it was huge it did have a lot of meat in it so thumbs up there 1 
the lead man is charismafree 0 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
what a mistake 0 
so they performed 1 
in my house i was getting dropped coverage upstairs and no coverage in my basement 0 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
poor talk time performance 0 
if you check the directors filmography on this site you will see why this film didnt have a chance 0 
there is so much good food in vegas that i feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to rice and company 0 
no plot whatsoever 0 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
very good though 1 
not recommended 0 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
i was very disappointed 0 
appears to actually outperform the original battery from china that came with my v325i 1 
then a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use 0 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
great phone 1 
what a big waste of time 0 
the only thing that i think could improve is the sound leaks out from the headset 0 
fans of the genre will be in heaven 1 
the movie is littered with overt racial slurs towards the black cast members and in return the whites are depicted as morons and boobs 0 
today was my first taste of a buldogis gourmet hot dog and i have to tell you it was more than i ever thought possible 1 
the cable looks so thin and flimsy it is scary 0 
not recommended 0 
do not make the same mistake as me 0 
needless to say i wont be going back anytime soon 0 
the food is good 1 
it was attached to a gas station and that is rarely a good sign 0 
it fits my ear well and is comfortable on 1 
poorly contstruct hinge 0 
the only thing i did like was the prime rib and dessert section 1 
highquality chicken on the chicken caesar salad 1 
despite how hard i rate businesses its actually rare for me to give a 1 star 0 
overall i was not impressed and would not go back 0 
if you are looking for a good quality motorola headset keep looking this isnt it 0 
i believe that pitch black was done well 1 
all of the main players are mesmerising 1 
omit watching this 0 
plantronics bluetooth excelent buy 1 
frankly after cotton club and unfaithful it was kind of embarrassing to watch lane and gere in this film because it is bad 0 
what a piece of junk i lose more calls on this phone 0 
a happy wonderful feel good ending 1 
this film has no redeeming features 0 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
it was just too horrible 0 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
kris kristoffersen is good in this movie and really makes a difference 1 
could not get strong enough signal 0 
i am also very happy with the price 1 
there is no plot or storyline 0 
the real killer is the volume and of course it breaking 0 
i purcashed this for the car charger and it does not work 0 
bad fit way too big 0 
unreliable im giving up 0 
the acting helps the writing along very well maybe the idiotsavant sister could have been played better and it is a real joy to watch 1 
comes with a strong light that you can use to light up your camera shots and even flash sos signals seriously 1 
i love this bluetooth 1 
drinks took close to 30 minutes to come out at one point 0 
i love the camera its really pretty good quality 1 
the calls drop the phone comes on and off at will the screen goes black and the worst of all it stops ringing intermittently 0 
unfortunately cover girl is an example of how hollywood used to exploit women for financial gain 0 
wow very spicy but delicious 1 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
mic doesnt work 0 
their frozen margaritas are way too sugary for my taste 0 
it has everything i need and i couldnt ask for more 1 
my first visit to hiro was a delight 1 
service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is vegas and located inside the crystals shopping mall by aria 1 
i saw mirrormask last night and it was an unsatisfactory experience 0 
the puppets look really cheesy not in a good way like in the puppet master 80s flicks 0 
i love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it 1 
i wish i could return the unit and get back my money 0 
the performances are real and gripping the crocdodile is extremely well done indeed if the black water website is to be believed thats because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous 1 
adapter does not provide enough charging current 0 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
we made the drive all the way from north scottsdale and i was not one bit disappointed 1 
juano hernandez an exceptional actor who played supporting roles in many films of the era is a proud black man who is accused of murdering a white man in the south 1 
food was really boring 0 
im probably one of the few people to ever go to ians and not like it 0 
trying to make a call on these is an exercise in frustration 0 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
the plot simply rumbles on like a machine desperately depending on the addition of new scenes 0 
i got the aluminum case for my new palm vx and it worked really wellit has protected my handheld perfectly so far 1 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
at around 4 pm i bought it at around 8pm i started to watch at around 815pm i fast forwarded the remaining film to see if there was anything left watchable for a human being with a brain but there wasnt 0 
very good product well made 1 
i can take a little bad service but the food sucks 0 
the acting helps the writing along very well maybe the idiotsavant sister could have been played better and it is a real joy to watch 1 
never heard of any of them except cole who was totally unbelievable in the part 0 
i did not bother contacting the company for few dollar product but i learned the lesson that i should not have bought this form online anyway 0 
the only thing worse than taylors acting was stanwycks singing 0 
items stated as included from the description are not included 0 
im probably one of the few people to ever go to ians and not like it 0 
this greedy corporation will never see another dime from me 0 
this allows the possibility of double booking for the same date and time after the first 0 
ray charles is legendary 1 
really awful 0 
call me a nut but i think this is one of the best movies ever 1 
the fries were not hot and neither was my burger 0 
its a gloriously fun fast paced and fairly accurate portrayal of the night of a raver 1 
and the red curry had so much bamboo shoots and wasnt very tasty to me 0 
that just screams legit in my booksomethats also pretty rare here in vegas 1 
if i take a picture the battery drops a bar and starts beeping letting me know its dieing 0 
rating 010 grade z note the show is so bad that even mother of the cast pull her daughter out of the show 0 
the dining space is tiny but elegantly decorated and comfortable 1 
the mic there is a joke and the volume is quite low 0 
im still trying to get over how bad it was 0 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
the cable looks so thin and flimsy it is scary 0 
im glad i found this product on amazon it is hard to find it wasnt high priced 1 
then our food came out disappointment ensued 0 
problem is that the ear loops are made of weak material and break easily 0 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
it was so cool 1 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
ive tried several different earpieces for my cell phone and this jabra one is the first one ive found that fits my ear comfortably 1 
worst customer service 0 
and the chef was generous with his time even came around twice so we can take pictures with him 1 
good case 1 
battery life is also great 1 
its the best headset i have used 1 
the screen does get smudged easily because it touches your ear and face 0 
check it out 1 
otherwise easy to install and use clear sound 1 
awesome service and food 1 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
the directing seems too pretentious 0 
i dont have to be an accountant to know im getting screwed 0 
battery life is real good 1 
first time going but i think i will quickly become a regular 1 
really good product 1 
maybe there would be a reasonable explanation for this atrocity 0 
unfortunately it will not recharge my iphone 4s despite connecting it from multiple power sources imac external battery wall outlet etc 0 
the cashier had no care what so ever on what i had to say it still ended up being wayyy overpriced 0 
the fact is this film is a wonderful heartwarming tale about two people chasing their dreams 1 
everything was good and tasty 1 
i am very impressed with this headset from plantronics 1 
raw and sublimely moving 1 
updatewent back for a second time and it was still just as amazing 1 
will never ever go back 0 
total waste of time 0 
there is no real plot 0 
never heard of any of them except cole who was totally unbelievable in the part 0 
gets the job done 1 
great product fast shipping 1 
this gets a 1 out of 10 simply because theres nothing lower 0 
just really good so far probably the best bt headset i have ever had 1 
it was so cool 1 
these are the central themes of the film and they are handled ineptly stereotypically and with no depth of imagination 0 
the chips and sals a here is amazing 1 
this is the kind of money that is wasted properly 1 
nicest chinese restaurant ive been in a while 1 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
i recommend igo to anyone with different brand cell phonesmp3 players in the family 1 
hayao miyazakis latest and eighth film for studio ghibili gake no ue no ponyo ponyo on the cliff by the sea is a wonderfully fun and imaginative look at childhood 1 
this convention never worked well in the past and certainly doesnt work here 0 
the pairing of the two devices was so easy it barely took a couple minutes before i started making calls with the voice dialing feature 1 
this movie is bad 0 
the igo chargers and tips are really great 1 
dont bother coming here 0 
i am going to have to be the first to negatively review this product 0 
he was extremely rude and really there are so many other restaurants i would love to dine at during a weekend in vegas 0 
beware this is not a trashy cult movie this is trash period 0 
waiter was a jerk 0 
this is hands down the best phone ive ever had 1 
wont ever go here again 0 
for that price i can think of a few place i would have much rather gone 0 
i use this product in a motor control center where there is a lot of high voltage humming from the equipment and it works great 1 
im happy about this purchase good quality and low price 1 
best tater tots in the southwest 1 
very tough and very short on flavor 0 
watching washing machine twirling around wouldnt hurt your eyes as much as this show 0 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
overall the film is interesting and thoughtprovoking 1 
other than that the leather is nice and soft the fit is very tight the cut out for the face is a good shape 1 
not recommended 0 
setup couldnt have been simpler 1 
and those baby owls were adorable 1 
victor mclaglen was even bad and brian donlevy was almost unrecognizable 0 
i received my orders well within the shipping timeframe everything was in good working order and overall i am very excited to have this source 1 
the worst phone from samsungcrap this crappy samsung e715 is the worst i have ever seeen 0 
judith light is one of my favorite actresses and i think she does a superb job in this film 1 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
by far the best cheesecurds we have ever had 1 
good quality 1 
these were so good we ordered them twice 1 
the jamaican mojitos are delicious 1 
i saw mirrormask last night and it was an unsatisfactory experience 0 
i love it 1 
on the ground right next to our table was a large smeared beensteppedinandtrackedeverywhere pile of green bird poop 0 
a week later after i activated it it suddenly died 0 
however after seeing the short again after about 25 years i was amazed at how timeless the film actually is 1 
great place to eat reminds me of the little mom and pop shops in the san francisco bay area 1 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
the selection was probably the worst ive seen in vegasthere was none 0 
keep up the good work amazon 1 
friends pasta also bad he barely touched it 0 
its really easy 1 
the fried rice was dry as well 0 
i have been to very few places to eat that under no circumstances would i ever return to and this tops the list 0 
editing the editing of this film was phenomenal in my opinion 1 
you wont regret it 1 
i had absolutely no problem with this headset linking to my 8530 blackberry curve 1 
to sum the film up breeders is a terrible cheaply made horror movie that should be avoided like the ebola virus 0 
plantronics bluetooth excelent buy 1 
the delivery was on time 1 
i hate those things as much as cheap quality black olives 0 
this is such a fun and funny movie 1 
very slow at seating even with reservation 0 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
this movie creates its own universe and is fascinating in every way 1 
the film is well paced understated and one of the best courtroom documentaries ive seen 1 
all in all i can assure you ill be back 1 
i would not recommend this place 0 
the buffet at bellagio was far from what i anticipated 0 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
good show samsung 1 
maybe there would be a reasonable explanation for this atrocity 0 
the bartender was also nice 1 
ambience is perfect 1 
i always order from the vegetarian menu during dinner which has a wide array of options to choose from 1 
i promise they wont disappoint 1 
1 long lasting battery you dont have to recharge it as frequentyly as some of the flip phones2 0 
this was reflected not only in the cast but also in the belowpar script which borrowed much from the earlier classic 0 
i wouldnt return 0 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
honeslty it didnt taste that fresh 0 
this place deserves no stars 0 
the nano stated itmy son was dissapointed 0 
god and i can never get that 90 minutes back 0 
i really hope the team behind this movie makes more movies and that they will continue to do so in their own some kinda weird style 1 
i will not return 0 
it is an insane game 1 
its a long time since i was so entertained by a movie 1 
the acting is beyond abysmal 0 
and considering the two of us left there very full and happy for about 20 you just cant go wrong 1 
so in a nutshell 1 the restaraunt smells like a combination of a dirty fish market and a sewer 0 
the instructions didnt explain that a microphone jack could be used 0 
buyerbe very careful 0 
i even dropped this phone into a stream and it was submerged for 15 seconds and it still works great 1 
i was very excited to get this headset because i thought it was really cute 1 
this movie creates its own universe and is fascinating in every way 1 
however after finally watching this film i realized that not only had i had a closed mind to the brilliance it depicts i also found myself watching it over and over again 1 
however after finally watching this film i realized that not only had i had a closed mind to the brilliance it depicts i also found myself watching it over and over again 1 
on a positive note our server was very attentive and provided great service 1 
great phone 1 
i have to jiggle the plug to get it to line up right to get decent volume 0 
the burger had absolutely no flavor the meat itself was totally bland the burger was overcooked and there was no charcoal flavor 0 
i never walked out of a movie faster 0 
i can think of no other film where something vitally important occurs every other minute 1 
battery has no life 0 
back to good bbq lighter fare reasonable pricing and tell the public they are back to the old ways 1 
the budget was evidently very limited 0 
i was totally fascinated by the music the dancing everything 1 
there was hardly any meat 0 
razr battery good buy 1 
i just wanted to leave 0 
lets start with all the problemsthe acting especially from the lead professor was very very bad 0 
the new characters werent all that memorable and i found myself forgetting who was who 0 
couldnt ask for a more satisfying meal 1 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
nice case feels good in your hands 1 
does not fit 0 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
i would not recommend this place 0 
i saw this short film on hbo the other day and absolutely loved it 1 
the waiter wasnt helpful or friendly and rarely checked on us 0 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
this results in the phone being either stuck at max volume or mute 0 
still waiting im sure this item would work well if i ever recieve it 0 
this place is good 1 
i had absolutely no problem with this headset linking to my 8530 blackberry curve 1 
what makes this story different are the terrific production values faultless photography composition and editing the terrific casting the underappreciated brian keith playing a bully teddy and vivid history 1 
i highly recommend this modest priced cellular phone 1 
barney is definitely super de duper 1 
i hate those things as much as cheap quality black olives 0 
we had 7 at our table and the service was pretty fast 1 
well packaged arrived on time and works as intended 1 
considering the relations off screen between taylor and stanwyck it was surprising how little chemistry there was on screen between the two of them 0 
i must say i have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again 1 
this film has no redeeming features 0 
food was average at best 0 
my side greek salad with the greek dressing was so tasty and the pita and hummus was very refreshing 1 
emily watsons character is very strong and she has only to give a quick glance and you understand everything 1 
she ordered a toasted english muffin that came out untoasted 0 
i probably would not go here again 0 
i really wanted the plantronics 510 to be the right one but it has too many issues for methe good 0 
im big fan of rpg games too but this movie its a disgrace to any selfrespecting rpger there is 0 
thank you for such great service 1 
very good quality though 1 
after a year the battery went completely dead on my headset 0 
the vegetables are so fresh and the sauce feels like authentic thai 1 
bt50 battery junk 0 
its just painful 0 
the only possible way this movie could be redeemed would be as mst3k fodder 0 
service is also cute 1 
i really hope the team behind this movie makes more movies and that they will continue to do so in their own some kinda weird style 1 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
if the food isnt bad enough for you then enjoy dealing with the worlds worstannoying drunk people 0 
it always cuts out and makes a beep beep beep sound then says signal failed 0 
good case 1 
battery has no life 0 
love this product 1 
by this time our side of the restaurant was almost empty so there was no excuse 0 
the foreigner is not worth one second of your time 0 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
i wish i could enter negative values admins 0 
before i go in to why i gave a 1 star rating please know that this was my third time eating at bachi burger before writing a review 0 
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
unfortunately it did not work 0 
a great film by a great director 1 
being a 90s child i truly enjoyed this show and i can proudly say that i enjoyed it big time and even more than the classical wb cartoons 1 
as always the evening was wonderful and the food delicious 1 
yet plantronincs continues to use the same flawed charger design 0 
you need two hands to operate the screenthis software interface is decade old and cannot compete with new software designs 0 
to my disbelief each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods i have ever tasted 0 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
i dont know exactly what it is about this movie but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our familys memories 1 
the seller is very understanding and patient i would definitely buy from them again 1 
the phone crashed completely and now i have to get it replaced 0 
the volume for the ringer is real good you have choices how loud 1 
love this phone 1 
this scene is very strong and unpleasant 0 
service is friendly and inviting 1 
highly recommend for any one who has a blue tooth phone 1 
the story which was told so eloquently by francis ford coppola 25 years earlier really unfolds gradually and leaves room for the characters to develop 1 
their daily specials are always a hit with my group 1 
seems like a good quick place to grab a bite of some familiar pub food but do yourself a favor and look elsewhere 0 
the incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film 1 
i guess that nobody at the network that aired this dribble watched it before putting it on 0 
it was a waste of my money 0 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
while i managed to bend the leaf spring back in place the metal now has enough stress that it will break on the next drop 0 
there is however some pretty good acting at least for this type of film 1 
there is simply no excuse for something this poorly done 0 
it was too predictable even for a chick flick 0 
the worst phone from samsungcrap this crappy samsung e715 is the worst i have ever seeen 0 
poor reliability 0 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
same problem as others have mentioned 0 
its like a bad two hour tv movie 0 
all i can do is whine on the internet so here it goesthe more i use the thing the less i like it 0 
overall a great experience 1 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
very disappointed in accessoryone 0 
sound quality on both end is excellent i use headset to call my wife and ask my wife to use headset to call me 2 1 
much better than the other ayce sushi place i went to in vegas 1 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
i seriously cannot believe that the owner has so many unexperienced employees that all are running around like chickens with their heads cut off 0 
everything about this film is simply incredible 1 
amazon sucks 0 
great phone 1 
the only downside is the service 0 
our server was very nice and even though he looked a little overwhelmed with all of our needs he stayed professional and friendly until the end 1 
its fits like a glove and is strong secure and durable 1 
oh the charger seems to work fine 1 
your servers suck wait correction our server heimer sucked 0 
cute quaint simple honest 1 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
how this piece of trash was ever released is beyond me the acting the story the characters the supposedly special effects etcits all wrong 0 
the opening sequence of this gem is a classic and the cat n mouse games that follow are a delight to watch 1 
it was awesome 1 
if you have several dozen or several hundred contacts then imagine the fun of sending each of them one by one 0 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
i really liked that 1 
we arent ones to make a scene at restaurants but i just dont get itdefinitely lost the love after this one 0 
they are so cool 1 
the basic premise is wasted since it is sidelined by the inexplicable focus on the documentary crew 0 
would not go back 0 
will never ever go back 0 
it was a great phone 1 
very good lunch spot 1 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
i found this move beautiful enjoyable and uplifting 1 
i cannot make calls at certain places 0 
needless to say i wont be going back anytime soon 0 
if you are razr owneryou must have this 1 
think it over when you plan to own this onethis sure is the last moto phone for me 0 
seriously flavorful delights folks 1 
tom wilkinson broke my heart at the end and everyone elses judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike 1 
great price too 1 
your servers suck wait correction our server heimer sucked 0 
this allows the possibility of double booking for the same date and time after the first 0 
very displeased 0 
but the service was beyond bad 0 
internet is excrutiatingly slow 0 
all in all ha long bay was a bit of a flop 0 
hitchcock is a great director 1 
and sometimes it was so embarrassing that i had to look away 0 
it does everything the description said it would 1 
could not get strong enough signal 0 
the waitress and manager are so friendly 1 
the voice recognition thru the handset is excellent 1 
1 hour 54 minutes of sheer tedium melodrama and horrible acting a mess of a script and a sinking feeling of good lord what were they thinking 0 
it is an hour and half waste of time following a bunch of very pretty high schoolers whine and cry about life 0 
walked in and the place smelled like an old grease trap and only 2 others there eating 0 
shrimp when i unwrapped it i live only 12 a mile from brushfire it was literally ice cold 0 
everything from acting to cinematography was solid 1 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
and finally after all that we get to an ending that wouldve been great had it been handled by competent people and not jerry falwell 0 
sounds good reasonably priced and effective its that simple 1 
one thing i hate is the mode set button at the side 0 
pretty good beer selection too 1 
very disappointing 0 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
painful on the ear 0 
star trek v the final frontier is the worst in the series 0 
the ending is so so perfect youll shed a tear 1 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
i believe that pitch black was done well 1 
this item worked great but it broke after 6 months of use 0 
great phone 1 
linked to my phone without effort 1 
however after finally watching this film i realized that not only had i had a closed mind to the brilliance it depicts i also found myself watching it over and over again 1 
this greedy corporation will never see another dime from me 0 
this movie is greatespecially if you enjoy visual arts 1 
i put the latest os on it v115g and it now likes to slow to a crawl and lock up every once in a while 0 
often the dialogue doesnt really follow from one line to another or fit the surroundings 0 
i got this phone on reccomendation from a relative and im glad i did 1 
best of all is the rotating feature very helpful 1 
i swung in to give them a try but was deeply disappointed 0 
poorly contstruct hinge 0 
the songs were the best and the muppets were so hilarious 1 
crostini that came with the salad was stale 0 
amazon sucks 0 
every time he opened his mouth you expect to hear you see kids pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show 0 
and the chef was generous with his time even came around twice so we can take pictures with him 1 
it makes very strange ticking noises before it ends the call 0 
the shrimp tender and moist 1 
the most annoying thing about cover girl is the way in which rita hayworth is put up on a pedestal 0 
hence the whole story lacks a certain energy 0 
this really is how vegas fine dining used to be right down to the menus handed to the ladies that have no prices listed 1 
i wouldnt return 0 
the best scene in the movie was when gerardo is trying to find a song that keeps running through his head 1 
i love this device 1 
it is practically useless and did not add any kind of boost to my reception after i bought it 0 
once your food arrives its meh 0 
i probably would not go here again 0 
john wayne did an incredible job for being so young in the movie industry 1 
item does not match picture 0 
insults profound deuchebaggery and had to go outside for a smoke break while serving just to solidify it 0 
i cant use this case because the smell is disgusting 0 
the phone loads super 1 
however i recently watched the whole thing again on dvd and i was completely struck by how extremely stupid the storyline was how it contained holes inconsistencies and frankly a whole lot of crap and how horrid the dancing was 0 
this movie is bad 0 
great steak great sides great wine amazing desserts 1 
a bit predictable 0 
lasted one day and then blew up 0 
i would avoid this place if you are staying in the mirage 0 
the scripting of the subtle comedy is unmatched by any movie in recent years 1 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
my sanyo has survived dozens of drops on blacktop without ill effect 1 
i am very happy 1 
1 hour 54 minutes of sheer tedium melodrama and horrible acting a mess of a script and a sinking feeling of good lord what were they thinking 0 
things happen characters personalities change plot twists occur for no real reason other than that script calls for it 0 
unfortunately it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees 0 
arrived quickly and much less expensive than others being sold 1 
this is a great deal 1 
clear crisp sound 1 
ive had this bluetoooth headset for some time now and still not comfortable with the way it fits on the ear 0 
maybe there would be a reasonable explanation for this atrocity 0 
worse theres an incredibly weak subplot thrown in that follows a little band of latterday mansonites as they go after a reporter whos working on a story on the anniversary of the killings 0 
superb phone on a great network 1 
very satisifed with that 1 
i got to enjoy the seafood salad with a fabulous vinegrette 1 
very nice and relaxing late night viewing 1 
i took back my money and got outta there 0 
i like design and look of jabra behing the ear headsets and 5020 is pretty comfortible to wear 24 hours a day without pain in the ear 1 
i still maintain that monkeys shouldnt make headphones we just obviously dont share enough dna to copy the design over to humans 0 
great product 1 
either way it sucks 0 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
to call this movie a drama is ridiculous 0 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
i tried the cape cod ravoli chickenwith cranberrymmmm 1 
for that its worth checking out 1 
good servicecheck 1 
there is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again 0 
dont make the same mistake that i did and please dont buy this phone 0 
the best example of how dumb the writing is when its established that you can turn the zombiestudents back into humans by removing a necklace containing a piece of the meteorite 0 
some applause should be given to the prelude however 1 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
it lasts less than 3o minutes if i actually try to use the phonemy wife has the same phone with the same problem 0 
great place to eat reminds me of the little mom and pop shops in the san francisco bay area 1 
the flat reenactments dont hold your attention because they are emotionally adrift and stagy 0 
cant get the software to work with my computer 0 
this isnt a small family restaurant this is a fine dining establishment 1 
the warmth it generates is in contrast to its austere backdrop 1 
great pizza and salads 1 
which is precisely why i am giving it such a bad review 0 
i could not understand what kind of idiot would produce this mess in the first place not to mention several season 0 
very disappointed and wondered how it could be in the oscar shortlist 0 
poor talk time performance 0 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
we wont be going back 0 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
this film tries to be a serious and sophisticated thrillerhorror flick and it fails miserably 0 
so far so good 1 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
this is an unbelievable bargain 1 
i was able to do voice dialing in the car with no problem 1 
the kids are very cool too 1 
dont waste your money 0 
i wasnt the least bit interested 0 
rude inconsiderate management 0 
bad characters bad story and bad acting 0 
the basic premise is wasted since it is sidelined by the inexplicable focus on the documentary crew 0 
the best phone in market 1 
their frozen margaritas are way too sugary for my taste 0 
so far it has worked like a charm 1 
adapter does not provide enough charging current 0 
this is an outstanding little restaurant with some of the best food i have ever tasted 1 
ill even say it again  this is torture 0 
i love this phone it is very handy and has a lot of features 1 
the presentation of the food was awful 0 
dont buy it 0 
avoid at all costs 0 
once your food arrives its meh 0 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
disappointed 0 
this is a great phone 1 
im not really sure how joeys was voted best hot dog in the valley by readers of phoenix magazine 0 
utter crap sound quality is terrible 0 
it is so small and you dont even realize that it is there after a while of getting used to it 1 
great charger 1 
his use of the colours of the french flag in the three films was nothing short of incredible every shot every scene was like a work of art 1 
there is really nothing for me at postinos hope your experience is better 0 
i had absolutely no problem with this headset linking to my 8530 blackberry curve 1 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
the bathrooms are clean and the place itself is well decorated 1 
the sides are delish mixed mushrooms yukon gold puree white corn beateous 1 
good servicecheck 1 
i could barely stomach the meal but didnt complain because it was a business lunch 0 
very prompt service 1 
i saw this film over christmas and what a great film it was 1 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
the cast is always entertaining as usual 1 
it is not good 0 
i liked the patio and the service was outstanding 1 
its too bad that everyone else involved didnt share crowes level of dedication to quality for if they did wed have a far better film on our hands than this subpar mess 0 
nothing special 0 
it was way over fried 0 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
love this phone 1 
the chips and salsa were really good the salsa was very fresh 1 
im not impressed with the concept or the food 0 
the phone is sturdy and waterproof 1 
it came free with a dvd player i bought but i still turned the thing off halfway through because i was embarrassed for howell 0 
the only thing really worth watching was the scenery and the house because it is beautiful 1 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
as always the evening was wonderful and the food delicious 1 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
ive had no trouble accessing the internet downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions 1 
the interplay between martin and emilio contains the same wonderful chemistry we saw in wall street with martin and charlie 1 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
the movie seemed a little slow at first 0 
when i saw it in the theater i thought i was going to be sick 0 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
omg i felt like i had never eaten thai food until this dish 1 
i would give this television series a 10 plus if i could 1 
some highlights great quality nigiri here 1 
i didnt realize how wonderful the short really is until the last two scenes 1 
after the first charge kept going dead after 12 minutes 0 
in fact its hard to remember that the part of ray charles is being acted and not played by the man himself 1 
service is quick and even to go orders are just like we like it 1 
service is quick and even to go orders are just like we like it 1 
star trek v the final frontier is the worst in the series 0 
poor construction 0 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
for that its worth checking out 1 
sooooo good 1 
the only suspense i was feeling was the frustration at just how retarded the girls were 0 
oh this is such a thing of beauty this restaurant 1 
does not fit 0 
even in my bmw 3 series which is fairly quiet i have trouble hearing what the other person is saying 0 
very satisifed with that 1 
this place is pretty good nice little vibe in the restaurant 1 
all in all ha long bay was a bit of a flop 0 
the cashier was friendly and even brought the food out to me 1 
itll be a regular stop on my trips to phoenix 1 
works like a charm it work the same as the one i got with the phone 1 
helen baxendale is a very credible lady macbeth who can be very cheerfull at times and sometimes she just looks like a naughty girl but deadly in her taste for blood and evil 1 
i was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar not only because the quality is great but the service is fast and the food impeccable 1 
warning stay away 0 
bland and flavorless is a good way of describing the barely tepid meat 0 
i live in the neighborhood so i am disappointed i wont be back here because it is a convenient location 0 
the warm beer didnt help 0 
i really recommend this faceplates since it looks very nice elegant and cool 1 
it isnt even an achievement as a sobaditsgood or sobaditsmemorable movie 0 
great price also 1 
i gave it a 10 1 
excellent short film 1 
this place is awesome if you want something light and healthy during the summer 1 
the veggitarian platter is out of this world 1 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
i am going to have to be the first to negatively review this product 0 
i highly recommend this movie for anyone interested in art poetry theater politics or japanese history 1 
the pleather case doesnt fit 0 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
would not go back 0 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
for sushi on the strip this is the place to go 1 
this was my first and only vegas buffet and it did not disappoint 1 
horrible 0 
all the actors give a wonderful performance especially jennifer rubin as jamie harris who changes from the nervous starlet in the beginning through the strange events she is part of to the cool star 1 
this movie is a good and humorous comment on life in 2006 1 
the block was amazing 1 
it was a pale color instead of nice and char and has no flavor 0 
but in any case the best part is you can download these pictures to your laptop using ir or even send pictures from your laptop to the phone 1 
i found a six inch long piece of wire in my salsa 0 
punishment park is a brilliant piece of cinema 1 
the food was outstanding and the prices were very reasonable 1 
conclusion i loved it 1 
when i saw it in the theater i thought i was going to be sick 0 
all the actors give a wonderful performance especially jennifer rubin as jamie harris who changes from the nervous starlet in the beginning through the strange events she is part of to the cool star 1 
it was horrendous 0 
very bad performance plays angela bennett a computer expert who is at home all the time 0 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
not to mention the combination of pears almonds and bacon is a big winner 1 
the greek dressing was very creamy and flavorful 1 
she ordered a toasted english muffin that came out untoasted 0 
the color is even prettier than i thought it would be and the graphics are incredibly sharp 1 
putting the race card aside lets look at the major flaw in the film they destroy latifas character 0 
plantronics bluetooth excelent buy 1 
this wonderful experience made this place a muststop whenever we are in town again 1 
my mother and brother had to do thiswhen i saw robert ryan portraying this type of man it was a very good imitation of this type of individual and i was impressed 1 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
2 thumbs up to this seller 1 
dont go here 0 
very windresistant 1 
no plot whatsoever 0 
the characters are interesting even if a bit predictable 1 
this is a great little item 1 
this place deserves one star and 90 has to do with the food 0 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
also difficult to put onid recommend avoiding this product 0 
these are fabulous 1 
reaching for the bottom row is uncomfortable and the send and end keys are not where i expect them to be3 0 
they have a really nice atmosphere 1 
but despite these few flaws this case is of exceptional quality and well worth the additional costs of owning an official oem product 1 
i especially love the long battery life 1 
a great touch 1 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
i love the camera its really pretty good quality 1 
the memories are murky but i can only say that i enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show 1 
it is shameful 0 
strike 2 who wants to be rushed 0 
so anyone near you will hear part of your conversation 0 
crust is not good 0 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
the plug did not work very well 0 
i love all the features and form factor 1 
i will be back many times soon 1 
its welldesigned and very sharp the blue is a very nice color 1 
the two main characters may be two of the most believable children i ever saw put on screen 1 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
if you simply want a small flip phone look elsewhere as the extra bells whistles are mediocre 0 
the spaghetti is nothing special whatsoever 0 
it showed exactly how the government and the scientist argued for humanity and the reasons of the gadget 1 
and i just love the colors 1 
but it wasnt anything at all just one big yawn 0 
really really good rice all the time 1 
this is essentially a communications tool that does not communicate 0 
the seller is very understanding and patient i would definitely buy from them again 1 
i went to bachi burger on a friends recommendation and was not disappointed 1 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
this is an extraordinary film 1 
chinese forgeries abound 0 
meredith m was better than all right 1 
the movie is full of wonderful dancing hence the title 1 
i came back today since they relocated and still not impressed 0 
i sat riveted to the tv screen 1 
disappointing experience 0 
but the premise of the film was so ridiculous that the president of the us 0 
light weight i hardly notice it is there 1 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
i did not have any problem with this item and would order it again if needed 1 
the charger worked for about a week and then completely stopped charging my phone 0 
the battery is working well as a replacement for the original that came with the phone over 2 years ago 1 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
my girlfriends veal was very bad 0 
sending it back 0 
ambience is perfect 1 
i felt insulted and disrespected how could you talk and judge another human being like that 0 
if you have not seen this movie i definitely recommend it 1 
overpriced for what you are getting 0 
i want to first say our server was great and we had perfect service 1 
service was fantastic 1 
if this premise sound stupid thats because it is 0 
the problem was the script 0 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
you wont be disappointed 1 
really awful 0 
all the other cases ive tried normally fall apart after a few months but this one seems to be in for the long haul 1 
sorry i will not be getting food from here anytime soon 0 
cant upload ringtones from a third party 0 
it never condescends all the characters have good genuine hearts and believable problems 1 
food was great and so was the serivce 1 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
i hate writing bad reviews about films especially those in which i really like the star but this film is so bad i dont believe for one second that anyone could have been proud of it 0 
i was particularly pleased with the acting ability of dwight schultz 1 
i believe the screenwriter did a good job of tying up the loose ends 1 
the only thing that i think could improve is the sound leaks out from the headset 0 
i really enjoyed eating here 1 
my mother and brother had to do thiswhen i saw robert ryan portraying this type of man it was a very good imitation of this type of individual and i was impressed 1 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
comfort for our whole family 1 
there was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth but it didnt really work into the rest of the plot 0 
as a courtroom drama its compelling as an indictment on the american justice system its frightening 1 
his performance as awarded was stunning 1 
the lines the cuts the audio everything is wrong 0 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
but when someone strives for greatness and poetry but delivers a muddled and often ridiculous story a bunch of disparate scenes pretentious dialogue then you get the worst kind of a movie that some other reviewer very accurately defined as pretentious crap 0 
we also ordered the spinach and avocado salad the ingredients were sad and the dressing literally had zero taste 0 
not nearly as good looking as the amazon picture makes it look 0 
howeverthe riingtones are not the best and neither are the games 0 
the result is a powerhouse achievement made more timely now perhaps because of our cultures disturbing fascination with celebrity and its distorted interpretations of fame 1 
con spotty service 0 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
i liked this movie way too much 1 
i would give this television series a 10 plus if i could 1 
the chefs were friendly and did a good job 1 
favorite place in town for shawarrrrrrma 1 
a bit predictable 0 
im not really sure how joeys was voted best hot dog in the valley by readers of phoenix magazine 0 
imdb ratings only go as low 1 for awful its time to get some negative numbers in there for cases such as these 0 
ive bought 5 wired headphones that sound better than these 0 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
you wont forget this movie 1 
i dont think ive ever gone to a movie and disliked it as much 0 
bad reception 0 
dont buy this product 0 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
loved itfriendly servers great food wonderful and imaginative menu 1 
i went to bachi burger on a friends recommendation and was not disappointed 1 
my ribeye steak was cooked perfectly and had great mesquite flavor 1 
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0 
the waitress and manager are so friendly 1 
the death row scenes were entirely unmoving 0 
nice sound 1 
you can find better movies at youtube 0 
the story unfolds in 18th century jutland and the use of period music played on period instruments is just one more fine touch 1 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
i as well wouldve given godfathers zero stars if possible 0 
to sum the film up breeders is a terrible cheaply made horror movie that should be avoided like the ebola virus 0 
i have tried these cables with my computer and my ipod and it works just fine 1 
after charging overnight these batteries work great 1 
the use of slowmotion needlessly repeats itself throughout the movie but is well backed up by bad acting and bad is a kind word here no continuity scenes that are thrown in for no reason whatsoever vehicles that looked like they were made from a corn flakes box and a directorial style that bordered on stupidity 0 
i really enjoyed eating here 1 
the owners really really need to quit being soooooo cheap let them wrap my freaking sandwich in two papers not one 0 
in a word it is embarrassing 0 
this company charge me a restocking fee and still not given me my refund back 0 
the food sucked which we expected but it sucked more than we could have imagined 0 
owners are really great people 1 
i have been to very few places to eat that under no circumstances would i ever return to and this tops the list 0 
the phone loads super 1 
the dialogue sucked 0 
works great when my cat attacked the phone he scratched the protective strip instead of destroying the screen 1 
do not make the same mistake as me 0 
unfortunately this is a bad movie that is just plain bad 0 
10 out of 10 for both the movie and trilogy 1 
lame would be the best way to describe it 0 
but the service was beyond bad 0 
all in all i give this one a resounding 9 out of 10 1 
very unreliable service from tmobile 0 
you could drive a semi truck into these holes 0 
i love this place 1 
this is one of the worst sandra bullock movie since speed 2 but not quite that bad 0 
the cinematographyif it can be called thatsucked 0 
echo problemvery unsatisfactory 0 
you cant relate with them hell you barely can understand them 0 
you could drive a semi truck into these holes 0 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
the transfers are very good 1 
my order was not correct 0 
ive had better not only from dedicated boba tea spots but even from jenni pho 0 
overall a delight 1 
in short dont bother with this movie 0 
so anyone near you will hear part of your conversation 0 
even when the women finally show up there is no sign of improvement the most expected things happen and by the time the film is over you might be far asleep 0 
youll love it 1 
my boyfriend tried the mediterranean chicken salad and fell in love 1 
im still trying to get over how bad it was 0 
buttons are too small 0 
worked great 1 
its a shame to see good actors like thomerson and james make a living in a mess like this 0 
very true to shakespear and a must for all shakespear fans 1 
weve tried to like this place but after 10 times i think were done with them 0 
he is one of my favourite directors and one of the most talented directors in the history of cinema 1 
definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly will return next time im in vegas 1 
i would not recommend this place 0 
i think i was one of the people who found this another one of roths pearls 1 
the selection was probably the worst ive seen in vegasthere was none 0 
food was great and so was the serivce 1 
elias koteasjack palance play good roles angelina is hot and gets nakedbilly drago appears in this and is cool as usual a cameo by sven ole thorsen helps make this a very enjoyable movie with good acting and a decent budget 1 
overall i was not impressed and would not go back 0 
in conclusion i will not bother with this movie because a volcano in los angeles is nothing but nonsense 0 
nothing special 0 
this place is good 1 
a truly truly bad film 0 
as always the evening was wonderful and the food delicious 1 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
it was so bad i had lost the heart to finish it 0 
my drink was never empty and he made some really great menu suggestions 1 
both of them were truly unbelievably good and i am so glad we went back 1 
this is such a fun and funny movie 1 
first of all there are enough racial stereotypes and racial jokes to offend everyone 0 
the sides are delish mixed mushrooms yukon gold puree white corn beateous 1 
very funny 1 
the fried rice was dry as well 0 
well never go again 0 
it was packed 0 
weve have gotten a much better service from the pizza place next door than the services we received from this restaurant 0 
reception is terrible and full of static 0 
the potatoes were great and so was the biscuit 1 
the fries were not hot and neither was my burger 0 
i advise everyone do not be fooled 0 
but in any case the best part is you can download these pictures to your laptop using ir or even send pictures from your laptop to the phone 1 
its really easy 1 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
if you want healthy authentic or ethic food try this place 1 
a drive thru means you do not want to wait around for half an hour for your food but somehow when we end up going here they make us wait and wait 0 
paolo sorrentino has written a wonderful story about loneliness and tony has built one of the most unforgettable characters seen in movies in recent years 1 
the update procedure is difficult and cumbersome 0 
reception is terrible and full of static 0 
this movie totally grates on my nerves 0 
wont work right or atleast for me 0 
its a fresh subtle and rather sublime effect 1 
my friend did not like his bloody mary 0 
raw and sublimely moving 1 
this review is long overdue since i consider a tale of two sisters to be the single greatest film ever made 1 
for those that havent seen it dont waste your time 0 
the shrimp tender and moist 1 
just whatever you do avoid groove as its the antithesis of all that is good about human traffic 0 
thank you for such great service 1 
its a shame to see good actors like thomerson and james make a living in a mess like this 0 
i love this bluetooth 1 
it ranks highly as a great noircrimedrama incredible performances by belmondo and lino ventura 1 
great phone 1 
it felt like a very gripping intelligent stage play but without the overly theatrical feeling one actually gets from watching people on a stage which plays on everyones terror of a white lie escalating to monstrous consequences 1 
i believe that pitch black was done well 1 
the movie is littered with overt racial slurs towards the black cast members and in return the whites are depicted as morons and boobs 0 
it is the best charger i have seen on the market yet 1 
youll love how thin it is 1 
a happy wonderful feel good ending 1 
the warmth it generates is in contrast to its austere backdrop 1 
great value 1 
i own a jabra earset and was very happy with it but the sound quality especially outgoing on this is better 1 
from what my dinner companions told meeverything was very fresh with nice texture and taste 1 
it looked like a wonderful story 1 
as for the mains also uninspired 0 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
good case excellent value 1 
the plot was the same as pretty much every other cheap horror 0 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
no actress has been worse used that june allison in this movie 0 
i gave it 5 stars then and im giving it 5 stars now 1 
if you want healthy authentic or ethic food try this place 1 
if you havent choked in your own vomit by the end by all the cheap drama and worthless dialogue youve must have bored yourself to death with this waste of time 0 
love the margaritas too 1 
i loved it 1 
why was this film made 0 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
i love the look and feel of samsung flipphones 1 
same problem as others have mentioned 0 
the phone is sturdy and waterproof 1 
one of my favorite purchases ever 1 
some highlights great quality nigiri here 1 
it looses connection to the phone even when it is within a couple feet between the two 0 
one more thing i can tolerate political incorrectness very well im all for artistic freedom and suspension of disbelief but the slavic female character was just too much 0 
a good commentary of todays love and undoubtedly a film worth seeing 1 
what a big waste of time 0 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
after two i felt disgusting 0 
its one of the most boring horror movies from the 90s mainly because it starts slow and centers in a boring atmosphere 0 
so i am here to warn youdo not rent this movie it is the dumbest thing you have never seen 0 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
the staff was very attentive 1 
in addition it feels amp looks as if the phone is all lightweight cheap plastic 0 
cant store anything but phone numbers to sim 0 
i cannot believe that the actors agreed to do this film 0 
nice case feels good in your hands 1 
the sets especially designed to work with the camera are amazingstylized beautiful and effective 1 
very nice and relaxing late night viewing 1 
but now that it is out of warranty the same problems reoccurebottom line put your money somewhere else cingular will not support it 0 
very good product well made 1 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
if there is a wind it is completely useless 0 
so i basically threw my money out the window for nothing 0 
this place is like chipotle but better 1 
a drive thru means you do not want to wait around for half an hour for your food but somehow when we end up going here they make us wait and wait 0 
the football scenes at the end were perplexing 0 
the soundtrack wasnt terrible either 1 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
terrible management 0 
dont buy this product it fails 0 
good item low price 1 
id rather eat airline food seriously 0 
spend your money and time some place else 0 
it was horrendous 0 
the bathrooms are clean and the place itself is well decorated 1 
the cast of veteran actors are more than just a nostalgia trip 1 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
this place is disgusting 0 
not even a hello we will be right with you 0 
the success of the film depends on the casting of sydney greenstreet as the alexander yardley character 1 
the only suspense i was feeling was the frustration at just how retarded the girls were 0 
i was seated immediately 1 
one of the best mexican movies ever and one of the less understood even by mexican themselves no matter how identified the should have felt with it 1 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
it only recognizes the phone as its storage device 0 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
the battery runs down quickly 0 
aside from its terrible lead this film has loads of other debits 0 
then our food came out disappointment ensued 0 
prosgood camera very nice pictures also has cool styles like black and white and more 1 
i had verizon 2 years ago and really liked their service 1 
great character actors telly savalas and peter boyle 1 
i have never had such bland food which surprised me considering the article we read focused so much on their spices and flavor 0 
unfortunately it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees 0 
to call this movie a drama is ridiculous 0 
i dont have very many words to say about this place but it does everything pretty well 1 
its quite simply the highest most superlative form of cinema imaginable 1 
both do good jobs and are quite amusing 1 
very prompt service 1 
battery is holding up well 1 
so absolutley fantastic 1 
all in all i give this one a resounding 9 out of 10 1 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
by the time the film ended i not only disliked it i despised it 0 
spoilers whatever else can or cant be said about it surface is superbly crafted 1 
i have had mine for about a year and this christmas i bought some for the rest of the family 1 
john wayne did an incredible job for being so young in the movie industry 1 
very disappointing 0 
sauce was tasteless 0 
so far it has worked like a charm 1 
i love the camera its really pretty good quality 1 
i was not happy with this item 0 
nonlinear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well 1 
so dont go there if you are looking for good food 0 
and the sound quality is great 1 
it was so cool 1 
it is a joy to use 1 
the attractive set used throughout most of the film is an eyepleasing gem 1 
rating 1 out of 10 0 
food arrived quickly 1 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
horrible horrible protector 0 
the food amazing 1 
horrible horrible protector 0 
i own 2 of these cases and would order another 1 
worst service to boot but that is the least of their worries 0 
level 5 spicy was perfect where spice didnt overwhelm the soup 1 
voice quality signal strength dropped calls 0 
we had 7 at our table and the service was pretty fast 1 
plug was the wrong size 0 
the only suspense i was feeling was the frustration at just how retarded the girls were 0 
fits comfortably came with three sizes of earbud tips 1 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
by the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant i was bored and didnt care what happened next and so i switched off 0 
the acting by the whole cast could be put on a scale and balanced perfectly between overacting and underacting 0 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
cant say enough good things about this place 1 
the screen does get smudged easily because it touches your ear and face 0 
i thought errol flynn was brilliant as custer and has since become my favourite actor 1 
good works fine 1 
thats how id describe this painfully dreary timewaster of a film 0 
babie bop is very cute 1 
wont go back 0 
stay away from this store be careful 0 
i put the latest os on it v115g and it now likes to slow to a crawl and lock up every once in a while 0 
their rotating beers on tap is also a highlight of this place 1 
one of the worst shows of all time 0 
great hands free device 1 
we arent ones to make a scene at restaurants but i just dont get itdefinitely lost the love after this one 0 
i will be back many times soon 1 
initially the local sites in the film which was filmed here in buffalo intrigued me 1 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
by the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant i was bored and didnt care what happened next and so i switched off 0 
i didnt want the clip going over the top of my ear causing discomfort 0 
this phone is very fast with sending any kind of messages and web browsing is significantly faster than previous phones i have used 1 
product is exactly as described 1 
all of the tapas dishes were delicious 1 
the good cinematography also makes her and monica bellucci look very beautiful 1 
timely shipment and quality product 1 
iam very pleased with my purchase 1 
this item worked great but it broke after 6 months of use 0 
by the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant i was bored and didnt care what happened next and so i switched off 0 
i was hoping for more 0 
its not what it says it is 0 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
the acting sucks the music sucks the script sucks the pacing sucks the special fx suck the directing sucks basically this movie sucks 0 
i recommend igo to anyone with different brand cell phonesmp3 players in the family 1 
food was average at best 0 
its one of the movies i need to see whenever it comes on tvnever mind the fact that i already have it memorized 1 
this is infuriating 0 
i enjoyed it 1 
the worst sappiest dialogue i could go on and on 0 
gotta love those closeups of slimy drooling teeth 1 
never got it 0 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
i tried talking real loud but shouting on the telephone gets old and i was still told it wasnt great 0 
the reception has been generally good 1 
the instructions didnt explain that a microphone jack could be used 0 
the bottowm lineanother worthless cheap gimmick from sprint 0 
i especially liked the noncliche choices with the parents in other movies i could predict the dialog verbatim but the writing in this movie made better selections 1 
unreliable im giving up 0 
i vomited in the bathroom mid lunch 0 
also the phone doesnt seem to accept anything except cbr mp3s preferably ripped by windows media player 0 
im pleased 1 
over rated 0 
the jalapeno bacon is soooo good 1 
kris kristoffersen is good in this movie and really makes a difference 1 
terrible my car will not accept this cassette 0 
the poor actors 0 
very easy to use 1 
this frog phone charm is adorable and very eye catching 1 
if you love authentic mexican food and want a whole bunch of interesting yet delicious meats to choose from you need to try this place 1 
the han nan chicken was also very tasty 1 
crisp and clear 1 
you also cannot take pictures with it in the case because the lense is covered 0 
judith light is one of my favorite actresses and i think she does a superb job in this film 1 
i had the mac salad and it was pretty bland so i will not be getting that again 0 
so i basically threw my money out the window for nothing 0 
incredible 1 
id say that would be the hardest decision honestly all of ms dishes taste how they are supposed to taste amazing 1 
the burger i got the gold standard a 17 burger and was kind of disappointed 0 
disappointing accessory from a good manufacturer 0 
awsome device works great 1 
horrible dont waste your time and money 0 
the bus boy on the other hand was so rude 0 
1010 1 
this film tries to be a serious and sophisticated thrillerhorror flick and it fails miserably 0 
the service here is fair at best 0 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
has been working great 1 
i would recommend it 1 
i really hope the team behind this movie makes more movies and that they will continue to do so in their own some kinda weird style 1 
took an hour to get our food only 4 tables in restaurant my food was luke warm our sever was running around like he was totally overwhelmed 0 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
an extensive menu provides lots of options for breakfast 1 
if you love death and decay and shakespears lyrics this is the one 1 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
this is probably the most irritating show i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
this place receives stars for their appetizers 1 
i am so tired of clichés that is just lazy writing and here they come in thick and fast 0 
you truly take this journey through the eyes and soul of a child 1 
i rather enjoyed it 1 
this place is great 1 
you cant beat that 1 
this place is overpriced not consistent with their boba and it really is overpriced 0 
it is indescribably the most annoying and idiotic show i have ever seen 0 
this place should honestly be blown up 0 
worst martini ever 0 
it was that year however that reminded us that huston was still at the top of his game as evinced by his faithful adaptation of james joyces acclaimed novella the dead 1 
i am also very happy with the price 1 
juano hernandez an exceptional actor who played supporting roles in many films of the era is a proud black man who is accused of murdering a white man in the south 1 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
the cast is always entertaining as usual 1 
this place is handsdown one of the best places to eat in the phoenix metro area 1 
those burgers were amazing 1 
she carries the movie well 1 
the waiter wasnt helpful or friendly and rarely checked on us 0 
great phone 1 
new battery works great in phone 1 
the pizza selections are good 1 
by this time our side of the restaurant was almost empty so there was no excuse 0 
my only complaint is the standard sound volume is a little low even when turned up to 5of 5 0 
it is an excellent drama an excellent thriller and an excellent film 1 
there are so many problems i dont know where to start 0 
the descriptions said yum yum sauce and another said eel sauce yet another said spicy mayowell none of the rolls had sauces on them 0 
this was utterly confusing at first which caused me to lose a couple of very very important contacts 0 
everything about this movie is stupid 0 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
its pretty surprising that this wonderful film was made in 1949 as hollywood generally had its collective heads in the sand concerning black and white issues at that time 1 
case was more or less an extra that i originally put on but later discarded because it scratched my ear 0 
due to this happening on every call i was forced to stop using this headset 0 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
not tasty and the texture was just nasty 0 
with the originality and freshness of the first movie now spent this remake had little else to offer 0 
they refuse to refund or replace 0 
and service was super friendly 1 
so in a nutshell 1 the restaraunt smells like a combination of a dirty fish market and a sewer 0 
but she is still a bad actress repeating her robotic face moves in each of her pictures 0 
superb phone on a great network 1 
i believe every one should see this movie as i think few people outside of south africa understand its past and what is being attempted in the truth and reconciliation process 1 
the ri style calamari was a joke 0 
but storm trooper is not even bad enough to make it to the list of wonderfully terrible movies 0 
i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
works well 1 
this allows the possibility of double booking for the same date and time after the first 0 
not even a hello we will be right with you 0 
what is even more stupid is that who had thought an idea that there should be a volcano in los angeles 0 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
how this piece of trash was ever released is beyond me the acting the story the characters the supposedly special effects etcits all wrong 0 
no real improvement 0 
garbo who showed right off the bat that her talents could carry over from the silent era i wanted to see some of her silent work but netflix doesnt seem to be stocking them 1 
the acting is like watching wooden puppets moving around and reading from a book thats how bad it is 0 
this is a great phone 1 
im returning them 0 
really really good rice all the time 1 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
i love this place 1 
this movie is possibly one of the most creative works of horror ever 1 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
what a piece of junk i lose more calls on this phone 0 
it deserves strong love 1 
everyone is treated equally special 1 
waste your money on this game 1 
im not sure what he was trying to do with this film 0 
mishima is extremely uninteresting 0 
just spicy enough perfect actually 1 
jawbone era is awesome too 1 
im still trying to get over how bad it was 0 
youll love how thin it is 1 
lots of holes in the script 0 
the incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film 1 
lightweight and works well 1 
so i basically threw my money out the window for nothing 0 
terrible management 0 
the phone was unusable and was not new 0 
seriously its not worth wasting your or your kids time on 0 
i felt asleep the first time i watched it so i can recommend it for insomniacs 0 
a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it 1 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
an hour and a half i wish i could bring back 0 
i am far from a sushi connoisseur but i can definitely tell the difference between good food and bad food and this was certainly bad food 0 
there is a totally unnecessary trainroller coaster scene 0 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
the shower area is outside so you can only rinse not take a full shower unless you dont mind being nude for everyone to see 0 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
his use of the colours of the french flag in the three films was nothing short of incredible every shot every scene was like a work of art 1 
with the originality and freshness of the first movie now spent this remake had little else to offer 0 
it is worth the drive 1 
if the food isnt bad enough for you then enjoy dealing with the worlds worstannoying drunk people 0 
add betty white and jean smart and you have a great cast everyone played their parts really well 1 
the folks at otto always make us feel so welcome and special 1 
sorry i will not be getting food from here anytime soon 0 
my husband said she was very rude did not even apologize for the bad food or anything 0 
his performance as awarded was stunning 1 
the design is very good4 1 
the only possible way this movie could be redeemed would be as mst3k fodder 0 
its just lame 0 
once your food arrives its meh 0 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
if only someone involved with it knew how to string together narrative 0 
it was just not a fun experience 1 
improper description i had to return it 0 
will definitely be back 1 
i dont know exactly what it is about this movie but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our familys memories 1 
good audio quality 1 
the service was poor and thats being nice 0 
would recommend this item 1 
a good time 1 
heres where the movie really pied me off 0 
all the actors give a wonderful performance especially jennifer rubin as jamie harris who changes from the nervous starlet in the beginning through the strange events she is part of to the cool star 1 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
when i received my pita it was huge it did have a lot of meat in it so thumbs up there 1 
the casting is also horrible cause all you see is a really really bad actors period 0 
the worst sappiest dialogue i could go on and on 0 
i had strawberry tea which was good 1 
it was probably dirt 0 
stopped by during the late may bank holiday off rick steve recommendation and loved it 1 
this place is great 1 
after the disappointing dinner we went elsewhere for dessert 0 
it works fine on my motorola 325 cellphone and a lot better than the wornout battery did 1 
not much flavor to them and very poorly constructed 0 
it is not good 0 
very slow at seating even with reservation 0 
im terribly disappointed that this film would receive so many awards and accolades especially when there are far more deserving works of film out there 0 
product is useless since it does not have enough charging current to charge the 2 cellphones i was planning to use it with 0 
lordy the khao soi is a dish that is not to be missed for curry lovers 1 
the nokia ca42 usb cable did not work with my phone 0 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
both the hot sour the egg flower soups were absolutely 5 stars 1 
i can assure you that you wont be disappointed 1 
i had strawberry tea which was good 1 
i dont understand how this garbage got on the shelves of the movie store its not even a real movie 0 
artless camerawork endlessly presents us with the ugliest setting imaginable ie 0 
an excellent new restaurant by an experienced frenchman 1 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
price is good too 1 
the awful dialogue and hopeless overacting by everyone who gets shot top off a real waste of space and time 0 
it defeats the purpose of a bluetooth headset 0 
i wish i could return the unit and get back my money 0 
im in az all the time and now have my new spot 1 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
an awesome new look for fall 2000 1 
otherwise easy to install and use clear sound 1 
ive had better not only from dedicated boba tea spots but even from jenni pho 0 
prosgood camera very nice pictures also has cool styles like black and white and more 1 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
people couldnt hear me talk and i had to pull out the earphone and talk on the phone 0 
we will not be coming back 0 
not impressed 0 
ryans bar is definitely one edinburgh establishment i wont be revisiting 0 
this may be the only bad film he ever made 0 
the story is lame not interesting and never really explains the sinister origins of the puppets 0 
i saw this short film on hbo the other day and absolutely loved it 1 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
this is not moviemaking 0 
also makes it easier to hold on to 1 
the greek dressing was very creamy and flavorful 1 
headset works great was packaged nicely to avoid any damage 1 
say bye bye to your tip lady 0 
not tasty and the texture was just nasty 0 
just what i wanted 1 
his costars dont fare much better with people like morgan freeman jonah hill and ed helms just wasted 0 
loved itfriendly servers great food wonderful and imaginative menu 1 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
if you are reading this please dont go there 0 
great product fast shipping 1 
the descriptions said yum yum sauce and another said eel sauce yet another said spicy mayowell none of the rolls had sauces on them 0 
i bought two of them and neither will charge 0 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
now we were chosen to be tortured with this disgusting piece of blatant american propaganda 0 
the cow tongue and cheek tacos are amazing 1 
i dont each much pasta but i love the homemade hand made pastas and thin pizzas here 1 
the ambiance isnt much better 0 
if you havent choked in your own vomit by the end by all the cheap drama and worthless dialogue youve must have bored yourself to death with this waste of time 0 
even allowing for poor production values for the time 1971 and the format some kind of miniseries this is baaaaaad 0 
the best phone in market 1 
great case and price 1 
there is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again 0 
yet plantronincs continues to use the same flawed charger design 0 
we received a white colored battery that goes dead after a couple hoursthe original used to last a week but still lasts longer than thereplacement 0 
both of them were truly unbelievably good and i am so glad we went back 1 
it was clear that she had the range and ability to pull off this part 1 
i loved it 1 
disappointing accessory from a good manufacturer 0 
thank you for such great service 1 
what a mistake that was 0 
ill even say it again  this is torture 0 
i love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it 1 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
food was average at best 0 
both great 1 
i was disgusted because i was pretty sure that was human hair 0 
you get what you pay for i guess 0 
food was great and so was the serivce 1 
they have been around for years and carries the highest quality of antiglare screen protector that i have found to date 1 
i recently tried caballeros and i have been back every week since 1 
dont buy this product 0 
terrible service 0 
this one works and was priced right 1 
works as described 1 
i have always used corded headsets and the freedom from the wireless is very helpful 1 
the construction of the headsets is poor 0 
they know how to make them here 1 
this is an excellent film 1 
the lines the cuts the audio everything is wrong 0 
a very very very slowmoving aimless movie about a distressed drifting young man 0 
very disappointed 0 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
for that price i can think of a few place i would have much rather gone 0 
its a fresh subtle and rather sublime effect 1 
when it opens the battery connection is broken and the device is turned off 0 
the phone crashed completely and now i have to get it replaced 0 
the food was terrible 0 
the food amazing 1 
waited 2 hours never got either of our pizzas as many other around us who came in later did 0 
an absolute must visit 1 
i as well wouldve given godfathers zero stars if possible 0 
we got sitting fairly fast but ended up waiting 40 minutes just to place our order another 30 minutes before the food arrived 0 
all it took was one drop from about 6 inches above the kitchen counter and it was crackedi am not impressed and i am not laughing 0 
the films dialogue is natural real to life 1 
this is one of peter watkins most accessible films 1 
i have to use the smallest earpieces provided but it stays on pretty well 1 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
much less than the jawbone i was going to replace it with 1 
the attempts at humor were pitiful and story is so awful it dosent bear thinking about which basically involves a vulcan stealing the enterprise to find god seriously i just didnt care about any of this film and oh not to mention uhura does a belly dance to distract male guards 0 
i came back today since they relocated and still not impressed 0 
helen baxendale is a very credible lady macbeth who can be very cheerfull at times and sometimes she just looks like a naughty girl but deadly in her taste for blood and evil 1 
never heard of any of them except cole who was totally unbelievable in the part 0 
waste of 13 bucks 0 
they were goldencrispy and delicious 1 
no ear loop needed its tiny and the sound is great 1 
but kevin spacey is an excellent verbal tsunami as buddy ackerman  and totally believable because he is a great actor 1 
it was attached to a gas station and that is rarely a good sign 0 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
its a feelgood film and thats how i felt when i came out of the cinema 1 
the potatoes were great and so was the biscuit 1 
wasted two hours 0 
some applause should be given to the prelude however 1 
now we were chosen to be tortured with this disgusting piece of blatant american propaganda 0 
this totally unfunny movie is so over the top and pathetic and unrealistic that throughout the whole 90 minutes of utter torture i probably looked at my watch about 70000 times 0 
it looses connection to the phone even when it is within a couple feet between the two 0 
the characters are interesting and you want to find out more about them the longer the movie goes on and i think people will be surprised by who does and doesnt make it 1 
does everything it should and more 1 
the only place good for this film is in the garbage 0 
so flavorful and has just the perfect amount of heat 1 
oh and i forgot to also mention the weird color effect it has on your phone 0 
my side greek salad with the greek dressing was so tasty and the pita and hummus was very refreshing 1 
then scene where they debated whether or not to sack the trumpeter who falsely was accused for the murder is pure horror really stupid 0 
the price is reasonable and the service is great 1 
worst customer service 0 
this was reflected not only in the cast but also in the belowpar script which borrowed much from the earlier classic 0 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
everything about it is fine and reasonable for the price ie 1 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
this place is great 1 
terrible phone holder 0 
like the other reviewer said you couldnt pay me to eat at this place again 0 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
linksys should have some way to exchange a bad phone for a refurb unit or something 0 
also notable is john baileys fine crisp beautifully colored cinematography and the great production design costumes by eiko ishioka who went on to do the memorable costumes for coppolas dracula for which she received a well deserved oscar 1 
bacon is hella salty 1 
sound quality on both end is excellent i use headset to call my wife and ask my wife to use headset to call me 2 1 
she ordered a toasted english muffin that came out untoasted 0 
easy to use 1 
the hockey scenes are terrible defensemen playing like theyre 5 years old goalies diving at shots that are 10 feet wide of the net etc 0 
weve have gotten a much better service from the pizza place next door than the services we received from this restaurant 0 
i waited and waited 0 
dont waste your on this one 0 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
great phone 1 
the instruction manual is lacking 0 
the spaghetti is nothing special whatsoever 0 
this case seems well made 1 
i as well wouldve given godfathers zero stars if possible 0 
excellent bluetooth headset 1 
worse theres an incredibly weak subplot thrown in that follows a little band of latterday mansonites as they go after a reporter whos working on a story on the anniversary of the killings 0 
not impressed 0 
the pairing of the two devices was so easy it barely took a couple minutes before i started making calls with the voice dialing feature 1 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
i was hoping for more 0 
doesnt do the job 0 
everything was gross 0 
ray charles is legendary 1 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
too bad you have to pay up to a month for the service 0 
this film and i use that word loosely is an insult to the moviegoing public 0 
awesome device 1 
we had fantastic service and were pleased by the atmosphere 1 
its an empty hollow shell of a movie 0 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
i would highly recommend this 1 
then theres the plot holes 0 
what happened next was prettyoff putting 0 
only like 3 or 4 buildings used a couple of locations maybe poor hummh 0 
makes it easier to keep up with my bluetooth when im not wearing it 0 
nice sound 1 
emily watsons character is very strong and she has only to give a quick glance and you understand everything 1 
juano hernandez an exceptional actor who played supporting roles in many films of the era is a proud black man who is accused of murdering a white man in the south 1 
big disappointment with calendar sync 0 
things happen characters personalities change plot twists occur for no real reason other than that script calls for it 0 
think of the film being like a dream 1 
i have purchased these for both family and friends and all enjoy their clarity and ease of use 1 
i could care less the interior is just beautiful 1 
everything about it is fine and reasonable for the price ie 1 
it sure does beat the nachos at the movies but i would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant 0 
the phone takes forever to charge like 2 to 5 hours literally 0 
thank you for such great service 1 
this was a different cut than the piece the other day but still wonderful and tender s well as well flavored 1 
poor quality and service 0 
the potato chip order was sad i could probably count how many chips were in that box and it was probably around 12 0 
what makes this story different are the terrific production values faultless photography composition and editing the terrific casting the underappreciated brian keith playing a bully teddy and vivid history 1 
if there is a wind it is completely useless 0 
and service was super friendly 1 
if you dont find it too bad as again the unit comes with one earpad onlyi would not recommend this to anyone 0 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
awsome device works great 1 
special mention should be made of the superb music score and sound effects which are an integral element in helping to make this such a memorable and enjoyable cartoon 1 
i was very disappointed 0 
this is a bad film with bad writing and good actorsan ugly cartoon crafted by paul haggis for people who cant handle anything but the bold strokes in storytellinga picture painted with crayons 0 
their monster chicken fried steak and eggs is my all time favorite 1 
this is one of peter watkins most accessible films 1 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
first time there and might just be the last 0 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
the cable looks so thin and flimsy it is scary 0 
one of the most disappointing aspects is the lack of notable gore 0 
someone shouldve invented this sooner 1 
now the pizza itself was good the peanut sauce was very tasty 1 
after trying many many handsfree gadgets this is the one that finally works well 1 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1
