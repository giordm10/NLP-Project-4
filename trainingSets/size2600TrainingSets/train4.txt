theres also enough hypocrisy in this film to make me vomit 0 
customer service was terrible 0 
highly recommend for any one who has a blue tooth phone 1 
the flat reenactments dont hold your attention because they are emotionally adrift and stagy 0 
the service was poor and thats being nice 0 
the acting sucks the music sucks the script sucks the pacing sucks the special fx suck the directing sucks basically this movie sucks 0 
yet plantronincs continues to use the same flawed charger design 0 
the cocktails are all handmade and delicious 1 
i love that they put their food in nice plastic containers as opposed to cramming it in little paper takeout boxes 1 
characters are onedimensional even the good guys and especially the bad guys 0 
we walked away stuffed and happy about our first vegas buffet experience 1 
i have to jiggle the plug to get it to line up right to get decent volume 0 
artless camerawork endlessly presents us with the ugliest setting imaginable ie 0 
so i basically threw my money out the window for nothing 0 
at first i thought i was grtting a good deal at 744 until i plugged it into my phone v3c razr 0 
i also didnt like the on button it felt like it would crack with use 0 
the plantains were the worst ive ever tasted 0 
dont make the same mistake i did 0 
the best place in vegas for breakfast just check out a sat or sun 1 
these are the central themes of the film and they are handled ineptly stereotypically and with no depth of imagination 0 
well im satisfied 1 
jawbone era is awesome too 1 
these are the central themes of the film and they are handled ineptly stereotypically and with no depth of imagination 0 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
the food is very good for your typical bar food 1 
the price is reasonable and the service is great 1 
could not get strong enough signal 0 
i will not be eating there again 0 
we recently witnessed her poor quality of management towards other guests as well 0 
lewis blacks considerable talent is wasted here too as he is at his most incendiary when he is unrestrained which the pg13 rating certainly wont allow 0 
its a total package 1 
nice docking station for home or work 1 
it was quite comfortable in the ear 1 
this is probably one of the least effective and utterly unoriginal films i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
highly unprofessional and rude to a loyal patron 0 
my brother in law who works at the mall ate here same day and guess what he was sick all night too 0 
too bad you have to pay up to a month for the service 0 
there was no chemistry between ben affleck and sandra bullock in this film and i couldnt understand why he would consider even leaving his wifetobe for this chick that he supposedly was knocked out by 0 
i had a salad with the wings and some ice cream for dessert and left feeling quite satisfied 1 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
i am very impressed with the job that motorola did on the sturdiness of this phone 1 
that was done in the second movie 0 
improper description i had to return it 0 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
i came over from verizon because cingulair has nicer cell phones the first thing i noticed was the really bad service 0 
i believe that this place is a great stop for those with a huge belly and hankering for sushi 1 
bela lugosi was totally extraneous intoning odd lines 0 
it is practically useless and did not add any kind of boost to my reception after i bought it 0 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
also the story and acting were weak 0 
each day of the week they have a different deal and its all so delicious 1 
we waited for forty five minutes in vain 0 
will order from them again 1 
there was no chemistry between ben affleck and sandra bullock in this film and i couldnt understand why he would consider even leaving his wifetobe for this chick that he supposedly was knocked out by 0 
they were goldencrispy and delicious 1 
this is hands down the best phone ive ever had 1 
really awful 0 
we waited for thirty minutes to be seated although there were 8 vacant tables and we were the only folks waiting 0 
i wont say any more i dont like spoilers so i dont want to be one but i believe this film is worth your time 1 
avoid this film at all costs 0 
what a piece of junk i lose more calls on this phone 0 
the greek dressing was very creamy and flavorful 1 
not sure who was more lost the flat characters or the audience nearly half of whom walked out 0 
personally i think it shows that people should learn to find a compromise them self without involving other people into issue 1 
much less than the jawbone i was going to replace it with 1 
good quality 1 
lets start with all the problemsthe acting especially from the lead professor was very very bad 0 
the football scenes at the end were perplexing 0 
ill even say it again  this is torture 0 
good quality 1 
unfortunately it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees 0 
fantastic buy and will get again for whatever my next phone is 1 
this is cool because most cases are just open there allowing the screen to get all scratched up 1 
if you have not seen this movie i definitely recommend it 1 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
it has kept up very well 1 
great product fast shipping 1 
only like 3 or 4 buildings used a couple of locations maybe poor hummh 0 
then a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use 0 
this is one of the worst sandra bullock movie since speed 2 but not quite that bad 0 
i believe that pitch black was done well 1 
i have bought this nokia cell phone a few weeks ago and it was a nightmare 0 
a piece of junk that broke after being on my phone for 2 days 0 
fast service 1 
it is a very well acted and done tv movie 1 
i would recommend saving room for this 1 
and then tragedy struck 0 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
graphics is far from the best part of the game 0 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
i am very impressed with the job that motorola did on the sturdiness of this phone 1 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
after i pulled up my car i waited for another 15 minutes before being acknowledged 0 
the food was excellent and service was very good 1 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
only had this a month but its worked flawlessly so far 1 
level 5 spicy was perfect where spice didnt overwhelm the soup 1 
service is friendly and inviting 1 
light weight i hardly notice it is there 1 
warning do not buy 0 
what this film lacks is a convincing script 0 
i would not recommend this place 0 
bad reception 0 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
the pan cakes everyone are raving about taste like a sugary disaster tailored to the palate of a six year old 0 
wow what a bad film 0 
works fine 1 
the food was barely lukewarm so it must have been sitting waiting for the server to bring it out to us 0 
this is a great deal 1 
i literally vomited while watching this film 0 
when my order arrived one of the gyros was missing 0 
the staff are great the ambiance is great 1 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
great phone 1 
there was hardly any meat 0 
what happened next was prettyoff putting 0 
the food was excellent and service was very good 1 
you wont regret it 1 
the vegetables are so fresh and the sauce feels like authentic thai 1 
jawbone era is awesome too 1 
the phone loads super 1 
great food and great service in a clean and friendly setting 1 
i love this cable it allows me to connect any miniusb device to my pc 1 
gets a signal when other verizon phones wont 1 
the bathrooms are clean and the place itself is well decorated 1 
helen baxendale is a very credible lady macbeth who can be very cheerfull at times and sometimes she just looks like a naughty girl but deadly in her taste for blood and evil 1 
dont buy it 0 
dont buy it 0 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
both rickman and stowe play their roles to the hilt in this tale of a childrens book writer who maybe has written a subversive tract 1 
i left with a stomach ache and felt sick the rest of the day 0 
after arguing with verizon regarding the dropped calls we returned the phones after two days 0 
so badwellits just bad 0 
i probably would not go here again 0 
a good commentary of todays love and undoubtedly a film worth seeing 1 
it even has its sweet moments 1 
about ten minutes into this film i started having second thoughts 0 
voice quality signal strength dropped calls 0 
all the other cases ive tried normally fall apart after a few months but this one seems to be in for the long haul 1 
which is precisely why i am giving it such a bad review 0 
very good phone 1 
not my thing 0 
barney is definitely super de duper 1 
it is a joy to use 1 
poorly contstruct hinge 0 
dont waste your time 0 
i purcashed this for the car charger and it does not work 0 
worse theres an incredibly weak subplot thrown in that follows a little band of latterday mansonites as they go after a reporter whos working on a story on the anniversary of the killings 0 
by the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant i was bored and didnt care what happened next and so i switched off 0 
great place to relax and have an awesome burger and beer 1 
omelets are to die for 1 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
if you have several dozen or several hundred contacts then imagine the fun of sending each of them one by one 0 
the chefs were friendly and did a good job 1 
the only thing really worth watching was the scenery and the house because it is beautiful 1 
too bad cause i know its family owned i really wanted to like this place 0 
it was that year however that reminded us that huston was still at the top of his game as evinced by his faithful adaptation of james joyces acclaimed novella the dead 1 
the greek dressing was very creamy and flavorful 1 
terrible my car will not accept this cassette 0 
but whatever it was that cost them so much it didnt translate to quality thats for sure 0 
but this movie really got to me 1 
works great when my cat attacked the phone he scratched the protective strip instead of destroying the screen 1 
in conclusion i will not bother with this movie because a volcano in los angeles is nothing but nonsense 0 
it was awesome 1 
i got home to see the driest damn wings ever 0 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
if good intentions made a film great then this film might be one of the greatest films ever made 1 
i still maintain that monkeys shouldnt make headphones we just obviously dont share enough dna to copy the design over to humans 0 
this movie was kind of long in length but i enjoyed every minute of it 1 
so i am here to warn youdo not rent this movie it is the dumbest thing you have never seen 0 
awsome device works great 1 
i started this review with two stars but im editing it to give it only one 0 
this film offers many delights and surprises 1 
i left the theater with a lilt in my step joy in my heart and hope for the human race 1 
in addition to having one of the most lovely songs ever written french cancan also boasts one of the cutest leading ladies ever to grace the screen 1 
i let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this bad idea we both hated it 0 
great time family dinner on a sunday night 1 
20th century foxs road house 1948 is not only quite a silly noir but is an implausible unmitigated bore of a movie 0 
the chains which im no fan of beat this place easily 0 
the only thing that i think could improve is the sound leaks out from the headset 0 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
the foreigner is not worth one second of your time 0 
perfect for someone me who only likes beer ice cold or in this case even colder 1 
not much seafood and like 5 strings of pasta at the bottom 0 
this is an excellent tool especially when paired with your phones autoanswer 1 
see both films if you can 1 
stay away from the q 0 
the staff is friendly and the joint is always clean 1 
disappointing experience 0 
the sound is clear and the people i talk to on it are amazed at the quality too 1 
we made the drive all the way from north scottsdale and i was not one bit disappointed 1 
best tater tots in the southwest 1 
the live music on fridays totally blows 0 
audio quality is poor very poor 0 
the service was meh 0 
the result is a powerhouse achievement made more timely now perhaps because of our cultures disturbing fascination with celebrity and its distorted interpretations of fame 1 
its not what it says it is 0 
they know how to make them here 1 
they work about 2 weeks then break 0 
the pizza tasted old super chewy in not a good way 0 
service stinks here 0 
it lasts less than 3o minutes if i actually try to use the phonemy wife has the same phone with the same problem 0 
omelets are to die for 1 
the sweet potato tots were good but the onion rings were perfection or as close as i have had 1 
it also took her forever to bring us the check when we asked for it 0 
as many people complained i found this headsets microphone was very weak 0 
i have had this phone for over a year now and i will tell you its not that great 0 
this is a great product sure beats using your fingers 1 
this mostly routine factbased tv drama gets a boost from the fine performance by cole 1 
great price too 1 
i got it because it was so small and adorable 1 
we ordered some old classics and some new dishes after going there a few times and were sorely disappointed with everything 0 
i liked it 1 
top line dont waste your time and money on this one its as bad as it comes 0 
very disappointed in accessoryone 0 
total waste of time 0 
the chips and sals a here is amazing 1 
when achille and philippa beautifully sing a duet from don giovanni that perfectly describes their situation in the movie you appreciate the subtle layers of this excellent film 1 
rating 010 grade z note the show is so bad that even mother of the cast pull her daughter out of the show 0 
steamboat willie is an amazingly important film to our cinema history 1 
service is friendly and inviting 1 
the only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port irda 0 
the only thing i did like was the prime rib and dessert section 1 
the only thing that i think could improve is the sound leaks out from the headset 0 
the only possible way this movie could be redeemed would be as mst3k fodder 0 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
it is rare when a filmmaker takes the time to tell a worthy moral tale with care and love that doesnt fall into the trap of being overly syrupy or over indulgent 1 
the wind and the lion is well written and superbly acted 1 
ray charles is legendary 1 
if you love death and decay and shakespears lyrics this is the one 1 
soyo technology sucks 0 
this was utterly confusing at first which caused me to lose a couple of very very important contacts 0 
the football scenes at the end were perplexing 0 
sam shepards portrayal of a gung ho marine was sobering 1 
barney is definitely super de duper 1 
worst customer service 0 
after two i felt disgusting 0 
sweetest phone 1 
if you want a real scare rent this one 1 
ordered a double cheeseburger got a single patty that was falling apart picture uploaded yeah still sucks 0 
interesting decor 1 
the feel of the dining room was more college cooking course than high class dining and the service was slow at best 0 
worked very well paired with a treo 700w and as a skype headset on my pc using a usb bluetooth transceiver 1 
this is just a great movie 1 
please dont waste your money 0 
he is an amazing film artist one of the most important whoever lived 1 
in fact its hard to remember that the part of ray charles is being acted and not played by the man himself 1 
the food is rich so order accordingly 1 
service is quick and friendly 1 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
of course the acting is blah 0 
bad script bad direction and horrible acting make this one plain bad 0 
it was way over fried 0 
ill be looking for a new earpiece 0 
the calls drop the phone comes on and off at will the screen goes black and the worst of all it stops ringing intermittently 0 
they will customize your order any way youd like my usual is eggplant with green bean stir fry love it 1 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
although i very much liked the look and sound of this place the actual experience was a bit disappointing 0 
comfort for our whole family 1 
i seriously cannot believe that the owner has so many unexperienced employees that all are running around like chickens with their heads cut off 0 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
the warmth it generates is in contrast to its austere backdrop 1 
exceptionally bad 0 
if you hate earbugs avoid this phone by all means 0 
kind of flops around 0 
dont waste your time here 0 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
its not what it says it is 0 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
piece of trash 0 
i received my headset in good time and was happy with it 1 
special thanks to dylan t for the recommendation on what to order all yummy for my tummy 1 
would not go back 0 
i still maintain that monkeys shouldnt make headphones we just obviously dont share enough dna to copy the design over to humans 0 
they keep getting better and better this is my third one and ive had numerous palms too 1 
would come back again if i had a sushi craving while in vegas 1 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
the handsfree part works fine but then the car tries to download the address book and the treo rebootsoverall i still rate this device high 1 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
the grilled chicken was so tender and yellow from the saffron seasoning 1 
the problem was the script 0 
i highly recommend this movie for anyone interested in art poetry theater politics or japanese history 1 
its uncomfortable and the sound quality is quite poor compared with the phone razr or with my previous wired headset that plugged into an lg 0 
it really is impressive that the place hasnt closed down 0 
unfortunately it was not good 0 
avoid avoid avoid 0 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
great charger 1 
having trouble with volume 0 
my wife had the lobster bisque soup which was lukewarm 0 
this greedy corporation will never see another dime from me 0 
this phone is pretty sturdy and ive never had any large problems with it 1 
it failed to convey the broad sweep of landscapes that were a great part of the original 0 
omit watching this 0 
worked very well paired with a treo 700w and as a skype headset on my pc using a usb bluetooth transceiver 1 
i received my orders well within the shipping timeframe everything was in good working order and overall i am very excited to have this source 1 
your servers suck wait correction our server heimer sucked 0 
your staff spends more time talking to themselves than me 0 
ive missed numerous calls because of this reason 0 
they have a really nice atmosphere 1 
yet i enjoy watching it 1 
worst phone ever 0 
useless phone simply deaf 0 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
total waste of time 0 
very disappointed 0 
the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach 0 
integrated seamlessly with the motorola razr phone 1 
the camera on the phone may be used as a dustpan when indoors id rather be using a disposable then this 0 
i went to bachi burger on a friends recommendation and was not disappointed 1 
this place is like chipotle but better 1 
i got the car charger and not even after a week the charger was brokeni went to plug it in and it started smoking 0 
i own 2 of these cases and would order another 1 
level 5 spicy was perfect where spice didnt overwhelm the soup 1 
you learn a lot about the real inside emotions of people in this movie and a lot about the movie business itself 1 
overall i was not impressed and would not go back 0 
very disappointing 0 
light weight i hardly notice it is there 1 
the meat was pretty dry i had the sliced brisket and pulled pork 0 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
conclusion i loved it 1 
buyer beware you could flush money right down the toilet 0 
i could barely stomach the meal but didnt complain because it was a business lunch 0 
both do good jobs and are quite amusing 1 
his costars dont fare much better with people like morgan freeman jonah hill and ed helms just wasted 0 
this is a disgrace 0 
great product fast shipping 1 
they have a really nice atmosphere 1 
id say that would be the hardest decision honestly all of ms dishes taste how they are supposed to taste amazing 1 
if you see it you should probably just leave it on the shelf 0 
saggy floppy piece of junk 0 
the story which was told so eloquently by francis ford coppola 25 years earlier really unfolds gradually and leaves room for the characters to develop 1 
the only suspense i was feeling was the frustration at just how retarded the girls were 0 
we ordered the duck rare and it was pink and tender on the inside with a nice char on the outside 1 
im not sure what he was trying to do with this film 0 
both rickman and stowe play their roles to the hilt in this tale of a childrens book writer who maybe has written a subversive tract 1 
there was so much hype over this phone that i assumed it was the best my mistake 0 
overall i like this place a lot 1 
this little device has transformed my organizational capability and made my life a whole lot easier 1 
im still infatuated with this phone 1 
its a feelgood film and thats how i felt when i came out of the cinema 1 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
after charging overnight these batteries work great 1 
defective crap 0 
but it picked up speed and got right to the point 1 
the folks at otto always make us feel so welcome and special 1 
poor quality 0 
love this place hits the spot when i want something healthy but not lacking in quantity or flavor 1 
the restaurant atmosphere was exquisite 1 
used and dirty 0 
dont waste your on this one 0 
the worst sappiest dialogue i could go on and on 0 
its reception is very very poor 0 
full of unconvincing cardboard characters it is blandly written by edward chodorov who also produced and is surprisingly directed by jean negulesco from whom one would expect a great deal more 0 
i am also very happy with the price 1 
still waiting im sure this item would work well if i ever recieve it 0 
delicious nyc bagels good selections of cream cheese real lox with capers even 1 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
tied to charger for conversations lasting more than 45 minutesmajor problems 0 
the real killer is the volume and of course it breaking 0 
talk about useless customer service 0 
this is an excellent film 1 
they never brought a salad we asked for 0 
omit watching this 0 
didnt laugh or even smile once 0 
your staff spends more time talking to themselves than me 0 
dont buy this product 0 
my mother and brother had to do thiswhen i saw robert ryan portraying this type of man it was a very good imitation of this type of individual and i was impressed 1 
basically the service was very bad 0 
the calls drop the phone comes on and off at will the screen goes black and the worst of all it stops ringing intermittently 0 
what a mistake 0 
soyo technology sucks 0 
sauce was tasteless 0 
he is almost unbearable to watch on screen he has little to no charisma and terrible comedic timing 0 
i cannot make calls at certain places 0 
i think this restaurant suffers from not trying hard enough 0 
i always order from the vegetarian menu during dinner which has a wide array of options to choose from 1 
everything about it is fine and reasonable for the price ie 1 
its a mediocre miserable hollow laughable and predictable piece of garbage 0 
i will never go back to this place and will never ever recommended this place to anyone 0 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
great place fo take out or eat in 1 
about half way through this film i started to dislike it 0 
the accompanied software is almost brilliant 1 
the only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port irda 0 
totally believable 1 
appetite instantly gone 0 
i would recommend it 1 
host staff were for lack of a better word bitches 0 
the wind and the lion is well written and superbly acted 1 
if you see it you should probably just leave it on the shelf 0 
works great 1 
i give wirefly 1 stari will contact cingularatt and inform them of this practice 0 
i can assure you that you wont be disappointed 1 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
its a great item 1 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
constantine gives everything the right intensity and seems to have a good understanding of the underlying psychological motivations 1 
the design is very good4 1 
all the other cases ive tried normally fall apart after a few months but this one seems to be in for the long haul 1 
dont waste your money and time 0 
if good intentions made a film great then this film might be one of the greatest films ever made 1 
i guess i liked the details of his dysfunctionhe was believable 1 
it even has its sweet moments 1 
this is a bad film with bad writing and good actorsan ugly cartoon crafted by paul haggis for people who cant handle anything but the bold strokes in storytellinga picture painted with crayons 0 
trying to make a call on these is an exercise in frustration 0 
not a good bargain 0 
coming here is like experiencing an underwhelming relationship where both parties cant wait for the other person to ask to break up 0 
and if that isnt enough of a mess of a movie for you the picture is also marred with a constant use of studio sets and indoor exteriors 0 
definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly will return next time im in vegas 1 
back to good bbq lighter fare reasonable pricing and tell the public they are back to the old ways 1 
works great when my cat attacked the phone he scratched the protective strip instead of destroying the screen 1 
my husband and i ate lunch here and were very disappointed with the food and service 0 
i do not know if this was emilio estevezs directorial debut but the pacing the interplay and development of the characters as well as some clever camera work surrounding the character estevez plays all suggest a natural eye 1 
definitely will come back here again 1 
itll be a regular stop on my trips to phoenix 1 
sucked most of the stuff does not work with my phone 0 
soyo technology sucks 0 
great price also 1 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
the things that the four kids get themselves into is absolutely hilarious to watch 1 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
i especially love the long battery life 1 
the burger i got the gold standard a 17 burger and was kind of disappointed 0 
very disappointed 0 
the visual effects were awful 0 
i dont have very many words to say about this place but it does everything pretty well 1 
otherwise easy to install and use clear sound 1 
the story starts too fast with absolutely no suspense or buildup in the slightest 0 
it is simple to use and i like it 1 
i do think tom hanks is a good actor 1 
1 hour 54 minutes of sheer tedium melodrama and horrible acting a mess of a script and a sinking feeling of good lord what were they thinking 0 
you can find better movies at youtube 0 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
i struggle to find anything bad to say about it 1 
hitchcock is a great director 1 
the grilled chicken was so tender and yellow from the saffron seasoning 1 
wont ever go here again 0 
service was exceptional and food was a good as all the reviews 1 
very disappointed 0 
the camera on the phone may be used as a dustpan when indoors id rather be using a disposable then this 0 
my only problem is i thought the actor playing the villain was a low rent michael ironside 0 
the first time i ever came here i had an amazing experience i still tell people how awesome the duck was 1 
tasted like dirt 0 
comes with a strong light that you can use to light up your camera shots and even flash sos signals seriously 1 
you cant go wrong with any of the food here 1 
the cow tongue and cheek tacos are amazing 1 
lucy bell is so much higher than this crap and for her to sink this low is quite depressing 0 
this device is great in several situations1 1 
the writer gorman bechard undoubtedly did his homework because all references are industry and characterage appropriate 1 
the problem i have is that they charge 1199 for a sandwich that is no bigger than a subway sub which offers better and more amount of vegetables 0 
about 30 minutes of footage is wasted to show mediocre elderly actors awkwardly babbling overwrought pseudosatanic gibberish corny enough to make a teen goth blush almost always in olde english and sometimes in latin that may or may not be made up words 0 
each day of the week they have a different deal and its all so delicious 1 
host staff were for lack of a better word bitches 0 
insults profound deuchebaggery and had to go outside for a smoke break while serving just to solidify it 0 
each day of the week they have a different deal and its all so delicious 1 
dont buy this product 0 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
it never condescends all the characters have good genuine hearts and believable problems 1 
the battery life is highly unacceptable 0 
they really want to make your experience a good one 1 
save your money ive had this item for 11 months now 0 
the building itself seems pretty neat the bathroom is pretty trippy but i wouldnt eat here again 0 
its a mediocre miserable hollow laughable and predictable piece of garbage 0 
stay away from the q 0 
it seems completely secure both holding on to my belt and keeping the iphone inside 1 
the only possible way this movie could be redeemed would be as mst3k fodder 0 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
this movie contained an allstar cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i havent seen before 1 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
my phone doesnt slide around my car now and the grip prevents my phone from slipping out of my hand 1 
the movie lacks visual interest drama expression of feeling and celebration of the very patriotism that underlines the narrative 0 
this totally unfunny movie is so over the top and pathetic and unrealistic that throughout the whole 90 minutes of utter torture i probably looked at my watch about 70000 times 0 
though the wind and the lion is told largely through the eyes of the son every member of the family can identify with one of the characters whether it be sean connerys noble brigand candace bergens feisty heroine john hustons wily john hay or steve kanalys spiffy radiant ruthless cando lieutenant roosevelts big stick 1 
excellent product for the price 1 
this device is great in several situations1 1 
in the span of an hour i had two people exclaim whoa is that the new phone on tv 1 
my boyfriend and i sat at the bar and had a completely delightful experience 1 
doesnt work 0 
yes its shiny on front side and i love it 1 
i promise they wont disappoint 1 
the performances are not improved by improvisation because the actors now have twice as much to worry about not only whether theyre delivering the line well but whether the line itself is any good 0 
needless to say we will never be back here again 0 
the phone gets extremely hot 0 
what a big waste of time 0 
another note about this phones appearance is that it really looks rather bland especially in the all black model 0 
the ambience is wonderful and there is music playing 1 
i could barely stomach the meal but didnt complain because it was a business lunch 0 
and those baby owls were adorable 1 
see it 1 
to sum the film up breeders is a terrible cheaply made horror movie that should be avoided like the ebola virus 0 
dont do it 0 
the eargels channel the sound directly into your ear and seem to increase the sound volume and clarity 1 
my boyfriend and i came here for the first time on a recent trip to vegas and could not have been more pleased with the quality of food and service 1 
this was like the final blow 0 
voice recognition is tremendous 1 
if you dont find it too bad as again the unit comes with one earpad onlyi would not recommend this to anyone 0 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
though the wind and the lion is told largely through the eyes of the son every member of the family can identify with one of the characters whether it be sean connerys noble brigand candace bergens feisty heroine john hustons wily john hay or steve kanalys spiffy radiant ruthless cando lieutenant roosevelts big stick 1 
from what my dinner companions told meeverything was very fresh with nice texture and taste 1 
damn good steak 1 
i will not return 0 
spend your money and time some place else 0 
never been to hard rock casino before will never ever step forward in it again 0 
i love the camera its really pretty good quality 1 
that company is a joke 0 
i am so tired of clichés that is just lazy writing and here they come in thick and fast 0 
these are certainly very comfortable and functionality is decent 1 
so far so good 1 
poor talk time performance 0 
much more interesting more action more suspense and less of the unneeded controversy 1 
no im going to eat the potato that i found some strangers hair in it 0 
pretty piece of junk 0 
great place to relax and have an awesome burger and beer 1 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
then as if i hadnt wasted enough of my life there they poured salt in the wound by drawing out the time it took to bring the check 0 
worst hour and a half of my lifeoh my gosh 0 
easily none other cartoon made me laugh in a tender way before getting into dark sitcoms oriented for teenagers 1 
never got it 0 
it did not work in my cell phone plug i am very up set with the charger 0 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
the tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu 0 
the food was great as always compliments to the chef 1 
if you have not seen this movie i definitely recommend it 1 
w810i is just superb 1 
nevertheless yet another wonderful film from the great masters stable 1 
the plot such as it is is so derivative and predictable that the ending is like a mercy killing 0 
im big fan of rpg games too but this movie its a disgrace to any selfrespecting rpger there is 0 
highly unrecommended 0 
dont buy it 0 
the movie is not completely perfect but titta di girolamo will stay with you for a long time after the vision of the movie 1 
beware this is not a trashy cult movie this is trash period 0 
it has been a winner for us 1 
overall a delight 1 
in particular the relationship between the bakery assistant and the waitress just didnt work for me at all 0 
but the service was beyond bad 0 
the potato chip order was sad i could probably count how many chips were in that box and it was probably around 12 0 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
but what really made it unwatchable was the direction 0 
a good commentary of todays love and undoubtedly a film worth seeing 1 
customer service was terrible 0 
i hate to disagree with my fellow yelpers but my husband and i were so disappointed with this place 0 
i really like this product over the motorola because it is allot clearer on the ear piece and the mic 1 
i kept catching the cable on the seat and i had to pull the phone out to turn it on an off 0 
everything captain howdy says is either laughable or just plain stupid 0 
as an earlier review noted plug in this charger and nothing happens 0 
the owners are super friendly and the staff is courteous 1 
what on earth is irons doing in this film 0 
a cheap and cheerless heist movie with poor characterisation lots of underbite style stoic emoting think chow yun fat in a better tomorrow and some cheesy clichés thrown into an abandoned factory ready for a few poorly executed flying judo rolls a la john woo 0 
very satisifed with that 1 
i felt as though her going to ireland did absolutely nothing whatsoever 0 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
piece of junk 0 
as for the mains also uninspired 0 
itll be a regular stop on my trips to phoenix 1 
so bad 0 
i received my supposedly new motorola 375 and apparently there was not a match between the phone and the charger 0 
the worst was the salmon sashimi 0 
awesome selection of beer 1 
this is some seriously good pizza and im an expertconnisseur on the topic 1 
i am very impressed with the job that motorola did on the sturdiness of this phone 1 
headset works great was packaged nicely to avoid any damage 1 
much more interesting more action more suspense and less of the unneeded controversy 1 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
i just saw this film and i recommend it 1 
saggy floppy piece of junk 0 
i rather enjoyed it 1 
if you want a real scare rent this one 1 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
terrible product and waste of money 0 
not much dialogue not much music the whole film was shot as elaborately and aesthetically like a sculpture 1 
the cast is good 1 
very disappointed in accessoryone 0 
i let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this bad idea we both hated it 0 
this phone works great 1 
watching washing machine twirling around wouldnt hurt your eyes as much as this show 0 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
very nice and relaxing late night viewing 1 
schrader has made a resume full of lousy amateurish films 0 
i will not be eating there again 0 
i wasnt expecting oscar material but this 0 
im surprised this is a good quality car charger and theres not much reviews about it 1 
phone now holds charge like it did when it was new 1 
wonderful lil tapas and the ambience made me feel all warm and fuzzy inside 1 
i had the mac salad and it was pretty bland so i will not be getting that again 0 
at no point in the proceedings does it look remotely like america 0 
product was excellent and works better than the verizon one and boy was it cheaper 1 
overall i am psyched to have a phone which has all my appointments and contacts in and gets great reception 1 
i didnt realize how wonderful the short really is until the last two scenes 1 
to be honest with you this is unbelievable nonsense and very foolish 0 
food arrived quickly 1 
also were served hot bread and butter and home made potato chips with bacon bits on topvery original and very good 1 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
all the bread is made inhouse 1 
i guess that nobody at the network that aired this dribble watched it before putting it on 0 
it sure does beat the nachos at the movies but i would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant 0 
the bt headset was such a disapoinment 0 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
by this time our side of the restaurant was almost empty so there was no excuse 0 
saggy floppy piece of junk 0 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
all in all i think it was a good investment 1 
he was extremely rude and really there are so many other restaurants i would love to dine at during a weekend in vegas 0 
i believe every one should see this movie as i think few people outside of south africa understand its past and what is being attempted in the truth and reconciliation process 1 
special thanks to dylan t for the recommendation on what to order all yummy for my tummy 1 
which is precisely why i am giving it such a bad review 0 
but this movie is not funny considering the ridiculousness of it 0 
there is however some pretty good acting at least for this type of film 1 
the characters are interesting even if a bit predictable 1 
unfortunately the ability to actually know you are receiving a call is a rather important feature and this phone is pitiful in that respect 0 
however after finally watching this film i realized that not only had i had a closed mind to the brilliance it depicts i also found myself watching it over and over again 1 
but in terms of the writing its very fresh and bold 1 
the owners are super friendly and the staff is courteous 1 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
i wasnt expecting oscar material but this 0 
in particular the relationship between the bakery assistant and the waitress just didnt work for me at all 0 
you could only take 2 videos at a time and the quality was very poor 0 
it is easy to turn on and off when you are in the car and the volume controls are quite accessable 1 
by the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant i was bored and didnt care what happened next and so i switched off 0 
the roast beef sandwich tasted really good 1 
itll be a regular stop on my trips to phoenix 1 
i had strawberry tea which was good 1 
battery is terrible 0 
unfortunately the ability to actually know you are receiving a call is a rather important feature and this phone is pitiful in that respect 0 
the waitresses are very friendly 1 
dont waste your time watching this rubbish nonresearched film 0 
owners are really great people 1 
this place was such a nice surprise 1 
the real killer is the volume and of course it breaking 0 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
wasted two hours 0 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
what a disappointment 0 
how awful she is 0 
i love this place 1 
everything was good and tasty 1 
thats how id describe this painfully dreary timewaster of a film 0 
not recommended 0 
if you look for authentic thai food go else where 0 
i love this phone 1 
howeverthe riingtones are not the best and neither are the games 0 
why are these sad little vegetables so overcooked 0 
im not impressed with the concept or the food 0 
is pretty funny 1 
add betty white and jean smart and you have a great cast everyone played their parts really well 1 
and dont even get me started on the jerky camerawork 0 
the warm beer didnt help 0 
i probably wont be coming back here 0 
the characters were all funny and had the peculiarity of not having a true lead character 1 
a piece of junk that broke after being on my phone for 2 days 0 
clever and a real crowdpleaserthis film still ranks among mickeys best films even after 80 wonderful years 1 
works great 1 
often the dialogue doesnt really follow from one line to another or fit the surroundings 0 
the food was delicious our bartender was attentive and personable and we got a great deal 1 
the bartender was also nice 1 
needless to say i wont be going back anytime soon 0 
if you dont find it too bad as again the unit comes with one earpad onlyi would not recommend this to anyone 0 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
must have been an off night at this place 0 
a standout scene 1 
tasted like dirt 0 
the least said about the acting the better 0 
a disappointment 0 
great steak great sides great wine amazing desserts 1 
that was done in the second movie 0 
this may be the only bad film he ever made 0 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
nargile i think you are great 1 
ill put this gem up against any movie in terms of screenplay cinematography acting postproduction editing directing or any other aspect of filmmaking 1 
i have yet to run this new battery below two bars and thats three days without charging 1 
all it took was one drop from about 6 inches above the kitchen counter and it was crackedi am not impressed and i am not laughing 0 
hated it 0 
i want my money back 0 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
definitely not worth the 3 i paid 0 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
very displeased 0 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
its so bad its actually worth seeing just for that reason 0 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
while i managed to bend the leaf spring back in place the metal now has enough stress that it will break on the next drop 0 
appears to actually outperform the original battery from china that came with my v325i 1 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
definitely not worth the 3 i paid 0 
the acting sucks the music sucks the script sucks the pacing sucks the special fx suck the directing sucks basically this movie sucks 0 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
they dropped more than the ball 0 
this place is overpriced not consistent with their boba and it really is overpriced 0 
do not buy if you want to use the holster 0 
there is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again 0 
arrived quickly and much less expensive than others being sold 1 
this is one of the worst sandra bullock movie since speed 2 but not quite that bad 0 
predictable but not a bad watch 1 
i had to go to a store and bought a new nokia phone which is working great 1 
save your money ive had this item for 11 months now 0 
these are the nicest restaurant owners ive ever come across 1 
this was one of the worst films i have ever seen 0 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
theres really nothing bad i can say about this headset 0 
you get incredibly fresh fish prepared with care 1 
hard to judge whether these sides were good because we were grossed out by the melted styrofoam and didnt want to eat it for fear of getting sick 0 
so dont go there if you are looking for good food 0 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
also makes it easier to hold on to 1 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
excellent starter wireless headset 0 
this is a great product sure beats using your fingers 1 
host staff were for lack of a better word bitches 0 
i never come again 0 
the sweet potato tots were good but the onion rings were perfection or as close as i have had 1 
couldnt ask for a more satisfying meal 1 
not loud enough and doesnt turn on like it should 0 
the instructions didnt explain that a microphone jack could be used 0 
it is a really good show to watch 1 
i started this review with two stars but im editing it to give it only one 0 
i had verizon 2 years ago and really liked their service 1 
you learn a lot about the real inside emotions of people in this movie and a lot about the movie business itself 1 
nothing short of magnificent photographycinematography in this film 1 
some great music and terrific scenery 1 
waste of 13 bucks 0 
the macarons here are insanely good 1 
weve tried to like this place but after 10 times i think were done with them 0 
there are so many problems i dont know where to start 0 
it has everything i need and i couldnt ask for more 1 
nothing at all to recommend 0 
trumbull on i love lucy 1 
it definitely was not as good as my s11 1 
i dont think well be going back anytime soon 0 
very clear quality sound and you dont have to mess with the sound on your ipod since you have the sound buttons on the headset 1 
cumbersome design 0 
dont buy this product 0 
if it was to turn my good day feeling into a night of disturbing memories than i guess he succeeded 0 
waitress was sweet and funny 1 
great movie 1 
first the bathrooms at this location were dirty seat covers were not replenished just plain yucky 0 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
nice headset priced right 1 
the food came out at a good pace 1 
very happy with this product 1 
the acting was bad 0 
and his subtle connections between the three films are awesome 1 
the script is bad very bad  it contains both cheesiness and unethical joke that you normally see in rated r or nc17 movie 0 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
crostini that came with the salad was stale 0 
crisp and clear 1 
there is nothing privileged about workingeating there 0 
doesnt last long 0 
this place is awesome if you want something light and healthy during the summer 1 
i also didnt like the on button it felt like it would crack with use 0 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
this product is great it makes working a lot easier i can go to the copier while waiting on hold for something 1 
to sum the film up breeders is a terrible cheaply made horror movie that should be avoided like the ebola virus 0 
it wasnt busy at all and now we know why 0 
i will never go back to this place and will never ever recommended this place to anyone 0 
omg the food was delicioso 1 
however bt headsets are currently not good for real time games like firstperson shooters since the audio delay messes me up 0 
but it is great i would really recommend it 1 
iam very pleased with my purchase 1 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
i bought this to use with my kindle fire and absolutely loved it 1 
we had 7 at our table and the service was pretty fast 1 
works great 1 
the ngage is still lacking in earbuds 0 
this movie was kind of long in length but i enjoyed every minute of it 1 
avoid avoid avoid 0 
i know he was a contract player with little control over his scripts but the acting was as bad as the script 0 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
this is some seriously good pizza and im an expertconnisseur on the topic 1 
its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
add betty white and jean smart and you have a great cast everyone played their parts really well 1 
kris kristoffersen is good in this movie and really makes a difference 1 
mishima is extremely uninteresting 0 
and sometimes it was so embarrassing that i had to look away 0 
the macarons here are insanely good 1 
however this didnt make up for the fact that overall this was a tremendously boring movie 0 
it was a drive to get there 0 
it felt like a very gripping intelligent stage play but without the overly theatrical feeling one actually gets from watching people on a stage which plays on everyones terror of a white lie escalating to monstrous consequences 1 
join the club and get awesome offers via email 1 
the plastic breaks really easy on this clip 0 
i exchanged the sony ericson z500a for this and im pretty happy with that decision 1 
lousy product 0 
i had the mac salad and it was pretty bland so i will not be getting that again 0 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
the point is the journey a journey that touches every member of the family 1 
i dont each much pasta but i love the homemade hand made pastas and thin pizzas here 1 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
a usable keyboard actually turns a pda into a realworld useful machine instead of just a neat gadget 1 
very good food great atmosphere1 1 
i even dropped this phone into a stream and it was submerged for 15 seconds and it still works great 1 
then the film just dropped the ball 0 
then scene where they debated whether or not to sack the trumpeter who falsely was accused for the murder is pure horror really stupid 0 
my only complaint is the standard sound volume is a little low even when turned up to 5of 5 0 
an awesome new look for fall 2000 1 
magical help 1 
service sucks 0 
i had the mac salad and it was pretty bland so i will not be getting that again 0 
later i found myself lost in the power of the film 1 
i was not happy with this item 0 
the scallop dish is quite appalling for value as well 0 
both actors truly understand and become their particular character delivering a convincing sincere performance 1 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
works fine 1 
the selection of food was not the best 0 
special mention should be made of the superb music score and sound effects which are an integral element in helping to make this such a memorable and enjoyable cartoon 1 
kind of hard to mess up a steak but they did 0 
it sure does beat the nachos at the movies but i would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant 0 
personally i think it shows that people should learn to find a compromise them self without involving other people into issue 1 
we definately enjoyed ourselves 1 
nice docking station for home or work 1 
it will drive you barking mad 0 
the plot has more holes than a pair of fishnet stockings and the direction and editing is astonishingly ham fisted 0 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
camerawork again bad 0 
never going back 0 
the show would begin with smart ass ed comments to each other that would be totally off the wall and uncalled for 0 
i went on motorolas website and followed all directions but could not get it to pair again 0 
it has a great camera thats 2mp and the pics are nice and clear with great picture quality 1 
elias koteasjack palance play good roles angelina is hot and gets nakedbilly drago appears in this and is cool as usual a cameo by sven ole thorsen helps make this a very enjoyable movie with good acting and a decent budget 1 
as for the mains also uninspired 0 
the movie has almost no action scenes in it and very little comedy 0 
finally after three or four times the spring of the latch broke and i could not use it any longer on the visor 0 
its a case of so bad it is laughable 0 
the only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port irda 0 
i loved their mussels cooked in this wine reduction the duck was tender and their potato dishes were delicious 1 
great case and price 1 
the film is way too long 0 
the worst phone from samsungcrap this crappy samsung e715 is the worst i have ever seeen 0 
the first thing that happened was that the tracking was off 0 
i highly recommend this case 1 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
it is an hour and half waste of time following a bunch of very pretty high schoolers whine and cry about life 0 
utter crap sound quality is terrible 0 
highly entertaining at all angles 1 
this product is clearly not ready for prime time i dont care how cool it looks if you cant tell a call is coming in its worthless 0 
all in all i can assure you ill be back 1 
overall i like there food and the service 1 
for people who are first timers in film making i think they did an excellent job 1 
in particular the relationship between the bakery assistant and the waitress just didnt work for me at all 0 
the plastic breaks really easy on this clip 0 
overall the film is interesting and thoughtprovoking 1 
best tater tots in the southwest 1 
i believe the screenwriter did a good job of tying up the loose ends 1 
spend your money and time some place else 0 
but storm trooper is not even bad enough to make it to the list of wonderfully terrible movies 0 
due to this happening on every call i was forced to stop using this headset 0 
horrible phone 0 
and sometimes it was so embarrassing that i had to look away 0 
i have 23 bars on my cell phone when i am home but you cant not hear anything 0 
the guys all had steaks and our steak loving son who has had steak at the best and worst places said it was the best steak hes ever eaten 1 
worked very well paired with a treo 700w and as a skype headset on my pc using a usb bluetooth transceiver 1 
arrived quickly and much less expensive than others being sold 1 
you also cannot take pictures with it in the case because the lense is covered 0 
waitress was good though 1 
would not go back 0 
there is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again 0 
food quality has been horrible 0 
very displeased 0 
for those that havent seen it dont waste your time 0 
this is an excellent tool especially when paired with your phones autoanswer 1 
nice ambiance 1 
this place is overpriced not consistent with their boba and it really is overpriced 0 
if you do go see this movie bring a pillow or a girlfriendboyfriend to keep you occupied through out 0 
hackneyed writing certainly but made even worse by the bad directing 0 
from what my dinner companions told meeverything was very fresh with nice texture and taste 1 
lot of holes in the plot theres nothing about how he became the emperor nothing about where he spend 20 years between his childhood and mature age 0 
they do not care about the consumer one bit 0 
motorola finally got the voice quality of a bluetooth headset right 1 
i definitly recommend 1 
this place is pretty good nice little vibe in the restaurant 1 
we will not be coming back 0 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
i was shocked because no signs indicate cash only 0 
also notable is john baileys fine crisp beautifully colored cinematography and the great production design costumes by eiko ishioka who went on to do the memorable costumes for coppolas dracula for which she received a well deserved oscar 1 
its welldesigned and very sharp the blue is a very nice color 1 
what a piece of junk i lose more calls on this phone 0 
the whole experience was underwhelming and i think well just go to ninja sushi next time 0 
worthwhile 1 
if you want a sandwich just go to any firehouse 1 
this is a good joint 1 
be sure to order dessert even if you need to pack it togo the tiramisu and cannoli are both to die for 1 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
our server was very nice and even though he looked a little overwhelmed with all of our needs he stayed professional and friendly until the end 1 
good food good service 1 
really ugly 0 
not a good item it worked for a while then started having problems in my auto reverse tape player 0 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
treo and tmobile refused to replace it again and forced me to buy another phone without any kind of upgrade discount 0 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
the biggest complaint i have is the battery drains superfast 0 
he also came back to check on us regularly excellent service 1 
their frozen margaritas are way too sugary for my taste 0 
worst phone ever 0 
incredible 1 
my sanyo has survived dozens of drops on blacktop without ill effect 1 
the food was outstanding and the prices were very reasonable 1 
the acting sucked 0 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
delete this film from your mind 0 
so dont go there if you are looking for good food 0 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
the tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu 0 
the handsfree part works fine but then the car tries to download the address book and the treo rebootsoverall i still rate this device high 1 
special mention should be made of the superb music score and sound effects which are an integral element in helping to make this such a memorable and enjoyable cartoon 1 
great time family dinner on a sunday night 1 
the success of the film depends on the casting of sydney greenstreet as the alexander yardley character 1 
some highlights great quality nigiri here 1 
very disappointing 0 
mediocre food 0 
for those that havent seen it dont waste your time 0 
great for ipods too 1 
blue ant is easy to use 1 
things that went wrong they burned the saganaki 0 
it was delicious 1 
their chow mein is so good 1 
the plot such as it is is so derivative and predictable that the ending is like a mercy killing 0 
so bad 0 
from what my dinner companions told meeverything was very fresh with nice texture and taste 1 
good show samsung 1 
after 3 months screen just went black all of a sudden 0 
bland not a liking this place for a number of reasons and i dont want to waste time on bad reviewing ill leave it at that 0 
too politically correct 0 
i had ordered a motorola data cable got a very well finished and working product 1 
after 20 minutes wait i got a table 0 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
the only downside is the service 0 
it is light has plenty of battery capacity and is very confortable to wear for somewhat extended periods of time 1 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
highly recommended 1 
i highly recommend this device to everyone 1 
i cant use this case because the smell is disgusting 0 
it isnt even an achievement as a sobaditsgood or sobaditsmemorable movie 0 
i left the theater with a lilt in my step joy in my heart and hope for the human race 1 
however my girl was complain that some time the phone doesnt wake up like normal phone does 0 
i recently had problems where i could not stay connected for more than 10 minutes before being disconnected 0 
lastly the mozzarella sticks they were the best thing we ordered 1 
there is no plot or storyline 0 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
i saw this short film on hbo the other day and absolutely loved it 1 
nargile i think you are great 1 
this place is way too overpriced for mediocre food 0 
it felt like a very gripping intelligent stage play but without the overly theatrical feeling one actually gets from watching people on a stage which plays on everyones terror of a white lie escalating to monstrous consequences 1 
my headset works just peachykeen 1 
elias koteasjack palance play good roles angelina is hot and gets nakedbilly drago appears in this and is cool as usual a cameo by sven ole thorsen helps make this a very enjoyable movie with good acting and a decent budget 1 
restored my phone to like new performance 1 
comfort for our whole family 1 
linked to my phone without effort 1 
if you want a real scare rent this one 1 
they could be used as exemplars for any set designer 1 
youll love how thin it is 1 
didnt laugh or even smile once 0 
bad fit way too big 0 
the least said about the acting the better 0 
nice design and quality 1 
the design is very good4 1 
nice spicy and tender 1 
the ripped banana was not only ripped but petrified and tasteless 0 
car charger as well as ac charger are included to make sure you never run out of juicehighy recommended 1 
horrible 0 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
juano hernandez an exceptional actor who played supporting roles in many films of the era is a proud black man who is accused of murdering a white man in the south 1 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
helen baxendale is a very credible lady macbeth who can be very cheerfull at times and sometimes she just looks like a naughty girl but deadly in her taste for blood and evil 1 
but despite these few flaws this case is of exceptional quality and well worth the additional costs of owning an official oem product 1 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
cant say enough good things about this place 1 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
couldnt use the unit with sunglasses not good in texas 0 
i dont like this nokia either 0 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
this was my first and only vegas buffet and it did not disappoint 1 
the food sucked which we expected but it sucked more than we could have imagined 0 
its this pandering to the audience that sabotages most of his films 0 
good case excellent value 1 
utterly without merit on any level this is akin to torture 0 
ryans bar is definitely one edinburgh establishment i wont be revisiting 0 
never again will i be dining at this place 0 
i will be back many times soon 1 
her lines seem to have been written by a fifteen year old though they are trying oh so so hard to sound like how a fifteen year old would really um you know well talk 0 
call me a nut but i think this is one of the best movies ever 1 
great price also 1 
if you stay in vegas you must get breakfast here at least once 1 
the service was a little slow considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace 0 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
it is perfect for a sitdown family meal or get together with a few friends 1 
the sets especially designed to work with the camera are amazingstylized beautiful and effective 1 
this is a good battery and it got here really fast 1 
cumbersome design 0 
the least said about the acting the better 0 
the real disappointment was our waiter 0 
i wasted my little money with this earpiece 0 
i left with a stomach ache and felt sick the rest of the day 0 
appetite instantly gone 0 
gets a signal when other verizon phones wont 1 
if that bug never showed up i would have given a 4 for sure but on the other side of the wall where this bug was climbing was the kitchen 0 
not enough volume 0 
it is light has plenty of battery capacity and is very confortable to wear for somewhat extended periods of time 1 
any ring toneoverall good phone to buy 1 
the movie is full of wonderful dancing hence the title 1 
i would highly recommend this product 1 
so i bought about 10 of these and saved alot of money 1 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
i will not be eating there again 0 
if you do watch it however there are small consolations the actresses playing annes sisters each do a wonderful job with their roles 1 
with great sound effects and impressive special effects i cant recommend this movie enough 1 
dont buy it 0 
ambience is perfect 1 
if that bug never showed up i would have given a 4 for sure but on the other side of the wall where this bug was climbing was the kitchen 0 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
it sure does beat the nachos at the movies but i would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant 0 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
the manager was the worst 0 
it really created a unique feeling though 1 
pretty piece of junk 0 
comfortable in my hand 1 
the food wasnt good 0 
i like steiners because its dark and it feels like a bar 1 
voice recognition is tremendous 1 
it fits my ear well and is comfortable on 1 
soggy and not good 0 
very good stuff for the price 1 
very good product well made 1 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
well im satisfied 1 
considering the relations off screen between taylor and stanwyck it was surprising how little chemistry there was on screen between the two of them 0 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
very bad experience 0 
both films are terrible but to the credit of the 1986 version it was watchable 0 
excellent starter wireless headset 0 
nine out of ten for a truly lovely film 1 
this blueant supertooth handsfree phone speaker is awesome 1 
how awesome is that 1 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
while i managed to bend the leaf spring back in place the metal now has enough stress that it will break on the next drop 0 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
i would have given no star if i was able 0 
i wont spoil it but the ending in pretty amazing 1 
great steak great sides great wine amazing desserts 1 
it was pretty gross 0 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
the fries were not hot and neither was my burger 0 
i saw this film over christmas and what a great film it was 1 
i kept looking at the time and it had soon become 35 minutes yet still no food 0 
the service here is fair at best 0 
sorry i will not be getting food from here anytime soon 0 
but this movie is not funny considering the ridiculousness of it 0 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
the worst sappiest dialogue i could go on and on 0 
then a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use 0 
both rickman and stowe play their roles to the hilt in this tale of a childrens book writer who maybe has written a subversive tract 1 
i dont have very many words to say about this place but it does everything pretty well 1 
dont buy this product it fails 0 
cinematography noteworthy including fine views of barcelona and its famed gaudi towers 1 
i hate to disagree with my fellow yelpers but my husband and i were so disappointed with this place 0 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
food was really boring 0 
the bose noise cancelling is amazing which is very important for a nyc commuter 1 
for that its worth checking out 1 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
sam shepards portrayal of a gung ho marine was sobering 1 
i love my 350 headset my jabra350 bluetooth headset is great the reception is very good and the ear piece is a comfortable fit 1 
cinematography the film was shot in an interesting way 1 
con spotty service 0 
the goat taco didnt skimp on the meat and wow what flavor 1 
this if the first movie ive given a 10 to in years 1 
bt50 battery junk 0 
not only did the software do a great job of this i could also make my own ringtones form my existing cds without an internet connection 1 
meredith m was better than all right 1 
for the price on amazon it is an excellent product which i would highly recommend 1 
the least said about the acting the better 0 
the noise shield is incrediable 1 
if you hate earbugs avoid this phone by all means 0 
the directing seems too pretentious 0 
which is precisely why i am giving it such a bad review 0 
great earpiece 1 
waitress was a little slow in service 0 
what on earth is irons doing in this film 0 
ambience is perfect 1 
i wasnt expecting oscar material but this 0 
it did not work in my cell phone plug i am very up set with the charger 0 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
we got the food and apparently they have never heard of salt and the batter on the fish was chewy 0 
i had a pretty satifying experience 1 
this is a chilly unremarkable movie about an author livingworking in a chilly abstruse culture 0 
the servers went back and forth several times not even so much as an are you being helped 0 
after arguing with verizon regarding the dropped calls we returned the phones after two days 0 
i would highly recommend this product 1 
food quality has been horrible 0 
it kept getting worse and worse so now im officially done 0 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
i definitly recommend 1 
each track commands sentiment actually contributing to the scenes and characters 1 
only had this a month but its worked flawlessly so far 1 
would come back again if i had a sushi craving while in vegas 1 
needless to say we will never be back here again 0 
this is the first phone ive had that has been so cheaply made 0 
nargile i think you are great 1 
how can you call yourself a steakhouse if you cant properly cook a steak i dont understand 0 
very easy to use 1 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
they could be used as exemplars for any set designer 1 
but it picked up speed and got right to the point 1 
the sets especially designed to work with the camera are amazingstylized beautiful and effective 1 
i dressed up to be treated so rudely 0 
that said our mouths and bellies were still quite pleased 1 
im glad the film didnt go for the most obvious choice as a lesser film certainly would have 1 
the mic is great 1 
aside from its terrible lead this film has loads of other debits 0 
i guess that nobody at the network that aired this dribble watched it before putting it on 0 
1010 1 
it defeats the purpose of a bluetooth headset 0 
the movie seemed a little slow at first 0 
the kids are very cool too 1 
the handsfree part works fine but then the car tries to download the address book and the treo rebootsoverall i still rate this device high 1 
weve tried to like this place but after 10 times i think were done with them 0 
good prices 1 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
i had strawberry tea which was good 1 
the performances are real and gripping the crocdodile is extremely well done indeed if the black water website is to be believed thats because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous 1 
the charger arrived within the promised timeframe but it did not work 0 
for people who are first timers in film making i think they did an excellent job 1 
sauce was tasteless 0 
it also took her forever to bring us the check when we asked for it 0 
what a waste of time 0 
why are these sad little vegetables so overcooked 0 
disappointed with battery 0 
this is a bad film with bad writing and good actorsan ugly cartoon crafted by paul haggis for people who cant handle anything but the bold strokes in storytellinga picture painted with crayons 0 
if you havent choked in your own vomit by the end by all the cheap drama and worthless dialogue youve must have bored yourself to death with this waste of time 0 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
this review is long overdue since i consider a tale of two sisters to be the single greatest film ever made 1 
think of the film being like a dream 1 
the use of slowmotion needlessly repeats itself throughout the movie but is well backed up by bad acting and bad is a kind word here no continuity scenes that are thrown in for no reason whatsoever vehicles that looked like they were made from a corn flakes box and a directorial style that bordered on stupidity 0 
the instruction manual is lacking 0 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
characters are onedimensional even the good guys and especially the bad guys 0 
the only thing worse than taylors acting was stanwycks singing 0 
we literally sat there for 20 minutes with no one asking to take our order 0 
works like a charm it work the same as the one i got with the phone 1 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
go watch it 1 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
i got the car charger and not even after a week the charger was brokeni went to plug it in and it started smoking 0 
for sushi on the strip this is the place to go 1 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
ive had better not only from dedicated boba tea spots but even from jenni pho 0 
waitress was a little slow in service 0 
it isnt even an achievement as a sobaditsgood or sobaditsmemorable movie 0 
but when someone strives for greatness and poetry but delivers a muddled and often ridiculous story a bunch of disparate scenes pretentious dialogue then you get the worst kind of a movie that some other reviewer very accurately defined as pretentious crap 0 
its a sad movie but very good 1 
is pretty funny 1 
overall i wasnt very impressed with noca 0 
i find wasting food to be despicable but this just wasnt food 0 
for that price i can think of a few place i would have much rather gone 0 
this is one of the better buffets that i have been to 1 
the service was a little slow considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace 0 
hes a national treasure 1 
it was so bad i had lost the heart to finish it 0 
stopped by during the late may bank holiday off rick steve recommendation and loved it 1 
the only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port irda 0 
the movie seemed a little slow at first 0 
its a mediocre miserable hollow laughable and predictable piece of garbage 0 
best of all is the rotating feature very helpful 1 
its the one movie that never ceases to interest me simply because it keeps me alert as i try to attempt to decipher its meanings 1 
best of all is the rotating feature very helpful 1 
i totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is 1 
they do not last forever but is not overly expensive to replaceeasy to operate and the sound is much better than others i have tried 1 
it has a very good plot it holds your complete attention the acting is superb tom wilkinson was fantastic and emily watson was also very good 1 
it didnt charge for me 0 
the story is beyond stupid 0 
the only thing i did like was the prime rib and dessert section 1 
the acting from all involved and that includes those like shatner and nimoy is bad and washed out and making them seem as old as they look in real life the special effects are tacky like when spock has to rescue kirk on a jet pack when he falls down from a mountain 0 
basically the service was very bad 0 
but it does get better reception and clarity than any phone ive had before 1 
i seriously cannot believe that the owner has so many unexperienced employees that all are running around like chickens with their heads cut off 0 
whatever the producer was going for he missed entirely 0 
highly unprofessional and rude to a loyal patron 0 
ive also had problems with the phone reading the memory card in which i always turn it on and then off again 0 
has been working great 1 
very well made and fits my surefire gx2 perfectly 1 
the food was outstanding and the prices were very reasonable 1 
bad day or not i have a very low tolerance for rude customer service people it is your job to be nice and polite wash dishes otherwise 0 
this place was such a nice surprise 1 
definitely worth checking out 1 
bad characters bad story and bad acting 0 
worst foodservice ive had in a while 0 
im not sure how long we stood there but it was long enough for me to begin to feel awkwardly out of place 0 
the entire audience applauded at the conclusion of the film 1 
cant get the software to work with my computer 0 
the scenery that the two daughters paint and photograph are beautiful 1 
this really is how vegas fine dining used to be right down to the menus handed to the ladies that have no prices listed 1 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
clever and a real crowdpleaserthis film still ranks among mickeys best films even after 80 wonderful years 1 
dont miss it 1 
its worth driving up from tucson 1 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
this results in the phone being either stuck at max volume or mute 0 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
sounds good reasonably priced and effective its that simple 1 
interesting decor 1 
otherwise dont even waste your time on this 0 
the camera although rated at an impressive 13 megapixels renders images that fall well below expectations of such a relatively high resolution 0 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
this item is fantastic and works perfectly 1 
spend your money and time some place else 0 
the scenery that the two daughters paint and photograph are beautiful 1 
an absolute must visit 1 
i consider this theft 0 
dessert panna cotta was amazing 1 
the service was not up to par either 0 
not as good as i had hoped 0 
the plantains were the worst ive ever tasted 0 
excellent service 1 
the dialogue sucked 0 
great steak great sides great wine amazing desserts 1 
the meat was pretty dry i had the sliced brisket and pulled pork 0 
very good stuff for the price 1 
it is not good 0 
there is however some pretty good acting at least for this type of film 1 
honeslty it didnt taste that fresh 0 
you get extra minutes so that you can carry out the call and not get cut off 1 
both of them were truly unbelievably good and i am so glad we went back 1 
never again will i be dining at this place 0 
this company charge me a restocking fee and still not given me my refund back 0 
this place is like chipotle but better 1 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
i had verizon 2 years ago and really liked their service 1 
another thing i didnt really like is when a character got punched in the face a gallon of blood would spew forth soon after 0 
the directing and the cinematography arent quite as good 0 
nevertheless yet another wonderful film from the great masters stable 1 
either way it sucks 0 
which are small and not worth the price 0 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
what possesed me to get this junk i have no idea 0 
sam shepards portrayal of a gung ho marine was sobering 1 
they have been around for years and carries the highest quality of antiglare screen protector that i have found to date 1 
i dont have very many words to say about this place but it does everything pretty well 1 
i left the theater with a lilt in my step joy in my heart and hope for the human race 1 
talk about great customer service of course we will be back 1 
i was totally fascinated by the music the dancing everything 1 
i asked multiple times for the wine list and after some time of being ignored i went to the hostess and got one myself 0 
the structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema 1 
the inside is really quite nice and very clean 1 
it was awesome 1 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
the plot has more holes than a pair of fishnet stockings and the direction and editing is astonishingly ham fisted 0 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
you never know if you pushed it hard enough or the right number of times for the function you want or not 0 
the turkey and roast beef were bland 0 
the only thing that i think could improve is the sound leaks out from the headset 0 
i consider this theft 0 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
if it were possible to give them zero stars theyd have it 0 
which are small and not worth the price 0 
the point is the journey a journey that touches every member of the family 1 
there was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters 0 
i was totally fascinated by the music the dancing everything 1 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
if you hate earbugs avoid this phone by all means 0 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
i would recommend this 1 
after a year the battery went completely dead on my headset 0 
omit watching this 0 
total waste of time 0 
all in all i think it was a good investment 1 
perabo has a nice energy level and is obviously very comfortable in front of a camera 1 
will definitely be back 1 
but i dont like it 0 
food was really good and i got full petty fast 1 
an amazing finale to possibly the best trilogy of all time 1 
very cheap plastic creaks like an old wooden floor 0 
good servicecheck 1 
so dont go there if you are looking for good food 0 
its so bad its actually worth seeing just for that reason 0 
if you dont find it too bad as again the unit comes with one earpad onlyi would not recommend this to anyone 0 
im so sorry but i really cant recommend it to anyone 0 
after 20 minutes wait i got a table 0 
once you get inside youll be impressed with the place 1 
it was either too cold not enough flavor or just bad 0 
over rated 0 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
the results well are a shame 0 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
and then tragedy struck 0 
left very frustrated 0 
highly recommended a 1 
however after about a year the fliptop started to get loose and wobbly and eventually my screen went black and i couldnt receive and place calls 0 
there is no plot here to keep you going in the first place 0 
the phone loads super 1 
nobody identifies with these characters because theyre all cardboard cutouts and stereotypes or predictably reversestereotypes 0 
setup couldnt have been simpler 1 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
this short film certainly pulls no punches 0 
nothing special 0 
items stated as included from the description are not included 0 
its a gloriously fun fast paced and fairly accurate portrayal of the night of a raver 1 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
if you dont find it too bad as again the unit comes with one earpad onlyi would not recommend this to anyone 0 
nargile i think you are great 1 
it was just not a fun experience 1 
actually the graphics were good at the time 1 
this scene is very strong and unpleasant 0 
i found this place by accident and i could not be happier 1 
the greek dressing was very creamy and flavorful 1 
their chow mein is so good 1 
not what i wanted 0 
i would not recommend this place 0 
awesome service and food 1 
their onscreen chemistry critical to the entire film is genuine 1 
both rickman and stowe play their roles to the hilt in this tale of a childrens book writer who maybe has written a subversive tract 1 
car charger as well as ac charger are included to make sure you never run out of juicehighy recommended 1 
yet plantronincs continues to use the same flawed charger design 0 
you cant beat the price on these 1 
the potatoes were great and so was the biscuit 1 
what a mistake that was 0 
i would give this television series a 10 plus if i could 1 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
our server was super nice and checked on us many times 1 
brilliance indeed 1 
omg the food was delicioso 1 
it lasts less than 3o minutes if i actually try to use the phonemy wife has the same phone with the same problem 0 
a must study for anyone interested in the worst sins of industrial design 0 
i had a pretty satifying experience 1 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
excellent performance 1 
waitress was good though 1 
this is a disgrace 0 
not much dialogue not much music the whole film was shot as elaborately and aesthetically like a sculpture 1 
i really wanted the plantronics 510 to be the right one but it has too many issues for methe good 0 
you have to hold the phone at a particular angle for the other party to hear you clearly 0 
the bt headset was such a disapoinment 0 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
the plantains were the worst ive ever tasted 0 
garbo who showed right off the bat that her talents could carry over from the silent era i wanted to see some of her silent work but netflix doesnt seem to be stocking them 1 
in the span of an hour i had two people exclaim whoa is that the new phone on tv 1 
all i can do is whine on the internet so here it goesthe more i use the thing the less i like it 0 
1010 1 
this phone is slim and light and the display is beautiful 1 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
good prices 1 
waitress was a little slow in service 0 
highly recommended a 1 
their onscreen chemistry critical to the entire film is genuine 1 
those phones are working just fine now 1 
i got to enjoy the seafood salad with a fabulous vinegrette 1 
dont buy this product 0 
the noise shield is incrediable 1 
ill definitely be in soon again 1 
my gyro was basically lettuce only 0 
the ambience is wonderful and there is music playing 1 
battery has no life 0 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
the concert sequences just sucked 0 
however i recently watched the whole thing again on dvd and i was completely struck by how extremely stupid the storyline was how it contained holes inconsistencies and frankly a whole lot of crap and how horrid the dancing was 0 
the basic premise is wasted since it is sidelined by the inexplicable focus on the documentary crew 0 
you wont be disappointed 1 
just whatever you do avoid groove as its the antithesis of all that is good about human traffic 0 
much better than the other ayce sushi place i went to in vegas 1 
black water is a thriller that manages to completely transcend its limitations its an indie flick by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience 1 
it is indescribably the most annoying and idiotic show i have ever seen 0 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
the seller is very understanding and patient i would definitely buy from them again 1 
i also didnt like the on button it felt like it would crack with use 0 
owners are really great people 1 
delicious nyc bagels good selections of cream cheese real lox with capers even 1 
highly unrecommended 0 
when achille and philippa beautifully sing a duet from don giovanni that perfectly describes their situation in the movie you appreciate the subtle layers of this excellent film 1 
no plot whatsoever 0 
think of the film being like a dream 1 
and i really did find them funny 1 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
be sure to order dessert even if you need to pack it togo the tiramisu and cannoli are both to die for 1 
voice quality signal strength dropped calls 0 
good case excellent value 1 
ive also had problems with the phone reading the memory card in which i always turn it on and then off again 0 
everything was good and tasty 1 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
some may say this buffet is pricey but i think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot 1 
it is perfect for a sitdown family meal or get together with a few friends 1 
the mic there is a joke and the volume is quite low 0 
i have tried these cables with my computer and my ipod and it works just fine 1 
waitress was a little slow in service 0 
this is not moviemaking 0 
but then they came back cold 0 
it also had a new problem 0 
the keyboard is a nice compromise between a full qwerty and the basic cell phone number keypad 1 
its a sad movie but very good 1 
i like steiners because its dark and it feels like a bar 1 
the poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying 0 
improper description i had to return it 0 
this place receives stars for their appetizers 1 
these are the nicest restaurant owners ive ever come across 1 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
if you are looking for a good quality motorola headset keep looking this isnt it 0 
it doesnt work in europe or asia 0 
if she had not rolled the eyes we may have stayed not sure if we will go back and try it again 0 
the reception has been generally good 1 
sauce was tasteless 0 
they will customize your order any way youd like my usual is eggplant with green bean stir fry love it 1 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
never been to hard rock casino before will never ever step forward in it again 0 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
all in all i give this one a resounding 9 out of 10 1 
we would recommend these to others 1 
linksys should have some way to exchange a bad phone for a refurb unit or something 0 
the characters are interesting even if a bit predictable 1 
the feel of the dining room was more college cooking course than high class dining and the service was slow at best 0 
i can assure you that you wont be disappointed 1 
unfortunately the ability to actually know you are receiving a call is a rather important feature and this phone is pitiful in that respect 0 
sounds good reasonably priced and effective its that simple 1 
john wayne did an incredible job for being so young in the movie industry 1 
by this time our side of the restaurant was almost empty so there was no excuse 0 
this is an excellent tool especially when paired with your phones autoanswer 1 
the performances are real and gripping the crocdodile is extremely well done indeed if the black water website is to be believed thats because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous 1 
think it over when you plan to own this onethis sure is the last moto phone for me 0 
great charger 1 
i find this inexcusable and so will probably be returning this phone and perhaps changing carriers 0 
the use of slowmotion needlessly repeats itself throughout the movie but is well backed up by bad acting and bad is a kind word here no continuity scenes that are thrown in for no reason whatsoever vehicles that looked like they were made from a corn flakes box and a directorial style that bordered on stupidity 0 
we waited for forty five minutes in vain 0 
i would have casted her in that role after ready the script 1 
i would recommend this 1 
excellent sound battery life and inconspicuous to boot 1 
it looks very nice 1 
ray charles is legendary 1 
the earpiece on this is too large or too heavyit keeps falling out of my ear 0 
at least think to refill my water before i struggle to wave you over for 10 minutes 0 
the sangria was about half of a glass wine full and was 12 ridiculous 0 
not nearly as good looking as the amazon picture makes it look 0 
the film deserves strong kudos for taking this stand for having exceptional acting from its mostly lesserknown cast and for the superintelligent script that doesnt insult the audience or take the easy way out when it comes to white racism 1 
speaking of the music it is unbearably predictably and kitchy 0 
i am pairing this with my iphone and i could not be happier with it so far 1 
helen baxendale is a very credible lady macbeth who can be very cheerfull at times and sometimes she just looks like a naughty girl but deadly in her taste for blood and evil 1 
at no point in the proceedings does it look remotely like america 0 
i will never forget it now 1 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
very poor service 0 
you need at least 3 mins to get to your phone book from the time you first turn on the phonebattery life is short 0 
good audio quality 1 
i like steiners because its dark and it feels like a bar 1 
portable and it works 1 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
considering the relations off screen between taylor and stanwyck it was surprising how little chemistry there was on screen between the two of them 0 
their monster chicken fried steak and eggs is my all time favorite 1 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
worked very well paired with a treo 700w and as a skype headset on my pc using a usb bluetooth transceiver 1 
it sure does beat the nachos at the movies but i would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant 0 
the cinematography is simply stunning to say the least and the fx are nothing if not stateoftheart 1 
i only hear garbage for audio 0 
excellent sound quality 1 
great price too 1 
the story is lame not interesting and never really explains the sinister origins of the puppets 0 
the basic premise is wasted since it is sidelined by the inexplicable focus on the documentary crew 0 
a disappointment 0 
i love this cable it allows me to connect any miniusb device to my pc 1 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
it was probably dirt 0 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
the worst sappiest dialogue i could go on and on 0 
it was just not a fun experience 1 
the croutons also taste homemade which is an extra plus 1 
this review is long overdue since i consider a tale of two sisters to be the single greatest film ever made 1 
however bt headsets are currently not good for real time games like firstperson shooters since the audio delay messes me up 0 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach 0 
this is one of the best italian thrillers of the early 70s 1 
its welldesigned and very sharp the blue is a very nice color 1 
his performance is simply genius 1 
easily none other cartoon made me laugh in a tender way before getting into dark sitcoms oriented for teenagers 1 
low quality 0 
at first i thought i was grtting a good deal at 744 until i plugged it into my phone v3c razr 0 
nice sound 1 
there is no plot here to keep you going in the first place 0 
sam shepards portrayal of a gung ho marine was sobering 1 
which are small and not worth the price 0 
beautiful styling though 1 
however after about a year the fliptop started to get loose and wobbly and eventually my screen went black and i couldnt receive and place calls 0 
i saw it as a child on tv back in 1973 when it was the stranger and i loved it 1 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
that company is a joke 0 
then the film just dropped the ball 0 
great product 1 
sam shepards portrayal of a gung ho marine was sobering 1 
utter crap sound quality is terrible 0 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
before i go in to why i gave a 1 star rating please know that this was my third time eating at bachi burger before writing a review 0 
it is shameful 0 
i really dont see how anyone could enjoy this movie 0 
im surprised this is a good quality car charger and theres not much reviews about it 1 
the only thing worse than taylors acting was stanwycks singing 0 
not much dialogue not much music the whole film was shot as elaborately and aesthetically like a sculpture 1 
great time family dinner on a sunday night 1 
i let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this bad idea we both hated it 0 
the charger arrived within the promised timeframe but it did not work 0 
it makes very strange ticking noises before it ends the call 0 
the veggitarian platter is out of this world 1 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
food arrived quickly 1 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
very good lunch spot 1 
design flaw 0 
really awful 0 
the problem i have is that they charge 1199 for a sandwich that is no bigger than a subway sub which offers better and more amount of vegetables 0 
restored my phone to like new performance 1 
this pair of headphones is the worst that i have ever had soundwise 0 
the ambience is wonderful and there is music playing 1 
otherwise dont even waste your time on this 0 
reaching for the bottom row is uncomfortable and the send and end keys are not where i expect them to be3 0 
the wind and the lion is well written and superbly acted 1 
the only downside is the service 0 
we have gotten a lot of compliments on it 1 
excellent product for the price 1 
warning do not buy 0 
great brunch spot 1 
the battery runs down quickly 0 
definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly will return next time im in vegas 1 
one thing i hate is the mode set button at the side 0 
very very sad 0 
if there was ever a movie that needed wordofmouth to promote this is it 1 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
cant get the software to work with my computer 0 
the only downside is the service 0 
so there is no way for me to plug it in here in the us unless i go by a converter 0 
the only downside is the service 0 
judith light is one of my favorite actresses and i think she does a superb job in this film 1 
dont buy it 0 
highly entertaining at all angles 1 
i was bored throughout the whole damn thing 0 
doesnt work at all i bougth it for my l7c and its not working 0 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
i know this is not like the other restaurants at all something is very off here 0 
i wont be back 0 
not a good bargain 0 
dont waste your money 0 
this movie now joins revenge of the boogeyman and zombiez as part of the hellish trinity of horror films 0 
this results in the phone being either stuck at max volume or mute 0 
yet plantronincs continues to use the same flawed charger design 0 
however i recently watched the whole thing again on dvd and i was completely struck by how extremely stupid the storyline was how it contained holes inconsistencies and frankly a whole lot of crap and how horrid the dancing was 0 
this movie is terrible 0 
the ngage is still lacking in earbuds 0 
its a campy sort of film thats a joy to watch 1 
in summary this was a largely disappointing dining experience 0 
garbo who showed right off the bat that her talents could carry over from the silent era i wanted to see some of her silent work but netflix doesnt seem to be stocking them 1 
good product good seller 1 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
horrible phone 0 
it is an insane game 1 
we ordered some old classics and some new dishes after going there a few times and were sorely disappointed with everything 0 
my side greek salad with the greek dressing was so tasty and the pita and hummus was very refreshing 1 
razr battery good buy 1 
really awful 0 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
lately they have been extremely nice and helpful on the phone 1 
the sets especially designed to work with the camera are amazingstylized beautiful and effective 1 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
i cant believe theres even a sequel to this 0 
really good product 1 
service is quick and friendly 1 
but i definitely would not eat here again 0 
i do love sushi but i found kabuki to be overpriced overhip and underservices 0 
well never go again 0 
the food amazing 1 
they have a plethora of salads and sandwiches and everything ive tried gets my seal of approval 1 
nothing new there 0 
after 20 minutes wait i got a table 0 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
as i said abovepretty useless 0 
my only problem is i thought the actor playing the villain was a low rent michael ironside 0 
lasted one day and then blew up 0 
the 12 mega pixel camera being a part of a phone is reasonably good7 1 
great case and price 1 
there was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters 0 
they will customize your order any way youd like my usual is eggplant with green bean stir fry love it 1 
mark my words this is one of those cult films like evil dead 2 or phantasm that people will still be discovering and falling in love with 20 30 40 years down the line 1 
very well made and fits my surefire gx2 perfectly 1 
see it 1 
by the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant i was bored and didnt care what happened next and so i switched off 0 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
good price 1 
i love this cable it allows me to connect any miniusb device to my pc 1 
must have been an off night at this place 0 
also notable is john baileys fine crisp beautifully colored cinematography and the great production design costumes by eiko ishioka who went on to do the memorable costumes for coppolas dracula for which she received a well deserved oscar 1 
we recently witnessed her poor quality of management towards other guests as well 0 
what makes this story different are the terrific production values faultless photography composition and editing the terrific casting the underappreciated brian keith playing a bully teddy and vivid history 1 
the goat taco didnt skimp on the meat and wow what flavor 1 
his costars dont fare much better with people like morgan freeman jonah hill and ed helms just wasted 0 
the ri style calamari was a joke 0 
the warmth it generates is in contrast to its austere backdrop 1 
but now i was completely grossed out 0 
not good for the money 0 
the sides are delish mixed mushrooms yukon gold puree white corn beateous 1 
i am very impressed with the job that motorola did on the sturdiness of this phone 1 
itll be a regular stop on my trips to phoenix 1 
there is a lot of beautiful places 1 
it is the best charger i have seen on the market yet 1 
the food is rich so order accordingly 1 
one of the worst shows of all time 0 
this is cool because most cases are just open there allowing the screen to get all scratched up 1 
i could not recommend these more 0 
well im satisfied 1 
setup couldnt have been simpler 1 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
this movie is terrible 0 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
it was that year however that reminded us that huston was still at the top of his game as evinced by his faithful adaptation of james joyces acclaimed novella the dead 1 
both great 1 
too bad cause i know its family owned i really wanted to like this place 0 
phenomenal food service and ambiance 1 
highly recommend for any one who has a blue tooth phone 1 
the football scenes at the end were perplexing 0 
nobody identifies with these characters because theyre all cardboard cutouts and stereotypes or predictably reversestereotypes 0 
the story which was told so eloquently by francis ford coppola 25 years earlier really unfolds gradually and leaves room for the characters to develop 1 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
not loud enough and doesnt turn on like it should 0 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
however after finally watching this film i realized that not only had i had a closed mind to the brilliance it depicts i also found myself watching it over and over again 1 
excellent product for the price 1 
they have been around for years and carries the highest quality of antiglare screen protector that i have found to date 1 
this is an unbelievable bargain 1 
nine out of ten for a truly lovely film 1 
this is a good joint 1 
overall i am psyched to have a phone which has all my appointments and contacts in and gets great reception 1 
restaurant is always full but never a wait 1 
im so sorry but i really cant recommend it to anyone 0 
makes it easier to keep up with my bluetooth when im not wearing it 0 
both do good jobs and are quite amusing 1 
didnt laugh or even smile once 0 
after i pulled up my car i waited for another 15 minutes before being acknowledged 0 
its an empty hollow shell of a movie 0 
poorly contstruct hinge 0 
and the beans and rice were mediocre at best 0 
crisp and clear 1 
dont buy this product it fails 0 
after 3 months screen just went black all of a sudden 0 
john wayne did an incredible job for being so young in the movie industry 1 
this is one of the best italian thrillers of the early 70s 1 
the selection of food was not the best 0 
i really hope the team behind this movie makes more movies and that they will continue to do so in their own some kinda weird style 1 
battery chargelife is quite long 1 
would come back again if i had a sushi craving while in vegas 1 
i recommend this for everyone who loves film movies anythinga work of art 1 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
also its a real treat to see anthony quinn playing crazy horse 1 
there are massive levels massive unlockable characters its just a massive game 1 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
black water is a thriller that manages to completely transcend its limitations its an indie flick by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience 1 
appetite instantly gone 0 
there is a lot of beautiful places 1 
the descriptions said yum yum sauce and another said eel sauce yet another said spicy mayowell none of the rolls had sauces on them 0 
the earpiece on this is too large or too heavyit keeps falling out of my ear 0 
easy to pair with my samsung cell 1 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
about ten minutes into this film i started having second thoughts 0 
great for ipods too 1 
the incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film 1 
dessert panna cotta was amazing 1 
exactly what i wanted 1 
this is a stunning movie 1 
i would have casted her in that role after ready the script 1 
and the beans and rice were mediocre at best 0 
reasonably priced also 1 
how awful she is 0 
low quality 0 
the instructions didnt explain that a microphone jack could be used 0 
overall i was not impressed and would not go back 0 
i wasnt expecting oscar material but this 0 
superb phone on a great network 1 
at any rate this film stinks its not funny and fulci should have stayed with giallo and supernatural zombie movies 0 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
i cant wait to go back 1 
i love this place 1 
the restaurant is very clean and has a family restaurant feel to it 1 
the service was not up to par either 0 
not tasty and the texture was just nasty 0 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
the cast was great 1 
this review is long overdue since i consider a tale of two sisters to be the single greatest film ever made 1 
also the area where my unit broke im not too fond of the magnetic strap 0 
barney is definitely super de duper 1 
the hockey scenes are terrible defensemen playing like theyre 5 years old goalies diving at shots that are 10 feet wide of the net etc 0 
we waited for forty five minutes in vain 0 
rating 1 out of 10 0 
this is the place where i first had pho and it was amazing 1 
i guess i should have known that this place would suck because it is inside of the excalibur but i didnt use my common sense 0 
think it over when you plan to own this onethis sure is the last moto phone for me 0 
but i thought his acting was skilled 1 
by the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant i was bored and didnt care what happened next and so i switched off 0 
the service was a little slow considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace 0 
1 long lasting battery you dont have to recharge it as frequentyly as some of the flip phones2 0 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
but in terms of the writing its very fresh and bold 1 
a lot of websites have been rating this a very good phone and so do i 1 
the very idea of it was lame take a minor character from a mediocre pg13 film and make a complete nonsequel while changing its tone to a pgrated family movie 0 
crisp and clear 1 
i kept looking at the time and it had soon become 35 minutes yet still no food 0 
he surely doesnt know how to make a coherent action movie from the screenwriter of air force one who was only obliged to write the script just for a big sum of money 0 
the file browser offers all the options that one needshandsfree is great 1 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
the soundtrack wasnt terrible either 1 
avoid this establishment 0 
1010 1 
too bad cause i know its family owned i really wanted to like this place 0 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
case was more or less an extra that i originally put on but later discarded because it scratched my ear 0 
poor quality and service 0 
my rating just 3 out of 10 0 
in the span of an hour i had two people exclaim whoa is that the new phone on tv 1 
if you want a sandwich just go to any firehouse 1 
i really recommend this faceplates since it looks very nice elegant and cool 1 
i hate to disagree with my fellow yelpers but my husband and i were so disappointed with this place 0 
imdb ratings only go as low 1 for awful its time to get some negative numbers in there for cases such as these 0 
my breakfast was perpared great with a beautiful presentation of 3 giant slices of toast lightly dusted with powdered sugar 1 
itll be a regular stop on my trips to phoenix 1 
definitely a turn off for me i doubt ill be back unless someone else is buying 0 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
we had fantastic service and were pleased by the atmosphere 1 
dont waste your time here 0 
not good by any stretch of the imagination 0 
however my girl was complain that some time the phone doesnt wake up like normal phone does 0 
his performance as awarded was stunning 1 
i was disgusted because i was pretty sure that was human hair 0 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
couldnt figure it out 0 
a film not easily forgotten 1 
it is perfect for a sitdown family meal or get together with a few friends 1 
it even has its sweet moments 1 
the ripped banana was not only ripped but petrified and tasteless 0 
while you dont yet hear mickey speak there are tons of sound effects and music throughout the filmsomething we take for granted now but which was a huge crowd pleaser in 1928 1 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
lastly the mozzarella sticks they were the best thing we ordered 1 
you also cannot take pictures with it in the case because the lense is covered 0 
it is zillion times away from reality 0 
however after about a year the fliptop started to get loose and wobbly and eventually my screen went black and i couldnt receive and place calls 0 
i wont be back 0 
we asked for the bill to leave without eating and they didnt bring that either 0 
the kids are very cool too 1 
then a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use 0 
nice case feels good in your hands 1 
very cheap plastic creaks like an old wooden floor 0 
my boyfriend and i came here for the first time on a recent trip to vegas and could not have been more pleased with the quality of food and service 1 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
but despite these few flaws this case is of exceptional quality and well worth the additional costs of owning an official oem product 1 
however i recently watched the whole thing again on dvd and i was completely struck by how extremely stupid the storyline was how it contained holes inconsistencies and frankly a whole lot of crap and how horrid the dancing was 0 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
you can watch them preparing the delicious food 1 
nice spicy and tender 1 
after the disappointing dinner we went elsewhere for dessert 0 
excellent 1 
battery life is real good 1 
there are the usual hitchcock logic flaws 0 
in a word it is embarrassing 0 
highly unprofessional and rude to a loyal patron 0 
often the dialogue doesnt really follow from one line to another or fit the surroundings 0 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
it sure does beat the nachos at the movies but i would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant 0 
my gyro was basically lettuce only 0 
i came back today since they relocated and still not impressed 0 
i would not recommend this place 0 
1010 1 
very tough and very short on flavor 0 
it failed to convey the broad sweep of landscapes that were a great part of the original 0 
victor mclaglen was even bad and brian donlevy was almost unrecognizable 0 
the foreigner is not worth one second of your time 0 
we had a group of 70 when we claimed we would only have 40 and they handled us beautifully 1 
i love the camera its really pretty good quality 1 
disappointing accessory from a good manufacturer 0 
this one wants to surf on the small wave of space movies in 1998 deep impact and armageddon and this one fails everywhere 0 
its uncomfortable and the sound quality is quite poor compared with the phone razr or with my previous wired headset that plugged into an lg 0 
by the time the film ended i not only disliked it i despised it 0 
weve tried to like this place but after 10 times i think were done with them 0 
i did not have any problem with this item and would order it again if needed 1 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
omelets are to die for 1 
it was just not a fun experience 1 
my first visit to hiro was a delight 1 
the service was extremely slow 0 
i will come back here every time im in vegas 1 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
i wish i could return the unit and get back my money 0 
i think i was one of the people who found this another one of roths pearls 1 
i paid the bill but did not tip because i felt the server did a terrible job 0 
not tasty and the texture was just nasty 0 
needless to say we will never be back here again 0 
i guess that nobody at the network that aired this dribble watched it before putting it on 0 
finally after three or four times the spring of the latch broke and i could not use it any longer on the visor 0 
disappointed 0 
worthwhile 1 
plus its only 8 bucks 1 
i never walked out of a movie faster 0 
it ranks highly as a great noircrimedrama incredible performances by belmondo and lino ventura 1 
what i really like there is the crepe station 1 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
but she is still a bad actress repeating her robotic face moves in each of her pictures 0 
we ordered some old classics and some new dishes after going there a few times and were sorely disappointed with everything 0 
penne vodka excellent 1 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
kind of flops around 0 
con spotty service 0 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
his performance as awarded was stunning 1 
its reception is very very poor 0 
i think the most wonderful parts literally full of wonder are the excerpts from his works 1 
comfort for our whole family 1 
it is easy to turn on and off when you are in the car and the volume controls are quite accessable 1 
ive never been treated so bad 0 
this totally unfunny movie is so over the top and pathetic and unrealistic that throughout the whole 90 minutes of utter torture i probably looked at my watch about 70000 times 0 
dont waste your time watching this rubbish nonresearched film 0 
i struggle to find anything bad to say about it 1 
the show would begin with smart ass ed comments to each other that would be totally off the wall and uncalled for 0 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
the story is beyond stupid 0 
im not sure how long we stood there but it was long enough for me to begin to feel awkwardly out of place 0 
best tater tots in the southwest 1 
the characters were all funny and had the peculiarity of not having a true lead character 1 
if you havent gone here go now 1 
juano hernandez an exceptional actor who played supporting roles in many films of the era is a proud black man who is accused of murdering a white man in the south 1 
the story line is totally predictable 0 
thus far have only visited twice and the food was absolutely delicious each time 1 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
im happy about this purchase good quality and low price 1 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
freezes frequently4 0 
nothing short of magnificent photographycinematography in this film 1 
there is simply no excuse for something this poorly done 0 
brilliance indeed 1 
nice headphones for the price and they work great 1 
itll be a regular stop on my trips to phoenix 1 
everyone is treated equally special 1 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
it has kept up very well 1 
worst phone ever 0 
an absolute must visit 1 
highly unprofessional and rude to a loyal patron 0 
the battery is unreliable as well as the service use antena 0 
if there were zero stars i would give it zero stars 0 
comfort for our whole family 1 
these products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet 0 
nice design and quality 1 
my friend loved the salmon tartar 1 
it was so funny 1 
the text messaging feature is really tricky to use 0 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
nice spicy and tender 1 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
i was disgusted because i was pretty sure that was human hair 0 
everything about this product is wrongfirst 0 
the roast beef sandwich tasted really good 1 
insults profound deuchebaggery and had to go outside for a smoke break while serving just to solidify it 0 
he also came back to check on us regularly excellent service 1 
this is the kind of money that is wasted properly 1 
treo and tmobile refused to replace it again and forced me to buy another phone without any kind of upgrade discount 0 
but it wasnt until i watched this film that i realised how great he actually was 1 
i know this is not like the other restaurants at all something is very off here 0 
my fiancé and i came in the middle of the day and we were greeted and seated right away 1 
when im on this side of town this will definitely be a spot ill hit up again 1 
not loud enough and doesnt turn on like it should 0 
in my house i was getting dropped coverage upstairs and no coverage in my basement 0 
its this pandering to the audience that sabotages most of his films 0 
the pleather case doesnt fit 0 
i would advise to not purchase this item it never worked very well 0 
they are so cool 1 
i think i was one of the people who found this another one of roths pearls 1 
im trying to return it for a refund 0 
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0 
the nano stated itmy son was dissapointed 0 
and the rest of it just sits there being awful with soldiers singing songs about the masculinity they pledge themselves to hairsplitting about purity the admiration of swords etc 0 
very nice and relaxing late night viewing 1 
i was bored throughout the whole damn thing 0 
one character is totally annoying with a voice that gives me the feeling of fingernails on a chalkboard 0 
seems like a good quick place to grab a bite of some familiar pub food but do yourself a favor and look elsewhere 0 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
the sets especially designed to work with the camera are amazingstylized beautiful and effective 1 
i left the theater with a lilt in my step joy in my heart and hope for the human race 1 
however this didnt make up for the fact that overall this was a tremendously boring movie 0 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
so badwellits just bad 0 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
bad reception 0 
lange had become a great actress 1 
unfortunately it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees 0 
im glad i found this product on amazon it is hard to find it wasnt high priced 1 
1 long lasting battery you dont have to recharge it as frequentyly as some of the flip phones2 0 
a very good film indeed about great and unconditional love 1 
love this product 1 
i would have casted her in that role after ready the script 1 
has been working great 1 
10 out of 10 for both the movie and trilogy 1 
worthless product 0 
bad fit way too big 0 
waaaaaayyyyyyyyyy over rated is all i am saying 0 
the worst was the salmon sashimi 0 
dont waste your on this one 0 
the staff are also very friendly and efficient 1 
definitely a bargain 1 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
also its a real treat to see anthony quinn playing crazy horse 1 
needless to say we will never be back here again 0 
the pairing of the two devices was so easy it barely took a couple minutes before i started making calls with the voice dialing feature 1 
you have to hold the phone at a particular angle for the other party to hear you clearly 0 
disappointing 0 
similarly the delivery man did not say a word of apology when our food was 45 minutes late 0 
poor product 0 
id say that would be the hardest decision honestly all of ms dishes taste how they are supposed to taste amazing 1 
it is not good 0 
the story is also both funny and poignant at times 1 
imdb ratings only go as low 1 for awful its time to get some negative numbers in there for cases such as these 0 
lot of holes in the plot theres nothing about how he became the emperor nothing about where he spend 20 years between his childhood and mature age 0 
best ive found so far ive tried 2 other bluetooths and this one has the best quality for both me and the listener as well as ease of using 1 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
and the rest of it just sits there being awful with soldiers singing songs about the masculinity they pledge themselves to hairsplitting about purity the admiration of swords etc 0 
omg the food was delicioso 1 
the potatoes were great and so was the biscuit 1 
regrettably the film fails 0 
stay away from the q 0 
i love the camera its really pretty good quality 1 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
this is definitely a cult classic well worth viewing and sharing with others 1 
definitely not worth the 3 i paid 0 
my sashimi was poor quality being soggy and tasteless 0 
i am very impressed with the job that motorola did on the sturdiness of this phone 1 
comfortable in my hand 1 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
everything about this film is simply incredible 1 
its a case of so bad it is laughable 0 
the food was terrible 0 
i dont know exactly what it is about this movie but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our familys memories 1 
the microphone also works well but according to people i have called it applifies everything 1 
the management is rude 0 
i received my headset in good time and was happy with it 1 
ive never been more insulted or felt disrespected 0 
it is so small and you dont even realize that it is there after a while of getting used to it 1 
think of the film being like a dream 1 
stay away from the q 0 
bad quality 0 
and sometimes it was so embarrassing that i had to look away 0 
just reading on the specs alone makes you say wow 1 
this item is fantastic and works perfectly 1 
as many people complained i found this headsets microphone was very weak 0 
itll be a regular stop on my trips to phoenix 1 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
my mother and brother had to do thiswhen i saw robert ryan portraying this type of man it was a very good imitation of this type of individual and i was impressed 1 
when im on this side of town this will definitely be a spot ill hit up again 1 
good show samsung 1 
the shipping time was also very quick 1 
appetite instantly gone 0 
id like to return it 0 
voice recognition is tremendous 1 
i could not recommend these more 0 
overall i would recommend this phone over the new walkman 1 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
i kept catching the cable on the seat and i had to pull the phone out to turn it on an off 0 
i really do recommend this place you can go wrong with this donut place 1 
this is not moviemaking 0 
crisp and clear 1 
im not sure what he was trying to do with this film 0 
but in any case the best part is you can download these pictures to your laptop using ir or even send pictures from your laptop to the phone 1 
we ordered the duck rare and it was pink and tender on the inside with a nice char on the outside 1 
worse theres an incredibly weak subplot thrown in that follows a little band of latterday mansonites as they go after a reporter whos working on a story on the anniversary of the killings 0 
does not work 0 
we made the drive all the way from north scottsdale and i was not one bit disappointed 1 
i literally vomited while watching this film 0 
one more thing i can tolerate political incorrectness very well im all for artistic freedom and suspension of disbelief but the slavic female character was just too much 0 
with great sound effects and impressive special effects i cant recommend this movie enough 1 
i am so tired of clichés that is just lazy writing and here they come in thick and fast 0 
the service was terrible though 0 
the writers were smack on and i think the best actors and actresses were a bonus to the showthese characters were so real 1 
this product is clearly not ready for prime time i dont care how cool it looks if you cant tell a call is coming in its worthless 0 
pricing is a bit of a concern at mellow mushroom 0 
none of them are engaging or exciting 0 
the kids are very cool too 1 
disappointing 0 
the sides are delish mixed mushrooms yukon gold puree white corn beateous 1 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
it doesnt work in europe or asia 0 
the potato chip order was sad i could probably count how many chips were in that box and it was probably around 12 0 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
you never know if you pushed it hard enough or the right number of times for the function you want or not 0 
otherwise dont even waste your time on this 0 
there is no plot or storyline 0 
the selection was probably the worst ive seen in vegasthere was none 0 
never again will i be dining at this place 0 
i really do recommend this place you can go wrong with this donut place 1 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
ray charles is legendary 1 
im probably one of the few people to ever go to ians and not like it 0 
not impressed 0 
the food was barely lukewarm so it must have been sitting waiting for the server to bring it out to us 0 
2 times very bad customer service 0 
its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
service sucks 0 
it was absolutely amazing 1 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
what a great double cheeseburger 1 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
comes with a strong light that you can use to light up your camera shots and even flash sos signals seriously 1 
1 hour 54 minutes of sheer tedium melodrama and horrible acting a mess of a script and a sinking feeling of good lord what were they thinking 0 
in my house i was getting dropped coverage upstairs and no coverage in my basement 0 
its too bad the food is so damn generic 0 
it will drive you barking mad 0 
omg i felt like i had never eaten thai food until this dish 1 
for sushi on the strip this is the place to go 1 
it was so funny 1 
having to humour him just to get by and get through the day was so apt 1 
bluetooth does not work phone locks up screens just flash up and now it just makes calls randomly while in my pocket locked 0 
the result is a powerhouse achievement made more timely now perhaps because of our cultures disturbing fascination with celebrity and its distorted interpretations of fame 1 
they dropped more than the ball 0 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
food was great and so was the serivce 1 
i loved their mussels cooked in this wine reduction the duck was tender and their potato dishes were delicious 1 
so far it has worked like a charm 1 
i even dropped this phone into a stream and it was submerged for 15 seconds and it still works great 1 
i love their fries and their beans 1 
they have been around for years and carries the highest quality of antiglare screen protector that i have found to date 1 
not good for the money 0 
juano hernandez an exceptional actor who played supporting roles in many films of the era is a proud black man who is accused of murdering a white man in the south 1 
someone shouldve invented this sooner 1 
seems like a good quick place to grab a bite of some familiar pub food but do yourself a favor and look elsewhere 0 
great steak great sides great wine amazing desserts 1 
both do good jobs and are quite amusing 1 
i waited and waited 0 
i would have casted her in that role after ready the script 1 
the chicken i got was definitely reheated and was only ok the wedges were cold and soggy 0 
this phone is slim and light and the display is beautiful 1 
does not fit 0 
it also had a new problem 0 
i have to jiggle the plug to get it to line up right to get decent volume 0 
everything about it is just bad 0 
the script is bad very bad  it contains both cheesiness and unethical joke that you normally see in rated r or nc17 movie 0 
my boyfriend tried the mediterranean chicken salad and fell in love 1 
terrible service 0 
awsome device works great 1 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
avoid at all costs 0 
the pizza tasted old super chewy in not a good way 0 
this phone works great 1 
i dont each much pasta but i love the homemade hand made pastas and thin pizzas here 1 
rating 1 out of 10 0 
problem is that the ear loops are made of weak material and break easily 0 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
voice recognition is tremendous 1 
just as good as when i had it more than a year ago 1 
omelets are to die for 1 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
i guess maybe we went on an off night but it was disgraceful 0 
they have great dinners 1 
why was this film made 0 
i dont think ive ever gone to a movie and disliked it as much 0 
waitress was good though 1 
dont make the same mistake i did 0 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
they never brought a salad we asked for 0 
when my mom and i got home she immediately got sick and she only had a few bites of salad 0 
and generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode 0 
victor mclaglen was even bad and brian donlevy was almost unrecognizable 0 
i think i was one of the people who found this another one of roths pearls 1 
the eargels channel the sound directly into your ear and seem to increase the sound volume and clarity 1 
we thought youd have to venture further away to get good sushi but this place really hit the spot that night 1 
i really hope the team behind this movie makes more movies and that they will continue to do so in their own some kinda weird style 1 
the range is very decent ive been able to roam around my house with the phone in the living room with no receptionsound quality issues 1 
an absolute must visit 1 
worst thai ever 0 
their daily specials are always a hit with my group 1 
its an empty hollow shell of a movie 0 
the dining space is tiny but elegantly decorated and comfortable 1 
the block was amazing 1 
this greedy corporation will never see another dime from me 0 
i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
lucy bell is so much higher than this crap and for her to sink this low is quite depressing 0 
elias koteasjack palance play good roles angelina is hot and gets nakedbilly drago appears in this and is cool as usual a cameo by sven ole thorsen helps make this a very enjoyable movie with good acting and a decent budget 1 
the headset fulfills my requirements so i am happy with my purchase 1 
talk about great customer service of course we will be back 1 
too politically correct 0 
and the rest of it just sits there being awful with soldiers singing songs about the masculinity they pledge themselves to hairsplitting about purity the admiration of swords etc 0 
i felt as though her going to ireland did absolutely nothing whatsoever 0 
i highly recommend this case 1 
not my thing 0 
the management is rude 0 
food was delicious 1 
some may say this buffet is pricey but i think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot 1 
excellent bluetooth headset 1 
one more thing i can tolerate political incorrectness very well im all for artistic freedom and suspension of disbelief but the slavic female character was just too much 0 
the shipping time was also very quick 1 
im pleased 1 
victor mclaglen was even bad and brian donlevy was almost unrecognizable 0 
the desserts were a bit strange 0 
the vegetables are so fresh and the sauce feels like authentic thai 1 
honeslty it didnt taste that fresh 0 
ray charles is legendary 1 
my mother and brother had to do thiswhen i saw robert ryan portraying this type of man it was a very good imitation of this type of individual and i was impressed 1 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
a great touch 1 
highquality chicken on the chicken caesar salad 1 
the camera although rated at an impressive 13 megapixels renders images that fall well below expectations of such a relatively high resolution 0 
seriously flavorful delights folks 1 
i had absolutely no problem with this headset linking to my 8530 blackberry curve 1 
it was attached to a gas station and that is rarely a good sign 0 
the greek dressing was very creamy and flavorful 1 
and i just love the colors 1 
by this time our side of the restaurant was almost empty so there was no excuse 0 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
great character actors telly savalas and peter boyle 1 
i wish i could enter negative values admins 0 
still waiting im sure this item would work well if i ever recieve it 0 
the microphone also works well but according to people i have called it applifies everything 1 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
its like a bad two hour tv movie 0 
service is friendly and inviting 1 
also great directing and photography 1 
i love this phone 1 
i have purchased these for both family and friends and all enjoy their clarity and ease of use 1 
no im going to eat the potato that i found some strangers hair in it 0 
must have been an off night at this place 0 
but the duet between the astronaut and his doctor at the beginning of the movie is a perfect exchange if one considers that this movie was made well into the cold war and the astronauts biggest fear is that he has crashed in the ussr 1 
i have had tmobile service for 2 or 3 years now and i am pretty happy with it 1 
dee snider just plain sucks 0 
its the one movie that never ceases to interest me simply because it keeps me alert as i try to attempt to decipher its meanings 1 
bland not a liking this place for a number of reasons and i dont want to waste time on bad reviewing ill leave it at that 0 
terrible phone holder 0 
its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
i hate movies like that 0 
the file browser offers all the options that one needshandsfree is great 1 
we waited for forty five minutes in vain 0 
as for the killer dont expect anything original or even remotely frightening 0 
very pleased with this headset 1 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
it did not work in my cell phone plug i am very up set with the charger 0 
the headset fulfills my requirements so i am happy with my purchase 1 
but this movie is definitely a below average rent 0 
after one bite i was hooked 1 
however after about a year the fliptop started to get loose and wobbly and eventually my screen went black and i couldnt receive and place calls 0 
watching washing machine twirling around wouldnt hurt your eyes as much as this show 0 
see it 1 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
i dont know what the big deal is about this place but i wont be back yaall 0 
we wont be going back 0 
buyerbe very careful 0 
how awful she is 0 
very disappointed 0 
overall i like there food and the service 1 
doesnt work 0 
horrible 0 
if you have several dozen or several hundred contacts then imagine the fun of sending each of them one by one 0 
it is light has plenty of battery capacity and is very confortable to wear for somewhat extended periods of time 1 
i can assure you that you wont be disappointed 1 
totally different with loads of understatement and black comedy this is a film few get to see but those who do will remember it 1 
the performances are real and gripping the crocdodile is extremely well done indeed if the black water website is to be believed thats because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous 1 
i saw this short film on hbo the other day and absolutely loved it 1 
i got this phone on reccomendation from a relative and im glad i did 1 
there is no plot or storyline 0 
everything was perfect the night we were in 1 
but its just not funny 0 
terrible service 0 
great place to eat reminds me of the little mom and pop shops in the san francisco bay area 1 
youd have to have the iq of particularly stupid mollusk not to see that one coming 0 
kids pizza is always a hit too with lots of great side dish options for the kiddos 1 
in other words the content level of this film is enough to easily fill a dozen other films 1 
steamboat willie is an amazingly important film to our cinema history 1 
awesome service and food 1 
great place to relax and have an awesome burger and beer 1 
didnt laugh or even smile once 0 
i wouldnt return 0 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
i really hope the team behind this movie makes more movies and that they will continue to do so in their own some kinda weird style 1 
sorry i will not be getting food from here anytime soon 0 
good case excellent value 1 
i love the ringtones because they are so upbeat 1 
in summary this was a largely disappointing dining experience 0 
yes i am simplifying things here for the sake of brevity for this really is at the core of the problems with this film it has too much going on without any real fulfilling explanation 0 
i struggle to find anything bad to say about it 1 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
not nearly as good looking as the amazon picture makes it look 0 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
even in my bmw 3 series which is fairly quiet i have trouble hearing what the other person is saying 0 
enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film 1 
the hockey scenes are terrible defensemen playing like theyre 5 years old goalies diving at shots that are 10 feet wide of the net etc 0 
very windresistant 1 
dont miss it 1 
i ordered albondigas soup which was just warm and tasted like tomato soup with frozen meatballs 0 
we have gotten a lot of compliments on it 1 
i dont have very many words to say about this place but it does everything pretty well 1 
despite the pans of reviewers i liked this movie 1 
bad choice 0 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
10 out of 10 for both the movie and trilogy 1 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
this was my first and only vegas buffet and it did not disappoint 1 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
the construction of the headsets is poor 0 
also the area where my unit broke im not too fond of the magnetic strap 0 
i have yet to run this new battery below two bars and thats three days without charging 1 
but i thought his acting was skilled 1 
the cast was great 1 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
the food is good 1 
10 out of 10 for both the movie and trilogy 1 
i think it was robert ryans best film because he portrayed someone like my father and he was a schizophrenic in real lifemy father although he never murdered anyone but was affected more so during the second world war which made him worse 1 
the food was terrible 0 
very disappointed 0 
you wont regret it 1 
not easy to watch 0 
i got the car charger and not even after a week the charger was brokeni went to plug it in and it started smoking 0 
i recommend igo to anyone with different brand cell phonesmp3 players in the family 1 
imdb ratings only go as low 1 for awful its time to get some negative numbers in there for cases such as these 0 
no real improvement 0 
the food is very good for your typical bar food 1 
comes with a strong light that you can use to light up your camera shots and even flash sos signals seriously 1 
i would have given no star if i was able 0 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
if you havent choked in your own vomit by the end by all the cheap drama and worthless dialogue youve must have bored yourself to death with this waste of time 0 
i can assure you that you wont be disappointed 1 
it was attached to a gas station and that is rarely a good sign 0 
if this premise sound stupid thats because it is 0 
but then they came back cold 0 
great pizza and salads 1 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
thank you for such great service 1 
food was so gooodd 1 
on a positive note our server was very attentive and provided great service 1 
the tracfonewebsite is user friendly and makes it easy toactivate etc 1 
from what my dinner companions told meeverything was very fresh with nice texture and taste 1 
the camera on the phone may be used as a dustpan when indoors id rather be using a disposable then this 0 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
i got it because it was so small and adorable 1 
i dont think i will be back for a very long time 0 
i let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this bad idea we both hated it 0 
in fact this stinker smells like a directtovideo release 0 
krussel always good 1 
by the time the film ended i not only disliked it i despised it 0 
i enjoyed it 1 
i always order from the vegetarian menu during dinner which has a wide array of options to choose from 1 
the only good thing was that it fits comfortably on small ears 1 
works like a charm it work the same as the one i got with the phone 1 
awsome device works great 1 
a very good film indeed about great and unconditional love 1 
the first time i ever came here i had an amazing experience i still tell people how awesome the duck was 1 
i will come back here every time im in vegas 1 
bad purchase 0 
cute quaint simple honest 1 
go to place for gyros 1 
great product and price 1 
my breakfast was perpared great with a beautiful presentation of 3 giant slices of toast lightly dusted with powdered sugar 1 
i cant wait to go back 1 
so good i am going to have to review this place twice once hereas a tribute to the place and once as a tribute to an event held here last night 1 
my sashimi was poor quality being soggy and tasteless 0 
after two i felt disgusting 0 
he surely doesnt know how to make a coherent action movie from the screenwriter of air force one who was only obliged to write the script just for a big sum of money 0 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
the cinematography is simply stunning to say the least and the fx are nothing if not stateoftheart 1 
those burgers were amazing 1 
it really is impressive that the place hasnt closed down 0 
worst ever 0 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
all it took was one drop from about 6 inches above the kitchen counter and it was crackedi am not impressed and i am not laughing 0 
dessert panna cotta was amazing 1 
i was hoping for more 0 
all in all i can assure you ill be back 1 
if you are razr owneryou must have this 1 
his losing his marbles so early in the proceedings is totally implausible and unconvincing 0 
however i recently watched the whole thing again on dvd and i was completely struck by how extremely stupid the storyline was how it contained holes inconsistencies and frankly a whole lot of crap and how horrid the dancing was 0 
their daily specials are always a hit with my group 1 
the acting by the whole cast could be put on a scale and balanced perfectly between overacting and underacting 0 
dont waste your time 0 
crash is a depressing little nothing that provokes emotion but teaches you nothing if you already know racism and prejudice are bad things 0 
good protection and does not make phone too bulky 1 
what makes this story different are the terrific production values faultless photography composition and editing the terrific casting the underappreciated brian keith playing a bully teddy and vivid history 1 
this particular model would not work with my motorola q smartphone 0 
not easy to watch 0 
now imagine that every single one of those decisions was made wrong 0 
its not hard to make a decent hamburger 0 
an interesting premise and billy drago is always good as a dangerous nutbag side note id love to see drago stephen mchattie and lance hendrikson in a flick together talk about raging cheekbones 1 
its kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly its embarrassing how childlike the company is 0 
i have been in more than a few bars in vegas and do not ever recall being charged for tap water 0 
the staff is friendly and the joint is always clean 1 
it is well made easy to access the phone and has a handy detachable belt clip 1 
total waste of time 0 
did not like at all 0 
phone now holds charge like it did when it was new 1 
oh this is such a thing of beauty this restaurant 1 
it was so boring 0 
i find this inexcusable and so will probably be returning this phone and perhaps changing carriers 0 
but i thought his acting was skilled 1 
my brother in law who works at the mall ate here same day and guess what he was sick all night too 0 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
clear crisp sound 1 
the lines the cuts the audio everything is wrong 0 
overall i am psyched to have a phone which has all my appointments and contacts in and gets great reception 1 
my rating just 3 out of 10 0 
saggy floppy piece of junk 0 
have been going since 2007 and every meal has been awesome 1 
it felt too light and tinny 0 
go rent it 1 
after the first charge kept going dead after 12 minutes 0 
very clear quality sound and you dont have to mess with the sound on your ipod since you have the sound buttons on the headset 1 
but then they came back cold 0 
during several different 2 minute calls i experienced 5 drops and it was in an area that had 5 bars 0 
all the other cases ive tried normally fall apart after a few months but this one seems to be in for the long haul 1 
i really like this product over the motorola because it is allot clearer on the ear piece and the mic 1 
it probably would have been better if the director hadnt spent most of the movie showcasing his own art work which really isnt that noteworthy 0 
i was very disappointed in the movie 0 
the burger had absolutely no flavor the meat itself was totally bland the burger was overcooked and there was no charcoal flavor 0 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
the vanilla ice cream was creamy and smooth while the profiterole choux pastry was fresh enough 1 
food arrived quickly 1 
this place is handsdown one of the best places to eat in the phoenix metro area 1 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
great pizza and salads 1 
the worst was the salmon sashimi 0 
we literally sat there for 20 minutes with no one asking to take our order 0 
he came running after us when he realized my husband had left his sunglasses on the table 1 
i hate those things as much as cheap quality black olives 0 
the staff is great the food is delish and they have an incredible beer selection 1 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
every time he opened his mouth you expect to hear you see kids pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show 0 
great pork sandwich 1 
everything captain howdy says is either laughable or just plain stupid 0 
we had fantastic service and were pleased by the atmosphere 1 
level 5 spicy was perfect where spice didnt overwhelm the soup 1 
good service very clean and inexpensive to boot 1 
interesting decor 1 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
and his subtle connections between the three films are awesome 1 
fantastic buy and will get again for whatever my next phone is 1 
i love this phone 1 
nevertheless yet another wonderful film from the great masters stable 1 
it always cuts out and makes a beep beep beep sound then says signal failed 0 
ill even say it again  this is torture 0 
unfortunately we must have hit the bakery on leftover day because everything we ordered was stale 0 
i use this product in a motor control center where there is a lot of high voltage humming from the equipment and it works great 1 
nice case feels good in your hands 1 
buttons are too small 0 
waste of money 0 
unfortunately any virtue in this films production work was lost on a regrettable script 0 
my ribeye steak was cooked perfectly and had great mesquite flavor 1 
i think the most wonderful parts literally full of wonder are the excerpts from his works 1 
this product is clearly not ready for prime time i dont care how cool it looks if you cant tell a call is coming in its worthless 0 
we walked away stuffed and happy about our first vegas buffet experience 1 
youll love it 1 
both actors truly understand and become their particular character delivering a convincing sincere performance 1 
awsome device works great 1 
poor talk time performance 0 
we wont be returning 0 
i am far from a sushi connoisseur but i can definitely tell the difference between good food and bad food and this was certainly bad food 0 
the food is not tasty at all not to say its real traditional hunan style 0 
i wasted my little money with this earpiece 0 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
very funny 1 
the chips and salsa were really good the salsa was very fresh 1 
i liked it 1 
unfortunately any virtue in this films production work was lost on a regrettable script 0 
the food was outstanding and the prices were very reasonable 1 
i connected my wifes bluetoothmotorola hs850 to my phone and it worked like a charm whether the phone was in my pocket or the case 1 
when i received my pita it was huge it did have a lot of meat in it so thumbs up there 1 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
how can that bethe audio quality is poor 0 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
the fried rice was dry as well 0 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
this is truly an art movieit actually has a lot of art in it 1 
dont make the same mistake i did 0 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
i love that they put their food in nice plastic containers as opposed to cramming it in little paper takeout boxes 1 
not enough volume 0 
buttons are too small 0 
i have bought this nokia cell phone a few weeks ago and it was a nightmare 0 
as many people complained i found this headsets microphone was very weak 0 
brilliance indeed 1 
the manager was the worst 0 
appetite instantly gone 0 
the selection on the menu was great and so were the prices 1 
it isnt even an achievement as a sobaditsgood or sobaditsmemorable movie 0 
and generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode 0 
but in terms of the writing its very fresh and bold 1 
kind of flops around 0 
a truly truly bad film 0 
i immediately said i wanted to talk to the manager but i did not want to talk to the guy who was doing shots of fireball behind the bar 0 
i was left shattered from the experience of watching this film and i took a good two hours to fully recover 0 
i love this bluetooth 1 
if you simply want a small flip phone look elsewhere as the extra bells whistles are mediocre 0 
trouble is the writing and directing make it impossible to establish those things that make a movie watchable like character story theme and so on 0 
truly awful 0 
i was left shattered from the experience of watching this film and i took a good two hours to fully recover 0 
after i pulled up my car i waited for another 15 minutes before being acknowledged 0 
bad day or not i have a very low tolerance for rude customer service people it is your job to be nice and polite wash dishes otherwise 0 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
it was a long time that i didnt see a so charismatic actor on screen 1 
this is essentially a communications tool that does not communicate 0 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
today was my first taste of a buldogis gourmet hot dog and i have to tell you it was more than i ever thought possible 1 
service is quick and friendly 1 
i wear glasses and it fits fine with them 1 
worst hour and a half of my lifeoh my gosh 0 
the movie had you on the edge of your seat and made you somewhat afraid to go to your car at the end of the night 1 
characters are onedimensional even the good guys and especially the bad guys 0 
they really want to make your experience a good one 1 
design flaw 0 
a very very very slowmoving aimless movie about a distressed drifting young man 0 
do not buy do not buyit sucks 0 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
it did not work in my cell phone plug i am very up set with the charger 0 
this phone is pretty sturdy and ive never had any large problems with it 1 
i will come back here every time im in vegas 1 
it makes very strange ticking noises before it ends the call 0 
the only suspense i was feeling was the frustration at just how retarded the girls were 0 
the screen size is big key pad lit well enough and the camera quality is excellent for a camera phone 1 
this was my first time and i cant wait until the next 1 
nothing new there 0 
good case 1 
it sure does beat the nachos at the movies but i would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant 0 
see it with your kids if you have a chanceit will open up some amazing dialog about how far race relations have come in the last 50 years 1 
his costars dont fare much better with people like morgan freeman jonah hill and ed helms just wasted 0 
didnt laugh or even smile once 0 
i dont think you will be disappointed 1 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
great price also 1 
very nice and relaxing late night viewing 1 
artless camerawork endlessly presents us with the ugliest setting imaginable ie 0 
the food was great as always compliments to the chef 1 
interesting decor 1 
works fine 1 
the characters are interesting and you really care for them 1 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
the cinematographyif it can be called thatsucked 0 
my first visit to hiro was a delight 1 
the menu had so much good stuff on it i could not decide 1 
i do think tom hanks is a good actor 1 
the dialogue is composed of things that make little sense 0 
this is one of the better buffets that i have been to 1 
dont miss it 1 
with great sound effects and impressive special effects i cant recommend this movie enough 1 
if she had not rolled the eyes we may have stayed not sure if we will go back and try it again 0 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
i wear glasses and it fits fine with them 1 
great bluetooth 1 
often the dialogue doesnt really follow from one line to another or fit the surroundings 0 
same evening him and i are both drastically sick 0 
i guess maybe we went on an off night but it was disgraceful 0 
it was a drive to get there 0 
crust is not good 0 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
id like to return it 0 
the seller is very understanding and patient i would definitely buy from them again 1 
my wife had the lobster bisque soup which was lukewarm 0 
the 12 mega pixel camera being a part of a phone is reasonably good7 1 
they dropped more than the ball 0 
last time buying from you 0 
i tried talking real loud but shouting on the telephone gets old and i was still told it wasnt great 0 
my order was not correct 0 
my rating just 3 out of 10 0 
the staff is great the food is delish and they have an incredible beer selection 1 
but when i check voice mail at night the keypad backlight turns off a few seconds into the first message and then im lost 0 
i hate to disagree with my fellow yelpers but my husband and i were so disappointed with this place 0 
the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach 0 
a very very very slowmoving aimless movie about a distressed drifting young man 0 
the volume switch rocketed out of the unit to a destination unknown 0 
bt50 battery junk 0 
strike 2 who wants to be rushed 0 
yes this film does require a rather significant amount of puzzlesolving but the pieces fit together to create a beautiful picture 1 
i had a pretty satifying experience 1 
dont buy it 0 
steamboat willie is an amazingly important film to our cinema history 1 
personally i think it shows that people should learn to find a compromise them self without involving other people into issue 1 
his performance is simply genius 1 
i would avoid this place if you are staying in the mirage 0 
very disappointing 0 
their monster chicken fried steak and eggs is my all time favorite 1 
the buffet at bellagio was far from what i anticipated 0 
due to this happening on every call i was forced to stop using this headset 0 
they made this case too small and is very difficult to install 0 
i gave it 5 stars then and im giving it 5 stars now 1 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
i received it quickly and it works great 1 
not recommended 0 
hard to judge whether these sides were good because we were grossed out by the melted styrofoam and didnt want to eat it for fear of getting sick 0 
seriously its not worth wasting your or your kids time on 0 
there are so many problems i dont know where to start 0 
it didnt make me scared horrified or make me sympathetic towards the characters it was simply annoying 0 
great case and price 1 
oh the charger seems to work fine 1 
i came over from verizon because cingulair has nicer cell phones the first thing i noticed was the really bad service 0 
do not buy do not buyit sucks 0 
its like a bad two hour tv movie 0 
a cheap and cheerless heist movie with poor characterisation lots of underbite style stoic emoting think chow yun fat in a better tomorrow and some cheesy clichés thrown into an abandoned factory ready for a few poorly executed flying judo rolls a la john woo 0 
server did a great job handling our large rowdy table 1 
a truly truly bad film 0 
so anyone near you will hear part of your conversation 0 
not impressed 0 
i was left shattered from the experience of watching this film and i took a good two hours to fully recover 0 
definitely worth checking out 1 
drinks took close to 30 minutes to come out at one point 0 
if you plan to use this in a car forget about it 0 
woa talk about awful 0 
i left the theater with a lilt in my step joy in my heart and hope for the human race 1 
the fish is badly made and some of its underwater shots are repeated a thousand times in the film 0 
great it was new packaged nice works good no problems and it came in less time then i expected 1 
he came running after us when he realized my husband had left his sunglasses on the table 1 
this place is way too overpriced for mediocre food 0 
pricing is a bit of a concern at mellow mushroom 0 
we have tried 2 units and they both failed within 2 months pros 0 
performed awful muffled tinny incoming sound and severe echo for those on the other end of the call 0 
and the rest of it just sits there being awful with soldiers singing songs about the masculinity they pledge themselves to hairsplitting about purity the admiration of swords etc 0 
a good film by a great director 1 
the service was extremely slow 0 
the chicken i got was definitely reheated and was only ok the wedges were cold and soggy 0 
im returning them 0 
highly unrecommended 0 
how can you call yourself a steakhouse if you cant properly cook a steak i dont understand 0 
then i watched it again two sundays ago march 20th 2005 and i began to really enjoy it and this time i taped the entire thing 1 
in addition to having one of the most lovely songs ever written french cancan also boasts one of the cutest leading ladies ever to grace the screen 1 
the staff are great the ambiance is great 1 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
total waste of time 0 
poor construction 0 
setup went very smoothly 1 
ive seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie 0 
what a waste of time 0 
my mother and brother had to do thiswhen i saw robert ryan portraying this type of man it was a very good imitation of this type of individual and i was impressed 1 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
it didnt work people can not hear me when i talk 0 
greatno problems at all 1 
i dont think you will be disappointed 1 
we wont be returning 0 
the stories were as unbelievable as the actors 0 
this is definitely a cult classic well worth viewing and sharing with others 1 
drinks took close to 30 minutes to come out at one point 0 
oh this is such a thing of beauty this restaurant 1 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach 0 
but this movie is definitely a below average rent 0 
i bought this battery with a coupon from amazon and im very happy with my purchase 1 
judith light is one of my favorite actresses and i think she does a superb job in this film 1 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
the battery runs down quickly 0 
you need two hands to operate the screenthis software interface is decade old and cannot compete with new software designs 0 
motorola finally got the voice quality of a bluetooth headset right 1 
its kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly its embarrassing how childlike the company is 0 
the new characters werent all that memorable and i found myself forgetting who was who 0 
both do good jobs and are quite amusing 1 
but it is great i would really recommend it 1 
worst thai ever 0 
worst phone ever 0 
it is well made easy to access the phone and has a handy detachable belt clip 1 
it is just the sort of pap that is screened in the afternoon to punish the unemployed for not having jobs 0 
i tried talking real loud but shouting on the telephone gets old and i was still told it wasnt great 0 
ill definitely be in soon again 1 
highly recommend for any one who has a blue tooth phone 1 
the service was great even the manager came and helped with our table 1 
there is really nothing for me at postinos hope your experience is better 0 
dont make the same mistake i did 0 
if you plan to use this in a car forget about it 0 
all the other cases ive tried normally fall apart after a few months but this one seems to be in for the long haul 1 
if you do watch it however there are small consolations the actresses playing annes sisters each do a wonderful job with their roles 1 
this is a great place to eat 1 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
there are so many problems i dont know where to start 0 
i went to bachi burger on a friends recommendation and was not disappointed 1 
this phone works great 1 
i found a six inch long piece of wire in my salsa 0 
the only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port irda 0 
this place is like chipotle but better 1 
i can think of no other film where something vitally important occurs every other minute 1 
well never go again 0 
i was very disappointed in the movie 0 
if you have several dozen or several hundred contacts then imagine the fun of sending each of them one by one 0 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
it looks very nice 1 
i ended up sliding it on the edge of my pants or back pockets instead 1 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
the earpiece on this is too large or too heavyit keeps falling out of my ear 0 
im surprised this is a good quality car charger and theres not much reviews about it 1 
it felt like a very gripping intelligent stage play but without the overly theatrical feeling one actually gets from watching people on a stage which plays on everyones terror of a white lie escalating to monstrous consequences 1 
an excellent new restaurant by an experienced frenchman 1 
the pizza tasted old super chewy in not a good way 0
