i saw mirrormask last night and it was an unsatisfactory experience 0 
restored my phone to like new performance 1 
highly recommend for any one who has a blue tooth phone 1 
i was bored throughout the whole damn thing 0 
this is a great restaurant at the mandalay bay 1 
dont buy this product 0 
as for the service i thought it was good 1 
that movie was bad 0 
i knew when i saw the film that more great things were to come from this gifted actor 1 
he was extremely rude and really there are so many other restaurants i would love to dine at during a weekend in vegas 0 
if you are looking for a good quality motorola headset keep looking this isnt it 0 
the atmosphere is modern and hip while maintaining a touch of coziness 1 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
avoid at any and all costs 0 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
instead we got a bore fest about a whiny spoiled brat babysitting 0 
the headsets are easy to use and everyone loves them 1 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
just really good so far probably the best bt headset i have ever had 1 
when achille and philippa beautifully sing a duet from don giovanni that perfectly describes their situation in the movie you appreciate the subtle layers of this excellent film 1 
otherwise easy to install and use clear sound 1 
very cheap plastic creaks like an old wooden floor 0 
in fact its hard to remember that the part of ray charles is being acted and not played by the man himself 1 
soggy and not good 0 
exceptionally bad 0 
he came running after us when he realized my husband had left his sunglasses on the table 1 
sauce was tasteless 0 
camera color balance is awful 0 
you learn a lot about the real inside emotions of people in this movie and a lot about the movie business itself 1 
unfortunately it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees 0 
anyway the plot flowed smoothly and the malebonding scenes were a hoot 1 
damn good steak 1 
in short dont bother with this movie 0 
each track commands sentiment actually contributing to the scenes and characters 1 
the worst phone from samsungcrap this crappy samsung e715 is the worst i have ever seeen 0 
instead we got a bore fest about a whiny spoiled brat babysitting 0 
macbeth jason connery moved me to tears with his final monolog out brief candle outhe gave the sphere of moral decay and dark forces a human face which makes it the more interesting 1 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
graphics is far from the best part of the game 0 
save your money ive had this item for 11 months now 0 
this scene is very strong and unpleasant 0 
sucked most of the stuff does not work with my phone 0 
this product is great it makes working a lot easier i can go to the copier while waiting on hold for something 1 
nevertheless yet another wonderful film from the great masters stable 1 
works fine 1 
id like to return it 0 
i wasnt the least bit interested 0 
good transmit audio 1 
it failed to convey the broad sweep of landscapes that were a great part of the original 0 
ill be looking for a new earpiece 0 
the last 15 minutes of movie are also not bad as well 1 
there was so much hype over this phone that i assumed it was the best my mistake 0 
avoid at all cost 0 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
the burger i got the gold standard a 17 burger and was kind of disappointed 0 
characters are onedimensional even the good guys and especially the bad guys 0 
now this is a movie i really dislike 0 
sending it back 0 
the only place good for this film is in the garbage 0 
food arrived quickly 1 
cant store anything but phone numbers to sim 0 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
how can anyone in their right mind ask for anything more from a movie than this 1 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
pricing is a bit of a concern at mellow mushroom 0 
today the graphics are crap 0 
this movie does an excellent job of revealing the complexity of the task and the incredible challenges facing south africa 1 
i highly recommend this case 1 
the jabra eargels fit my ears very well 1 
this device is great in several situations1 1 
i wouldnt see this movie again for free 0 
the color is even prettier than i thought it would be and the graphics are incredibly sharp 1 
the last 15 minutes of movie are also not bad as well 1 
service sucks 0 
this place receives stars for their appetizers 1 
the buffet at bellagio was far from what i anticipated 0 
i left the theater with a lilt in my step joy in my heart and hope for the human race 1 
not impressed 0 
horrible phone 0 
punishment park is a brilliant piece of cinema 1 
we watched our waiter pay a lot more attention to other tables and ignore us 0 
the grilled chicken was so tender and yellow from the saffron seasoning 1 
i took back my money and got outta there 0 
definitely worth checking out 1 
trying to make a call on these is an exercise in frustration 0 
but now i was completely grossed out 0 
happy so far 1 
the pan cakes everyone are raving about taste like a sugary disaster tailored to the palate of a six year old 0 
its not what it says it is 0 
setup went very smoothly 1 
because both ears are occupied background is not distracting at all 1 
its a mediocre miserable hollow laughable and predictable piece of garbage 0 
it is light easy to use and has very clear reception and transmission 1 
maybe if they werent cold they would have been somewhat edible 0 
good case excellent value 1 
this movie totally grates on my nerves 0 
overall i was not impressed and would not go back 0 
the headset fulfills my requirements so i am happy with my purchase 1 
a pretty good product 1 
main thing i didnt enjoy is that the crowd is of older crowd around mid 30s and up 0 
a film not easily forgotten 1 
lately they have been extremely nice and helpful on the phone 1 
the battery life is highly unacceptable 0 
first of all it doesnt wear well 0 
service is friendly and inviting 1 
we are so glad we found this place 1 
the delivery was on time 1 
this gets a 1 out of 10 simply because theres nothing lower 0 
seller shipped quickly and much cheaper than the competitors 1 
at first glance it is a lovely bakery cafe nice ambiance clean friendly staff 1 
restored my phone to like new performance 1 
however bt headsets are currently not good for real time games like firstperson shooters since the audio delay messes me up 0 
nothing at all to recommend 0 
the battery is completely useless to me 0 
after the disappointing dinner we went elsewhere for dessert 0 
just does not work 0 
as for the mains also uninspired 0 
they have great dinners 1 
every thing on phone work perfectly she like it 1 
if you havent gone here go now 1 
and i really did find them funny 1 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
not what i wanted 0 
nothing at all to recommend 0 
gets a signal when other verizon phones wont 1 
his costars dont fare much better with people like morgan freeman jonah hill and ed helms just wasted 0 
setup went very smoothly 1 
this movie is possibly one of the most creative works of horror ever 1 
i loved it 1 
the food was excellent and service was very good 1 
they have great dinners 1 
terrible service 0 
doesnt hold charge 0 
the chefs were friendly and did a good job 1 
its pure brilliance 1 
a film not easily forgotten 1 
one more thing i can tolerate political incorrectness very well im all for artistic freedom and suspension of disbelief but the slavic female character was just too much 0 
very pleased with this headset 1 
this is an excellent film 1 
i think i was one of the people who found this another one of roths pearls 1 
full of unconvincing cardboard characters it is blandly written by edward chodorov who also produced and is surprisingly directed by jean negulesco from whom one would expect a great deal more 0 
worked very well paired with a treo 700w and as a skype headset on my pc using a usb bluetooth transceiver 1 
i got the aluminum case for my new palm vx and it worked really wellit has protected my handheld perfectly so far 1 
gets a signal when other verizon phones wont 1 
i wish i could enter negative values admins 0 
its a piece of crap 0 
on the up side their cafe serves really good food 1 
what a waste of money and time 0 
its very slow 0 
not loud enough and doesnt turn on like it should 0 
i also decided not to send it back because our waitress looked like she was on the verge of having a heart attack 0 
i wasted my little money with this earpiece 0 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
i would not recommend this place 0 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
my experience was terrible this was my fourth bluetooth headset and while it was much more comfortable than my last jabra which i hated 0 
the tracfonewebsite is user friendly and makes it easy toactivate etc 1 
the biggest complaint i have is the battery drains superfast 0 
nargile i think you are great 1 
i had absolutely no problem with this headset linking to my 8530 blackberry curve 1 
i guess i should have known that this place would suck because it is inside of the excalibur but i didnt use my common sense 0 
waiter was a jerk 0 
an awesome new look for fall 2000 1 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
so i bought about 10 of these and saved alot of money 1 
anyways the food was definitely not filling at all and for the price you pay you should expect more 0 
the best place in vegas for breakfast just check out a sat or sun 1 
the plastic breaks really easy on this clip 0 
its too bad that everyone else involved didnt share crowes level of dedication to quality for if they did wed have a far better film on our hands than this subpar mess 0 
this movie is greatespecially if you enjoy visual arts 1 
worst thai ever 0 
ordered an appetizer and took 40 minutes and then the pizza another 10 minutes 0 
camerawork again bad 0 
there is a totally unnecessary trainroller coaster scene 0 
this is an outstanding little restaurant with some of the best food i have ever tasted 1 
very very disappointed ordered the 35 big bay plater 0 
it didnt make me scared horrified or make me sympathetic towards the characters it was simply annoying 0 
excellent service 1 
definitely a turn off for me i doubt ill be back unless someone else is buying 0 
an hour seriously 0 
he also came back to check on us regularly excellent service 1 
if only someone involved with it knew how to string together narrative 0 
we ordered some old classics and some new dishes after going there a few times and were sorely disappointed with everything 0 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
no plot whatsoever 0 
on the ground right next to our table was a large smeared beensteppedinandtrackedeverywhere pile of green bird poop 0 
but the actingeven that of such professionals as drago and debbie rochonwas terrible the directing worse perhaps contributory to the former the dialog chimplike and the camera work barely tolerable 0 
the two main characters may be two of the most believable children i ever saw put on screen 1 
everything about it is just bad 0 
dont buy it 0 
the ear buds only play music in one ear 0 
the mic there is a joke and the volume is quite low 0 
pretty good beer selection too 1 
its extremely slow and takes forever to do anything with it 0 
dont bother go to the store 0 
its this pandering to the audience that sabotages most of his films 0 
the plot is nonsense that doesnt interest in the slightest way or have any uniqueness to it 0 
the acting is fantastic the stories are seamlessly woven together and the dogs are splendid a must rent view or see 1 
thats how id describe this painfully dreary timewaster of a film 0 
then a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use 0 
he is one of my favourite directors and one of the most talented directors in the history of cinema 1 
it was probably dirt 0 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
this may be the only bad film he ever made 0 
the lead man is charismafree 0 
i wear glasses and it fits fine with them 1 
go watch it 1 
by the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant i was bored and didnt care what happened next and so i switched off 0 
im really disappointed all i have now is a charger that doesnt work 0 
arrived quickly and much less expensive than others being sold 1 
i think that it is a must see older john wayne film 1 
i found a six inch long piece of wire in my salsa 0 
things that went wrong they burned the saganaki 0 
my only problem is i thought the actor playing the villain was a low rent michael ironside 0 
the very idea of it was lame take a minor character from a mediocre pg13 film and make a complete nonsequel while changing its tone to a pgrated family movie 0 
this one is simply a disappointment 0 
not worth it 0 
it is simple to use and i like it 1 
the plot is nonsense that doesnt interest in the slightest way or have any uniqueness to it 0 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
also the story and acting were weak 0 
voice quality signal strength dropped calls 0 
the camera although rated at an impressive 13 megapixels renders images that fall well below expectations of such a relatively high resolution 0 
he is an amazing film artist one of the most important whoever lived 1 
great phone 1 
trouble is the writing and directing make it impossible to establish those things that make a movie watchable like character story theme and so on 0 
beware this is not a trashy cult movie this is trash period 0 
my only problem is i thought the actor playing the villain was a low rent michael ironside 0 
the soundtrack wasnt terrible either 1 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
it fits so securely that the ear hook does not even need to be used and the sound is better directed through your ear canal 1 
cant get the software to work with my computer 0 
small sleek impressive looking practical setup with ample storage in place 1 
the burger i got the gold standard a 17 burger and was kind of disappointed 0 
this is the phone to get for 2005 i just bought my s710a and all i can say is wow 1 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
the sweet potato fries were very good and seasoned well 1 
if you simply want a small flip phone look elsewhere as the extra bells whistles are mediocre 0 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
it has all the features i want 1 
the whole experience was underwhelming and i think well just go to ninja sushi next time 0 
the script is bad very bad  it contains both cheesiness and unethical joke that you normally see in rated r or nc17 movie 0 
you could only take 2 videos at a time and the quality was very poor 0 
i felt insulted and disrespected how could you talk and judge another human being like that 0 
went in for happy hour great list of wines 1 
it quit working after id used it for about 18 months so i just purchased another one because this is the best headset ive ever owned 1 
the warmth it generates is in contrast to its austere backdrop 1 
i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
every thing on phone work perfectly she like it 1 
best tacos in town by far 1 
works like a charm it work the same as the one i got with the phone 1 
the shipping time was also very quick 1 
there is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again 0 
voice quality signal strength dropped calls 0 
their research and development division obviously knows what theyre doing 1 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
however the ear pads come off easily and after only one week i lost one 0 
the film has great actors a master director a significant themeat least a wouldbe significant theme undertone of fifties existential worldweariness aerial scenes that ought to have thrilled both senses and imagination and characters about which one might deeply care 1 
first time going but i think i will quickly become a regular 1 
lame would be the best way to describe it 0 
some may say this buffet is pricey but i think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot 1 
we waited for forty five minutes in vain 0 
my brother in law who works at the mall ate here same day and guess what he was sick all night too 0 
service was very prompt 1 
emily watsons character is very strong and she has only to give a quick glance and you understand everything 1 
5 stars for the brick oven bread app 1 
voice recognition is tremendous 1 
this device is great in several situations1 1 
i love this cable it allows me to connect any miniusb device to my pc 1 
the management is rude 0 
ample portions and good prices 1 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
prosgood camera very nice pictures also has cool styles like black and white and more 1 
as for the mains also uninspired 0 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
the writer gorman bechard undoubtedly did his homework because all references are industry and characterage appropriate 1 
none of the three sizes they sent with the headset would stay in my ears 0 
i really wanted the plantronics 510 to be the right one but it has too many issues for methe good 0 
the burger i got the gold standard a 17 burger and was kind of disappointed 0 
bad day or not i have a very low tolerance for rude customer service people it is your job to be nice and polite wash dishes otherwise 0 
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1 
looks great and is strong 1 
great product for the price 1 
an awesome new look for fall 2000 1 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
but above all the exquisite visual composition of each moment with inventive and elegant use of closeup camera angle and lighting including pointillistic faux home movie footage is a wonder and joy to behold 1 
i did not bother contacting the company for few dollar product but i learned the lesson that i should not have bought this form online anyway 0 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
the staff is always super friendly and helpful which is especially cool when you bring two small boys and a baby 1 
having trouble with volume 0 
my fella got the huevos rancheros and they didnt look too appealing 0 
i love the scream movies and all horror movies and this one ranks way up there 1 
service was very prompt 1 
one of my favorite purchases ever 1 
ive dropped my phone more times than i can say even on concrete and my phone is still great knock on wood 1 
the movie is littered with overt racial slurs towards the black cast members and in return the whites are depicted as morons and boobs 0 
the sound quality is good and functionality is awesome 1 
the real killer is the volume and of course it breaking 0 
i checked out this place a couple years ago and was not impressed 0 
the real disappointment was our waiter 0 
only like 3 or 4 buildings used a couple of locations maybe poor hummh 0 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
in short dont bother with this movie 0 
i dont think it would hold it too securly on your belt 0 
if you plan to use this in a car forget about it 0 
the jalapeno bacon is soooo good 1 
a very very very slowmoving aimless movie about a distressed drifting young man 0 
the secondary plot line is incomprehensible and its relation to the primary plot line is mystifying 0 
its a little geeky but i think thats its sex on toast and it rocks and oozes sex right down to its battery embedded sleek stylish leather case 1 
warning do not buy 0 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
i advise you to look out for it 1 
its been my choice headset for yearsgreat sound good volume good noise cancellation 1 
this is a good joint 1 
i cant see how this movie can be an inspiration to anyone to come out or overcome fear and rejection 0 
not to mention the combination of pears almonds and bacon is a big winner 1 
110 and only because there is no setting for 010 0 
the service was a little slow considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace 0 
it failed to convey the broad sweep of landscapes that were a great part of the original 0 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
i recently tried caballeros and i have been back every week since 1 
i have eaten here multiple times and each time the food was delicious 1 
i left with a stomach ache and felt sick the rest of the day 0 
the acting was decidely wooden though no worse than a period universal b movie 0 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
at least think to refill my water before i struggle to wave you over for 10 minutes 0 
nice quality build unlike some cheap s out there 1 
the food is rich so order accordingly 1 
my husband and i ate lunch here and were very disappointed with the food and service 0 
i think i was one of the people who found this another one of roths pearls 1 
but despite these few flaws this case is of exceptional quality and well worth the additional costs of owning an official oem product 1 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
it is cheap and it feel and look just as cheap 0 
this place is pretty good nice little vibe in the restaurant 1 
god and i can never get that 90 minutes back 0 
a must study for anyone interested in the worst sins of industrial design 0 
the story itself is just predictable and lazy 0 
big disappointment with calendar sync 0 
beware this is not a trashy cult movie this is trash period 0 
fantastic earphones 1 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
classywarm atmosphere fun and fresh appetizers succulent steaks baseball steak 1 
characters are onedimensional even the good guys and especially the bad guys 0 
what this film lacks is a convincing script 0 
this is hands down the best phone ive ever had 1 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
i dont recommend unless your car breaks down in front of it and you are starving 0 
unfortunately this is a bad movie that is just plain bad 0 
the crêpe was delicate and thin and moist 1 
painful on the ear 0 
but i thought his acting was skilled 1 
product was excellent and works better than the verizon one and boy was it cheaper 1 
dont waste your money and time 0 
buttons are too small 0 
some applause should be given to the prelude however 1 
the only thing that i think could improve is the sound leaks out from the headset 0 
both do good jobs and are quite amusing 1 
cute quaint simple honest 1 
drinks took close to 30 minutes to come out at one point 0 
will be back again 1 
they made this case too small and is very difficult to install 0 
the flair bartenders are absolutely amazing 1 
the jamaican mojitos are delicious 1 
so i bought about 10 of these and saved alot of money 1 
there still are good actors around 1 
i came back today since they relocated and still not impressed 0 
i heart this place 1 
it came free with a dvd player i bought but i still turned the thing off halfway through because i was embarrassed for howell 0 
it looks very nice 1 
great character actors telly savalas and peter boyle 1 
the construction of the headsets is poor 0 
sweetest phone 1 
so i am here to warn youdo not rent this movie it is the dumbest thing you have never seen 0 
this particular model would not work with my motorola q smartphone 0 
good transmit audio 1 
the success of the film depends on the casting of sydney greenstreet as the alexander yardley character 1 
very tough and very short on flavor 0 
problem is that the ear loops are made of weak material and break easily 0 
ill definitely be in soon again 1 
after a year the battery went completely dead on my headset 0 
good product good seller 1 
its a fresh subtle and rather sublime effect 1 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
great place to eat reminds me of the little mom and pop shops in the san francisco bay area 1 
rip off over charge shipping 0 
using all earpieces left or right this thing will not stay on my ear 0 
the story itself is just predictable and lazy 0 
the film gives meaning to the phrase never in the history of human conflict has so much been owed by so many to so few 1 
this is truly an art movieit actually has a lot of art in it 1 
these are fabulous 1 
this was like the final blow 0 
five star plus plus 1 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
doesnt work at all i bougth it for my l7c and its not working 0 
do not waste your time 0 
there is really nothing for me at postinos hope your experience is better 0 
unfortunately this is a bad movie that is just plain bad 0 
an italian reviewer called this a small great film and thats right 1 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
integrated seamlessly with the motorola razr phone 1 
the story itself is just predictable and lazy 0 
keep up the good work amazon 1 
hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in 0 
the calls drop the phone comes on and off at will the screen goes black and the worst of all it stops ringing intermittently 0 
awesome device 1 
it was pretty gross 0 
i received it quickly and it works great 1 
problem is that the ear loops are made of weak material and break easily 0 
it was also the right balance of war and love 1 
its pure brilliance 1 
it looses connection to the phone even when it is within a couple feet between the two 0 
also its a real treat to see anthony quinn playing crazy horse 1 
good product incredible value 1 
kind of hard to mess up a steak but they did 0 
it was horrible 0 
great movie 1 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
i recommend igo to anyone with different brand cell phonesmp3 players in the family 1 
then i exchanged for the same phone even that had the same problem 0 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
one thing i hate is the mode set button at the side 0 
great character actors telly savalas and peter boyle 1 
the ambience is wonderful and there is music playing 1 
this phone works great 1 
it only recognizes the phone as its storage device 0 
i highly recommend this movie for anyone interested in art poetry theater politics or japanese history 1 
he cant act one of the least scary villains i have ever seen he cant write did he write this damn movie in his sleep 0 
last night was my second time dining here and i was so happy i decided to go back 1 
there is a totally unnecessary trainroller coaster scene 0 
i highly recommend these and encourage people to give them a try 1 
having trouble with volume 0 
ryans bar is definitely one edinburgh establishment i wont be revisiting 0 
the fact is this film is a wonderful heartwarming tale about two people chasing their dreams 1 
my boyfriend and i sat at the bar and had a completely delightful experience 1 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
the only good thing was that it fits comfortably on small ears 1 
this is probably the most irritating show i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
he owns the film just as spacek owned coal miners daughter and quaid owned great balls of fire 1 
call me a nut but i think this is one of the best movies ever 1 
works great 1 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
small sleek impressive looking practical setup with ample storage in place 1 
this is one of the worst sandra bullock movie since speed 2 but not quite that bad 0 
there is a brilliant twist ending 1 
what a mistake that was 0 
if you simply want a small flip phone look elsewhere as the extra bells whistles are mediocre 0 
a great way to finish a great 1 
dont buy this product it fails 0 
nice docking station for home or work 1 
the characters are interesting and you want to find out more about them the longer the movie goes on and i think people will be surprised by who does and doesnt make it 1 
instead we got a bore fest about a whiny spoiled brat babysitting 0 
the food was excellent and service was very good 1 
iam very pleased with my purchase 1 
i paid too much 0 
excellent performance 1 
being a 90s child i truly enjoyed this show and i can proudly say that i enjoyed it big time and even more than the classical wb cartoons 1 
works great 1 
not good for the money 0 
it ranks highly as a great noircrimedrama incredible performances by belmondo and lino ventura 1 
my headset works just peachykeen 1 
setup went very smoothly 1 
so far so good 1 
also makes it easier to hold on to 1 
what a piece of junk i lose more calls on this phone 0 
the sound quality for the device is unacceptableunless you are in a really quiet area you almost hear nothing 0 
the attractive set used throughout most of the film is an eyepleasing gem 1 
raw and sublimely moving 1 
this was one of the worst films i have ever seen 0 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
worth every penny 1 
god and i can never get that 90 minutes back 0 
this is cool because most cases are just open there allowing the screen to get all scratched up 1 
the jamaican mojitos are delicious 1 
when achille and philippa beautifully sing a duet from don giovanni that perfectly describes their situation in the movie you appreciate the subtle layers of this excellent film 1 
punishment park is a brilliant piece of cinema 1 
the sound quality is good and functionality is awesome 1 
avoid this establishment 0 
this movie now joins revenge of the boogeyman and zombiez as part of the hellish trinity of horror films 0 
the scripting of the subtle comedy is unmatched by any movie in recent years 1 
pretty good beer selection too 1 
the owner used to work at nobu so this place is really similar for half the price 1 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
i have been very happy with the 510 and have had no complaints from any one regarding my sound quality on their end 1 
excellent short film 1 
it presents a idyllic yet serious portrayal of the ups and downs of the characters lives 1 
he surely doesnt know how to make a coherent action movie from the screenwriter of air force one who was only obliged to write the script just for a big sum of money 0 
the performances are real and gripping the crocdodile is extremely well done indeed if the black water website is to be believed thats because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous 1 
everything from acting to cinematography was solid 1 
nevertheless yet another wonderful film from the great masters stable 1 
they could serve it with just the vinaigrette and it may make for a better overall dish but it was still very good 1 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
the plot has more holes than a pair of fishnet stockings and the direction and editing is astonishingly ham fisted 0 
but the convoluted plot just didnt convince me and much of the film was watched with a weird questioning glance 0 
regardless the film fails on most levels 0 
sounds good reasonably priced and effective its that simple 1 
an amazing finale to possibly the best trilogy of all time 1 
would not reccommend 0 
enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film 1 
it came free with a dvd player i bought but i still turned the thing off halfway through because i was embarrassed for howell 0 
maybe if they werent cold they would have been somewhat edible 0 
and if that isnt enough of a mess of a movie for you the picture is also marred with a constant use of studio sets and indoor exteriors 0 
each track commands sentiment actually contributing to the scenes and characters 1 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
they have been around for years and carries the highest quality of antiglare screen protector that i have found to date 1 
never got it 0 
the only thing really worth watching was the scenery and the house because it is beautiful 1 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
the worst one of the series 0 
at a time when it seems that film animation has been dominated by disneypixars cgi masterpieces it is both refreshing and comforting to know that miyazaki is still relying on traditional handdrawn animation to tell his charming and enchanting stories 1 
but the actingeven that of such professionals as drago and debbie rochonwas terrible the directing worse perhaps contributory to the former the dialog chimplike and the camera work barely tolerable 0 
top line dont waste your time and money on this one its as bad as it comes 0 
this is a good joint 1 
it is easy to turn on and off when you are in the car and the volume controls are quite accessable 1 
my boyfriend and i sat at the bar and had a completely delightful experience 1 
a greasy unhealthy meal 0 
nice headset priced right 1 
exceptionally bad 0 
this is a disgrace 0 
if the food isnt bad enough for you then enjoy dealing with the worlds worstannoying drunk people 0 
both of them were truly unbelievably good and i am so glad we went back 1 
not a good bargain 0 
i had to go to a store and bought a new nokia phone which is working great 1 
this case seems well made 1 
it doesnt work in europe or asia 0 
but if you liked movies like the matrix and better yet their sequels i think youll appreciate the thought provoking mindblowing experience this film will give you 1 
over rated 0 
nice solid keyboard 1 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
would come back again if i had a sushi craving while in vegas 1 
but when i check voice mail at night the keypad backlight turns off a few seconds into the first message and then im lost 0 
the refried beans that came with my meal were dried out and crusty and the food was bland 0 
its a little geeky but i think thats its sex on toast and it rocks and oozes sex right down to its battery embedded sleek stylish leather case 1 
very much disappointed with this company 0 
i really do recommend this place you can go wrong with this donut place 1 
the guys all had steaks and our steak loving son who has had steak at the best and worst places said it was the best steak hes ever eaten 1 
its pure brilliance 1 
then theres the plot holes 0 
i cant use this case because the smell is disgusting 0 
i dont understand how this garbage got on the shelves of the movie store its not even a real movie 0 
just reading on the specs alone makes you say wow 1 
some highlights great quality nigiri here 1 
there is a totally unnecessary trainroller coaster scene 0 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
i will never forget it now 1 
the keyboard is a nice compromise between a full qwerty and the basic cell phone number keypad 1 
fans of the genre will be in heaven 1 
i had verizon 2 years ago and really liked their service 1 
this movie has a cutting edge to it 1 
its the best headset i have used 1 
totally believable 1 
thus far have only visited twice and the food was absolutely delicious each time 1 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
they have been around for years and carries the highest quality of antiglare screen protector that i have found to date 1 
the plot has more holes than a pair of fishnet stockings and the direction and editing is astonishingly ham fisted 0 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
this game rocks 1 
the new characters werent all that memorable and i found myself forgetting who was who 0 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
i did not expect this to be so good 1 
the chicken wings contained the driest chicken meat i have ever eaten 0 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
weve tried to like this place but after 10 times i think were done with them 0 
i just dont know how this place managed to served the blandest food i have ever eaten when they are preparing indian cuisine 0 
the wind and the lion is well written and superbly acted 1 
i really dont see how anyone could enjoy this movie 0 
the delivery was on time 1 
it was a long time that i didnt see a so charismatic actor on screen 1 
the worst phone ive ever had only had it for a few months 0 
i can say that the desserts were yummy 1 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
no real improvement 0 
the food was very good 1 
a greasy unhealthy meal 0 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
i probably would not go here again 0 
their onscreen chemistry critical to the entire film is genuine 1 
so for our enjoyment we get to see them run around play games and be dangerous 1 
bland and flavorless is a good way of describing the barely tepid meat 0 
damn good steak 1 
trying to make a call on these is an exercise in frustration 0 
the nano stated itmy son was dissapointed 0 
this is actually a very smart movie 1 
the camera really likes her in this movie 1 
all this movie does is make you sick watching all these slackers make excuses for their stupid actions for 90 minutes 0 
great pizza and salads 1 
they will customize your order any way youd like my usual is eggplant with green bean stir fry love it 1 
after the disappointing dinner we went elsewhere for dessert 0 
worst hour and a half of my lifeoh my gosh 0 
i have two more years left in this contract and i hate this phone 0 
the last 15 minutes of movie are also not bad as well 1 
they are so cool 1 
great phone 1 
this movie is greatespecially if you enjoy visual arts 1 
first time there and might just be the last 0 
its just painful 0 
i even dropped this phone into a stream and it was submerged for 15 seconds and it still works great 1 
it really is impressive that the place hasnt closed down 0 
but in terms of the writing its very fresh and bold 1 
i came over from verizon because cingulair has nicer cell phones the first thing i noticed was the really bad service 0 
using all earpieces left or right this thing will not stay on my ear 0 
the cable looks so thin and flimsy it is scary 0 
yes i am simplifying things here for the sake of brevity for this really is at the core of the problems with this film it has too much going on without any real fulfilling explanation 0 
i give wirefly 1 stari will contact cingularatt and inform them of this practice 0 
if you are reading this please dont go there 0 
there are massive levels massive unlockable characters its just a massive game 1 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
i give it 2 thumbs down 0 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
food was good service was good prices were good 1 
the results well are a shame 0 
i especially liked the noncliche choices with the parents in other movies i could predict the dialog verbatim but the writing in this movie made better selections 1 
i have eaten here multiple times and each time the food was delicious 1 
we had fantastic service and were pleased by the atmosphere 1 
if you havent choked in your own vomit by the end by all the cheap drama and worthless dialogue youve must have bored yourself to death with this waste of time 0 
i advise you to look out for it 1 
all it took was one drop from about 6 inches above the kitchen counter and it was crackedi am not impressed and i am not laughing 0 
a piece of cinematic garbage captured on celluloid 0 
avoid at all cost 0 
the writer gorman bechard undoubtedly did his homework because all references are industry and characterage appropriate 1 
steer clear of this product and go with the genuine palm replacementr pens which come in a threepack 0 
the steaks are all well trimmed and also perfectly cooked 1 
the puppets look really cheesy not in a good way like in the puppet master 80s flicks 0 
the food was barely lukewarm so it must have been sitting waiting for the server to bring it out to us 0 
this one is simply a disappointment 0 
being a 90s child i truly enjoyed this show and i can proudly say that i enjoyed it big time and even more than the classical wb cartoons 1 
echo problemvery unsatisfactory 0 
terrible my car will not accept this cassette 0 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
i had about two bites and refused to eat anymore 0 
all the actors give a wonderful performance especially jennifer rubin as jamie harris who changes from the nervous starlet in the beginning through the strange events she is part of to the cool star 1 
service stinks here 0 
all in all im quite satisfied with this purchase 1 
the design is very odd as the ear clip is not very comfortable at all 0 
helen baxendale is a very credible lady macbeth who can be very cheerfull at times and sometimes she just looks like a naughty girl but deadly in her taste for blood and evil 1 
not good by any stretch of the imagination 0 
i had to wait over 30 minutes to get my drink and longer to get 2 arepas 0 
works good 1 
frankly after cotton club and unfaithful it was kind of embarrassing to watch lane and gere in this film because it is bad 0 
by far the best cheesecurds we have ever had 1 
omg the food was delicioso 1 
i asked multiple times for the wine list and after some time of being ignored i went to the hostess and got one myself 0 
the use of slowmotion needlessly repeats itself throughout the movie but is well backed up by bad acting and bad is a kind word here no continuity scenes that are thrown in for no reason whatsoever vehicles that looked like they were made from a corn flakes box and a directorial style that bordered on stupidity 0 
what a waste of time 0 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
sooooo good 1 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
integrated seamlessly with the motorola razr phone 1 
was not happy 0 
the chefs were friendly and did a good job 1 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
but in terms of the writing its very fresh and bold 1 
this convention never worked well in the past and certainly doesnt work here 0 
so just beware 0 
the basic premise is wasted since it is sidelined by the inexplicable focus on the documentary crew 0 
i purchased this and within 2 days it was no longer working 0 
so far so good 1 
reasonably priced also 1 
i think that it is a must see older john wayne film 1 
excellent product for the price 1 
the selection of food was not the best 0 
will never ever go back and have told many people what had happened 0 
the movie is not completely perfect but titta di girolamo will stay with you for a long time after the vision of the movie 1 
i hope this place sticks around 1 
the nachos are a must have 1 
the price is reasonable and the service is great 1 
i am not a filmmaker nor am i a director but i would hide my head in the sand if id spent whatever amount of money and time on this movie 0 
truly awful 0 
one of the most disappointing aspects is the lack of notable gore 0 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
it is a very well acted and done tv movie 1 
i will never go back to this place and will never ever recommended this place to anyone 0 
the cast of veteran actors are more than just a nostalgia trip 1 
this place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver 0 
the story is lame not interesting and never really explains the sinister origins of the puppets 0 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
but the premise of the film was so ridiculous that the president of the us 0 
battery is terrible 0 
but in any case the best part is you can download these pictures to your laptop using ir or even send pictures from your laptop to the phone 1 
this place is horrible and way overpriced 0 
back to good bbq lighter fare reasonable pricing and tell the public they are back to the old ways 1 
now i know that i made a wise decision 1 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
i dont think well be going back anytime soon 0 
there are so many problems i dont know where to start 0 
maybe its just their vegetarian fare but ive been twice and i thought it was average at best 0 
i was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar not only because the quality is great but the service is fast and the food impeccable 1 
even allowing for poor production values for the time 1971 and the format some kind of miniseries this is baaaaaad 0 
i was totally fascinated by the music the dancing everything 1 
a good film by a great director 1 
the only place good for this film is in the garbage 0 
ive only had my bluetooth for a few weeks but i really like it 1 
fast service 1 
on a positive note our server was very attentive and provided great service 1 
star trek v the final frontier is the worst in the series 0 
works fine 1 
insults profound deuchebaggery and had to go outside for a smoke break while serving just to solidify it 0 
great sound and service 1 
but when someone strives for greatness and poetry but delivers a muddled and often ridiculous story a bunch of disparate scenes pretentious dialogue then you get the worst kind of a movie that some other reviewer very accurately defined as pretentious crap 0 
this is the phone to get for 2005 i just bought my s710a and all i can say is wow 1 
i left the theater with a lilt in my step joy in my heart and hope for the human race 1 
both rickman and stowe play their roles to the hilt in this tale of a childrens book writer who maybe has written a subversive tract 1 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
a fly was in my apple juice a fly 0 
my husband said she was very rude did not even apologize for the bad food or anything 0 
it was quite comfortable in the ear 1 
i think the most wonderful parts literally full of wonder are the excerpts from his works 1 
yes this film does require a rather significant amount of puzzlesolving but the pieces fit together to create a beautiful picture 1 
i hate writing bad reviews about films especially those in which i really like the star but this film is so bad i dont believe for one second that anyone could have been proud of it 0 
you wont forget this movie 1 
the restaurant atmosphere was exquisite 1 
i mean in a realistic world she would never have gotten into that ballet repertory the whole thing was quite pathetic 0 
product is exactly as described 1 
if you love death and decay and shakespears lyrics this is the one 1 
go rent it 1 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
everything was gross 0 
it is not good 0 
this place lacked style 0 
great for ipods too 1 
the refried beans that came with my meal were dried out and crusty and the food was bland 0 
good quality 1 
a pretty good product 1 
definitely a turn off for me i doubt ill be back unless someone else is buying 0 
aside from its terrible lead this film has loads of other debits 0 
the worst phone from samsungcrap this crappy samsung e715 is the worst i have ever seeen 0 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
its one of the movies i need to see whenever it comes on tvnever mind the fact that i already have it memorized 1 
food was average at best 0 
best of all is the rotating feature very helpful 1 
in fact its hard to remember that the part of ray charles is being acted and not played by the man himself 1 
product was excellent and works better than the verizon one and boy was it cheaper 1 
all this movie does is make you sick watching all these slackers make excuses for their stupid actions for 90 minutes 0 
unfortunately it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees 0 
linked to my phone without effort 1 
id advise anyone to go and see it 1 
the pan cakes everyone are raving about taste like a sugary disaster tailored to the palate of a six year old 0 
please dont waste your money 0 
the worst phone ive ever had only had it for a few months 0 
mic doesnt work 0 
after the first charge kept going dead after 12 minutes 0 
hes a national treasure 1 
the acting was bad the dialogs were extremely shallow and insincere 0 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
much more interesting more action more suspense and less of the unneeded controversy 1 
from what my dinner companions told meeverything was very fresh with nice texture and taste 1 
this little device has transformed my organizational capability and made my life a whole lot easier 1 
customer service was terrible 0 
when it opens the battery connection is broken and the device is turned off 0 
i heart this place 1 
the film has great actors a master director a significant themeat least a wouldbe significant theme undertone of fifties existential worldweariness aerial scenes that ought to have thrilled both senses and imagination and characters about which one might deeply care 1 
in an interesting part of town this place is amazing 1 
appears to actually outperform the original battery from china that came with my v325i 1 
the worst one of the series 0 
they will customize your order any way youd like my usual is eggplant with green bean stir fry love it 1 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
first off the reception sucks i have never had more than 2 bars ever 0 
jawbone era is awesome too 1 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
del taco is pretty nasty and should be avoided if possible 0 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
the characters are interesting and you really care for them 1 
and finally after all that we get to an ending that wouldve been great had it been handled by competent people and not jerry falwell 0 
i love the scream movies and all horror movies and this one ranks way up there 1 
otherwise dont even waste your time on this 0 
much less than the jawbone i was going to replace it with 1 
any ring toneoverall good phone to buy 1 
this phone might well be the worst ive ever had in any brand 0 
the point is the journey a journey that touches every member of the family 1 
you could only take 2 videos at a time and the quality was very poor 0 
do not purchase this phone 0 
id say that would be the hardest decision honestly all of ms dishes taste how they are supposed to taste amazing 1 
the charger worked for about a week and then completely stopped charging my phone 0 
only pros large seating area nice bar area great simple drink menu the best brick oven pizza with homemade dough 1 
the wind and the lion is well written and superbly acted 1 
we walked away stuffed and happy about our first vegas buffet experience 1 
initially the local sites in the film which was filmed here in buffalo intrigued me 1 
the price was very good and with the free shipping and all it was a good purchase 1 
also makes it easier to hold on to 1 
very unreliable service from tmobile 0 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
there is nothing authentic about this place 0 
well just if you keep thinking how bad it is 0 
they are so cool 1 
hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in 0 
that company is a joke 0 
each day of the week they have a different deal and its all so delicious 1 
victor mclaglen was even bad and brian donlevy was almost unrecognizable 0 
kind of flops around 0 
the dialogue is composed of things that make little sense 0 
this case seems well made 1 
wont go back 0 
their menu is diverse and reasonably priced 1 
dont buy this product 0 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
excellent hands free tool 1 
all in all i can assure you ill be back 1 
timely shipment and quality product 1 
its very attractive and appears to be of good quality 1 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
im glad the film didnt go for the most obvious choice as a lesser film certainly would have 1 
i wish i could return the unit and get back my money 0 
nice leather 1 
director paul matthews who also wrotedirected the weak 1995 monster movie grim clearly doesnt know how to pace his films 0 
he owns the film just as spacek owned coal miners daughter and quaid owned great balls of fire 1 
worst martini ever 0 
it was a good thing that the tickets only cost five dollars because i would be mad if id have paid 750 to see this crap 0 
very disappointed 0 
eew this location needs a complete overhaul 0 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
i could not recommend these more 0 
there are so many problems i dont know where to start 0 
this movie is terrible 0 
we loved the biscuits 1 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
the waitresses are very friendly 1 
this review is long overdue since i consider a tale of two sisters to be the single greatest film ever made 1 
cinematography the film was shot in an interesting way 1 
this is one of the better buffets that i have been to 1 
our server was very nice and even though he looked a little overwhelmed with all of our needs he stayed professional and friendly until the end 1 
there was so much hype over this phone that i assumed it was the best my mistake 0 
never again will i be dining at this place 0 
awsome device works great 1 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
only had this a month but its worked flawlessly so far 1 
saggy floppy piece of junk 0 
and if that isnt enough of a mess of a movie for you the picture is also marred with a constant use of studio sets and indoor exteriors 0 
not recommended 0 
i never walked out of a movie faster 0 
whatever prompted such a documentary is beyond me 0 
the script is bad very bad  it contains both cheesiness and unethical joke that you normally see in rated r or nc17 movie 0 
bluetooth does not work phone locks up screens just flash up and now it just makes calls randomly while in my pocket locked 0 
it also took her forever to bring us the check when we asked for it 0 
it has all the features i want 1 
i came over from verizon because cingulair has nicer cell phones the first thing i noticed was the really bad service 0 
the first thing that happened was that the tracking was off 0 
we started with the tuna sashimi which was brownish in color and obviously wasnt fresh 0 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
sending it back 0 
it looked like a wonderful story 1 
as i said abovepretty useless 0 
this movie is possibly one of the most creative works of horror ever 1 
it seems completely secure both holding on to my belt and keeping the iphone inside 1 
the plantains were the worst ive ever tasted 0 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
he is almost unbearable to watch on screen he has little to no charisma and terrible comedic timing 0 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
avoid this one if you can 0 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
setup went very smoothly 1 
brilliant 1 
excellent performance 1 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
this hole in the wall has great mexican street tacos and friendly staff 1 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
i love this device 1 
nice headphones for the price and they work great 1 
saw the movie today and thought it was a good effort good messages for kids 1 
after my phone got to be about a year old its been slowly breaking despite much care on my part 0 
i think it was robert ryans best film because he portrayed someone like my father and he was a schizophrenic in real lifemy father although he never murdered anyone but was affected more so during the second world war which made him worse 1 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
i was so insulted 0 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
the shrimp tender and moist 1 
a film not easily forgotten 1 
at around 4 pm i bought it at around 8pm i started to watch at around 815pm i fast forwarded the remaining film to see if there was anything left watchable for a human being with a brain but there wasnt 0 
do not make the same mistake as me 0 
it definitely was not as good as my s11 1 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
im translating movies for a living and this is the first movie in my 5year working experience that i found offensive to my intelligence 0 
worst service to boot but that is the least of their worries 0 
my boyfriend and i sat at the bar and had a completely delightful experience 1 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
by far the best cheesecurds we have ever had 1 
worst service to boot but that is the least of their worries 0 
after trying many many handsfree gadgets this is the one that finally works well 1 
very good though 1 
im probably one of the few people to ever go to ians and not like it 0 
i loved it 1 
horrible 0 
best of luck to the rude and noncustomer service focused new management 0 
the films sole bright spot was jonah hill who will look almost unrecognizable to fans of the recent superbad due to the amount of weight he lost in the interim 1 
great phone 1 
when i saw it in the theater i thought i was going to be sick 0 
great price also 1 
it deserves strong love 1 
total brunch fail 0 
if you want a sandwich just go to any firehouse 1 
very well made and fits my surefire gx2 perfectly 1 
on three different occasions i asked for well done or medium well and all three times i got the bloodiest piece of meat on my plate 0 
totally believable 1 
one character is totally annoying with a voice that gives me the feeling of fingernails on a chalkboard 0 
great product 1 
we thought youd have to venture further away to get good sushi but this place really hit the spot that night 1 
its pretty easy 1 
i find this inexcusable and so will probably be returning this phone and perhaps changing carriers 0 
but when i check voice mail at night the keypad backlight turns off a few seconds into the first message and then im lost 0 
walked in and the place smelled like an old grease trap and only 2 others there eating 0 
the jerky camera movements were also annoying 0 
comfortable in my hand 1 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
that movie was bad 0 
the attention given to every character and complex psychological portrayals detailing loyalty treachery love and hope are tremendous 1 
great software for motorolas 1 
will not be back 0 
ive had this bluetoooth headset for some time now and still not comfortable with the way it fits on the ear 0 
its worth driving up from tucson 1 
first off the reception sucks i have never had more than 2 bars ever 0 
the stories were as unbelievable as the actors 0 
this place has it 1 
due to this happening on every call i was forced to stop using this headset 0 
crust is not good 0 
this movie was kind of long in length but i enjoyed every minute of it 1 
2 thumbs up 1 
even when the women finally show up there is no sign of improvement the most expected things happen and by the time the film is over you might be far asleep 0 
my gyro was basically lettuce only 0 
as for the killer dont expect anything original or even remotely frightening 0 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
almost all of the songs in cover girl are oldfashioned and not very tuneful 0 
the greek dressing was very creamy and flavorful 1 
i love their fries and their beans 1 
not worth it 0 
leopard print is wonderfully wild 1 
barney is definitely super de duper 1 
for service i give them no stars 0 
the interplay between martin and emilio contains the same wonderful chemistry we saw in wall street with martin and charlie 1 
i ordered the voodoo pasta and it was the first time id had really excellent pasta since going gluten free several years ago 1 
i have to mention this and it is a huge spoiler i loved the ending how all the characters of the three films were the remaining survivors of the ferry disaster with valentine and the young judge together and the old man watching it on her tv solidifying his happiness over the suffering which he dealt with for those many years 1 
definitely worth seeing its the sort of thought provoking film that forces you to question your own threshold of loneliness 1 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
everything is appalling 0 
unfortunately it will not recharge my iphone 4s despite connecting it from multiple power sources imac external battery wall outlet etc 0 
great food and awesome service 1 
horrible had to switch 3 times 0 
the pizza selections are good 1 
everything was fresh and delicious 1 
the plastic breaks really easy on this clip 0 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
the jamaican mojitos are delicious 1 
nicest chinese restaurant ive been in a while 1 
for the price this was a great deal 1 
good beer drink selection and good food selection 1 
any ring toneoverall good phone to buy 1 
this is one of the best movies out there that shows such strong sibling bond for each other 1 
the spaghetti is nothing special whatsoever 0 
the management is rude 0 
i struggle to find anything bad to say about it 1 
i have purchased these for both family and friends and all enjoy their clarity and ease of use 1 
best fish ive ever had in my life 1 
both do good jobs and are quite amusing 1 
this is an excellent film 1 
there is simply no excuse for something this poorly done 0 
after the first charge kept going dead after 12 minutes 0 
then as if i hadnt wasted enough of my life there they poured salt in the wound by drawing out the time it took to bring the check 0 
what this film lacks is a convincing script 0 
this is a really fantastic thai restaurant which is definitely worth a visit 1 
item arrived quickly and works great with my metro pcs samsung schr450 slider phone and sony premium sound in ear plugs 1 
as for the killer dont expect anything original or even remotely frightening 0 
i dont think ill be running back to carlys anytime soon for food 0 
the headsets are easy to use and everyone loves them 1 
this review is long overdue since i consider a tale of two sisters to be the single greatest film ever made 1 
and the rest of it just sits there being awful with soldiers singing songs about the masculinity they pledge themselves to hairsplitting about purity the admiration of swords etc 0 
the script is bad very bad  it contains both cheesiness and unethical joke that you normally see in rated r or nc17 movie 0 
very good quality though 1 
i also decided not to send it back because our waitress looked like she was on the verge of having a heart attack 0 
performed awful muffled tinny incoming sound and severe echo for those on the other end of the call 0 
but in terms of the writing its very fresh and bold 1 
the story unfolds in 18th century jutland and the use of period music played on period instruments is just one more fine touch 1 
everything on the menu is terrific and we were also thrilled that they made amazing accommodations for our vegetarian daughter 1 
otherwise dont even waste your time on this 0 
the worst phone from samsungcrap this crappy samsung e715 is the worst i have ever seeen 0 
service is quick and even to go orders are just like we like it 1 
as for the service i thought it was good 1 
and if that isnt enough of a mess of a movie for you the picture is also marred with a constant use of studio sets and indoor exteriors 0 
if you do go see this movie bring a pillow or a girlfriendboyfriend to keep you occupied through out 0 
the potatoes were like rubber and you could tell they had been made up ahead of time being kept under a warmer 0 
ive had better not only from dedicated boba tea spots but even from jenni pho 0 
not a good bargain 0 
this movie is also revealing 1 
victor mclaglen was even bad and brian donlevy was almost unrecognizable 0 
10 out of 10 for both the movie and trilogy 1 
muddy low quality sound and the casing around the wires insert was poorly super glued and slid off 0 
but it is great i would really recommend it 1 
it is a really good show to watch 1 
its a fresh subtle and rather sublime effect 1 
rude inconsiderate management 0 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
i had the chicken pho and it tasted very bland 0 
the pleather case doesnt fit 0 
its one of the movies i need to see whenever it comes on tvnever mind the fact that i already have it memorized 1 
i got it because it was so small and adorable 1 
the staff are great the ambiance is great 1 
we have tried 2 units and they both failed within 2 months pros 0 
yet plantronincs continues to use the same flawed charger design 0 
the poor actors 0 
his losing his marbles so early in the proceedings is totally implausible and unconvincing 0 
nice spicy and tender 1 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
this was a different cut than the piece the other day but still wonderful and tender s well as well flavored 1 
its just lame 0 
the only good thing was that it fits comfortably on small ears 1 
the vanilla ice cream was creamy and smooth while the profiterole choux pastry was fresh enough 1 
dont make the same mistake i did 0 
people who like european films and art movies will like this movie 1 
as i said abovepretty useless 0 
poor sound quality 0 
my side greek salad with the greek dressing was so tasty and the pita and hummus was very refreshing 1 
it was also the right balance of war and love 1 
if you havent choked in your own vomit by the end by all the cheap drama and worthless dialogue youve must have bored yourself to death with this waste of time 0 
i love their fries and their beans 1 
director paul matthews who also wrotedirected the weak 1995 monster movie grim clearly doesnt know how to pace his films 0 
best fish ive ever had in my life 1 
one of the worst shows of all time 0 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
they brought a fresh batch of fries and i was thinking yay something warm but no 0 
i purcashed this for the car charger and it does not work 0 
they could be used as exemplars for any set designer 1 
the feel of the dining room was more college cooking course than high class dining and the service was slow at best 0 
id like to return it 0 
i just saw this film and i recommend it 1 
both rickman and stowe play their roles to the hilt in this tale of a childrens book writer who maybe has written a subversive tract 1 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
worth every penny 1 
its so bad its actually worth seeing just for that reason 0 
they have been around for years and carries the highest quality of antiglare screen protector that i have found to date 1 
youd have to have the iq of particularly stupid mollusk not to see that one coming 0 
their rotating beers on tap is also a highlight of this place 1 
the jamaican mojitos are delicious 1 
the cinematography is simply stunning to say the least and the fx are nothing if not stateoftheart 1 
seems like a good quick place to grab a bite of some familiar pub food but do yourself a favor and look elsewhere 0 
ps the only scene in the movie that was cool is when the central character finds her room blown up 1 
the pizza selections are good 1 
they do not last forever but is not overly expensive to replaceeasy to operate and the sound is much better than others i have tried 1 
the owners really really need to quit being soooooo cheap let them wrap my freaking sandwich in two papers not one 0 
i have had mine for about a year and this christmas i bought some for the rest of the family 1 
we literally sat there for 20 minutes with no one asking to take our order 0 
with the originality and freshness of the first movie now spent this remake had little else to offer 0 
my boyfriend and i came here for the first time on a recent trip to vegas and could not have been more pleased with the quality of food and service 1 
the block was amazing 1 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
the first time i ever came here i had an amazing experience i still tell people how awesome the duck was 1 
very satisifed with that 1 
bad quality 0 
works great 1 
everyone is very attentive providing excellent customer service 1 
but if you liked movies like the matrix and better yet their sequels i think youll appreciate the thought provoking mindblowing experience this film will give you 1 
definitely not worth the 3 i paid 0 
my brother in law who works at the mall ate here same day and guess what he was sick all night too 0 
we waited for thirty minutes to be seated although there were 8 vacant tables and we were the only folks waiting 0 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
later i found myself lost in the power of the film 1 
hell no will i go back 0 
i purcashed this for the car charger and it does not work 0 
excellent product for the price 1 
other than that the leather is nice and soft the fit is very tight the cut out for the face is a good shape 1 
love the margaritas too 1 
one of my favorite purchases ever 1 
a very charming film with wonderful sentiment and heart 1 
my side greek salad with the greek dressing was so tasty and the pita and hummus was very refreshing 1 
if there is a wind it is completely useless 0 
spoilers whatever else can or cant be said about it surface is superbly crafted 1 
they have a really nice atmosphere 1 
couldnt figure it out 0 
and the rest of it just sits there being awful with soldiers singing songs about the masculinity they pledge themselves to hairsplitting about purity the admiration of swords etc 0 
it makes very strange ticking noises before it ends the call 0 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
this is was due to the fact that it took 20 minutes to be acknowledged then another 35 minutes to get our foodand they kept forgetting things 0 
its very slow 0 
this movie totally grates on my nerves 0 
this does not fit the palm tungsten e2 and it broke the first time i tried to plug it in 0 
highly recommend for any one who has a blue tooth phone 1 
long whiny and pointless 0 
but if you liked movies like the matrix and better yet their sequels i think youll appreciate the thought provoking mindblowing experience this film will give you 1 
bad quality 0 
not only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic but it also managed to give away the entire movie and im not exaggerating every moment every plot point every joke is told in the trailer 0 
last time buying from you 0 
i thought errol flynn was brilliant as custer and has since become my favourite actor 1 
your brain will attempt to shutdown as part of a primal impulse of selfpreservation 0 
food was average at best 0 
i rate this movie 910 1 
you can watch them preparing the delicious food 1 
excellent performance 1 
waitress was a little slow in service 0 
the story is beyond stupid 0 
one more thing i can tolerate political incorrectness very well im all for artistic freedom and suspension of disbelief but the slavic female character was just too much 0 
a good quality bargain i bought this after i bought a cheapy from big lots that sounded awful and people on the other end couldnt hear me 1 
the inside is really quite nice and very clean 1 
sucked most of the stuff does not work with my phone 0 
when i opened the sandwich i was impressed but not in a good way 0 
treo and tmobile refused to replace it again and forced me to buy another phone without any kind of upgrade discount 0 
a fly was in my apple juice a fly 0 
my wife had the lobster bisque soup which was lukewarm 0 
this battery is an excellent bargain 1 
its just lame 0 
this is infuriating 0 
sprint charges for this service 0 
this case seems well made 1 
everything stinks 0 
nice design and quality 1 
worst service to boot but that is the least of their worries 0 
this one is simply a disappointment 0 
i own a jabra earset and was very happy with it but the sound quality especially outgoing on this is better 1 
instead we got a bore fest about a whiny spoiled brat babysitting 0 
steer clear of this product and go with the genuine palm replacementr pens which come in a threepack 0 
what i really like there is the crepe station 1 
great steak great sides great wine amazing desserts 1 
its worth driving up from tucson 1 
delicious and i will absolutely be back 1 
cumbersome design 0 
you need at least 3 mins to get to your phone book from the time you first turn on the phonebattery life is short 0 
the pleather case doesnt fit 0 
the food was terrible 0 
highly recommended for all ages although the younger set will probably not appreciate some of the more subtle references they will certainly appreciate one galley scene in particular 1 
everything about this movie is stupid 0 
so i bought about 10 of these and saved alot of money 1 
its a feelgood film and thats how i felt when i came out of the cinema 1 
the staff is friendly and the joint is always clean 1 
ive owned this phone for 7 months now and can say that its the best mobile phone ive had 1 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
not sure who was more lost the flat characters or the audience nearly half of whom walked out 0 
this place receives stars for their appetizers 1 
needless to say i wont be going back anytime soon 0 
the sound is clear and the people i talk to on it are amazed at the quality too 1 
i want my money back 0 
he owns the film just as spacek owned coal miners daughter and quaid owned great balls of fire 1 
im a big fan of this series mostly due to anne rices style sensitivities and treatments 1 
the good cinematography also makes her and monica bellucci look very beautiful 1 
if this premise sound stupid thats because it is 0 
there is however some pretty good acting at least for this type of film 1 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
ill give this film 10 out of 10 1 
very tough and very short on flavor 0 
cant say enough good things about this place 1 
punishment park is a brilliant piece of cinema 1 
the management is rude 0 
i will be back many times soon 1 
this movie does an excellent job of revealing the complexity of the task and the incredible challenges facing south africa 1 
we loved the biscuits 1 
the price was very good and with the free shipping and all it was a good purchase 1 
now the pizza itself was good the peanut sauce was very tasty 1 
none of the three sizes they sent with the headset would stay in my ears 0 
i will never forget it now 1 
and sometimes it was so embarrassing that i had to look away 0 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
to my disbelief each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods i have ever tasted 0 
the sound is clear and the people i talk to on it are amazed at the quality too 1 
this movie totally grates on my nerves 0 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
if there is a wind it is completely useless 0 
five star plus plus 1 
do not purchase this phone 0 
the movie was so boring that i sometimes found myself occupied peaking in the paper instead of watching never happened during a columbo movie before 0 
the food was very good 1 
wow very spicy but delicious 1 
there is so much good food in vegas that i feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to rice and company 0 
the noise shield is incrediable 1 
lot of holes in the plot theres nothing about how he became the emperor nothing about where he spend 20 years between his childhood and mature age 0 
i had verizon 2 years ago and really liked their service 1 
the problem was the script 0 
the block was amazing 1 
cant store anything but phone numbers to sim 0 
for those that havent seen it dont waste your time 0 
no plot whatsoever 0 
arrived quickly and much less expensive than others being sold 1 
the explosion of the gas tanks at the end was just as awful 0 
this is an outstanding little restaurant with some of the best food i have ever tasted 1 
feelings thoughtsgabriels discomfort during the danceall these intangibles leap to life and come within the viewers grasp in hustons portrayal 1 
the best part about nurse betty is its unpredictability 1 
the jabra eargels fit my ears very well 1 
i am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this 1 
updatewent back for a second time and it was still just as amazing 1 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
the charger worked for about a week and then completely stopped charging my phone 0 
you get incredibly fresh fish prepared with care 1 
no ear loop needed its tiny and the sound is great 1 
the things that the four kids get themselves into is absolutely hilarious to watch 1 
frankly after cotton club and unfaithful it was kind of embarrassing to watch lane and gere in this film because it is bad 0 
feelings thoughtsgabriels discomfort during the danceall these intangibles leap to life and come within the viewers grasp in hustons portrayal 1 
the acting sucks the music sucks the script sucks the pacing sucks the special fx suck the directing sucks basically this movie sucks 0 
excellent product for the price 1 
worked very well paired with a treo 700w and as a skype headset on my pc using a usb bluetooth transceiver 1 
on three different occasions i asked for well done or medium well and all three times i got the bloodiest piece of meat on my plate 0 
this is a great place to eat 1 
when my mom and i got home she immediately got sick and she only had a few bites of salad 0 
we are sending it back 0 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
i will not return 0 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
what a disappointment 0 
i received it quickly and it works great 1 
i kept catching the cable on the seat and i had to pull the phone out to turn it on an off 0 
i would recommend this 1 
first time going but i think i will quickly become a regular 1 
as an earlier review noted plug in this charger and nothing happens 0 
what a waste of time 0 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
really good product 1 
not tasty and the texture was just nasty 0 
this is a bad film with bad writing and good actorsan ugly cartoon crafted by paul haggis for people who cant handle anything but the bold strokes in storytellinga picture painted with crayons 0 
this was my first time and i cant wait until the next 1 
sauce was tasteless 0 
it sure does beat the nachos at the movies but i would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant 0 
excellent cast story line performances 1 
these are the central themes of the film and they are handled ineptly stereotypically and with no depth of imagination 0 
it dit not work most of the time with my nokia 5320 0 
his costars dont fare much better with people like morgan freeman jonah hill and ed helms just wasted 0 
the sweet potato tots were good but the onion rings were perfection or as close as i have had 1 
it came free with a dvd player i bought but i still turned the thing off halfway through because i was embarrassed for howell 0 
50 down the drain 0 
poor voice clarity 0 
server did a great job handling our large rowdy table 1 
the cast of veteran actors are more than just a nostalgia trip 1 
it clicks into place in a way that makes you wonder how long that mechanism would last 0 
it deserves strong love 1 
this movie contained an allstar cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i havent seen before 1 
a cheap and cheerless heist movie with poor characterisation lots of underbite style stoic emoting think chow yun fat in a better tomorrow and some cheesy clichés thrown into an abandoned factory ready for a few poorly executed flying judo rolls a la john woo 0 
during several different 2 minute calls i experienced 5 drops and it was in an area that had 5 bars 0 
we got sitting fairly fast but ended up waiting 40 minutes just to place our order another 30 minutes before the food arrived 0 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
i love this device 1 
in other words the content level of this film is enough to easily fill a dozen other films 1 
i recently had problems where i could not stay connected for more than 10 minutes before being disconnected 0 
nice solid keyboard 1 
this item worked great but it broke after 6 months of use 0 
cinematography noteworthy including fine views of barcelona and its famed gaudi towers 1 
not as good as i had hoped 0 
the cast is always entertaining as usual 1 
also the phone doesnt seem to accept anything except cbr mp3s preferably ripped by windows media player 0 
it always cuts out and makes a beep beep beep sound then says signal failed 0 
if you see it you should probably just leave it on the shelf 0 
to those who find this movie intelligent or even masterful i can only say its your intelligence and your imagination you obviously used to try and make some sense of this pitiful attempt its in our human nature to try and make sense of things 0 
the screen does get smudged easily because it touches your ear and face 0 
i had about two bites and refused to eat anymore 0 
best breakfast buffet 1 
the inside is really quite nice and very clean 1 
you cant relate with them hell you barely can understand them 0 
simply beautiful 1 
oh the charger seems to work fine 1 
seems like a good quick place to grab a bite of some familiar pub food but do yourself a favor and look elsewhere 0 
we watched our waiter pay a lot more attention to other tables and ignore us 0 
overall i was not impressed and would not go back 0 
if you havent choked in your own vomit by the end by all the cheap drama and worthless dialogue youve must have bored yourself to death with this waste of time 0 
ive only had my bluetooth for a few weeks but i really like it 1 
nice docking station for home or work 1 
it is cheap and it feel and look just as cheap 0 
the movie was so boring that i sometimes found myself occupied peaking in the paper instead of watching never happened during a columbo movie before 0 
greatno problems at all 1 
seriously killer hot chai latte 1 
it is simple to use and i like it 1 
the seller is very understanding and patient i would definitely buy from them again 1 
my mother and brother had to do thiswhen i saw robert ryan portraying this type of man it was a very good imitation of this type of individual and i was impressed 1 
this one is simply a disappointment 0 
there are massive levels massive unlockable characters its just a massive game 1 
what a big waste of time 0 
so i basically threw my money out the window for nothing 0 
i can take a little bad service but the food sucks 0 
however this didnt make up for the fact that overall this was a tremendously boring movie 0 
i felt asleep the first time i watched it so i can recommend it for insomniacs 0 
there is simply no excuse for something this poorly done 0 
but whatever it was that cost them so much it didnt translate to quality thats for sure 0 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
the refried beans that came with my meal were dried out and crusty and the food was bland 0 
by far the best cheesecurds we have ever had 1 
the worst one of the series 0 
i enjoyed reading this book to my children when they were little 1 
service was fantastic 1 
it felt too light and tinny 0 
the ear buds only play music in one ear 0 
its pretty surprising that this wonderful film was made in 1949 as hollywood generally had its collective heads in the sand concerning black and white issues at that time 1 
come hungry leave happy and stuffed 1 
the plastic breaks really easy on this clip 0 
the lighting is awful 0 
the sound quality for the device is unacceptableunless you are in a really quiet area you almost hear nothing 0 
the shipping time was also very quick 1 
i recommend this for everyone who loves film movies anythinga work of art 1 
i found this place by accident and i could not be happier 1 
the worst phone from samsungcrap this crappy samsung e715 is the worst i have ever seeen 0 
which has more depth and character than the man underneath it 0 
another note about this phones appearance is that it really looks rather bland especially in the all black model 0 
very disappointing 0 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
during several different 2 minute calls i experienced 5 drops and it was in an area that had 5 bars 0 
this is hands down the best phone ive ever had 1 
brilliant 1 
very clear quality sound and you dont have to mess with the sound on your ipod since you have the sound buttons on the headset 1 
i also didnt like the on button it felt like it would crack with use 0 
i dont think you will be disappointed 1 
i love the look and feel of samsung flipphones 1 
what did bother me was the slow service 0 
customer service was terrible 0 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
it was so funny 1 
it has northern humour and positive about the community it represents 1 
enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film 1 
updatewent back for a second time and it was still just as amazing 1 
i give it 2 thumbs down 0 
customer service was terrible 0 
the film is well paced understated and one of the best courtroom documentaries ive seen 1 
so badwellits just bad 0 
if you want a sandwich just go to any firehouse 1 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
easily none other cartoon made me laugh in a tender way before getting into dark sitcoms oriented for teenagers 1 
his performance is simply genius 1 
how awful she is 0 
i rate this movie 910 1 
totally believable 1 
i saw it as a child on tv back in 1973 when it was the stranger and i loved it 1 
my 5year old nokia 2160 from tracfone holds the charge a lot better than this 0 
it came free with a dvd player i bought but i still turned the thing off halfway through because i was embarrassed for howell 0 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
to summarize the food was incredible nay transcendant but nothing brings me joy quite like the memory of the pneumatic condiment dispenser 1 
no actress has been worse used that june allison in this movie 0 
im still infatuated with this phone 1 
i recently had problems where i could not stay connected for more than 10 minutes before being disconnected 0 
the speaker is of low quality so as making the ring tones sound very cheap 0 
very bad experience 0 
great phone 1 
battery life is real good 1 
its not user friendly 0 
fantastic buy and will get again for whatever my next phone is 1 
i wasnt expecting oscar material but this 0 
i own a jabra earset and was very happy with it but the sound quality especially outgoing on this is better 1 
couldnt figure it out 0 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
main thing i didnt enjoy is that the crowd is of older crowd around mid 30s and up 0 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
duris has a wholesome appearance and gives a fine performance 1 
they keep getting better and better this is my third one and ive had numerous palms too 1 
the acting was decidely wooden though no worse than a period universal b movie 0 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
performed awful muffled tinny incoming sound and severe echo for those on the other end of the call 0 
from here on the widmark character turns unintentionally comical 0 
the loudspeaker option is great the bumpers with the lights is very appealing 0 
restaurant is always full but never a wait 1 
earbud piece breaks easily 0 
i love this thing 1 
the script is was there a script 0 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
a good quality bargain i bought this after i bought a cheapy from big lots that sounded awful and people on the other end couldnt hear me 1 
i will not be eating there again 0 
it was attached to a gas station and that is rarely a good sign 0 
the kids are annoying 0 
an interesting premise and billy drago is always good as a dangerous nutbag side note id love to see drago stephen mchattie and lance hendrikson in a flick together talk about raging cheekbones 1 
waited 2 hours never got either of our pizzas as many other around us who came in later did 0 
food was average at best 0 
i know he was a contract player with little control over his scripts but the acting was as bad as the script 0 
i think this restaurant suffers from not trying hard enough 0 
the food was very good 1 
the phone loads super 1 
she carries the movie well 1 
the wind and the lion is well written and superbly acted 1 
worked very well paired with a treo 700w and as a skype headset on my pc using a usb bluetooth transceiver 1 
add betty white and jean smart and you have a great cast everyone played their parts really well 1 
please dont waste your money 0 
however my girl was complain that some time the phone doesnt wake up like normal phone does 0 
the first thing that happened was that the tracking was off 0 
the football scenes at the end were perplexing 0 
this is the first phone ive had that has been so cheaply made 0 
horrible 0 
enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film 1 
great price too 1 
my girlfriends veal was very bad 0 
im probably one of the few people to ever go to ians and not like it 0 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
my friend did not like his bloody mary 0 
bad characters bad story and bad acting 0 
a very good film indeed about great and unconditional love 1 
i had high hopes for this place since the burgers are cooked over a charcoal grill but unfortunately the taste fell flat way flat 0 
awful service 0 
i would highly recommend this 1 
seriously flavorful delights folks 1 
special mention should be made of the superb music score and sound effects which are an integral element in helping to make this such a memorable and enjoyable cartoon 1 
the service was a bit lacking 0 
so bad 0 
very good lunch spot 1 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
your brain will attempt to shutdown as part of a primal impulse of selfpreservation 0 
however bt headsets are currently not good for real time games like firstperson shooters since the audio delay messes me up 0 
this is not moviemaking 0 
this convention never worked well in the past and certainly doesnt work here 0 
considering the relations off screen between taylor and stanwyck it was surprising how little chemistry there was on screen between the two of them 0 
im not really sure how joeys was voted best hot dog in the valley by readers of phoenix magazine 0 
people couldnt hear me talk and i had to pull out the earphone and talk on the phone 0 
avoid this one if you can 0 
there was no chemistry between ben affleck and sandra bullock in this film and i couldnt understand why he would consider even leaving his wifetobe for this chick that he supposedly was knocked out by 0 
this movie contained an allstar cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i havent seen before 1 
the poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying 0 
this device is great in several situations1 1 
there is simply no excuse for something this poorly done 0 
great food and service huge portions and they give a military discount 1 
painful on the ear 0 
a lot of websites have been rating this a very good phone and so do i 1 
the jerky camera movements were also annoying 0 
dessert panna cotta was amazing 1 
doesnt do the job 0 
elias koteasjack palance play good roles angelina is hot and gets nakedbilly drago appears in this and is cool as usual a cameo by sven ole thorsen helps make this a very enjoyable movie with good acting and a decent budget 1 
favorite place in town for shawarrrrrrma 1 
not recommended 0 
and the rest of it just sits there being awful with soldiers singing songs about the masculinity they pledge themselves to hairsplitting about purity the admiration of swords etc 0 
the acting is beyond abysmal 0 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
it doesnt make you look cool 0 
but this movie really got to me 1 
i highly recommend this device to everyone 1 
and finally after all that we get to an ending that wouldve been great had it been handled by competent people and not jerry falwell 0 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
almost all of the songs in cover girl are oldfashioned and not very tuneful 0 
today was my first taste of a buldogis gourmet hot dog and i have to tell you it was more than i ever thought possible 1 
the scallop dish is quite appalling for value as well 0 
the new characters werent all that memorable and i found myself forgetting who was who 0 
the food came out at a good pace 1 
their menu is diverse and reasonably priced 1 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
the refried beans that came with my meal were dried out and crusty and the food was bland 0 
dont waste your money 0 
hated it 0 
it is rare when a filmmaker takes the time to tell a worthy moral tale with care and love that doesnt fall into the trap of being overly syrupy or over indulgent 1 
this was my first time and i cant wait until the next 1 
the shrimp tender and moist 1 
has been working great 1 
totally different with loads of understatement and black comedy this is a film few get to see but those who do will remember it 1 
i know he was a contract player with little control over his scripts but the acting was as bad as the script 0 
crash is a depressing little nothing that provokes emotion but teaches you nothing if you already know racism and prejudice are bad things 0 
not good by any stretch of the imagination 0 
once you get inside youll be impressed with the place 1 
how this piece of trash was ever released is beyond me the acting the story the characters the supposedly special effects etcits all wrong 0 
i will continue to come here on ladies night andddd date night highly recommend this place to anyone who is in the area 1 
once you get inside youll be impressed with the place 1 
i am so pleased to know such a modern day genius is out there letting is passion for art drive him and taking us as an audience with him 1 
the phone loads super 1 
this is the kind of money that is wasted properly 1 
it was just too horrible 0 
crash is a depressing little nothing that provokes emotion but teaches you nothing if you already know racism and prejudice are bad things 0 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
the only suspense i was feeling was the frustration at just how retarded the girls were 0 
when i placed my treo into the case not only was it not snug but there was a lot of extra room on the sides 0 
this is a great deal 1 
great steak great sides great wine amazing desserts 1 
i received my headset in good time and was happy with it 1 
so far it has worked like a charm 1 
the construction of the headsets is poor 0 
i can assure you that you wont be disappointed 1 
the charger arrived within the promised timeframe but it did not work 0 
not much seafood and like 5 strings of pasta at the bottom 0 
i highly recommend this movie for anyone interested in art poetry theater politics or japanese history 1 
its practically perfect in all of them  a true masterpiece in a sea of faux masterpieces 1 
no plot whatsoever 0 
it is cheap and it feel and look just as cheap 0 
service was very prompt 1 
but it wasnt anything at all just one big yawn 0 
needless to say i wont be going back anytime soon 0 
great place to relax and have an awesome burger and beer 1 
my 810 score is mostly for the plot 1 
overpriced for what you are getting 0 
the puppets look really cheesy not in a good way like in the puppet master 80s flicks 0 
and then tragedy struck 0 
the screen size is big key pad lit well enough and the camera quality is excellent for a camera phone 1 
reaching for the bottom row is uncomfortable and the send and end keys are not where i expect them to be3 0 
after watching this film i wanted to learn more about the works of this artist 1 
sounds good reasonably priced and effective its that simple 1 
lovely little thriller from hitchcock with lots of nice shenanigans surrounding a murdered spy a kidnapped child a nasty church a foreign plot and some random taxidermists 1 
but it does get better reception and clarity than any phone ive had before 1 
fantastic food 1 
the script is was there a script 0 
go to place for gyros 1 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
horrible 0 
the least said about the acting the better 0 
excellent dualpurpose headset 1 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
the foreigner is not worth one second of your time 0 
good case 1 
but it picked up speed and got right to the point 1 
now we were chosen to be tortured with this disgusting piece of blatant american propaganda 0 
the mic is great 1 
love this phone 1 
it is zillion times away from reality 0 
this is a beautiful phone 1 
the dialogue sucked 0 
ill even say it again  this is torture 0 
service is quick and even to go orders are just like we like it 1 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
same evening him and i are both drastically sick 0 
it really is impressive that the place hasnt closed down 0 
the warm beer didnt help 0 
this item worked great but it broke after 6 months of use 0 
the secondary plot line is incomprehensible and its relation to the primary plot line is mystifying 0 
id like to return it 0 
plug was the wrong size 0 
this place is overpriced not consistent with their boba and it really is overpriced 0 
magical help 1 
for a product that costs as much as this one does i expect it to work far better and with greater ease than this thing does 0 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
i ordered the lemon raspberry ice cocktail which was also incredible 1 
just really good so far probably the best bt headset i have ever had 1 
this pair of headphones is the worst that i have ever had soundwise 0 
very bad performance plays angela bennett a computer expert who is at home all the time 0 
i know he was a contract player with little control over his scripts but the acting was as bad as the script 0 
probably not in a hurry to go back 0 
phenomenal food service and ambiance 1 
you could only take 2 videos at a time and the quality was very poor 0 
then i exchanged for the same phone even that had the same problem 0 
krussel always good 1 
i probably would not go here again 0 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
i also decided not to send it back because our waitress looked like she was on the verge of having a heart attack 0 
penne vodka excellent 1 
the majority of the logitech earbud headsets failed 0 
i like steiners because its dark and it feels like a bar 1 
i took back my money and got outta there 0 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
battery chargelife is quite long 1 
im glad i found this product on amazon it is hard to find it wasnt high priced 1 
considering the relations off screen between taylor and stanwyck it was surprising how little chemistry there was on screen between the two of them 0 
ive had this for nearly 2 years and it has worked great for me 1 
works good 1 
the eargels channel the sound directly into your ear and seem to increase the sound volume and clarity 1 
we had a group of 70 when we claimed we would only have 40 and they handled us beautifully 1 
works for me 1 
stay away from the q 0 
i love this phone 1 
its a mediocre miserable hollow laughable and predictable piece of garbage 0 
for readers who have already seen one of miyazakis films he is still in top form and made another worthwhile experience 1 
great brunch spot 1 
ill give this film 10 out of 10 1 
but whatever it was that cost them so much it didnt translate to quality thats for sure 0 
i give wirefly 1 stari will contact cingularatt and inform them of this practice 0 
honeslty it didnt taste that fresh 0 
excellent performance 1 
id rather eat airline food seriously 0 
it is rare when a filmmaker takes the time to tell a worthy moral tale with care and love that doesnt fall into the trap of being overly syrupy or over indulgent 1 
great phone 1 
i used bitpim a free program you can find on the internetto transfer data to the phonethe price of the cable was excellent 1 
everything about it is fine and reasonable for the price ie 1 
i have purchased these for both family and friends and all enjoy their clarity and ease of use 1 
i bought this phone as a replacement for my startac and have regretted it since 0 
everything is appalling 0 
this totally unfunny movie is so over the top and pathetic and unrealistic that throughout the whole 90 minutes of utter torture i probably looked at my watch about 70000 times 0 
very windresistant 1 
at first i thought i was grtting a good deal at 744 until i plugged it into my phone v3c razr 0 
love this headset 1 
cooked to perfection and the service was impeccable 1 
on three different occasions i asked for well done or medium well and all three times i got the bloodiest piece of meat on my plate 0 
last night was my second time dining here and i was so happy i decided to go back 1 
but this movie is definitely a below average rent 0 
this was reflected not only in the cast but also in the belowpar script which borrowed much from the earlier classic 0 
it is simple to use and i like it 1 
some may say this buffet is pricey but i think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot 1 
i am very impressed with this headset from plantronics 1 
pretty good beer selection too 1 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
we recently witnessed her poor quality of management towards other guests as well 0 
the only suspense i was feeling was the frustration at just how retarded the girls were 0 
it has everything i need and i couldnt ask for more 1 
the folks at otto always make us feel so welcome and special 1 
the performances are not improved by improvisation because the actors now have twice as much to worry about not only whether theyre delivering the line well but whether the line itself is any good 0 
there were too many close ups 0 
i thought errol flynn was brilliant as custer and has since become my favourite actor 1 
ive owned this phone for 7 months now and can say that its the best mobile phone ive had 1 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
simply beautiful 1 
i received it quickly and it works great 1 
great phone 1 
2 times very bad customer service 0 
it lasts less than 3o minutes if i actually try to use the phonemy wife has the same phone with the same problem 0 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
very bad performance plays angela bennett a computer expert who is at home all the time 0 
the acting sucked 0 
it presents a idyllic yet serious portrayal of the ups and downs of the characters lives 1 
so far so good 1 
i have only had it for a few weeks but so far so good 1 
victor mclaglen was even bad and brian donlevy was almost unrecognizable 0 
you can find better movies at youtube 0 
food arrived quickly 1 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
there is so much good food in vegas that i feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to rice and company 0 
i mean in a realistic world she would never have gotten into that ballet repertory the whole thing was quite pathetic 0 
lucy bell is so much higher than this crap and for her to sink this low is quite depressing 0 
the acting was bad 0 
dont waste your money 0 
excellent product for the price 1 
excellent sound quality 1 
this phone is very fast with sending any kind of messages and web browsing is significantly faster than previous phones i have used 1 
comes with a strong light that you can use to light up your camera shots and even flash sos signals seriously 1 
then i exchanged for the same phone even that had the same problem 0 
the charger arrived within the promised timeframe but it did not work 0 
putting the race card aside lets look at the major flaw in the film they destroy latifas character 0 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
you get incredibly fresh fish prepared with care 1 
i found this move beautiful enjoyable and uplifting 1 
it has a great camera thats 2mp and the pics are nice and clear with great picture quality 1 
the cg opening sequence in space looked like it could have been created on microsoft slideshow for gods sake 0 
disappointed with battery 0 
performed awful muffled tinny incoming sound and severe echo for those on the other end of the call 0 
to those who find this movie intelligent or even masterful i can only say its your intelligence and your imagination you obviously used to try and make some sense of this pitiful attempt its in our human nature to try and make sense of things 0 
dont waste your money 0 
the roast beef sandwich tasted really good 1 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
i dont understand how this garbage got on the shelves of the movie store its not even a real movie 0 
the service here is fair at best 0 
my wife had the lobster bisque soup which was lukewarm 0 
because both ears are occupied background is not distracting at all 1 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
damn good steak 1 
i highly recommend these and encourage people to give them a try 1 
the jalapeno bacon is soooo good 1 
i promise they wont disappoint 1 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
it features an outlandish array of memorable psychotic but lovable nuts 1 
not too screamy not to masculine but just right 1 
it is so small and you dont even realize that it is there after a while of getting used to it 1 
we recently witnessed her poor quality of management towards other guests as well 0 
audio quality is poor very poor 0 
my husband and i ate lunch here and were very disappointed with the food and service 0 
linksys should have some way to exchange a bad phone for a refurb unit or something 0 
it was either too cold not enough flavor or just bad 0 
i own 2 of these cases and would order another 1 
who in their right mind is gonna buy this battery 0 
we made the drive all the way from north scottsdale and i was not one bit disappointed 1 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
the problem was the script 0 
the camera although rated at an impressive 13 megapixels renders images that fall well below expectations of such a relatively high resolution 0 
i wasnt expecting oscar material but this 0 
very good though 1 
great movie 1 
too politically correct 0 
i came back today since they relocated and still not impressed 0 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
also the phone doesnt seem to accept anything except cbr mp3s preferably ripped by windows media player 0 
cant get the software to work with my computer 0 
the attempts at humor were pitiful and story is so awful it dosent bear thinking about which basically involves a vulcan stealing the enterprise to find god seriously i just didnt care about any of this film and oh not to mention uhura does a belly dance to distract male guards 0 
the design is very odd as the ear clip is not very comfortable at all 0 
i went on motorolas website and followed all directions but could not get it to pair again 0 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
this is an outstanding little restaurant with some of the best food i have ever tasted 1 
i ordered this for sony ericsson w810i but i think it only worked once thats when i first used it 0 
i love the look and feel of samsung flipphones 1 
the meat was pretty dry i had the sliced brisket and pulled pork 0 
if you plan to use this in a car forget about it 0 
my sashimi was poor quality being soggy and tasteless 0 
you get incredibly fresh fish prepared with care 1 
reaching for the bottom row is uncomfortable and the send and end keys are not where i expect them to be3 0 
i can say that the desserts were yummy 1 
pretty cool i would say 1 
now this is a movie i really dislike 0 
started watching this but didnt believe in any of the characters 0 
the whole experience was underwhelming and i think well just go to ninja sushi next time 0 
the camera on the phone may be used as a dustpan when indoors id rather be using a disposable then this 0 
we ordered some old classics and some new dishes after going there a few times and were sorely disappointed with everything 0 
the directing and the cinematography arent quite as good 0 
this place was such a nice surprise 1 
the good cinematography also makes her and monica bellucci look very beautiful 1 
it didnt make me scared horrified or make me sympathetic towards the characters it was simply annoying 0 
however i needed some better instructions 0 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
1010 1 
this greedy corporation will never see another dime from me 0 
defective crap 0 
conclusion very filling meals 1 
i recommend this for everyone who loves film movies anythinga work of art 1 
this case has passed the one year mark and while it shows signs of wear it is 100 functional 1 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
the screen does get smudged easily because it touches your ear and face 0 
in my house i was getting dropped coverage upstairs and no coverage in my basement 0 
the waiter wasnt helpful or friendly and rarely checked on us 0 
on the up side their cafe serves really good food 1 
i also didnt like the on button it felt like it would crack with use 0 
mobile phone tools are a must have 1 
really bad 0 
which are small and not worth the price 0 
i like design and look of jabra behing the ear headsets and 5020 is pretty comfortible to wear 24 hours a day without pain in the ear 1 
excellent product 1 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
i kept catching the cable on the seat and i had to pull the phone out to turn it on an off 0 
very windresistant 1 
great food and service huge portions and they give a military discount 1 
love the margaritas too 1 
i will not be eating there again 0 
excellent product for the price 1 
same problem as others have mentioned 0 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
i totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is 1 
mishima is extremely uninteresting 0 
i hope this place sticks around 1 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
putting the race card aside lets look at the major flaw in the film they destroy latifas character 0 
i could eat their bruschetta all day it is devine 1 
if you have not seen this movie i definitely recommend it 1 
stopped by during the late may bank holiday off rick steve recommendation and loved it 1 
setup couldnt have been simpler 1 
i wont be back 0 
the acting was bad the dialogs were extremely shallow and insincere 0 
its so bad its actually worth seeing just for that reason 0 
this may be the only bad film he ever made 0 
the flat reenactments dont hold your attention because they are emotionally adrift and stagy 0 
last time buying from you 0 
gets the job done 1 
one more thing i can tolerate political incorrectness very well im all for artistic freedom and suspension of disbelief but the slavic female character was just too much 0 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
this is one of the better buffets that i have been to 1 
what a piece of junk i lose more calls on this phone 0 
then theres the plot holes 0 
comfortable nice range good battery life 1 
great movie 1 
the attempts at humor were pitiful and story is so awful it dosent bear thinking about which basically involves a vulcan stealing the enterprise to find god seriously i just didnt care about any of this film and oh not to mention uhura does a belly dance to distract male guards 0 
anyways the food was definitely not filling at all and for the price you pay you should expect more 0 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
at first i thought i was grtting a good deal at 744 until i plugged it into my phone v3c razr 0 
i enjoyed reading this book to my children when they were little 1 
it was a long time that i didnt see a so charismatic actor on screen 1 
i sat riveted to the tv screen 1 
this is a simple little phone to use but the breakage is unacceptible 0 
will not be back 0 
i wouldnt see this movie again for free 0 
i tried talking real loud but shouting on the telephone gets old and i was still told it wasnt great 0 
all in all im quite satisfied with this purchase 1 
the ambiance isnt much better 0 
highly unrecommended 0 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
we had so much to say about the place before we walked in that he expected it to be amazing but was quickly disappointed 0 
i believe that this place is a great stop for those with a huge belly and hankering for sushi 1 
i liked the patio and the service was outstanding 1 
maybe its just their vegetarian fare but ive been twice and i thought it was average at best 0 
cant get the software to work with my computer 0 
this was my first time and i cant wait until the next 1 
i thought it was bad 0 
it is cheap and it feel and look just as cheap 0 
i ordered this for sony ericsson w810i but i think it only worked once thats when i first used it 0 
itll be a regular stop on my trips to phoenix 1 
i ordered this for sony ericsson w810i but i think it only worked once thats when i first used it 0 
it was a great phone 1 
in an interesting part of town this place is amazing 1 
this is probably the most irritating show i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
crash is a depressing little nothing that provokes emotion but teaches you nothing if you already know racism and prejudice are bad things 0 
earbud piece breaks easily 0 
great bluetooth 1 
what a mistake that was 0 
this movie suffered because of the writing it needed more suspense 0 
service is quick and even to go orders are just like we like it 1 
crust is not good 0 
babie bop is very cute 1 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
they work about 2 weeks then break 0 
love the margaritas too 1 
my wife had the lobster bisque soup which was lukewarm 0 
it has a great camera thats 2mp and the pics are nice and clear with great picture quality 1 
the football scenes at the end were perplexing 0 
great food and service huge portions and they give a military discount 1 
i was very excited to get this headset because i thought it was really cute 1 
excellent short film 1 
the sound quality is good and functionality is awesome 1 
every thing on phone work perfectly she like it 1 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
its uncomfortable and the sound quality is quite poor compared with the phone razr or with my previous wired headset that plugged into an lg 0 
it is wonderful and inspiring to watch and i hope that it gets released again on to video or dvd 1 
worst customer service 0 
w810i is just superb 1 
the sound quality is good and functionality is awesome 1 
not recommended 0 
this movie is also revealing 1 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
it looked like a wonderful story 1 
the chains which im no fan of beat this place easily 0 
if you do watch it however there are small consolations the actresses playing annes sisters each do a wonderful job with their roles 1 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
bad script bad direction and horrible acting make this one plain bad 0 
this movie is so awesome 1 
kris kristoffersen is good in this movie and really makes a difference 1 
awesome device 1 
check it out 1 
but the convoluted plot just didnt convince me and much of the film was watched with a weird questioning glance 0 
we loved the place 1 
very good quality though 1 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
overall i am psyched to have a phone which has all my appointments and contacts in and gets great reception 1 
keep up the good work amazon 1 
plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job 1 
come hungry leave happy and stuffed 1 
i asked multiple times for the wine list and after some time of being ignored i went to the hostess and got one myself 0 
i own 2 of these cases and would order another 1 
everything was good and tasty 1 
mobile phone tools are a must have 1 
ordered a double cheeseburger got a single patty that was falling apart picture uploaded yeah still sucks 0 
then i exchanged for the same phone even that had the same problem 0 
2 times very bad customer service 0 
great place to eat reminds me of the little mom and pop shops in the san francisco bay area 1 
i find wasting food to be despicable but this just wasnt food 0 
who in their right mind is gonna buy this battery 0 
i am so tired of clichés that is just lazy writing and here they come in thick and fast 0 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
no plot whatsoever 0 
this is an outstanding little restaurant with some of the best food i have ever tasted 1 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
we ordered the duck rare and it was pink and tender on the inside with a nice char on the outside 1 
buttons are too small 0 
utter crap sound quality is terrible 0 
excellent product 1 
great audio 1 
this particular model would not work with my motorola q smartphone 0 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
easily none other cartoon made me laugh in a tender way before getting into dark sitcoms oriented for teenagers 1 
all in all i can assure you ill be back 1 
will never ever go back and have told many people what had happened 0 
you could drive a semi truck into these holes 0 
all in all im quite satisfied with this purchase 1 
much better than the other ayce sushi place i went to in vegas 1 
works great 1 
but it is great i would really recommend it 1 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
considering the relations off screen between taylor and stanwyck it was surprising how little chemistry there was on screen between the two of them 0 
unfortunately we must have hit the bakery on leftover day because everything we ordered was stale 0 
i love all the features and form factor 1 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
so just beware 0 
he came running after us when he realized my husband had left his sunglasses on the table 1 
at no point in the proceedings does it look remotely like america 0 
avoid this one if you can 0 
the battery life is highly unacceptable 0 
it is super charged up for use as a small hybrid palmtopcameracellphone and excels in those roles 1 
any ring toneoverall good phone to buy 1 
i loved it 1 
this is simply the best bluetooth headset for sound quality 1 
yes this film does require a rather significant amount of puzzlesolving but the pieces fit together to create a beautiful picture 1 
we are so glad we found this place 1 
theres barely a boring moment in the film and there are plenty of humorous parts 1 
i especially love the long battery life 1 
my girlfriends veal was very bad 0 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
pricing is a bit of a concern at mellow mushroom 0 
if you look for authentic thai food go else where 0 
piece of junk 0 
if there was ever an indication of a writer and a directors ability to meld two highly volatile temperaments into a seamless union of creativity then this is it 1 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
the cashier had no care what so ever on what i had to say it still ended up being wayyy overpriced 0 
one of the best mexican movies ever and one of the less understood even by mexican themselves no matter how identified the should have felt with it 1 
the crêpe was delicate and thin and moist 1 
disappointed 0 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
highly recommend for any one who has a blue tooth phone 1 
2 times very bad customer service 0 
as for the killer dont expect anything original or even remotely frightening 0 
we recently witnessed her poor quality of management towards other guests as well 0 
excellent short film 1 
so far so good 1 
would come back again if i had a sushi craving while in vegas 1 
it is just the sort of pap that is screened in the afternoon to punish the unemployed for not having jobs 0 
so bad 0 
clever and a real crowdpleaserthis film still ranks among mickeys best films even after 80 wonderful years 1 
it really is impressive that the place hasnt closed down 0 
big disappointment with calendar sync 0 
bad script bad direction and horrible acting make this one plain bad 0 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
any ring toneoverall good phone to buy 1 
phone is sturdy as all nokia bar phones are 1 
i struggle to find anything bad to say about it 1 
the food is about on par with dennys which is to say not good at all 0 
the fried rice was dry as well 0 
any ring toneoverall good phone to buy 1 
so i am here to warn youdo not rent this movie it is the dumbest thing you have never seen 0 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
it rocked my world and is certainly a must see for anyone with no social or physical outlets 1 
even worse than ticker 0 
battery life is real good 1 
its the one movie that never ceases to interest me simply because it keeps me alert as i try to attempt to decipher its meanings 1 
the steak was amazingrge fillet relleno was the best seafood plate i have ever had 1 
motorola finally got the voice quality of a bluetooth headset right 1 
and if that isnt enough of a mess of a movie for you the picture is also marred with a constant use of studio sets and indoor exteriors 0 
of course the footage from the 70s was grainy but that only enhanced the film 1 
yet plantronincs continues to use the same flawed charger design 0 
must have been an off night at this place 0 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
i believe that this place is a great stop for those with a huge belly and hankering for sushi 1 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
all in all i think it was a good investment 1 
the camera really likes her in this movie 1 
i wasted my little money with this earpiece 0 
ive bought 5 wired headphones that sound better than these 0 
reception is terrible and full of static 0 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
the food came out at a good pace 1 
id like to return it 0 
love this phone 1 
each day of the week they have a different deal and its all so delicious 1 
it was horrible 0 
the scenes with the ohsomature neighbourgirl are a misplace 0 
i would avoid this place if you are staying in the mirage 0 
then as if i hadnt wasted enough of my life there they poured salt in the wound by drawing out the time it took to bring the check 0 
this review is long overdue since i consider a tale of two sisters to be the single greatest film ever made 1 
the shipping time was also very quick 1 
a very good film indeed about great and unconditional love 1 
very much disappointed with this company 0 
i really do recommend this place you can go wrong with this donut place 1 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
the fries were great too 1 
i had high hopes for this place since the burgers are cooked over a charcoal grill but unfortunately the taste fell flat way flat 0 
i rate this movie 910 1 
worthless product 0 
only like 3 or 4 buildings used a couple of locations maybe poor hummh 0 
this is some seriously good pizza and im an expertconnisseur on the topic 1 
i heart this place 1 
lifetime does not air it enough so if anyone knows what store sells it let me know because this is a musthave 1 
i wouldnt return 0 
a week later after i activated it it suddenly died 0 
thanks again to amazon for having the things i need for a good price 1 
it was a very superficial movie and it gave me the feeling that i was watching play rather than a film 0 
we waited for thirty minutes to be seated although there were 8 vacant tables and we were the only folks waiting 0 
classywarm atmosphere fun and fresh appetizers succulent steaks baseball steak 1 
muddy low quality sound and the casing around the wires insert was poorly super glued and slid off 0 
not only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic but it also managed to give away the entire movie and im not exaggerating every moment every plot point every joke is told in the trailer 0 
the ambience is wonderful and there is music playing 1 
the secondary plot line is incomprehensible and its relation to the primary plot line is mystifying 0 
once you get inside youll be impressed with the place 1 
end of days is one of the worst bigbudget action movies ive ever seen 0 
soggy and not good 0 
the film gives meaning to the phrase never in the history of human conflict has so much been owed by so many to so few 1 
no plot whatsoever 0 
i found a six inch long piece of wire in my salsa 0 
disappointing 0 
our server was very nice and even though he looked a little overwhelmed with all of our needs he stayed professional and friendly until the end 1 
he surely doesnt know how to make a coherent action movie from the screenwriter of air force one who was only obliged to write the script just for a big sum of money 0 
i was so insulted 0 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
i know that sounds funny but to me it seemed like sketchy technology that wouldnt work wellwell this one works great 1 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
its practically perfect in all of them  a true masterpiece in a sea of faux masterpieces 1 
loved itfriendly servers great food wonderful and imaginative menu 1 
the jerky camera movements were also annoying 0 
the nachos are a must have 1 
macbeth jason connery moved me to tears with his final monolog out brief candle outhe gave the sphere of moral decay and dark forces a human face which makes it the more interesting 1 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
sprint charges for this service 0 
being a 90s child i truly enjoyed this show and i can proudly say that i enjoyed it big time and even more than the classical wb cartoons 1 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
just does not work 0 
the sound quality is excellent as well 1 
but whatever it was that cost them so much it didnt translate to quality thats for sure 0 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
i think that it is a must see older john wayne film 1 
the shower area is outside so you can only rinse not take a full shower unless you dont mind being nude for everyone to see 0 
battery life is also great 1 
there are so many problems i dont know where to start 0 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
after 20 minutes wait i got a table 0 
bad choice 0 
comfortable in my hand 1 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
i dont think ill be running back to carlys anytime soon for food 0 
after the disappointing dinner we went elsewhere for dessert 0 
i have read others reviews here but i havent had any problem with it 1 
the restaurant is very clean and has a family restaurant feel to it 1 
amazon sucks 0 
you need two hands to operate the screenthis software interface is decade old and cannot compete with new software designs 0 
id like to return it 0 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
its the best headset i have used 1 
what a waste of time 0 
its kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly its embarrassing how childlike the company is 0 
my order was not correct 0 
i dont know exactly what it is about this movie but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our familys memories 1 
the good cinematography also makes her and monica bellucci look very beautiful 1 
i thought errol flynn was brilliant as custer and has since become my favourite actor 1 
it works 1 
nine out of ten for a truly lovely film 1 
my 5year old nokia 2160 from tracfone holds the charge a lot better than this 0 
a world better than 95 of the garbage in the theatres today 1 
a truly truly bad film 0 
absolutel junk 0 
i purchased this and within 2 days it was no longer working 0 
great place to eat reminds me of the little mom and pop shops in the san francisco bay area 1 
when it opens the battery connection is broken and the device is turned off 0 
never been to hard rock casino before will never ever step forward in it again 0 
service is quick and friendly 1 
an italian reviewer called this a small great film and thats right 1 
this review is long overdue since i consider a tale of two sisters to be the single greatest film ever made 1 
if you are looking for a good quality motorola headset keep looking this isnt it 0 
im using it with an iriver spinn with case and it fits fine 1 
people who like european films and art movies will like this movie 1 
will never ever go back 0 
just spicy enough perfect actually 1 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
this is a great little item 1 
there still are good actors around 1 
its the one movie that never ceases to interest me simply because it keeps me alert as i try to attempt to decipher its meanings 1 
not recommended 0 
yet plantronincs continues to use the same flawed charger design 0 
the cable looks so thin and flimsy it is scary 0 
cinematography the film was shot in an interesting way 1 
i swung in to give them a try but was deeply disappointed 0 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
my sanyo has survived dozens of drops on blacktop without ill effect 1 
needless to say i wont be going back anytime soon 0 
the cg opening sequence in space looked like it could have been created on microsoft slideshow for gods sake 0 
the best place in vegas for breakfast just check out a sat or sun 1 
pretty cool i would say 1 
on the ground right next to our table was a large smeared beensteppedinandtrackedeverywhere pile of green bird poop 0 
great product and price 1 
poor voice clarity 0 
highly entertaining at all angles 1 
i would avoid this place if you are staying in the mirage 0 
it is not good 0 
i could not stand to even watch it for very long for fear of losing iq 0 
the chicken dishes are ok the beef is like shoe leather 0 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
the acting is beyond abysmal 0 
i wouldnt see this movie again for free 0 
i enjoyed reading this book to my children when they were little 1 
disappointed 0 
so flavorful and has just the perfect amount of heat 1 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
i did not have any problem with this item and would order it again if needed 1 
the story itself is just predictable and lazy 0 
i understand that its supposed to be a cheap popcorn comedy but that doesnt mean that it has to completely insult our intelligence and have writing so incredibly hackneyed that it borders on offensive 0 
only had this a month but its worked flawlessly so far 1 
this device is great in several situations1 1 
it was forced like everything in this movie 0 
does not work for listening to music with the cingular 8125 0 
the earpiece on this is too large or too heavyit keeps falling out of my ear 0 
this is high adventure at its best 1 
highly recommended for all ages although the younger set will probably not appreciate some of the more subtle references they will certainly appreciate one galley scene in particular 1 
not my thing 0 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
so bad 0 
bad purchase 0 
excellent product 1 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
i have read others reviews here but i havent had any problem with it 1 
after 20 minutes wait i got a table 0 
also the phone doesnt seem to accept anything except cbr mp3s preferably ripped by windows media player 0 
thanks again to amazon for having the things i need for a good price 1 
the lead man is charismafree 0 
leopard print is wonderfully wild 1 
if you want healthy authentic or ethic food try this place 1 
comes with a strong light that you can use to light up your camera shots and even flash sos signals seriously 1 
would come back again if i had a sushi craving while in vegas 1 
i love the look and feel of samsung flipphones 1 
the acting helps the writing along very well maybe the idiotsavant sister could have been played better and it is a real joy to watch 1 
i got the aluminum case for my new palm vx and it worked really wellit has protected my handheld perfectly so far 1 
very comfortable 1 
also its slim enough to fit into my alarm clock docking station without removing the case 1 
so they performed 1 
if you are reading this please dont go there 0 
oh and i forgot to also mention the weird color effect it has on your phone 0 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
definitely a turn off for me i doubt ill be back unless someone else is buying 0 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
this place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver 0 
ive bought 5 wired headphones that sound better than these 0 
i mean in a realistic world she would never have gotten into that ballet repertory the whole thing was quite pathetic 0 
the songs were the best and the muppets were so hilarious 1 
better than youd expect 1 
the cg opening sequence in space looked like it could have been created on microsoft slideshow for gods sake 0 
highly recommended a 1 
worth every penny 1 
id love to go back 1 
definitely will come back here again 1 
the sweet potato fries were very good and seasoned well 1 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
just does not work 0 
awesome service and food 1 
these are fabulous 1 
there is however some pretty good acting at least for this type of film 1 
the only good thing was our waiter he was very helpful and kept the bloddy marys coming 1 
the block was amazing 1 
and the sound quality is great 1 
the meat was pretty dry i had the sliced brisket and pulled pork 0 
its pure brilliance 1 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
great atmosphere friendly and fast service 1 
this is a really fantastic thai restaurant which is definitely worth a visit 1 
the acting was decidely wooden though no worse than a period universal b movie 0 
you also cannot take pictures with it in the case because the lense is covered 0 
omit watching this 0 
their menu is diverse and reasonably priced 1 
they will customize your order any way youd like my usual is eggplant with green bean stir fry love it 1 
howeverthe riingtones are not the best and neither are the games 0 
very good phone 1 
i use this product in a motor control center where there is a lot of high voltage humming from the equipment and it works great 1 
but the premise of the film was so ridiculous that the president of the us 0 
i wont be back 0 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
it has a very good plot it holds your complete attention the acting is superb tom wilkinson was fantastic and emily watson was also very good 1 
the camera really likes her in this movie 1 
great brunch spot 1 
all it took was one drop from about 6 inches above the kitchen counter and it was crackedi am not impressed and i am not laughing 0 
voice recognition is tremendous 1 
i love this phone 1 
be sure to order dessert even if you need to pack it togo the tiramisu and cannoli are both to die for 1 
sauce was tasteless 0 
best headset ever 1 
i love the pho and the spring rolls oh so yummy you have to try 1 
it even has its sweet moments 1 
good works fine 1 
i like design and look of jabra behing the ear headsets and 5020 is pretty comfortible to wear 24 hours a day without pain in the ear 1 
the bartender was also nice 1 
great character actors telly savalas and peter boyle 1 
again no plot at all 0 
it just blew 0 
i went on motorolas website and followed all directions but could not get it to pair again 0 
it has a great camera thats 2mp and the pics are nice and clear with great picture quality 1 
there was so much hype over this phone that i assumed it was the best my mistake 0 
when achille and philippa beautifully sing a duet from don giovanni that perfectly describes their situation in the movie you appreciate the subtle layers of this excellent film 1 
the first thing that happened was that the tracking was off 0 
unfortunately it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees 0 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
my fella got the huevos rancheros and they didnt look too appealing 0 
works good 1 
the ending is so so perfect youll shed a tear 1 
its hard not to fall headoverheels in love with that girl 1 
hitchcock is a great director 1 
there was no chemistry between ben affleck and sandra bullock in this film and i couldnt understand why he would consider even leaving his wifetobe for this chick that he supposedly was knocked out by 0 
i love this thing 1 
the meat was pretty dry i had the sliced brisket and pulled pork 0 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
the color is even prettier than i thought it would be and the graphics are incredibly sharp 1 
so in a nutshell 1 the restaraunt smells like a combination of a dirty fish market and a sewer 0 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
this totally unfunny movie is so over the top and pathetic and unrealistic that throughout the whole 90 minutes of utter torture i probably looked at my watch about 70000 times 0 
your servers suck wait correction our server heimer sucked 0 
its worth driving up from tucson 1 
eclectic selection 1 
as a courtroom drama its compelling as an indictment on the american justice system its frightening 1 
timely shipment and quality product 1 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
it was too predictable even for a chick flick 0 
so just beware 0 
the film is way too long 0 
this film tries to be a serious and sophisticated thrillerhorror flick and it fails miserably 0 
perhaps i caught them on an off night judging by the other reviews but im not inspired to go back 0 
everything was perfect the night we were in 1 
what a waste 0 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
if you look for authentic thai food go else where 0 
and the rest of it just sits there being awful with soldiers singing songs about the masculinity they pledge themselves to hairsplitting about purity the admiration of swords etc 0 
the headset fulfills my requirements so i am happy with my purchase 1 
its been my choice headset for yearsgreat sound good volume good noise cancellation 1 
today was my first taste of a buldogis gourmet hot dog and i have to tell you it was more than i ever thought possible 1 
i also decided not to send it back because our waitress looked like she was on the verge of having a heart attack 0 
nargile i think you are great 1 
great pork sandwich 1 
a good quality bargain i bought this after i bought a cheapy from big lots that sounded awful and people on the other end couldnt hear me 1 
the food is very good for your typical bar food 1 
i think the most wonderful parts literally full of wonder are the excerpts from his works 1 
the entire audience applauded at the conclusion of the film 1 
it isnt even an achievement as a sobaditsgood or sobaditsmemorable movie 0 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
the explosion of the gas tanks at the end was just as awful 0 
the chefs were friendly and did a good job 1 
rude inconsiderate management 0 
then our food came out disappointment ensued 0 
i do not know if this was emilio estevezs directorial debut but the pacing the interplay and development of the characters as well as some clever camera work surrounding the character estevez plays all suggest a natural eye 1 
the plantains were the worst ive ever tasted 0 
the story unfolds in 18th century jutland and the use of period music played on period instruments is just one more fine touch 1 
the success of the film depends on the casting of sydney greenstreet as the alexander yardley character 1 
item arrived quickly and works great with my metro pcs samsung schr450 slider phone and sony premium sound in ear plugs 1 
i even dropped this phone into a stream and it was submerged for 15 seconds and it still works great 1 
yet i enjoy watching it 1 
hell no will i go back 0 
the movie lacks visual interest drama expression of feeling and celebration of the very patriotism that underlines the narrative 0 
the plastic breaks really easy on this clip 0 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
i got the car charger and not even after a week the charger was brokeni went to plug it in and it started smoking 0 
stay away from the q 0 
waste of money 0 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
yet plantronincs continues to use the same flawed charger design 0 
works great 1 
the camera really likes her in this movie 1 
not what i wanted 0 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
yeah the movie pretty much sucked 0 
we had fantastic service and were pleased by the atmosphere 1 
it is a really good show to watch 1 
on three different occasions i asked for well done or medium well and all three times i got the bloodiest piece of meat on my plate 0 
walked in and the place smelled like an old grease trap and only 2 others there eating 0 
it is unusable in a moving car at freeway speed 0 
i had ordered a motorola data cable got a very well finished and working product 1 
an italian reviewer called this a small great film and thats right 1 
would not reccommend 0 
i really liked that 1 
but it wasnt anything at all just one big yawn 0 
i know this is not like the other restaurants at all something is very off here 0 
it is a joy to use 1 
their chow mein is so good 1 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
battery has no life 0 
the acting helps the writing along very well maybe the idiotsavant sister could have been played better and it is a real joy to watch 1 
they have a really nice atmosphere 1 
the chicken dishes are ok the beef is like shoe leather 0 
i wasnt really impressed with strip steak 0 
dont buy it 0 
definitely a turn off for me i doubt ill be back unless someone else is buying 0 
dont waste your money 0 
the text messaging feature is really tricky to use 0 
their menu is diverse and reasonably priced 1 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
the movie showed a lot of florida at its best made it look very appealing 1 
hence the whole story lacks a certain energy 0 
ill give this film 10 out of 10 1 
great food 1 
exceptionally bad 0 
a very good film indeed about great and unconditional love 1 
the warmth it generates is in contrast to its austere backdrop 1 
a piece of cinematic garbage captured on celluloid 0 
go rent it 1 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
the price was very good and with the free shipping and all it was a good purchase 1 
this blueant supertooth handsfree phone speaker is awesome 1 
when i placed my treo into the case not only was it not snug but there was a lot of extra room on the sides 0 
generally it just lacked imagination 0 
their rotating beers on tap is also a highlight of this place 1 
the worst was the salmon sashimi 0 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
this one wants to surf on the small wave of space movies in 1998 deep impact and armageddon and this one fails everywhere 0 
att is not clear sound is very distorted and you have to yell when you talk 0 
a film not easily forgotten 1 
great place to relax and have an awesome burger and beer 1 
once you get inside youll be impressed with the place 1 
so there is no way for me to plug it in here in the us unless i go by a converter 0 
by this time our side of the restaurant was almost empty so there was no excuse 0 
seafood was limited to boiled shrimp and crab legs but the crab legs definitely did not taste fresh 0 
an excellent new restaurant by an experienced frenchman 1 
food was average at best 0 
bad quality 0 
i especially love the long battery life 1 
i mean in a realistic world she would never have gotten into that ballet repertory the whole thing was quite pathetic 0 
great bluetooth 1 
it ranks highly as a great noircrimedrama incredible performances by belmondo and lino ventura 1 
50 down the drain 0 
the sound quality is excellent as well 1 
love this headset 1 
great software for motorolas 1 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
the charger worked for about a week and then completely stopped charging my phone 0 
very bad performance plays angela bennett a computer expert who is at home all the time 0 
the steak and the shrimp are in my opinion the best entrees at gc 1 
the descriptions said yum yum sauce and another said eel sauce yet another said spicy mayowell none of the rolls had sauces on them 0 
i dont each much pasta but i love the homemade hand made pastas and thin pizzas here 1 
someone shouldve invented this sooner 1 
very easy to use 1 
after 20 minutes wait i got a table 0 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
i couldnt think of a better way to end the film but a smile on my face great way to wrap up an amazing film and trilogy 1 
really ugly 0 
i especially love the long battery life 1 
its still wild stuff though and is highly recommended to fans of giallo cinema 1 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
worked perfectly 1 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
its fits like a glove and is strong secure and durable 1 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
no complaints 1 
service is quick and even to go orders are just like we like it 1 
the movie lacks visual interest drama expression of feeling and celebration of the very patriotism that underlines the narrative 0 
it was quite comfortable in the ear 1 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
so there is no way for me to plug it in here in the us unless i go by a converter 0 
a pretty good product 1 
we have gotten a lot of compliments on it 1 
this item is great installed it let it charged up overnite and it has been working good every since with no problems 1 
this is one of the better buffets that i have been to 1 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
i advise everyone do not be fooled 0 
nice docking station for home or work 1 
bad quality 0 
didnt laugh or even smile once 0 
how this piece of trash was ever released is beyond me the acting the story the characters the supposedly special effects etcits all wrong 0 
it also took her forever to bring us the check when we asked for it 0 
that company is a joke 0 
the visual effects were awful 0 
it failed to convey the broad sweep of landscapes that were a great part of the original 0 
appears to actually outperform the original battery from china that came with my v325i 1 
cinematography the film was shot in an interesting way 1 
we made the drive all the way from north scottsdale and i was not one bit disappointed 1 
great place to eat reminds me of the little mom and pop shops in the san francisco bay area 1 
conclusion i loved it 1 
the shower area is outside so you can only rinse not take a full shower unless you dont mind being nude for everyone to see 0 
this one wants to surf on the small wave of space movies in 1998 deep impact and armageddon and this one fails everywhere 0 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
these are fabulous 1 
sam shepards portrayal of a gung ho marine was sobering 1 
this is a stunning movie 1 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
excellent service 1 
waited 2 hours never got either of our pizzas as many other around us who came in later did 0 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
i would recommend purchasing the jabra jx10 series 2 which works flawlessly with my moto q go figure 1 
i was able to do voice dialing in the car with no problem 1 
i have tried these cables with my computer and my ipod and it works just fine 1 
the only consistent thread holding the series together were the amazing performances of leni parker and anita laselva as the two taelons in quiet idealogical conflict 0 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
food was really good and i got full petty fast 1 
it failed to convey the broad sweep of landscapes that were a great part of the original 0 
lewis blacks considerable talent is wasted here too as he is at his most incendiary when he is unrestrained which the pg13 rating certainly wont allow 0 
it is an hour and half waste of time following a bunch of very pretty high schoolers whine and cry about life 0 
truly awful 0 
best tater tots in the southwest 1 
very friendly staff 1 
does not work for listening to music with the cingular 8125 0 
i will never go back to this place and will never ever recommended this place to anyone 0 
this one works and was priced right 1 
its very attractive and appears to be of good quality 1 
not good by any stretch of the imagination 0 
he owns the film just as spacek owned coal miners daughter and quaid owned great balls of fire 1 
i can think of no other film where something vitally important occurs every other minute 1 
overall the film is interesting and thoughtprovoking 1 
the price is reasonable and the service is great 1 
the service was not up to par either 0 
my order was not correct 0 
the chains which im no fan of beat this place easily 0 
its just painful 0 
i enjoyed reading this book to my children when they were little 1 
as for the mains also uninspired 0 
no complaints 1 
this place is handsdown one of the best places to eat in the phoenix metro area 1 
great earpiece 1 
i really loved the story line and the poler bear was kinda cutebut if anyone has a question about fort steele just ask away 1 
i will not be eating there again 0 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
a fantastic neighborhood gem 1 
i never walked out of a movie faster 0 
basically the service was very bad 0 
as for the service im a fan because its quick and youre being served by some nice folks 1 
the inside is really quite nice and very clean 1 
in my house i was getting dropped coverage upstairs and no coverage in my basement 0 
ive had better not only from dedicated boba tea spots but even from jenni pho 0 
the problem was the script 0 
the story starts too fast with absolutely no suspense or buildup in the slightest 0 
waiter was a jerk 0 
its hard not to fall headoverheels in love with that girl 1 
furthermore you cant even find hours of operation on the website 0 
very satisifed with that 1 
nothing at all to recommend 0 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
this place has it 1 
battery chargelife is quite long 1 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
the service was poor and thats being nice 0 
tasted like dirt 0 
the movie was very interesting from beginning to the end 1 
better than youd expect 1 
but the duet between the astronaut and his doctor at the beginning of the movie is a perfect exchange if one considers that this movie was made well into the cold war and the astronauts biggest fear is that he has crashed in the ussr 1 
it is very educational for children 1 to 8 years old 1 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
even worse than ticker 0 
special mention should be made of the superb music score and sound effects which are an integral element in helping to make this such a memorable and enjoyable cartoon 1 
you cant beat that 1 
i must say i have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again 1 
i liked it 1 
there is a totally unnecessary trainroller coaster scene 0 
about ten minutes into this film i started having second thoughts 0 
this really is how vegas fine dining used to be right down to the menus handed to the ladies that have no prices listed 1 
i was hoping for more 0 
howeverthe riingtones are not the best and neither are the games 0 
only like 3 or 4 buildings used a couple of locations maybe poor hummh 0 
after arguing with verizon regarding the dropped calls we returned the phones after two days 0 
it always cuts out and makes a beep beep beep sound then says signal failed 0 
artless camerawork endlessly presents us with the ugliest setting imaginable ie 0 
this is a beautiful phone 1 
not much flavor to them and very poorly constructed 0 
this one is simply a disappointment 0 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
the service here is fair at best 0 
if the food isnt bad enough for you then enjoy dealing with the worlds worstannoying drunk people 0 
this is a great deal 1 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
characters are onedimensional even the good guys and especially the bad guys 0 
now this is a movie i really dislike 0 
its just lame 0 
i got to enjoy the seafood salad with a fabulous vinegrette 1 
this is a great little item 1 
this movie is greatespecially if you enjoy visual arts 1 
i guess i liked the details of his dysfunctionhe was believable 1 
we ordered some old classics and some new dishes after going there a few times and were sorely disappointed with everything 0 
all it took was one drop from about 6 inches above the kitchen counter and it was crackedi am not impressed and i am not laughing 0 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
the bipolarity of the ruthless thug one minute a ruthless killer the next minute a luvs diaper commercial is completely unconvincing 0 
poor construction 0 
the jerky camera movements were also annoying 0 
i saw it as a child on tv back in 1973 when it was the stranger and i loved it 1 
the casting is also horrible cause all you see is a really really bad actors period 0 
the phone gets extremely hot 0 
it was a great phone 1 
but above all the exquisite visual composition of each moment with inventive and elegant use of closeup camera angle and lighting including pointillistic faux home movie footage is a wonder and joy to behold 1 
artless camerawork endlessly presents us with the ugliest setting imaginable ie 0 
i did not expect this to be so good 1 
this is the first phone ive had that has been so cheaply made 0 
waited 2 hours never got either of our pizzas as many other around us who came in later did 0 
the real disappointment was our waiter 0 
i cant see how this movie can be an inspiration to anyone to come out or overcome fear and rejection 0 
i really dont see how anyone could enjoy this movie 0 
the igo chargers and tips are really great 1 
it looks very nice 1 
the food was great as always compliments to the chef 1 
this product had a strong rubberpetroleum smell that was unbearable after a while and caused me to return it 0 
ive owned this phone for 7 months now and can say that its the best mobile phone ive had 1 
this film has no redeeming features 0 
this device is great in several situations1 1 
service stinks here 0 
camera color balance is awful 0 
dont waste your money and time 0 
the movie was so boring that i sometimes found myself occupied peaking in the paper instead of watching never happened during a columbo movie before 0 
the inside is really quite nice and very clean 1 
it is the best charger i have seen on the market yet 1 
crash is a depressing little nothing that provokes emotion but teaches you nothing if you already know racism and prejudice are bad things 0 
it is an insane game 1 
the ear buds only play music in one ear 0 
i hate movies like that 0 
i found this move beautiful enjoyable and uplifting 1 
but it is great i would really recommend it 1 
i would recommend purchasing the jabra jx10 series 2 which works flawlessly with my moto q go figure 1 
aailiyah was pretty good as akasha in places compelling her first entrance and mini dance scene 1 
a week later after i activated it it suddenly died 0 
stopped by during the late may bank holiday off rick steve recommendation and loved it 1 
not even good for camp value 0 
its quite simply the highest most superlative form of cinema imaginable 1 
i will come back here every time im in vegas 1 
avoid at all costs 0 
doesnt hold charge 0 
i cant see how this movie can be an inspiration to anyone to come out or overcome fear and rejection 0 
1010 1 
the good cinematography also makes her and monica bellucci look very beautiful 1 
i have two more years left in this contract and i hate this phone 0 
trouble is the writing and directing make it impossible to establish those things that make a movie watchable like character story theme and so on 0 
the holster that arrived did not match the photo in the ad 0 
i found the product to be easy to set up and use 1 
itll be a regular stop on my trips to phoenix 1 
improper description i had to return it 0 
piece of junk 0 
add betty white and jean smart and you have a great cast everyone played their parts really well 1 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
the building itself seems pretty neat the bathroom is pretty trippy but i wouldnt eat here again 0 
if you check the directors filmography on this site you will see why this film didnt have a chance 0 
horrible horrible protector 0 
the acting by the whole cast could be put on a scale and balanced perfectly between overacting and underacting 0 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
highly recommended for all ages although the younger set will probably not appreciate some of the more subtle references they will certainly appreciate one galley scene in particular 1 
items stated as included from the description are not included 0 
do not make the same mistake as me 0 
im super pissd 0 
top line dont waste your time and money on this one its as bad as it comes 0 
definitely a bargain 1 
waste of money 0 
it always cuts out and makes a beep beep beep sound then says signal failed 0 
ive seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie 0 
very good lunch spot 1 
nice solid keyboard 1 
but when i check voice mail at night the keypad backlight turns off a few seconds into the first message and then im lost 0 
overall i wasnt very impressed with noca 0 
nice headphones for the price and they work great 1 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
the acting from all involved and that includes those like shatner and nimoy is bad and washed out and making them seem as old as they look in real life the special effects are tacky like when spock has to rescue kirk on a jet pack when he falls down from a mountain 0 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
be sure to order dessert even if you need to pack it togo the tiramisu and cannoli are both to die for 1 
everything was fresh and delicious 1 
cant get the software to work with my computer 0 
muddy low quality sound and the casing around the wires insert was poorly super glued and slid off 0 
director paul matthews who also wrotedirected the weak 1995 monster movie grim clearly doesnt know how to pace his films 0 
it was a great phone 1 
i could eat their bruschetta all day it is devine 1 
his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic 1 
this is truly an art movieit actually has a lot of art in it 1 
unless youre just out to visually collect all extant films of austens work you can skip this one 0 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
the shipping time was also very quick 1 
i saw it as a child on tv back in 1973 when it was the stranger and i loved it 1 
service sucks 0 
none of the new ones have ever quite worked properly 0 
i wear glasses and it fits fine with them 1 
the movie has almost no action scenes in it and very little comedy 0 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
the bus boy on the other hand was so rude 0 
went in for happy hour great list of wines 1 
thats how id describe this painfully dreary timewaster of a film 0 
i highly recommend this case 1 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
great phone 1 
reversible plug works great 1 
i really do recommend this place you can go wrong with this donut place 1 
also great directing and photography 1 
id love to go back 1 
these are fabulous 1 
i paid too much 0 
the server was very negligent of our needs and made us feel very unwelcome i would not suggest this place 0 
the cow tongue and cheek tacos are amazing 1 
best tacos in town by far 1 
im glad i found this product on amazon it is hard to find it wasnt high priced 1 
its a long time since i was so entertained by a movie 1 
my only problem is i thought the actor playing the villain was a low rent michael ironside 0 
my order was not correct 0 
worked great 1 
we loved the biscuits 1 
we would recommend these to others 1 
the acting sucks the music sucks the script sucks the pacing sucks the special fx suck the directing sucks basically this movie sucks 0 
it is practically useless and did not add any kind of boost to my reception after i bought it 0 
his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic 1 
on the up side their cafe serves really good food 1 
i tried talking real loud but shouting on the telephone gets old and i was still told it wasnt great 0 
this movie is bad 0 
nonlinear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well 1 
on the negative its insipid enough to cause regret for another 2 hours of life wasted in front of the screen 0 
it is very educational for children 1 to 8 years old 1 
their rotating beers on tap is also a highlight of this place 1 
the tracfonewebsite is user friendly and makes it easy toactivate etc 1 
the dialogue sucked 0 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
the kids are very cool too 1 
its kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly its embarrassing how childlike the company is 0 
chinese forgeries abound 0 
soyo technology sucks 0 
on the up side their cafe serves really good food 1 
i would definitely recommend the jabra bt250v for those who are looking for comfort clarity and a great price 1 
i am far from a sushi connoisseur but i can definitely tell the difference between good food and bad food and this was certainly bad food 0 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
greatno problems at all 1 
what a disappointment 0 
i want to first say our server was great and we had perfect service 1 
babie bop is very cute 1 
the only thing that i think could improve is the sound leaks out from the headset 0 
we ordered the duck rare and it was pink and tender on the inside with a nice char on the outside 1 
i was totally fascinated by the music the dancing everything 1 
this does not fit the palm tungsten e2 and it broke the first time i tried to plug it in 0 
what is even more stupid is that who had thought an idea that there should be a volcano in los angeles 0 
as an earlier review noted plug in this charger and nothing happens 0 
an hour and a half i wish i could bring back 0 
prosgood camera very nice pictures also has cool styles like black and white and more 1 
tonight i had the elk filet specialand it sucked 0 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
im glad i found this product on amazon it is hard to find it wasnt high priced 1 
the only thing i wasnt too crazy about was their guacamole as i dont like it puréed 0 
great product 1 
the plot well i said id let that one go 0 
we enjoy their pizza and brunch 1 
when achille and philippa beautifully sing a duet from don giovanni that perfectly describes their situation in the movie you appreciate the subtle layers of this excellent film 1 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
the script is horrendously stupid 0 
the characters are interesting and you really care for them 1 
this place is pretty good nice little vibe in the restaurant 1 
design flaw 0 
stay away from this store be careful 0 
nonlinear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well 1 
items stated as included from the description are not included 0 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
and if that isnt enough of a mess of a movie for you the picture is also marred with a constant use of studio sets and indoor exteriors 0 
lame would be the best way to describe it 0 
this is one of the worst sandra bullock movie since speed 2 but not quite that bad 0 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
the plot simply rumbles on like a machine desperately depending on the addition of new scenes 0 
i find wasting food to be despicable but this just wasnt food 0 
took an hour to get our food only 4 tables in restaurant my food was luke warm our sever was running around like he was totally overwhelmed 0 
it has a great camera thats 2mp and the pics are nice and clear with great picture quality 1 
all the actors give a wonderful performance especially jennifer rubin as jamie harris who changes from the nervous starlet in the beginning through the strange events she is part of to the cool star 1 
the meat was pretty dry i had the sliced brisket and pulled pork 0 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
great product for the price 1 
glad i didnt pay to see it 0 
awful service 0 
this place has it 1 
the food was very good 1 
but what really made it unwatchable was the direction 0 
last night was my second time dining here and i was so happy i decided to go back 1 
however this didnt make up for the fact that overall this was a tremendously boring movie 0 
reaching for the bottom row is uncomfortable and the send and end keys are not where i expect them to be3 0 
plantronics bluetooth excelent buy 1 
main thing i didnt enjoy is that the crowd is of older crowd around mid 30s and up 0 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
this is the place where i first had pho and it was amazing 1 
anyways the food was definitely not filling at all and for the price you pay you should expect more 0 
really ugly 0 
if you do go see this movie bring a pillow or a girlfriendboyfriend to keep you occupied through out 0 
the mic is great 1 
cant get the software to work with my computer 0 
very disappointing 0 
the scenes with the ohsomature neighbourgirl are a misplace 0 
the battery is completely useless to me 0 
when i opened the sandwich i was impressed but not in a good way 0 
we had 7 at our table and the service was pretty fast 1 
its an empty hollow shell of a movie 0 
this film tries to be a serious and sophisticated thrillerhorror flick and it fails miserably 0 
it was a long time that i didnt see a so charismatic actor on screen 1 
the majority of the logitech earbud headsets failed 0 
regardless the film fails on most levels 0 
they brought a fresh batch of fries and i was thinking yay something warm but no 0
