i hate to disagree with my fellow yelpers but my husband and i were so disappointed with this place 0 
a film not easily forgotten 1 
thanks good a movie like this was done and released 1 
appears to actually outperform the original battery from china that came with my v325i 1 
the jamaican mojitos are delicious 1 
there arent death scenes like in previous movies and the fx are terrible 0 
really ugly 0 
it looses connection to the phone even when it is within a couple feet between the two 0 
i rate this movie 910 1 
still its quite interesting and entertaining to follow 1 
food was so gooodd 1 
its pure brilliance 1 
appears to actually outperform the original battery from china that came with my v325i 1 
the goat taco didnt skimp on the meat and wow what flavor 1 
this one wants to surf on the small wave of space movies in 1998 deep impact and armageddon and this one fails everywhere 0 
a good quality bargain i bought this after i bought a cheapy from big lots that sounded awful and people on the other end couldnt hear me 1 
a truly truly bad film 0 
perfect for the ps3 1 
at any rate this film stinks its not funny and fulci should have stayed with giallo and supernatural zombie movies 0 
today was my first taste of a buldogis gourmet hot dog and i have to tell you it was more than i ever thought possible 1 
the refried beans that came with my meal were dried out and crusty and the food was bland 0 
like the other reviewer said you couldnt pay me to eat at this place again 0 
another note about this phones appearance is that it really looks rather bland especially in the all black model 0 
i enjoyed it 1 
verizon tech support walked my through a few procedures none of which worked and i ended up having to do a hard reset wiping out all my data 0 
first time there and might just be the last 0 
the update procedure is difficult and cumbersome 0 
very friendly staff 1 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
i paid the bill but did not tip because i felt the server did a terrible job 0 
worked very well paired with a treo 700w and as a skype headset on my pc using a usb bluetooth transceiver 1 
it was too predictable even for a chick flick 0 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
i struggle to find anything bad to say about it 1 
the attractive set used throughout most of the film is an eyepleasing gem 1 
a week later after i activated it it suddenly died 0 
its the best headset i have used 1 
the pan cakes everyone are raving about taste like a sugary disaster tailored to the palate of a six year old 0 
he was terrible 0 
this is a masterful piece of filmmaking with many themes simmering and occasionally boiling over in this warts and all study of the poets bohemian selfindulgent wartime years that span the aerial bombardments of london and the outward tranquillity of a welsh coastal retreat the borderlines between friendship lust and love dedication to art and experience versus practical concerns jealousy rivalry cowardice and egotism versus heroism and selfsacrifice and more 1 
i had a pretty satifying experience 1 
works as described 1 
i was very disappointed in the movie 0 
i think it was robert ryans best film because he portrayed someone like my father and he was a schizophrenic in real lifemy father although he never murdered anyone but was affected more so during the second world war which made him worse 1 
beautiful styling though 1 
and finally after all that we get to an ending that wouldve been great had it been handled by competent people and not jerry falwell 0 
i wasted my little money with this earpiece 0 
the pancake was also really good and pretty large at that 1 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
whatever the producer was going for he missed entirely 0 
but the service was beyond bad 0 
integrated seamlessly with the motorola razr phone 1 
some may say this buffet is pricey but i think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot 1 
great food 1 
this is a great little item 1 
the best example of how dumb the writing is when its established that you can turn the zombiestudents back into humans by removing a necklace containing a piece of the meteorite 0 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
def coming back to bowl next time 1 
absolutely great 1 
i felt asleep the first time i watched it so i can recommend it for insomniacs 0 
the restaurant atmosphere was exquisite 1 
i found the product to be easy to set up and use 1 
i wish i could enter negative values admins 0 
the result is a powerhouse achievement made more timely now perhaps because of our cultures disturbing fascination with celebrity and its distorted interpretations of fame 1 
judith light is one of my favorite actresses and i think she does a superb job in this film 1 
steamboat willie is an amazingly important film to our cinema history 1 
kieslowski never ceases to amaze me 1 
i know that sounds funny but to me it seemed like sketchy technology that wouldnt work wellwell this one works great 1 
for readers who have already seen one of miyazakis films he is still in top form and made another worthwhile experience 1 
the movie was very interesting from beginning to the end 1 
very disappointed 0 
its a great tool for entertainment communication and data managementoh be sure to use activesync 42 for optimal data synchronization results 1 
very disappointing 0 
was not happy 0 
clear crisp sound 1 
well just if you keep thinking how bad it is 0 
i wish i could enter negative values admins 0 
i cannot make calls at certain places 0 
great food and great service in a clean and friendly setting 1 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
poor sound quality 0 
i found this move beautiful enjoyable and uplifting 1 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
it is very comfortable to wear as well which is probably the most important aspect about using a case 1 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
no ear loop needed its tiny and the sound is great 1 
comfortable in my hand 1 
as i said abovepretty useless 0 
freezes frequently4 0 
the movie seemed a little slow at first 0 
very good stuff for the price 1 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
if you do watch it however there are small consolations the actresses playing annes sisters each do a wonderful job with their roles 1 
the shrimp tender and moist 1 
really bad 0 
it didnt charge for me 0 
the film is well paced understated and one of the best courtroom documentaries ive seen 1 
call me a nut but i think this is one of the best movies ever 1 
the instruction manual is lacking 0 
works well 1 
her lines seem to have been written by a fifteen year old though they are trying oh so so hard to sound like how a fifteen year old would really um you know well talk 0 
im glad the film didnt go for the most obvious choice as a lesser film certainly would have 1 
yes its shiny on front side and i love it 1 
ive owned this phone for 7 months now and can say that its the best mobile phone ive had 1 
1 long lasting battery you dont have to recharge it as frequentyly as some of the flip phones2 0 
if you plan to use this in a car forget about it 0 
however bt headsets are currently not good for real time games like firstperson shooters since the audio delay messes me up 0 
i was mortified 0 
filmiing was less expansive 0 
5 stars for the brick oven bread app 1 
i like the fact that it rests lightly against your ear rather than inside 1 
ive had this bluetoooth headset for some time now and still not comfortable with the way it fits on the ear 0 
youll love how thin it is 1 
i have yet to run this new battery below two bars and thats three days without charging 1 
rude inconsiderate management 0 
its really easy 1 
this movie has a cutting edge to it 1 
very disappointing 0 
1010 1 
it felt like a very gripping intelligent stage play but without the overly theatrical feeling one actually gets from watching people on a stage which plays on everyones terror of a white lie escalating to monstrous consequences 1 
battery life is also great 1 
i dont have very many words to say about this place but it does everything pretty well 1 
i saw this film over christmas and what a great film it was 1 
the dining space is tiny but elegantly decorated and comfortable 1 
i didnt realize how wonderful the short really is until the last two scenes 1 
love the margaritas too 1 
they know how to make them here 1 
i dont recommend unless your car breaks down in front of it and you are starving 0 
the phone gets extremely hot 0 
the ri style calamari was a joke 0 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
in the span of an hour i had two people exclaim whoa is that the new phone on tv 1 
could not get strong enough signal 0 
the charger arrived within the promised timeframe but it did not work 0 
i liked the patio and the service was outstanding 1 
absolutely great 1 
1 long lasting battery you dont have to recharge it as frequentyly as some of the flip phones2 0 
the burger is good beef cooked just right 1 
nice spicy and tender 1 
last time buying from you 0 
what a waste of money and time 0 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
the food amazing 1 
the headset fulfills my requirements so i am happy with my purchase 1 
appetite instantly gone 0 
dont waste your on this one 0 
does not work for listening to music with the cingular 8125 0 
a pretty good product 1 
excellent product 1 
after one bite i was hooked 1 
dont buy it 0 
well packaged arrived on time and works as intended 1 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
highquality chicken on the chicken caesar salad 1 
plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job 1 
its one of the most boring horror movies from the 90s mainly because it starts slow and centers in a boring atmosphere 0 
either way it sucks 0 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
1010 1 
love the margaritas too 1 
its very slow 0 
nothing short of magnificent photographycinematography in this film 1 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
the noise shield is incrediable 1 
this is simply the best bluetooth headset for sound quality 1 
totally believable 1 
how awesome is that 1 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
their steaks are 100 recommended 1 
the only very disappointing thing was there was no speakerphone 0 
the veggitarian platter is out of this world 1 
i started this review with two stars but im editing it to give it only one 0 
but if you liked movies like the matrix and better yet their sequels i think youll appreciate the thought provoking mindblowing experience this film will give you 1 
the service was terrible food was mediocre 0 
anyway the plot flowed smoothly and the malebonding scenes were a hoot 1 
i had high hopes for this place since the burgers are cooked over a charcoal grill but unfortunately the taste fell flat way flat 0 
mobile phone tools are a must have 1 
this place is handsdown one of the best places to eat in the phoenix metro area 1 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
id advise anyone to go and see it 1 
the place was fairly clean but the food simply wasnt worth it 0 
nobody identifies with these characters because theyre all cardboard cutouts and stereotypes or predictably reversestereotypes 0 
good value works fine power via usb car or wall outlet 1 
dont waste your on this one 0 
poor quality and service 0 
this is the phone to get for 2005 i just bought my s710a and all i can say is wow 1 
their onscreen chemistry critical to the entire film is genuine 1 
disappointing 0 
disappointed with battery 0 
dont miss it 1 
fast service 1 
in other words the content level of this film is enough to easily fill a dozen other films 1 
performed awful muffled tinny incoming sound and severe echo for those on the other end of the call 0 
i immediately said i wanted to talk to the manager but i did not want to talk to the guy who was doing shots of fireball behind the bar 0 
the greek dressing was very creamy and flavorful 1 
the service was great even the manager came and helped with our table 1 
i would recommend purchasing the jabra jx10 series 2 which works flawlessly with my moto q go figure 1 
honeslty it didnt taste that fresh 0 
nargile i think you are great 1 
it was horrendous 0 
the least said about the acting the better 0 
however the ear pads come off easily and after only one week i lost one 0 
i think i was one of the people who found this another one of roths pearls 1 
i couldnt think of a better way to end the film but a smile on my face great way to wrap up an amazing film and trilogy 1 
however after about a year the fliptop started to get loose and wobbly and eventually my screen went black and i couldnt receive and place calls 0 
what is even more stupid is that who had thought an idea that there should be a volcano in los angeles 0 
for service i give them no stars 0 
please dont waste your money 0 
damian is so talented and versatile in so many ways of writing and portraying different characters on screen 1 
battery is holding up well 1 
my only complaint is the standard sound volume is a little low even when turned up to 5of 5 0 
seller shipped quickly and much cheaper than the competitors 1 
this movie totally grates on my nerves 0 
the chips and sals a here is amazing 1 
the noise shield is incrediable 1 
i gave it 5 stars then and im giving it 5 stars now 1 
the food was great as always compliments to the chef 1 
voice recognition is tremendous 1 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
its still wild stuff though and is highly recommended to fans of giallo cinema 1 
very windresistant 1 
crostini that came with the salad was stale 0 
this movie suffered because of the writing it needed more suspense 0 
the result is a powerhouse achievement made more timely now perhaps because of our cultures disturbing fascination with celebrity and its distorted interpretations of fame 1 
how awful she is 0 
nicest chinese restaurant ive been in a while 1 
dont make the same mistake i did 0 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
improper description i had to return it 0 
the acting as youd expect from this cast is top notch 1 
this place is awesome if you want something light and healthy during the summer 1 
it is just the sort of pap that is screened in the afternoon to punish the unemployed for not having jobs 0 
when a song could explain the emotions of the subjects better such as when jay adams unfortunate life was a subject of talk the song old man by neil young was played which evokes many emotions 1 
this place receives stars for their appetizers 1 
for sushi on the strip this is the place to go 1 
the bottowm lineanother worthless cheap gimmick from sprint 0 
generally it just lacked imagination 0 
the plot is nonsense that doesnt interest in the slightest way or have any uniqueness to it 0 
it is a really good show to watch 1 
there arent death scenes like in previous movies and the fx are terrible 0 
the cashier had no care what so ever on what i had to say it still ended up being wayyy overpriced 0 
i have purchased these for both family and friends and all enjoy their clarity and ease of use 1 
there is no plot or storyline 0 
the ngage is still lacking in earbuds 0 
its reception is very very poor 0 
after trying many many handsfree gadgets this is the one that finally works well 1 
love this phone 1 
this totally unfunny movie is so over the top and pathetic and unrealistic that throughout the whole 90 minutes of utter torture i probably looked at my watch about 70000 times 0 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
it was either too cold not enough flavor or just bad 0 
service was exceptional and food was a good as all the reviews 1 
i can say that the desserts were yummy 1 
initially the local sites in the film which was filmed here in buffalo intrigued me 1 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
we walked away stuffed and happy about our first vegas buffet experience 1 
id say that would be the hardest decision honestly all of ms dishes taste how they are supposed to taste amazing 1 
these were so good we ordered them twice 1 
the songs were the best and the muppets were so hilarious 1 
not nearly as good looking as the amazon picture makes it look 0 
this place is handsdown one of the best places to eat in the phoenix metro area 1 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
i advise you to look out for it 1 
good quality 1 
that was done in the second movie 0 
there are many continuity errors one other user commented on different cars in the garage joes glassesthe one that got to me the most was the fact joes facial hair configuration seemed to change from scene to scene 0 
the sweet potato tots were good but the onion rings were perfection or as close as i have had 1 
this is a masterful piece of filmmaking with many themes simmering and occasionally boiling over in this warts and all study of the poets bohemian selfindulgent wartime years that span the aerial bombardments of london and the outward tranquillity of a welsh coastal retreat the borderlines between friendship lust and love dedication to art and experience versus practical concerns jealousy rivalry cowardice and egotism versus heroism and selfsacrifice and more 1 
i keep watching it over and over 1 
it feels poorly constructed the menus are difficult to navigate and the buttons are so recessed that it is difficult to push them 0 
you will leave the theater wanting to go out and dance under the stars 1 
im big fan of rpg games too but this movie its a disgrace to any selfrespecting rpger there is 0 
if you want healthy authentic or ethic food try this place 1 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
i did not bother contacting the company for few dollar product but i learned the lesson that i should not have bought this form online anyway 0 
i like steiners because its dark and it feels like a bar 1 
they were goldencrispy and delicious 1 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
lastly the mozzarella sticks they were the best thing we ordered 1 
we enjoy their pizza and brunch 1 
the soundtrack wasnt terrible either 1 
they really want to make your experience a good one 1 
amazon sucks 0 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
this is an unbelievable bargain 1 
i will be back many times soon 1 
i was very disappointed in the movie 0 
this item is great installed it let it charged up overnite and it has been working good every since with no problems 1 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
however the ear pads come off easily and after only one week i lost one 0 
everything was perfect the night we were in 1 
its one of the most boring horror movies from the 90s mainly because it starts slow and centers in a boring atmosphere 0 
the owners really really need to quit being soooooo cheap let them wrap my freaking sandwich in two papers not one 0 
they are so cool 1 
an instant classic with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits 1 
clear skype calls long battery life long range 1 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
this place is way too overpriced for mediocre food 0 
lets start with all the problemsthe acting especially from the lead professor was very very bad 0 
it showed exactly how the government and the scientist argued for humanity and the reasons of the gadget 1 
i was so insulted 0 
there is really nothing for me at postinos hope your experience is better 0 
this one wants to surf on the small wave of space movies in 1998 deep impact and armageddon and this one fails everywhere 0 
doesnt last long 0 
i cant see how this movie can be an inspiration to anyone to come out or overcome fear and rejection 0 
i love this device 1 
the script is bad very bad  it contains both cheesiness and unethical joke that you normally see in rated r or nc17 movie 0 
also the fries are without a doubt the worst fries ive ever had 0 
i would have given no star if i was able 0 
later i found myself lost in the power of the film 1 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
worthless product 0 
if you hate earbugs avoid this phone by all means 0 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
the jabra eargels fit my ears very well 1 
everyone is very attentive providing excellent customer service 1 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
it was a good thing that the tickets only cost five dollars because i would be mad if id have paid 750 to see this crap 0 
logitech bluetooth headset is a 10 1 
and the red curry had so much bamboo shoots and wasnt very tasty to me 0 
my order was not correct 0 
the script is horrendously stupid 0 
it crackles with an unpredictable youthful energy but honestly i found it hard to follow and concentrate on it meanders so badly 0 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
what a waste 0 
however the ear pads come off easily and after only one week i lost one 0 
i was hoping for more 0 
you cant relate with them hell you barely can understand them 0 
these are the central themes of the film and they are handled ineptly stereotypically and with no depth of imagination 0 
very funny 1 
up there with the best of melville 1 
i bought this phone as a replacement for my startac and have regretted it since 0 
i love all the features and form factor 1 
bad quality 0 
very bad performance plays angela bennett a computer expert who is at home all the time 0 
camera color balance is awful 0 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
you cant relate with them hell you barely can understand them 0 
the concert sequences just sucked 0 
love it great armband 1 
this was like the final blow 0 
i was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar not only because the quality is great but the service is fast and the food impeccable 1 
earbud piece breaks easily 0 
i dont know exactly what it is about this movie but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our familys memories 1 
not much seafood and like 5 strings of pasta at the bottom 0 
bluetooth does not work phone locks up screens just flash up and now it just makes calls randomly while in my pocket locked 0 
if you simply want a small flip phone look elsewhere as the extra bells whistles are mediocre 0 
this is probably the most irritating show i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
could not get strong enough signal 0 
car charger as well as ac charger are included to make sure you never run out of juicehighy recommended 1 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
everything stinks 0 
great product and price 1 
the fries were great too 1 
all the bread is made inhouse 1 
ive only had my bluetooth for a few weeks but i really like it 1 
we were promptly greeted and seated 1 
too bad cause i know its family owned i really wanted to like this place 0 
the voice recognition thru the handset is excellent 1 
my boyfriend and i came here for the first time on a recent trip to vegas and could not have been more pleased with the quality of food and service 1 
cant upload ringtones from a third party 0 
in conclusion i will not bother with this movie because a volcano in los angeles is nothing but nonsense 0 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
what i really like there is the crepe station 1 
do not buy if you want to use the holster 0 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
this is an excellent tool especially when paired with your phones autoanswer 1 
go watch it 1 
the croutons also taste homemade which is an extra plus 1 
the worst experience ever 0 
the atmosphere is modern and hip while maintaining a touch of coziness 1 
i will never go back to this place and will never ever recommended this place to anyone 0 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
i believe the screenwriter did a good job of tying up the loose ends 1 
the most annoying thing about cover girl is the way in which rita hayworth is put up on a pedestal 0 
very disappointed and wondered how it could be in the oscar shortlist 0 
will never ever go back 0 
this is one of the best italian thrillers of the early 70s 1 
great choice 1 
i really liked that 1 
the chips and sals a here is amazing 1 
i thoroughly enjoyed it when christopher eccleston took control of the tardis and the continuation of the series 1 
today was my first taste of a buldogis gourmet hot dog and i have to tell you it was more than i ever thought possible 1 
it was a long time that i didnt see a so charismatic actor on screen 1 
i especially liked the noncliche choices with the parents in other movies i could predict the dialog verbatim but the writing in this movie made better selections 1 
i got the aluminum case for my new palm vx and it worked really wellit has protected my handheld perfectly so far 1 
this movie is also revealing 1 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
the chips and sals a here is amazing 1 
i cant use this case because the smell is disgusting 0 
very disappointing 0 
i searched the internet and found this one to be the best value 1 
the cashew cream sauce was bland and the vegetables were undercooked 0 
no actress has been worse used that june allison in this movie 0 
and the beans and rice were mediocre at best 0 
battery has no life 0 
the food is rich so order accordingly 1 
i thought it was bad 0 
its a campy sort of film thats a joy to watch 1 
this is infuriating 0 
i love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it 1 
they never brought a salad we asked for 0 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
it was horrendous 0 
the poor actors 0 
nothing new there 0 
just does not work 0 
it is well made easy to access the phone and has a handy detachable belt clip 1 
this movie is greatespecially if you enjoy visual arts 1 
gets a signal when other verizon phones wont 1 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
your staff spends more time talking to themselves than me 0 
i have had problems wit hit dropping signal and more 0 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
avoid at all costs 0 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
very disappointing 0 
its welldesigned and very sharp the blue is a very nice color 1 
i tried the cape cod ravoli chickenwith cranberrymmmm 1 
it works fine on my motorola 325 cellphone and a lot better than the wornout battery did 1 
utterly without merit on any level this is akin to torture 0 
i have eaten here multiple times and each time the food was delicious 1 
i will continue to come here on ladies night andddd date night highly recommend this place to anyone who is in the area 1 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
the explosion of the gas tanks at the end was just as awful 0 
no one at the table thought the food was above average or worth the wait that we had for it 0 
i love this thing 1 
dont buy it 0 
the casting is also horrible cause all you see is a really really bad actors period 0 
the mic there is a joke and the volume is quite low 0 
the phone crashed completely and now i have to get it replaced 0 
food was really boring 0 
the movie is terribly boring in places 0 
not nearly as good looking as the amazon picture makes it look 0 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
portable and it works 1 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
you have to hold the phone at a particular angle for the other party to hear you clearly 0 
no complaints 1 
very good stuff for the price 1 
paolo sorrentino has written a wonderful story about loneliness and tony has built one of the most unforgettable characters seen in movies in recent years 1 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
those burgers were amazing 1 
in fact its hard to remember that the part of ray charles is being acted and not played by the man himself 1 
i know that sounds funny but to me it seemed like sketchy technology that wouldnt work wellwell this one works great 1 
this is was due to the fact that it took 20 minutes to be acknowledged then another 35 minutes to get our foodand they kept forgetting things 0 
this is was due to the fact that it took 20 minutes to be acknowledged then another 35 minutes to get our foodand they kept forgetting things 0 
product is useless since it does not have enough charging current to charge the 2 cellphones i was planning to use it with 0 
its a sad movie but very good 1 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
the voice recognition thru the handset is excellent 1 
i was hoping for more 0 
it crackles with an unpredictable youthful energy but honestly i found it hard to follow and concentrate on it meanders so badly 0 
i used bitpim a free program you can find on the internetto transfer data to the phonethe price of the cable was excellent 1 
the dialogue is composed of things that make little sense 0 
i will come back here every time im in vegas 1 
w810i is just superb 1 
i have been to very few places to eat that under no circumstances would i ever return to and this tops the list 0 
putting the race card aside lets look at the major flaw in the film they destroy latifas character 0 
at any rate this film stinks its not funny and fulci should have stayed with giallo and supernatural zombie movies 0 
i was able to do voice dialing in the car with no problem 1 
third the cheese on my friends burger was cold 0 
both rickman and stowe play their roles to the hilt in this tale of a childrens book writer who maybe has written a subversive tract 1 
not a weekly haunt but definitely a place to come back to every once in a while 1 
special mention should be made of the superb music score and sound effects which are an integral element in helping to make this such a memorable and enjoyable cartoon 1 
dont waste your money 0 
very good stuff for the price 1 
now this dish was quite flavourful 1 
so absolutley fantastic 1 
5 stars for the brick oven bread app 1 
great place to eat reminds me of the little mom and pop shops in the san francisco bay area 1 
on three different occasions i asked for well done or medium well and all three times i got the bloodiest piece of meat on my plate 0 
this place is disgusting 0 
very clear quality sound and you dont have to mess with the sound on your ipod since you have the sound buttons on the headset 1 
best headset ever 1 
fantastic buy and will get again for whatever my next phone is 1 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
the story starts too fast with absolutely no suspense or buildup in the slightest 0 
i go to far too many places and ive never seen any restaurant that serves a 1 egg breakfast especially for 400 0 
the ambiance was incredible 1 
trumbull on i love lucy 1 
the volume switch rocketed out of the unit to a destination unknown 0 
each track commands sentiment actually contributing to the scenes and characters 1 
nice docking station for home or work 1 
im translating movies for a living and this is the first movie in my 5year working experience that i found offensive to my intelligence 0 
very dissapointing performance 0 
i give wirefly 1 stari will contact cingularatt and inform them of this practice 0 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
this place is good 1 
obviously they have a terrible customer service so you get what you pay for 0 
very cheap plastic creaks like an old wooden floor 0 
restaurant is always full but never a wait 1 
he came running after us when he realized my husband had left his sunglasses on the table 1 
raw and sublimely moving 1 
i got to enjoy the seafood salad with a fabulous vinegrette 1 
the film deserves strong kudos for taking this stand for having exceptional acting from its mostly lesserknown cast and for the superintelligent script that doesnt insult the audience or take the easy way out when it comes to white racism 1 
one nice thing was that they added gratuity on the bill since our party was larger than 6 or 8 and they didnt expect more tip than that 1 
speaking of the music it is unbearably predictably and kitchy 0 
saw the movie today and thought it was a good effort good messages for kids 1 
also notable is john baileys fine crisp beautifully colored cinematography and the great production design costumes by eiko ishioka who went on to do the memorable costumes for coppolas dracula for which she received a well deserved oscar 1 
i believe that pitch black was done well 1 
there was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth but it didnt really work into the rest of the plot 0 
the manager was the worst 0 
my friend did not like his bloody mary 0 
appetite instantly gone 0 
now we were chosen to be tortured with this disgusting piece of blatant american propaganda 0 
you share general loewenhielms exquisite joy in his partaking of the cailles en sarcophage even though you are just watching a movie but you do wish for just a small sample to savor 1 
like the other reviewer said you couldnt pay me to eat at this place again 0 
similarly the delivery man did not say a word of apology when our food was 45 minutes late 0 
the films dialogue is natural real to life 1 
great pork sandwich 1 
but in terms of the writing its very fresh and bold 1 
i love all the features and form factor 1 
this one wants to surf on the small wave of space movies in 1998 deep impact and armageddon and this one fails everywhere 0 
we waited an hour for what was a breakfast i could have done 100 times better at home 0 
constantine gives everything the right intensity and seems to have a good understanding of the underlying psychological motivations 1 
we wont be going back anytime soon 0 
i guess it was supposed to be clever twist then shed some light on the situation but it was just stupid 0 
we had 7 at our table and the service was pretty fast 1 
it will drive you barking mad 0 
an instant classic with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits 1 
the shipping time was also very quick 1 
there was so much hype over this phone that i assumed it was the best my mistake 0 
i mean in a realistic world she would never have gotten into that ballet repertory the whole thing was quite pathetic 0 
weve tried to like this place but after 10 times i think were done with them 0 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
i will not return 0 
i liked the patio and the service was outstanding 1 
the script is bad very bad  it contains both cheesiness and unethical joke that you normally see in rated r or nc17 movie 0 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
the bose noise cancelling is amazing which is very important for a nyc commuter 1 
i was so insulted 0 
sound quality on both end is excellent i use headset to call my wife and ask my wife to use headset to call me 2 1 
i will be back many times soon 1 
worst thai ever 0 
the story starts too fast with absolutely no suspense or buildup in the slightest 0 
i consider this theft 0 
the bt headset was such a disapoinment 0 
we had 7 at our table and the service was pretty fast 1 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
i checked everywhere and there is no feature for it which is really disappointing 0 
this is cool because most cases are just open there allowing the screen to get all scratched up 1 
exactly what i wanted 1 
you could only take 2 videos at a time and the quality was very poor 0 
nothing special 0 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
no actress has been worse used that june allison in this movie 0 
i was so insulted 0 
an hour and a half i wish i could bring back 0 
simply beautiful 1 
i have read others reviews here but i havent had any problem with it 1 
loved the casting of jimmy buffet as the science teacher 1 
artless camerawork endlessly presents us with the ugliest setting imaginable ie 0 
to be honest with you this is unbelievable nonsense and very foolish 0 
good service very clean and inexpensive to boot 1 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
great product fast shipping 1 
all in all im quite satisfied with this purchase 1 
utter crap sound quality is terrible 0 
even in my bmw 3 series which is fairly quiet i have trouble hearing what the other person is saying 0 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
the guys all had steaks and our steak loving son who has had steak at the best and worst places said it was the best steak hes ever eaten 1 
to call this movie a drama is ridiculous 0 
i recently tried caballeros and i have been back every week since 1 
otherwise dont even waste your time on this 0 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
dont waste your money 0 
everything about it is fine and reasonable for the price ie 1 
i ended up sliding it on the edge of my pants or back pockets instead 1 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
plus its only 8 bucks 1 
good case excellent value 1 
an extensive menu provides lots of options for breakfast 1 
adapter does not provide enough charging current 0 
i think it was robert ryans best film because he portrayed someone like my father and he was a schizophrenic in real lifemy father although he never murdered anyone but was affected more so during the second world war which made him worse 1 
it has all the features i want 1 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
the food was very good 1 
about ten minutes into this film i started having second thoughts 0 
i do love sushi but i found kabuki to be overpriced overhip and underservices 0 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
very well made and fits my surefire gx2 perfectly 1 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
it has all the features i want 1 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
good servicecheck 1 
i did not bother contacting the company for few dollar product but i learned the lesson that i should not have bought this form online anyway 0 
delete this film from your mind 0 
i will never go back to this place and will never ever recommended this place to anyone 0 
i would not recommend this place 0 
you get extra minutes so that you can carry out the call and not get cut off 1 
eew this location needs a complete overhaul 0 
works well 1 
its practically perfect in all of them  a true masterpiece in a sea of faux masterpieces 1 
howeverthe riingtones are not the best and neither are the games 0 
frankly after cotton club and unfaithful it was kind of embarrassing to watch lane and gere in this film because it is bad 0 
im happy about this purchase good quality and low price 1 
unreliable im giving up 0 
the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach 0 
there were several moments in the movie that just didnt need to be there and were excruciatingly slow moving 0 
reaching for the bottom row is uncomfortable and the send and end keys are not where i expect them to be3 0 
happy so far 1 
the burger had absolutely no flavor the meat itself was totally bland the burger was overcooked and there was no charcoal flavor 0 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
mobile phone tools are a must have 1 
went for lunch service was slow 0 
considering the relations off screen between taylor and stanwyck it was surprising how little chemistry there was on screen between the two of them 0 
did not like at all 0 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
at no point in the proceedings does it look remotely like america 0 
i hate movies like that 0 
they will customize your order any way youd like my usual is eggplant with green bean stir fry love it 1 
i have eaten here multiple times and each time the food was delicious 1 
hitchcock is a great director 1 
the fried rice was dry as well 0 
the accompanied software is almost brilliant 1 
the fries were not hot and neither was my burger 0 
i waited and waited 0 
much more interesting more action more suspense and less of the unneeded controversy 1 
this is a witty and delightful adaptation of the dr seuss book brilliantly animated by upas finest and thoroughly deserving of its academy award 1 
for a product that costs as much as this one does i expect it to work far better and with greater ease than this thing does 0 
we started with the tuna sashimi which was brownish in color and obviously wasnt fresh 0 
this was like the final blow 0 
this really is how vegas fine dining used to be right down to the menus handed to the ladies that have no prices listed 1 
which has more depth and character than the man underneath it 0 
the art style has the appearance of crayonpencil drawings and is wonderfully colorful and fanciful 1 
every element of this story was so over the top excessively phony and contrived that it was painful to sit through 0 
the servers are not pleasant to deal with and they dont always honor pizza hut coupons 0 
i recently had problems where i could not stay connected for more than 10 minutes before being disconnected 0 
i just wanted to leave 0 
damn good steak 1 
worthless product 0 
so just beware 0 
theres really nothing bad i can say about this headset 0 
otherwise dont even waste your time on this 0 
so just beware 0 
my side greek salad with the greek dressing was so tasty and the pita and hummus was very refreshing 1 
his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic 1 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
reaching for the bottom row is uncomfortable and the send and end keys are not where i expect them to be3 0 
the first time i ever came here i had an amazing experience i still tell people how awesome the duck was 1 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
waitress was good though 1 
not what i wanted 0 
seriously its not worth wasting your or your kids time on 0 
lange had become a great actress 1 
lightweight and works well 1 
ive only had my bluetooth for a few weeks but i really like it 1 
phone is sturdy as all nokia bar phones are 1 
feelings thoughtsgabriels discomfort during the danceall these intangibles leap to life and come within the viewers grasp in hustons portrayal 1 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
if you want a real scare rent this one 1 
if you do go see this movie bring a pillow or a girlfriendboyfriend to keep you occupied through out 0 
i got home to see the driest damn wings ever 0 
im super pissd 0 
id advise anyone to go and see it 1 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
very good though 1 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
i still maintain that monkeys shouldnt make headphones we just obviously dont share enough dna to copy the design over to humans 0 
appetite instantly gone 0 
always a great time at dos gringos 1 
i would definitely recommend the jabra bt250v for those who are looking for comfort clarity and a great price 1 
but whatever it was that cost them so much it didnt translate to quality thats for sure 0 
due to this happening on every call i was forced to stop using this headset 0 
good case 1 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
the black eyed peas and sweet potatoes unreal 1 
a usable keyboard actually turns a pda into a realworld useful machine instead of just a neat gadget 1 
the chicken dishes are ok the beef is like shoe leather 0 
nice headphones for the price and they work great 1 
very serious spoilers this movie was a huge disappointment 0 
iam very pleased with my purchase 1 
see both films if you can 1 
these headphones were a great find and i think they are perhaps the best purchase ive made in the last several years seriously 1 
crash is a depressing little nothing that provokes emotion but teaches you nothing if you already know racism and prejudice are bad things 0 
plug was the wrong size 0 
i had absolutely no problem with this headset linking to my 8530 blackberry curve 1 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
im surprised this is a good quality car charger and theres not much reviews about it 1 
i give wirefly 1 stari will contact cingularatt and inform them of this practice 0 
youll love it 1 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
easily none other cartoon made me laugh in a tender way before getting into dark sitcoms oriented for teenagers 1 
overpriced for what you are getting 0 
unfortunately the ability to actually know you are receiving a call is a rather important feature and this phone is pitiful in that respect 0 
even the squibs look awful 0 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
though the wind and the lion is told largely through the eyes of the son every member of the family can identify with one of the characters whether it be sean connerys noble brigand candace bergens feisty heroine john hustons wily john hay or steve kanalys spiffy radiant ruthless cando lieutenant roosevelts big stick 1 
also the fries are without a doubt the worst fries ive ever had 0 
this movie is excellentangel is beautiful and scamp is adorablehis little yelps when hes scaredand the funniest parts are whenscamp is caught under the curtain and when angel and scamp are singing ive never had this feeling beforei totally recommend this movieits coming out on special edition on june 20the cover has scamp on a garbage can and angel underneath the lid 1 
the chicken dishes are ok the beef is like shoe leather 0 
very good quality though 1 
i really enjoyed eating here 1 
not too screamy not to masculine but just right 1 
regardless the film fails on most levels 0 
best ive found so far ive tried 2 other bluetooths and this one has the best quality for both me and the listener as well as ease of using 1 
the death row scenes were entirely unmoving 0 
the movie lacks visual interest drama expression of feeling and celebration of the very patriotism that underlines the narrative 0 
avoid at all costs 0 
the film gives meaning to the phrase never in the history of human conflict has so much been owed by so many to so few 1 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
avoid at all cost 0 
i was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar not only because the quality is great but the service is fast and the food impeccable 1 
this is simply the best bluetooth headset for sound quality 1 
i was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar not only because the quality is great but the service is fast and the food impeccable 1 
battery is terrible 0 
integrated seamlessly with the motorola razr phone 1 
the puppets look really cheesy not in a good way like in the puppet master 80s flicks 0 
the tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu 0 
i dont think it would hold it too securly on your belt 0 
you could drive a semi truck into these holes 0 
it is not good 0 
1010 1 
however after finally watching this film i realized that not only had i had a closed mind to the brilliance it depicts i also found myself watching it over and over again 1 
i could eat their bruschetta all day it is devine 1 
if there was ever a movie that needed wordofmouth to promote this is it 1 
phone now holds charge like it did when it was new 1 
a very very very slowmoving aimless movie about a distressed drifting young man 0 
crust is not good 0 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
all in all i think it was a good investment 1 
so i had to take the battery out of the phone put it all back together and then restart it 0 
the vanilla ice cream was creamy and smooth while the profiterole choux pastry was fresh enough 1 
the film has an ultracheap look to it 0 
if there was ever a movie that needed wordofmouth to promote this is it 1 
one more thing i can tolerate political incorrectness very well im all for artistic freedom and suspension of disbelief but the slavic female character was just too much 0 
despite the pans of reviewers i liked this movie 1 
the story is beyond stupid 0 
crust is not good 0 
this is the phone to get for 2005 i just bought my s710a and all i can say is wow 1 
also makes it easier to hold on to 1 
very disappointing 0 
for that its worth checking out 1 
this is infuriating 0 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
i never come again 0 
trouble is the writing and directing make it impossible to establish those things that make a movie watchable like character story theme and so on 0 
i purcashed this for the car charger and it does not work 0 
so they performed 1 
classywarm atmosphere fun and fresh appetizers succulent steaks baseball steak 1 
painful on the ear 0 
the staff is always super friendly and helpful which is especially cool when you bring two small boys and a baby 1 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
the fries were not hot and neither was my burger 0 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
im a bit disappointed 0 
oh this is such a thing of beauty this restaurant 1 
the wind and the lion is well written and superbly acted 1 
crust is not good 0 
it is a very well acted and done tv movie 1 
if only someone involved with it knew how to string together narrative 0 
ample portions and good prices 1 
john garfield ann revere lilli plmer william conrad canada leeand filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screenjames wong howe 1 
much better than the other ayce sushi place i went to in vegas 1 
utter crap sound quality is terrible 0 
as for the mains also uninspired 0 
setup couldnt have been simpler 1 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
this case seems well made 1 
the restaurant is very clean and has a family restaurant feel to it 1 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
after 3 months screen just went black all of a sudden 0 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
not enough volume 0 
i had to wait over 30 minutes to get my drink and longer to get 2 arepas 0 
however after finally watching this film i realized that not only had i had a closed mind to the brilliance it depicts i also found myself watching it over and over again 1 
sorry i will not be getting food from here anytime soon 0 
another thing i didnt really like is when a character got punched in the face a gallon of blood would spew forth soon after 0 
things that went wrong they burned the saganaki 0 
what makes this story different are the terrific production values faultless photography composition and editing the terrific casting the underappreciated brian keith playing a bully teddy and vivid history 1 
oh yeah and the storyline was pathetic too 0 
there arent death scenes like in previous movies and the fx are terrible 0 
mobile phone tools are a must have 1 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
not sure who was more lost the flat characters or the audience nearly half of whom walked out 0 
i wasnt the least bit interested 0 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
but when i check voice mail at night the keypad backlight turns off a few seconds into the first message and then im lost 0 
they do not care about the consumer one bit 0 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
dont waste your money 0 
stay away from the q 0 
what i really like there is the crepe station 1 
in summary this was a largely disappointing dining experience 0 
very clear quality sound and you dont have to mess with the sound on your ipod since you have the sound buttons on the headset 1 
this place deserves no stars 0 
sweetest phone 1 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
i was deeply impressed with the character he played 1 
it probably would have been better if the director hadnt spent most of the movie showcasing his own art work which really isnt that noteworthy 0 
the film has an ultracheap look to it 0 
unfortunately it was not good 0 
whatever prompted such a documentary is beyond me 0 
it was a pale color instead of nice and char and has no flavor 0 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
it is an insane game 1 
it seems completely secure both holding on to my belt and keeping the iphone inside 1 
whatever prompted such a documentary is beyond me 0 
bela lugosi was totally extraneous intoning odd lines 0 
an hour seriously 0 
very very sad 0 
who in their right mind is gonna buy this battery 0 
lasted one day and then blew up 0 
this case seems well made 1 
how stupid is that 0 
doesnt hold charge 0 
low quality 0 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
a disappointment 0 
i would definitely recommend the jabra bt250v for those who are looking for comfort clarity and a great price 1 
its still wild stuff though and is highly recommended to fans of giallo cinema 1 
i gave it 5 stars then and im giving it 5 stars now 1 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
the burger i got the gold standard a 17 burger and was kind of disappointed 0 
definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly will return next time im in vegas 1 
great value 1 
their regular toasted bread was equally satisfying with the occasional pats of butter mmmm 1 
it is a true classic 1 
this if the first movie ive given a 10 to in years 1 
1010 1 
disappointed with battery 0 
about half way through this film i started to dislike it 0 
and i really did find them funny 1 
great phone 1 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
good product incredible value 1 
the story is beyond stupid 0 
at first glance it is a lovely bakery cafe nice ambiance clean friendly staff 1 
every element of this story was so over the top excessively phony and contrived that it was painful to sit through 0 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
it is worth the drive 1 
on the ground right next to our table was a large smeared beensteppedinandtrackedeverywhere pile of green bird poop 0 
my boyfriend tried the mediterranean chicken salad and fell in love 1 
the meat was pretty dry i had the sliced brisket and pulled pork 0 
gets a signal when other verizon phones wont 1 
i was mortified 0 
the acting was bad 0 
his performance is simply genius 1 
mishima is extremely uninteresting 0 
howeverthe riingtones are not the best and neither are the games 0 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
it didnt charge for me 0 
there was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth but it didnt really work into the rest of the plot 0 
the scripting of the subtle comedy is unmatched by any movie in recent years 1 
it was a very superficial movie and it gave me the feeling that i was watching play rather than a film 0 
you have to hold the phone at a particular angle for the other party to hear you clearly 0 
buttons are too small 0 
my boyfriend and i came here for the first time on a recent trip to vegas and could not have been more pleased with the quality of food and service 1 
if you dont find it too bad as again the unit comes with one earpad onlyi would not recommend this to anyone 0 
it looked like a wonderful story 1 
punishment park is a brilliant piece of cinema 1 
very disappointed 0 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
but kevin spacey is an excellent verbal tsunami as buddy ackerman  and totally believable because he is a great actor 1 
there is no plot here to keep you going in the first place 0 
i didnt realize how wonderful the short really is until the last two scenes 1 
i have had tmobile service for 2 or 3 years now and i am pretty happy with it 1 
the service was terrible food was mediocre 0 
i really like this product over the motorola because it is allot clearer on the ear piece and the mic 1 
i am also very happy with the price 1 
great pork sandwich 1 
the story starts too fast with absolutely no suspense or buildup in the slightest 0 
i was bored throughout the whole damn thing 0 
happy so far 1 
there is however some pretty good acting at least for this type of film 1 
amazon sucks 0 
and generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode 0 
i really liked that 1 
seafood was limited to boiled shrimp and crab legs but the crab legs definitely did not taste fresh 0 
this is some seriously good pizza and im an expertconnisseur on the topic 1 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
it was delicious 1 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
the steak and the shrimp are in my opinion the best entrees at gc 1 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
this is the place where i first had pho and it was amazing 1 
it showed exactly how the government and the scientist argued for humanity and the reasons of the gadget 1 
hands down my favorite italian restaurant 1 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
this is high adventure at its best 1 
at around 4 pm i bought it at around 8pm i started to watch at around 815pm i fast forwarded the remaining film to see if there was anything left watchable for a human being with a brain but there wasnt 0 
then the film just dropped the ball 0 
in fact i liked it better than interview with a vampire and i liked this lestat stuart townsend better than cruises attempt 1 
glad i didnt pay to see it 0 
avoid avoid avoid 0 
glad i didnt pay to see it 0 
a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it 1 
there still are good actors around 1 
worse theres an incredibly weak subplot thrown in that follows a little band of latterday mansonites as they go after a reporter whos working on a story on the anniversary of the killings 0 
a very good film indeed about great and unconditional love 1 
o my gosh the best phone i have ever had 1 
walked in and the place smelled like an old grease trap and only 2 others there eating 0 
save your money ive had this item for 11 months now 0 
horrible 0 
the scenes with the ohsomature neighbourgirl are a misplace 0 
bought mainly for the charger which broke soon after purchasing 0 
i guess i should have known that this place would suck because it is inside of the excalibur but i didnt use my common sense 0 
not loud enough and doesnt turn on like it should 0 
it quit working after id used it for about 18 months so i just purchased another one because this is the best headset ive ever owned 1 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
i love my 350 headset my jabra350 bluetooth headset is great the reception is very good and the ear piece is a comfortable fit 1 
this place is not quality sushi it is not a quality restaurant 0 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
go to place for gyros 1 
i recently tried caballeros and i have been back every week since 1 
worst thai ever 0 
the owner used to work at nobu so this place is really similar for half the price 1 
i am glad i purchased it 1 
and those baby owls were adorable 1 
very friendly staff 1 
it is a joy to use 1 
what a piece of junk i lose more calls on this phone 0 
i have eaten here multiple times and each time the food was delicious 1 
at a time when it seems that film animation has been dominated by disneypixars cgi masterpieces it is both refreshing and comforting to know that miyazaki is still relying on traditional handdrawn animation to tell his charming and enchanting stories 1 
for readers who have already seen one of miyazakis films he is still in top form and made another worthwhile experience 1 
what this film lacks is a convincing script 0 
i was very disappointed 0 
overall i would recommend this phone over the new walkman 1 
nothing special 0 
the phone crashed completely and now i have to get it replaced 0 
unfortunately it was not good 0 
does not work for listening to music with the cingular 8125 0 
probably not in a hurry to go back 0 
when i placed my treo into the case not only was it not snug but there was a lot of extra room on the sides 0 
i guess maybe we went on an off night but it was disgraceful 0 
it deserves strong love 1 
razr battery good buy 1 
this movie does an excellent job of revealing the complexity of the task and the incredible challenges facing south africa 1 
good audio quality 1 
appetite instantly gone 0 
prosgood camera very nice pictures also has cool styles like black and white and more 1 
great price too 1 
so flavorful and has just the perfect amount of heat 1 
he owns the film just as spacek owned coal miners daughter and quaid owned great balls of fire 1 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
the tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu 0 
by far the best cheesecurds we have ever had 1 
i live in the neighborhood so i am disappointed i wont be back here because it is a convenient location 0 
best fish ive ever had in my life 1 
the films dialogue is natural real to life 1 
i recommend igo to anyone with different brand cell phonesmp3 players in the family 1 
its extremely slow and takes forever to do anything with it 0 
if there is a wind it is completely useless 0 
to summarize the food was incredible nay transcendant but nothing brings me joy quite like the memory of the pneumatic condiment dispenser 1 
the decor is nice and the piano music soundtrack is pleasant 1 
not a weekly haunt but definitely a place to come back to every once in a while 1 
this phone works great 1 
even the squibs look awful 0 
there was so much hype over this phone that i assumed it was the best my mistake 0 
lifetime does not air it enough so if anyone knows what store sells it let me know because this is a musthave 1 
very good though 1 
the problem was the script 0 
delete this film from your mind 0 
integrated seamlessly with the motorola razr phone 1 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
dont buy this product it fails 0 
it was so boring 0 
the earpiece on this is too large or too heavyit keeps falling out of my ear 0 
the service was outshining i definitely recommend the halibut 1 
the music in the film is really nice too 1 
i would recommend this 1 
i loved their mussels cooked in this wine reduction the duck was tender and their potato dishes were delicious 1 
everything about it is just bad 0 
too bad you have to pay up to a month for the service 0 
the seller is very understanding and patient i would definitely buy from them again 1 
brilliance indeed 1 
i advise you to look out for it 1 
back to good bbq lighter fare reasonable pricing and tell the public they are back to the old ways 1 
great sound and service 1 
i am pairing this with my iphone and i could not be happier with it so far 1 
very happy with this product 1 
were jerks on the phone 0 
i am not a filmmaker nor am i a director but i would hide my head in the sand if id spent whatever amount of money and time on this movie 0 
im surprised this is a good quality car charger and theres not much reviews about it 1 
the acting was decidely wooden though no worse than a period universal b movie 0 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
avoid avoid avoid 0 
director paul matthews who also wrotedirected the weak 1995 monster movie grim clearly doesnt know how to pace his films 0 
service is also cute 1 
i love their fries and their beans 1 
this movie is possibly one of the most creative works of horror ever 1 
the budget was evidently very limited 0 
worst ever 0 
we were promptly greeted and seated 1 
it never condescends all the characters have good genuine hearts and believable problems 1 
for readers who have already seen one of miyazakis films he is still in top form and made another worthwhile experience 1 
this place has it 1 
the phone loads super 1 
i found this place by accident and i could not be happier 1 
classywarm atmosphere fun and fresh appetizers succulent steaks baseball steak 1 
blue ant is easy to use 1 
really really good rice all the time 1 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
avoid avoid avoid 0 
it was a drive to get there 0 
both great 1 
it was that loudglad to say that the plantronics 510 maintains a flawless connection to my cell and with no static during normal use 1 
in addition it feels amp looks as if the phone is all lightweight cheap plastic 0 
im happy about this purchase good quality and low price 1 
its pretty surprising that this wonderful film was made in 1949 as hollywood generally had its collective heads in the sand concerning black and white issues at that time 1 
one of the best mexican movies ever and one of the less understood even by mexican themselves no matter how identified the should have felt with it 1 
the budget was evidently very limited 0 
it also had a new problem 0 
it doesnt work in europe or asia 0 
there was no chemistry between ben affleck and sandra bullock in this film and i couldnt understand why he would consider even leaving his wifetobe for this chick that he supposedly was knocked out by 0 
this is a bad film with bad writing and good actorsan ugly cartoon crafted by paul haggis for people who cant handle anything but the bold strokes in storytellinga picture painted with crayons 0 
the goat taco didnt skimp on the meat and wow what flavor 1 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
excellent bluetooth headset 1 
the poor actors 0 
it is an excellent drama an excellent thriller and an excellent film 1 
absolutel junk 0 
we wont be going back 0 
it crackles with an unpredictable youthful energy but honestly i found it hard to follow and concentrate on it meanders so badly 0 
nevertheless yet another wonderful film from the great masters stable 1 
its a piece of crap 0 
i also didnt like the on button it felt like it would crack with use 0 
does not work 0 
i am going to have to be the first to negatively review this product 0 
so far it has worked like a charm 1 
wont ever go here again 0 
there is nothing privileged about workingeating there 0 
the crêpe was delicate and thin and moist 1 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
pretty cool i would say 1 
the biggest complaint i have is the battery drains superfast 0 
earbud piece breaks easily 0 
i never walked out of a movie faster 0 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
it is simple to use and i like it 1 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
beware this is not a trashy cult movie this is trash period 0 
at least think to refill my water before i struggle to wave you over for 10 minutes 0 
not my thing 0 
the cocktails are all handmade and delicious 1 
there was hardly any meat 0 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
the food amazing 1 
also were served hot bread and butter and home made potato chips with bacon bits on topvery original and very good 1 
this pair of headphones is the worst that i have ever had soundwise 0 
i wont be back 0 
weve have gotten a much better service from the pizza place next door than the services we received from this restaurant 0 
putting the race card aside lets look at the major flaw in the film they destroy latifas character 0 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
not what i wanted 0 
not even good for camp value 0 
you also cannot take pictures with it in the case because the lense is covered 0 
its a great tool for entertainment communication and data managementoh be sure to use activesync 42 for optimal data synchronization results 1 
nice leather 1 
not even a hello we will be right with you 0 
adapter does not provide enough charging current 0 
crash is a depressing little nothing that provokes emotion but teaches you nothing if you already know racism and prejudice are bad things 0 
weve tried to like this place but after 10 times i think were done with them 0 
i guess maybe we went on an off night but it was disgraceful 0 
the music in the film is really nice too 1 
for people who are first timers in film making i think they did an excellent job 1 
its the one movie that never ceases to interest me simply because it keeps me alert as i try to attempt to decipher its meanings 1 
ambience is perfect 1 
works good 1 
the chips and sals a here is amazing 1 
the budget was evidently very limited 0 
to summarize the food was incredible nay transcendant but nothing brings me joy quite like the memory of the pneumatic condiment dispenser 1 
director paul matthews who also wrotedirected the weak 1995 monster movie grim clearly doesnt know how to pace his films 0 
its not hard to make a decent hamburger 0 
keep up the good work amazon 1 
i swung in to give them a try but was deeply disappointed 0 
beautiful styling though 1 
the movie was so boring that i sometimes found myself occupied peaking in the paper instead of watching never happened during a columbo movie before 0 
i cant wait to go back 1 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
the microphone also works well but according to people i have called it applifies everything 1 
but now that it is out of warranty the same problems reoccurebottom line put your money somewhere else cingular will not support it 0 
i purcashed this for the car charger and it does not work 0 
best of luck to the rude and noncustomer service focused new management 0 
well just if you keep thinking how bad it is 0 
piece of junk 0 
a good commentary of todays love and undoubtedly a film worth seeing 1 
all of the main players are mesmerising 1 
juano hernandez an exceptional actor who played supporting roles in many films of the era is a proud black man who is accused of murdering a white man in the south 1 
i have yet to run this new battery below two bars and thats three days without charging 1 
the nano stated itmy son was dissapointed 0 
dont buy it 0 
the worst piece of crap ever along with the verizon customer service 0 
never going back 0 
my experience was terrible this was my fourth bluetooth headset and while it was much more comfortable than my last jabra which i hated 0 
the phone crashed completely and now i have to get it replaced 0 
spoilers whatever else can or cant be said about it surface is superbly crafted 1 
then i had to continue pairing it periodically since it somehow kept dropping 0 
there still are good actors around 1 
reversible plug works great 1 
as a sushi lover avoid this place by all means 0 
i immediately said i wanted to talk to the manager but i did not want to talk to the guy who was doing shots of fireball behind the bar 0 
he is an amazing film artist one of the most important whoever lived 1 
i wish i could enter negative values admins 0 
a film not easily forgotten 1 
horrible 0 
i took back my money and got outta there 0 
great hands free device 1 
the plot well i said id let that one go 0 
great food 1 
for readers who have already seen one of miyazakis films he is still in top form and made another worthwhile experience 1 
returned 8 hours later 0 
works great 1 
cant say enough good things about this place 1 
im not impressed with the concept or the food 0 
the tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu 0 
oh yeah and the storyline was pathetic too 0 
this movie totally grates on my nerves 0 
poor quality and service 0 
the script is bad very bad  it contains both cheesiness and unethical joke that you normally see in rated r or nc17 movie 0 
any ring toneoverall good phone to buy 1 
i cant use this case because the smell is disgusting 0 
the cast of veteran actors are more than just a nostalgia trip 1 
new battery works great in phone 1 
it is a joy to use 1 
this product had a strong rubberpetroleum smell that was unbearable after a while and caused me to return it 0 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
from here on the widmark character turns unintentionally comical 0 
no actress has been worse used that june allison in this movie 0 
classywarm atmosphere fun and fresh appetizers succulent steaks baseball steak 1 
everyone is very attentive providing excellent customer service 1 
it is practically useless and did not add any kind of boost to my reception after i bought it 0 
unfortunately inexperience of direction meant that scene after scene passed with little in the way of dramatic tension or conflict 0 
about ten minutes into this film i started having second thoughts 0 
terrible phone holder 0 
in addition it feels amp looks as if the phone is all lightweight cheap plastic 0 
very unreliable service from tmobile 0 
portable and it works 1 
worth every penny 1 
thank you for wasting my money 0 
victor mclaglen was even bad and brian donlevy was almost unrecognizable 0 
worst thai ever 0 
sooooo good 1 
highly entertaining at all angles 1 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
greatno problems at all 1 
i saw it as a child on tv back in 1973 when it was the stranger and i loved it 1 
everything about it is fine and reasonable for the price ie 1 
waited and waited and waited 0 
it really created a unique feeling though 1 
im not sure what he was trying to do with this film 0 
similarly the delivery man did not say a word of apology when our food was 45 minutes late 0 
but in terms of the writing its very fresh and bold 1 
this pda rocks 1 
will not be back 0 
here in the wind and the lion we see a wonderful rendering of americas own imperial age 1 
i got the aluminum case for my new palm vx and it worked really wellit has protected my handheld perfectly so far 1 
the stories were powerful explorations of the nature of man and of art 1 
dont buy this product 0 
food was really boring 0 
the waitress was friendly and happy to accomodate for veganveggie options 1 
service is also cute 1 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
the opening sequence of this gem is a classic and the cat n mouse games that follow are a delight to watch 1 
i wasnt expecting oscar material but this 0 
great food and awesome service 1 
car charger as well as ac charger are included to make sure you never run out of juicehighy recommended 1 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
great atmosphere friendly and fast service 1 
my boyfriend and i sat at the bar and had a completely delightful experience 1 
im pleased 1 
i paid too much 0 
i never walked out of a movie faster 0 
constantine gives everything the right intensity and seems to have a good understanding of the underlying psychological motivations 1 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
10 out of 10 for both the movie and trilogy 1 
great time family dinner on a sunday night 1 
you can find better movies at youtube 0 
server did a great job handling our large rowdy table 1 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
but i definitely would not eat here again 0 
the acting is beyond abysmal 0 
bad quality 0 
avoid at all costs 0 
there is nothing authentic about this place 0 
i ordered albondigas soup which was just warm and tasted like tomato soup with frozen meatballs 0 
things happen characters personalities change plot twists occur for no real reason other than that script calls for it 0 
ray charles life provided excellent biographical material for the film which goes well beyond being just another movie about a musician 1 
i particularly remember my senses being assaulted by strident cords of music that would blare out with very little warning and even less meaning 0 
talk about useless customer service 0 
honeslty it didnt taste that fresh 0 
server did a great job handling our large rowdy table 1 
this film has no redeeming features 0 
if there was ever an indication of a writer and a directors ability to meld two highly volatile temperaments into a seamless union of creativity then this is it 1 
this movie is greatespecially if you enjoy visual arts 1 
the phone was unusable and was not new 0 
the best place in vegas for breakfast just check out a sat or sun 1 
in the summer you can dine in a charming outdoor patio so very delightful 1 
comfort for our whole family 1 
this movie is greatespecially if you enjoy visual arts 1 
everything about it is just bad 0 
we also ordered the spinach and avocado salad the ingredients were sad and the dressing literally had zero taste 0 
food was below average 0 
at a time when it seems that film animation has been dominated by disneypixars cgi masterpieces it is both refreshing and comforting to know that miyazaki is still relying on traditional handdrawn animation to tell his charming and enchanting stories 1 
its quite simply the highest most superlative form of cinema imaginable 1 
i would recommend this 1 
i liked this movie way too much 1 
no actress has been worse used that june allison in this movie 0 
this movie is also revealing 1 
i was hoping for more 0 
excellent product for the price 1 
the secondary plot line is incomprehensible and its relation to the primary plot line is mystifying 0 
its a fresh subtle and rather sublime effect 1 
however paul schrader has indeed made a film about mishima that is both superb complex 1 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
what did bother me was the slow service 0 
whatever prompted such a documentary is beyond me 0 
the malta settings are as dry and as barren as the dialogue 0 
about half way through this film i started to dislike it 0 
excellent phone 1 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
the microphone also works well but according to people i have called it applifies everything 1 
after 3 months screen just went black all of a sudden 0 
graphics is far from the best part of the game 0 
incredible 1 
this phone might well be the worst ive ever had in any brand 0 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
oh and i forgot to also mention the weird color effect it has on your phone 0 
will never ever go back and have told many people what had happened 0 
my brother in law who works at the mall ate here same day and guess what he was sick all night too 0 
keep up the good work amazon 1 
service was good and the company was better 1 
both great 1 
juano hernandez an exceptional actor who played supporting roles in many films of the era is a proud black man who is accused of murdering a white man in the south 1 
i have tried these cables with my computer and my ipod and it works just fine 1 
we will not be coming back 0 
none of the three sizes they sent with the headset would stay in my ears 0 
my boyfriend and i sat at the bar and had a completely delightful experience 1 
i received it quickly and it works great 1 
utterly without merit on any level this is akin to torture 0 
frankly after cotton club and unfaithful it was kind of embarrassing to watch lane and gere in this film because it is bad 0 
the staff are also very friendly and efficient 1 
kind of flops around 0 
truly awful 0 
i really enjoyed eating here 1 
director paul matthews who also wrotedirected the weak 1995 monster movie grim clearly doesnt know how to pace his films 0 
after 3 months screen just went black all of a sudden 0 
the memories are murky but i can only say that i enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show 1 
this item is fantastic and works perfectly 1 
battery is terrible 0 
nice solid keyboard 1 
we had a group of 70 when we claimed we would only have 40 and they handled us beautifully 1 
it also had a new problem 0 
theres really nothing bad i can say about this headset 0 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
took an hour to get our food only 4 tables in restaurant my food was luke warm our sever was running around like he was totally overwhelmed 0 
none of the three sizes they sent with the headset would stay in my ears 0 
this film highlights the fundamental flaws of the legal process that its not about discovering guilt or innocence but rather is about who presents better in court 1 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
its a shame to see good actors like thomerson and james make a living in a mess like this 0 
if there was ever an indication of a writer and a directors ability to meld two highly volatile temperaments into a seamless union of creativity then this is it 1 
lovely little thriller from hitchcock with lots of nice shenanigans surrounding a murdered spy a kidnapped child a nasty church a foreign plot and some random taxidermists 1 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
i love the look and feel of samsung flipphones 1 
were jerks on the phone 0 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
i received my orders well within the shipping timeframe everything was in good working order and overall i am very excited to have this source 1 
after one bite i was hooked 1 
worst customer service ever 0 
bad reception 0 
then as if i hadnt wasted enough of my life there they poured salt in the wound by drawing out the time it took to bring the check 0 
service stinks here 0 
howeverthe riingtones are not the best and neither are the games 0 
excellent sound quality 1 
i even fully charged it before i went to bed and turned off blue tooth and wifi and noticed that it only had 20 left in the morning 0 
the chips that came out were dripping with grease and mostly not edible 0 
none of it works just dont buy it 0 
a very good film indeed about great and unconditional love 1 
i dont think there are any redeeming qualities in this remake 0 
it is a joy to use 1 
for those that havent seen it dont waste your time 0 
they were goldencrispy and delicious 1 
i live in the neighborhood so i am disappointed i wont be back here because it is a convenient location 0 
the bathrooms are clean and the place itself is well decorated 1 
terrible management 0 
the food is very good for your typical bar food 1 
i am not a filmmaker nor am i a director but i would hide my head in the sand if id spent whatever amount of money and time on this movie 0 
finally after three or four times the spring of the latch broke and i could not use it any longer on the visor 0 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
not too screamy not to masculine but just right 1 
krussel always good 1 
it has a great camera thats 2mp and the pics are nice and clear with great picture quality 1 
it is easy to turn on and off when you are in the car and the volume controls are quite accessable 1 
horrible horrible protector 0 
i give wirefly 1 stari will contact cingularatt and inform them of this practice 0 
we got the food and apparently they have never heard of salt and the batter on the fish was chewy 0 
does not fit 0 
an excellent new restaurant by an experienced frenchman 1 
the story is also both funny and poignant at times 1 
the buffet at bellagio was far from what i anticipated 0 
we walked away stuffed and happy about our first vegas buffet experience 1 
there was so much hype over this phone that i assumed it was the best my mistake 0 
it also had a new problem 0 
i recently tried caballeros and i have been back every week since 1 
product is useless since it does not have enough charging current to charge the 2 cellphones i was planning to use it with 0 
wont work right or atleast for me 0 
i liked it 1 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
im still infatuated with this phone 1 
the jerky camera movements were also annoying 0 
the story line is just awful 0 
i received it quickly and it works great 1 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
im surprised this is a good quality car charger and theres not much reviews about it 1 
the delivery was on time 1 
to call this movie a drama is ridiculous 0 
really pleased with this product so far 1 
it finds my cell phone right away when i enter the car 1 
this phone tries very hard to do everything but fails at its very ability to be a phone 0 
you wont regret it 1 
he is an amazing film artist one of the most important whoever lived 1 
all in all an excellent restaurant highlighted by great service a unique menu and a beautiful setting 1 
battery has no life 0 
imdb ratings only go as low 1 for awful its time to get some negative numbers in there for cases such as these 0 
the reception has been generally good 1 
i dressed up to be treated so rudely 0 
the camera on the phone may be used as a dustpan when indoors id rather be using a disposable then this 0 
i have been to very few places to eat that under no circumstances would i ever return to and this tops the list 0 
five star plus plus 1 
there was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters 0 
i would not recommend this place 0 
i will not be eating there again 0 
service is also cute 1 
i searched the internet and found this one to be the best value 1 
the soundtrack sucked 0 
obviously they have a terrible customer service so you get what you pay for 0 
not even a hello we will be right with you 0 
it was clear that she had the range and ability to pull off this part 1 
all in all id expected a better consumer experience from motorola 0 
the service was terrible food was mediocre 0 
having trouble with volume 0 
nargile i think you are great 1 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
and if that isnt enough of a mess of a movie for you the picture is also marred with a constant use of studio sets and indoor exteriors 0 
the mic is great 1 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
i was left shattered from the experience of watching this film and i took a good two hours to fully recover 0 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
an extensive menu provides lots of options for breakfast 1 
it didnt charge for me 0 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
main thing i didnt enjoy is that the crowd is of older crowd around mid 30s and up 0 
it is well made easy to access the phone and has a handy detachable belt clip 1 
this place is handsdown one of the best places to eat in the phoenix metro area 1 
the new characters werent all that memorable and i found myself forgetting who was who 0 
i believe every one should see this movie as i think few people outside of south africa understand its past and what is being attempted in the truth and reconciliation process 1 
with great sound effects and impressive special effects i cant recommend this movie enough 1 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
even the squibs look awful 0 
highly unprofessional and rude to a loyal patron 0 
cant say enough good things about this place 1 
used and dirty 0 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
this film highlights the fundamental flaws of the legal process that its not about discovering guilt or innocence but rather is about who presents better in court 1 
level 5 spicy was perfect where spice didnt overwhelm the soup 1 
i gave it 5 stars then and im giving it 5 stars now 1 
disappointed with battery 0 
they dropped more than the ball 0 
sending it back 0 
in the summer you can dine in a charming outdoor patio so very delightful 1 
i was very excited to get this headset because i thought it was really cute 1 
level 5 spicy was perfect where spice didnt overwhelm the soup 1 
i consider this theft 0 
elias koteasjack palance play good roles angelina is hot and gets nakedbilly drago appears in this and is cool as usual a cameo by sven ole thorsen helps make this a very enjoyable movie with good acting and a decent budget 1 
good show samsung 1 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
o my gosh the best phone i have ever had 1 
i purchased this and within 2 days it was no longer working 0 
fits comfortably came with three sizes of earbud tips 1 
he deserves 5 stars 1 
this is a stunning movie 1 
the price was very good and with the free shipping and all it was a good purchase 1 
disappointed 0 
on three different occasions i asked for well done or medium well and all three times i got the bloodiest piece of meat on my plate 0 
punishment park is a brilliant piece of cinema 1 
the cast is always entertaining as usual 1 
worked very well paired with a treo 700w and as a skype headset on my pc using a usb bluetooth transceiver 1 
do not make the same mistake as me 0 
i really recommend this faceplates since it looks very nice elegant and cool 1 
i cannot make calls at certain places 0 
the stories were powerful explorations of the nature of man and of art 1 
waitress was sweet and funny 1 
first of all there are enough racial stereotypes and racial jokes to offend everyone 0 
all the characters in this film are tremendously well played 1 
pretty cool i would say 1 
nice solid keyboard 1 
this movie is a good and humorous comment on life in 2006 1 
arrived quickly and much less expensive than others being sold 1 
echo problemvery unsatisfactory 0 
comfortable nice range good battery life 1 
the poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying 0 
its a campy sort of film thats a joy to watch 1 
not nearly as good looking as the amazon picture makes it look 0 
i left the theater with a lilt in my step joy in my heart and hope for the human race 1 
there is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again 0 
this is a great product sure beats using your fingers 1 
i love this phone it is very handy and has a lot of features 1 
i found this move beautiful enjoyable and uplifting 1 
the cinematography is simply stunning to say the least and the fx are nothing if not stateoftheart 1 
there is a totally unnecessary trainroller coaster scene 0 
the telephone repair man was really funny and his reactions to the nuts and bitchy boss were truly genuine 1 
it just blew 0 
this is cool because most cases are just open there allowing the screen to get all scratched up 1 
lange had become a great actress 1 
there was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters 0 
it was a long time that i didnt see a so charismatic actor on screen 1 
the food is good 1 
it was not good 0 
the dialogue sucked 0 
they have a really nice atmosphere 1 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
terrible service 0 
not good enough for the price 0 
the block was amazing 1 
but this movie is definitely a below average rent 0 
i left the theater with a lilt in my step joy in my heart and hope for the human race 1 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
this would not even be good as a made for tv flick 0 
def coming back to bowl next time 1 
avoid at all cost 0 
director paul matthews who also wrotedirected the weak 1995 monster movie grim clearly doesnt know how to pace his films 0 
it was so cool 1 
you could only take 2 videos at a time and the quality was very poor 0 
the whole experience was underwhelming and i think well just go to ninja sushi next time 0 
the art style has the appearance of crayonpencil drawings and is wonderfully colorful and fanciful 1 
i had a pretty satifying experience 1 
that being said for a phone the camera is very nice many cool effects to play with and video is decent as well 1 
so badwellits just bad 0 
interesting decor 1 
my boyfriend and i sat at the bar and had a completely delightful experience 1 
this movie suffered because of the writing it needed more suspense 0 
and i just love the colors 1 
i understand that its supposed to be a cheap popcorn comedy but that doesnt mean that it has to completely insult our intelligence and have writing so incredibly hackneyed that it borders on offensive 0 
we watched our waiter pay a lot more attention to other tables and ignore us 0 
makes it easier to keep up with my bluetooth when im not wearing it 0 
of course the footage from the 70s was grainy but that only enhanced the film 1 
i own a jabra earset and was very happy with it but the sound quality especially outgoing on this is better 1 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
piece of trash 0 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
car charger as well as ac charger are included to make sure you never run out of juicehighy recommended 1 
the food is rich so order accordingly 1 
very dissapointing performance 0 
unreliable im giving up 0 
you cant beat the price on these 1 
the only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive 1 
but this movie is definitely a below average rent 0 
poor talk time performance 0 
this place is not worth your time let alone vegas 0 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
at around 4 pm i bought it at around 8pm i started to watch at around 815pm i fast forwarded the remaining film to see if there was anything left watchable for a human being with a brain but there wasnt 0 
and considering the two of us left there very full and happy for about 20 you just cant go wrong 1 
eew this location needs a complete overhaul 0 
i definitly recommend 1 
a very good film indeed about great and unconditional love 1 
couldnt figure it out 0 
very happy with this product 1 
the cow tongue and cheek tacos are amazing 1 
of course the footage from the 70s was grainy but that only enhanced the film 1 
it is practically useless and did not add any kind of boost to my reception after i bought it 0 
the construction of the headsets is poor 0 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
being a 90s child i truly enjoyed this show and i can proudly say that i enjoyed it big time and even more than the classical wb cartoons 1 
i love being able to use one headset for both by landline and cell 1 
but i thought his acting was skilled 1 
crisp and clear 1 
great character actors telly savalas and peter boyle 1 
the death row scenes were entirely unmoving 0 
i knew when i saw the film that more great things were to come from this gifted actor 1 
it was pretty gross 0 
this one works and was priced right 1 
they will customize your order any way youd like my usual is eggplant with green bean stir fry love it 1 
bela lugosi was totally extraneous intoning odd lines 0 
i have purchased these for both family and friends and all enjoy their clarity and ease of use 1 
you truly take this journey through the eyes and soul of a child 1 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
there are the usual hitchcock logic flaws 0 
the noise shield is incrediable 1 
it was a drive to get there 0 
delicious and i will absolutely be back 1 
actually the graphics were good at the time 1 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
the songs were the best and the muppets were so hilarious 1 
i have had tmobile service for 2 or 3 years now and i am pretty happy with it 1 
great food and awesome service 1 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
they will customize your order any way youd like my usual is eggplant with green bean stir fry love it 1 
i can barely ever hear on it and am constantly saying what 0 
i was so insulted 0 
oh the charger seems to work fine 1 
very good though 1 
his performance as awarded was stunning 1 
i wouldnt return 0 
we are so glad we found this place 1 
his costars dont fare much better with people like morgan freeman jonah hill and ed helms just wasted 0 
hitchcock is a great director 1 
the refried beans that came with my meal were dried out and crusty and the food was bland 0 
we wont be going back 0 
light weight i hardly notice it is there 1 
i was bored throughout the whole damn thing 0 
this place is pretty good nice little vibe in the restaurant 1 
they have been around for years and carries the highest quality of antiglare screen protector that i have found to date 1 
weird vibe from owners 0 
cant say enough good things about this place 1 
their daily specials are always a hit with my group 1 
it was either too cold not enough flavor or just bad 0 
they dropped more than the ball 0 
integrated seamlessly with the motorola razr phone 1 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
the chips that came out were dripping with grease and mostly not edible 0 
food was delicious 1 
main thing i didnt enjoy is that the crowd is of older crowd around mid 30s and up 0 
unfortunately it will not recharge my iphone 4s despite connecting it from multiple power sources imac external battery wall outlet etc 0 
not sure who was more lost the flat characters or the audience nearly half of whom walked out 0 
this is so embarassing and also my ears hurt if i try to push the ear plug into my ear 0 
leopard print is wonderfully wild 1 
i love this thing 1 
the burger is good beef cooked just right 1 
special mention should be made of the superb music score and sound effects which are an integral element in helping to make this such a memorable and enjoyable cartoon 1 
bad script bad direction and horrible acting make this one plain bad 0 
worth every penny 1 
i advise everyone do not be fooled 0 
better than new 1 
it definitely was not as good as my s11 1 
the wind and the lion is well written and superbly acted 1 
full of unconvincing cardboard characters it is blandly written by edward chodorov who also produced and is surprisingly directed by jean negulesco from whom one would expect a great deal more 0 
crash is a depressing little nothing that provokes emotion but teaches you nothing if you already know racism and prejudice are bad things 0 
graphics is far from the best part of the game 0 
it was packed 0 
blue ant is easy to use 1 
this was a different cut than the piece the other day but still wonderful and tender s well as well flavored 1 
just reading on the specs alone makes you say wow 1 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
fits comfortably came with three sizes of earbud tips 1 
yet i enjoy watching it 1 
i just dont know how this place managed to served the blandest food i have ever eaten when they are preparing indian cuisine 0 
reaching for the bottom row is uncomfortable and the send and end keys are not where i expect them to be3 0 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
the food was terrible 0 
this is so embarassing and also my ears hurt if i try to push the ear plug into my ear 0 
after one bite i was hooked 1 
nine out of ten for a truly lovely film 1 
will order from them again 1 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
better than expected 1 
there is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again 0 
ill give this film 10 out of 10 1 
thank you for wasting my money 0 
perfect for someone me who only likes beer ice cold or in this case even colder 1 
trying to make a call on these is an exercise in frustration 0 
krussel always good 1 
we waited an hour for what was a breakfast i could have done 100 times better at home 0 
im not sure how long we stood there but it was long enough for me to begin to feel awkwardly out of place 0 
now the pizza itself was good the peanut sauce was very tasty 1 
do not buy if you want to use the holster 0 
exceptionally bad 0 
these are the central themes of the film and they are handled ineptly stereotypically and with no depth of imagination 0 
worst martini ever 0 
the ri style calamari was a joke 0 
camera color balance is awful 0 
not good by any stretch of the imagination 0 
i love the look and feel of samsung flipphones 1 
so for our enjoyment we get to see them run around play games and be dangerous 1 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
i was hoping for more 0 
i love all the features and form factor 1 
helen baxendale is a very credible lady macbeth who can be very cheerfull at times and sometimes she just looks like a naughty girl but deadly in her taste for blood and evil 1 
we were promptly greeted and seated 1 
this short film certainly pulls no punches 0 
service is perfect and the family atmosphere is nice to see 1 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
if you look for authentic thai food go else where 0 
this place is not worth your time let alone vegas 0 
my boyfriend and i sat at the bar and had a completely delightful experience 1 
much less than the jawbone i was going to replace it with 1 
very unreliable service from tmobile 0 
this was like the final blow 0 
i could not understand what kind of idiot would produce this mess in the first place not to mention several season 0 
i vomited in the bathroom mid lunch 0 
im big fan of rpg games too but this movie its a disgrace to any selfrespecting rpger there is 0 
this is an excellent film 1 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
if you love authentic mexican food and want a whole bunch of interesting yet delicious meats to choose from you need to try this place 1 
the acting helps the writing along very well maybe the idiotsavant sister could have been played better and it is a real joy to watch 1 
after charging overnight these batteries work great 1 
all in all an excellent restaurant highlighted by great service a unique menu and a beautiful setting 1 
i didnt realize how wonderful the short really is until the last two scenes 1 
now the burgers arent as good the pizza which used to be amazing is doughy and flavorless 0 
really really good rice all the time 1 
both rickman and stowe play their roles to the hilt in this tale of a childrens book writer who maybe has written a subversive tract 1 
my friend loved the salmon tartar 1 
my sister has one also and she loves it 1 
graphics is far from the best part of the game 0 
1 long lasting battery you dont have to recharge it as frequentyly as some of the flip phones2 0 
so far it has worked like a charm 1 
insults profound deuchebaggery and had to go outside for a smoke break while serving just to solidify it 0 
car charger as well as ac charger are included to make sure you never run out of juicehighy recommended 1 
today was my first taste of a buldogis gourmet hot dog and i have to tell you it was more than i ever thought possible 1 
both rickman and stowe play their roles to the hilt in this tale of a childrens book writer who maybe has written a subversive tract 1 
im translating movies for a living and this is the first movie in my 5year working experience that i found offensive to my intelligence 0 
voice quality signal strength dropped calls 0 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
perfect for someone me who only likes beer ice cold or in this case even colder 1 
could not get strong enough signal 0 
due to this happening on every call i was forced to stop using this headset 0 
worse theres an incredibly weak subplot thrown in that follows a little band of latterday mansonites as they go after a reporter whos working on a story on the anniversary of the killings 0 
the film gives meaning to the phrase never in the history of human conflict has so much been owed by so many to so few 1 
the mic there is a joke and the volume is quite low 0 
great product 1 
pretty piece of junk 0 
if you do watch it however there are small consolations the actresses playing annes sisters each do a wonderful job with their roles 1 
not good enough for the price 0 
horrible 0 
it was a bit too sweet not really spicy enough and lacked flavor 0 
this place lacked style 0 
we loved the biscuits 1 
juano hernandez an exceptional actor who played supporting roles in many films of the era is a proud black man who is accused of murdering a white man in the south 1 
thank you for wasting my money 0 
it is well made easy to access the phone and has a handy detachable belt clip 1 
not recommended 0 
this pda rocks 1 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
service was good and the company was better 1 
much less than the jawbone i was going to replace it with 1 
this was such an awesome movie that i bought it off of ebay 1 
the chefs were friendly and did a good job 1 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
it is light easy to use and has very clear reception and transmission 1 
the only thing i wasnt too crazy about was their guacamole as i dont like it puréed 0 
good case excellent value 1 
we also ordered the spinach and avocado salad the ingredients were sad and the dressing literally had zero taste 0 
after charging overnight these batteries work great 1 
customer service was terrible 0 
i felt as though her going to ireland did absolutely nothing whatsoever 0 
con spotty service 0 
fast service 1 
i want my money back 0 
it was a waste of my money 0 
the incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film 1 
the service was great even the manager came and helped with our table 1 
the script is a big flawed mess 0 
it is unusable in a moving car at freeway speed 0 
still i do like this movie for its empowerment of women theres not enough movies out there like this one 1 
anyway the plot flowed smoothly and the malebonding scenes were a hoot 1 
the ngage is still lacking in earbuds 0 
go watch it 1 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
that was funny 1 
the chips and sals a here is amazing 1 
ryans bar is definitely one edinburgh establishment i wont be revisiting 0 
but the convoluted plot just didnt convince me and much of the film was watched with a weird questioning glance 0 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
the accompanied software is almost brilliant 1 
unfortunately it will not recharge my iphone 4s despite connecting it from multiple power sources imac external battery wall outlet etc 0 
about ten minutes into this film i started having second thoughts 0 
i consider this theft 0 
it was horrendous 0 
low quality 0 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
great brunch spot 1 
some applause should be given to the prelude however 1 
add betty white and jean smart and you have a great cast everyone played their parts really well 1 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
in the span of an hour i had two people exclaim whoa is that the new phone on tv 1 
for service i give them no stars 0 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
finally after three or four times the spring of the latch broke and i could not use it any longer on the visor 0 
very pleased with this headset 1 
it doesnt work in europe or asia 0 
i have had this phone for over a year now and i will tell you its not that great 0 
plus it was wellpaced and suited its relatively short run time 1 
the wind and the lion is well written and superbly acted 1 
what the hell kind of crap is that 0 
he was terrible 0 
it was a good thing that the tickets only cost five dollars because i would be mad if id have paid 750 to see this crap 0 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
any grandmother can make a roasted chicken better than this one 0 
now this dish was quite flavourful 1 
its a sad movie but very good 1 
the movie seemed a little slow at first 0 
i hate to disagree with my fellow yelpers but my husband and i were so disappointed with this place 0 
greatno problems at all 1 
its a sad movie but very good 1 
i started this review with two stars but im editing it to give it only one 0 
my only complaint is the standard sound volume is a little low even when turned up to 5of 5 0 
there still are good actors around 1 
if you check the directors filmography on this site you will see why this film didnt have a chance 0 
the block was amazing 1 
went for lunch service was slow 0 
also difficult to put onid recommend avoiding this product 0 
my only complaint is the standard sound volume is a little low even when turned up to 5of 5 0 
another thing i didnt really like is when a character got punched in the face a gallon of blood would spew forth soon after 0 
bluetooth range is good a few days ago i left my phone in the trunk got a call and carried the conversation without a hitch 1 
it was packed 0 
furthermore you cant even find hours of operation on the website 0 
you have to hold the phone at a particular angle for the other party to hear you clearly 0 
this place was such a nice surprise 1 
funny clever hip just like prays previous film hype 1 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
the food is very good for your typical bar food 1 
nice docking station for home or work 1 
everything was gross 0 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
it is an hour and half waste of time following a bunch of very pretty high schoolers whine and cry about life 0 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
i found this move beautiful enjoyable and uplifting 1 
why was this film made 0 
i consider this theft 0 
people who like european films and art movies will like this movie 1 
i have only had it for a few weeks but so far so good 1 
howeverthe riingtones are not the best and neither are the games 0 
this case seems well made 1 
these were so good we ordered them twice 1 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
ryans bar is definitely one edinburgh establishment i wont be revisiting 0 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
battery lasts only a few hours 0 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
well im satisfied 1 
this place lacked style 0 
to those who find this movie intelligent or even masterful i can only say its your intelligence and your imagination you obviously used to try and make some sense of this pitiful attempt its in our human nature to try and make sense of things 0 
the selection on the menu was great and so were the prices 1 
wow what a bad film 0 
disappointed 0 
dont make the same mistake i did 0 
a cheap and cheerless heist movie with poor characterisation lots of underbite style stoic emoting think chow yun fat in a better tomorrow and some cheesy clichés thrown into an abandoned factory ready for a few poorly executed flying judo rolls a la john woo 0 
delicious and i will absolutely be back 1 
clear skype calls long battery life long range 1 
john wayne did an incredible job for being so young in the movie industry 1 
i was left shattered from the experience of watching this film and i took a good two hours to fully recover 0 
you wont be disappointed 1 
great hands free device 1 
i had to go to a store and bought a new nokia phone which is working great 1 
works like a charm it work the same as the one i got with the phone 1 
i love being able to use one headset for both by landline and cell 1 
everything stinks 0 
the flat reenactments dont hold your attention because they are emotionally adrift and stagy 0 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
will definitely be back 1 
service was exceptional and food was a good as all the reviews 1 
if that bug never showed up i would have given a 4 for sure but on the other side of the wall where this bug was climbing was the kitchen 0 
very clear quality sound and you dont have to mess with the sound on your ipod since you have the sound buttons on the headset 1 
the steak was amazingrge fillet relleno was the best seafood plate i have ever had 1 
it felt like a very gripping intelligent stage play but without the overly theatrical feeling one actually gets from watching people on a stage which plays on everyones terror of a white lie escalating to monstrous consequences 1 
it quit working after id used it for about 18 months so i just purchased another one because this is the best headset ive ever owned 1 
i dont have very many words to say about this place but it does everything pretty well 1 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
i put the latest os on it v115g and it now likes to slow to a crawl and lock up every once in a while 0 
this place deserves one star and 90 has to do with the food 0 
another note about this phones appearance is that it really looks rather bland especially in the all black model 0 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
the new characters werent all that memorable and i found myself forgetting who was who 0 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
also were served hot bread and butter and home made potato chips with bacon bits on topvery original and very good 1 
they keep getting better and better this is my third one and ive had numerous palms too 1 
i wont spoil it but the ending in pretty amazing 1 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
i gave it 5 stars because of the sound quality 1 
battery has no life 0 
i was deeply impressed with the character he played 1 
its not user friendly 0 
if there was ever a movie that needed wordofmouth to promote this is it 1 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
exactly what i wanted 1 
we walked away stuffed and happy about our first vegas buffet experience 1 
this was such an awesome movie that i bought it off of ebay 1 
i found this place by accident and i could not be happier 1 
and i really did find them funny 1 
this item worked great but it broke after 6 months of use 0 
rating 010 grade z note the show is so bad that even mother of the cast pull her daughter out of the show 0 
then i had to continue pairing it periodically since it somehow kept dropping 0 
regrettably the film fails 0 
portable and it works 1 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
id say that would be the hardest decision honestly all of ms dishes taste how they are supposed to taste amazing 1 
avoid this one if you can 0 
its one of the movies i need to see whenever it comes on tvnever mind the fact that i already have it memorized 1 
its a shame to see good actors like thomerson and james make a living in a mess like this 0 
the lighting is awful 0 
brilliant 1 
if you look for authentic thai food go else where 0 
lightweight and works well 1 
the chicken i got was definitely reheated and was only ok the wedges were cold and soggy 0 
we walked away stuffed and happy about our first vegas buffet experience 1 
my headset works just peachykeen 1 
the scenes are often funny and occasionally touching as the characters evaluate their lives and where they are going 1 
incredible 1 
and i really did find them funny 1 
avoid at all costs 0 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
i cant believe theres even a sequel to this 0 
it has kept up very well 1 
my 5year old nokia 2160 from tracfone holds the charge a lot better than this 0 
tom wilkinson broke my heart at the end and everyone elses judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike 1 
so i am here to warn youdo not rent this movie it is the dumbest thing you have never seen 0 
i tried the cape cod ravoli chickenwith cranberrymmmm 1 
this movie now joins revenge of the boogeyman and zombiez as part of the hellish trinity of horror films 0 
oh and i forgot to also mention the weird color effect it has on your phone 0 
if you are razr owneryou must have this 1 
very nice and relaxing late night viewing 1 
this is a simple little phone to use but the breakage is unacceptible 0 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
this is a witty and delightful adaptation of the dr seuss book brilliantly animated by upas finest and thoroughly deserving of its academy award 1 
useless phone simply deaf 0 
definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly will return next time im in vegas 1 
reception is terrible and full of static 0 
overall i was not impressed and would not go back 0 
i great reception all the time 1 
i had about two bites and refused to eat anymore 0 
i got to enjoy the seafood salad with a fabulous vinegrette 1 
long whiny and pointless 0 
and the accents are absolutely abysmal 0 
even if you love bad movies do not watch this movie 0 
due to this happening on every call i was forced to stop using this headset 0 
works as described 1 
i know this is not like the other restaurants at all something is very off here 0 
the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach 0 
there was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth but it didnt really work into the rest of the plot 0 
at no point in the proceedings does it look remotely like america 0 
if you simply want a small flip phone look elsewhere as the extra bells whistles are mediocre 0 
it fits my ear well and is comfortable on 1 
it was clear that she had the range and ability to pull off this part 1 
this was such an awesome movie that i bought it off of ebay 1 
the fact is this film is a wonderful heartwarming tale about two people chasing their dreams 1 
the sides are delish mixed mushrooms yukon gold puree white corn beateous 1 
you will leave the theater wanting to go out and dance under the stars 1 
it finds my cell phone right away when i enter the car 1 
reasonably priced also 1 
clear crisp sound 1 
the shrimp tender and moist 1 
host staff were for lack of a better word bitches 0 
small sleek impressive looking practical setup with ample storage in place 1 
the jabra eargels fit my ears very well 1 
i would highly recommend this 1 
steer clear of this product and go with the genuine palm replacementr pens which come in a threepack 0 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
the kids are annoying 0 
the volume switch rocketed out of the unit to a destination unknown 0 
why was this film made 0 
bad characters bad story and bad acting 0 
the keyboard is a nice compromise between a full qwerty and the basic cell phone number keypad 1 
the dining space is tiny but elegantly decorated and comfortable 1 
i wish i could enter negative values admins 0 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
this mostly routine factbased tv drama gets a boost from the fine performance by cole 1 
its pretty easy 1 
we got the food and apparently they have never heard of salt and the batter on the fish was chewy 0 
audio quality is poor very poor 0 
jamie foxx absolutely is ray charles 1 
went for lunch service was slow 0 
your brain will attempt to shutdown as part of a primal impulse of selfpreservation 0 
it is perfect for a sitdown family meal or get together with a few friends 1 
not a good item it worked for a while then started having problems in my auto reverse tape player 0 
nothing at all to recommend 0 
it has a very good plot it holds your complete attention the acting is superb tom wilkinson was fantastic and emily watson was also very good 1 
this is probably the most irritating show i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
when my mom and i got home she immediately got sick and she only had a few bites of salad 0 
worst customer service ever 0 
an hour seriously 0 
bluetooth does not work phone locks up screens just flash up and now it just makes calls randomly while in my pocket locked 0 
the kids are annoying 0 
i highly recommend these and encourage people to give them a try 1 
i love being able to use one headset for both by landline and cell 1 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
i recently had problems where i could not stay connected for more than 10 minutes before being disconnected 0 
worst foodservice ive had in a while 0 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
the story unfolds in 18th century jutland and the use of period music played on period instruments is just one more fine touch 1 
the han nan chicken was also very tasty 1 
this is simply the best bluetooth headset for sound quality 1 
how awesome is that 1 
regardless the film fails on most levels 0 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
a piece of cinematic garbage captured on celluloid 0 
great atmosphere friendly and fast service 1 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
bad quality 0 
none of it works just dont buy it 0 
for a product that costs as much as this one does i expect it to work far better and with greater ease than this thing does 0 
we literally sat there for 20 minutes with no one asking to take our order 0 
phone is sturdy as all nokia bar phones are 1 
its extremely slow and takes forever to do anything with it 0 
we were promptly greeted and seated 1 
i was not happy with this item 0 
this place should honestly be blown up 0 
the accompanied software is almost brilliant 1 
obviously they have a terrible customer service so you get what you pay for 0 
the greek dressing was very creamy and flavorful 1 
the mic is great 1 
i am very impressed with the job that motorola did on the sturdiness of this phone 1 
special thanks to dylan t for the recommendation on what to order all yummy for my tummy 1 
ive never been treated so bad 0 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
the sound quality for the device is unacceptableunless you are in a really quiet area you almost hear nothing 0 
it makes very strange ticking noises before it ends the call 0 
when i saw it in the theater i thought i was going to be sick 0 
the turkey and roast beef were bland 0 
the sound quality for the device is unacceptableunless you are in a really quiet area you almost hear nothing 0 
the headsets are easy to use and everyone loves them 1 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
you wont regret it 1 
the worst sappiest dialogue i could go on and on 0 
but this movie is definitely a below average rent 0 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
nine out of ten for a truly lovely film 1 
the bottowm lineanother worthless cheap gimmick from sprint 0 
an interesting premise and billy drago is always good as a dangerous nutbag side note id love to see drago stephen mchattie and lance hendrikson in a flick together talk about raging cheekbones 1 
the film deserves strong kudos for taking this stand for having exceptional acting from its mostly lesserknown cast and for the superintelligent script that doesnt insult the audience or take the easy way out when it comes to white racism 1 
the film gives meaning to the phrase never in the history of human conflict has so much been owed by so many to so few 1 
that said our mouths and bellies were still quite pleased 1 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
clear crisp sound 1 
the phone takes forever to charge like 2 to 5 hours literally 0 
they work about 2 weeks then break 0 
talk about useless customer service 0 
judith light is one of my favorite actresses and i think she does a superb job in this film 1 
there was hardly any meat 0 
i have been very happy with the 510 and have had no complaints from any one regarding my sound quality on their end 1 
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 
appears to actually outperform the original battery from china that came with my v325i 1 
very unreliable service from tmobile 0 
but this movie really got to me 1 
i was left shattered from the experience of watching this film and i took a good two hours to fully recover 0 
but even the talented carrell cant save this 0 
the first time i ever came here i had an amazing experience i still tell people how awesome the duck was 1 
great audio 1 
however this didnt make up for the fact that overall this was a tremendously boring movie 0 
but the actingeven that of such professionals as drago and debbie rochonwas terrible the directing worse perhaps contributory to the former the dialog chimplike and the camera work barely tolerable 0 
highly recommended a 1 
hands down my favorite italian restaurant 1 
the fried rice was dry as well 0 
reaching for the bottom row is uncomfortable and the send and end keys are not where i expect them to be3 0 
i am very impressed with this headset from plantronics 1 
im not impressed with the concept or the food 0 
bad quality 0 
if she had not rolled the eyes we may have stayed not sure if we will go back and try it again 0 
if only someone involved with it knew how to string together narrative 0 
excellent phone 1 
and i really did find them funny 1 
he is almost unbearable to watch on screen he has little to no charisma and terrible comedic timing 0 
aside from its terrible lead this film has loads of other debits 0 
the only thing that i think could improve is the sound leaks out from the headset 0 
so they performed 1 
improper description i had to return it 0 
works great 1 
there is no real plot 0 
ive only had my bluetooth for a few weeks but i really like it 1 
just what i wanted 1 
this is a simple little phone to use but the breakage is unacceptible 0 
they could be used as exemplars for any set designer 1 
excellent product 1 
the only very disappointing thing was there was no speakerphone 0 
easily none other cartoon made me laugh in a tender way before getting into dark sitcoms oriented for teenagers 1 
the seasonal fruit was fresh white peach puree 1 
sweetest phone 1 
we literally sat there for 20 minutes with no one asking to take our order 0 
also its a real treat to see anthony quinn playing crazy horse 1 
it was so funny 1 
the service was extremely slow 0 
the art style has the appearance of crayonpencil drawings and is wonderfully colorful and fanciful 1 
at least think to refill my water before i struggle to wave you over for 10 minutes 0 
fans of the genre will be in heaven 1 
it even has its sweet moments 1 
i guess maybe we went on an off night but it was disgraceful 0 
if you do go see this movie bring a pillow or a girlfriendboyfriend to keep you occupied through out 0 
better than youd expect 1 
to call this movie a drama is ridiculous 0 
in a word it is embarrassing 0 
the chicken i got was definitely reheated and was only ok the wedges were cold and soggy 0 
its a case of so bad it is laughable 0 
a very charming film with wonderful sentiment and heart 1 
what this film lacks is a convincing script 0 
its like a bad two hour tv movie 0 
not nearly as good looking as the amazon picture makes it look 0 
thanks good a movie like this was done and released 1 
the kids are annoying 0 
jabra ear gels r the best 1 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
bacon is hella salty 1 
truly awful 0 
other than that the leather is nice and soft the fit is very tight the cut out for the face is a good shape 1 
in addition it feels amp looks as if the phone is all lightweight cheap plastic 0 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
lange had become a great actress 1 
terrible my car will not accept this cassette 0 
its quite simply the highest most superlative form of cinema imaginable 1 
i really loved the story line and the poler bear was kinda cutebut if anyone has a question about fort steele just ask away 1 
he is almost unbearable to watch on screen he has little to no charisma and terrible comedic timing 0 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
although i very much liked the look and sound of this place the actual experience was a bit disappointing 0 
but even the talented carrell cant save this 0 
poor product 0 
i would recommend it 1 
it is shameful 0 
will never ever go back 0 
the camera although rated at an impressive 13 megapixels renders images that fall well below expectations of such a relatively high resolution 0 
reversible plug works great 1 
the football scenes at the end were perplexing 0 
the dialogue sucked 0 
the most annoying thing about cover girl is the way in which rita hayworth is put up on a pedestal 0 
i gave it 5 stars then and im giving it 5 stars now 1 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
customer service was terrible 0 
1010 1 
the food is not tasty at all not to say its real traditional hunan style 0 
i cant wait to go back 1 
so far it has worked like a charm 1 
unfortunately it did not work 0 
not much seafood and like 5 strings of pasta at the bottom 0 
if that bug never showed up i would have given a 4 for sure but on the other side of the wall where this bug was climbing was the kitchen 0 
definitely not worth the 3 i paid 0 
so dont go there if you are looking for good food 0 
they know how to make them here 1 
easy to pair with my samsung cell 1 
and the sound quality is great 1 
i have to mention this and it is a huge spoiler i loved the ending how all the characters of the three films were the remaining survivors of the ferry disaster with valentine and the young judge together and the old man watching it on her tv solidifying his happiness over the suffering which he dealt with for those many years 1 
i was sitting in my vehicle with the cradle on my belt and the headset lost signal 0 
i saw this short film on hbo the other day and absolutely loved it 1 
im in az all the time and now have my new spot 1 
i have 23 bars on my cell phone when i am home but you cant not hear anything 0 
also if your phone is dropped this case is not going to save it specially when dropped face down 0 
the casting is also horrible cause all you see is a really really bad actors period 0 
food is way overpriced and portions are fucking small 0 
i was very disappointed 0 
the stories were powerful explorations of the nature of man and of art 1 
it is very comfortable to wear as well which is probably the most important aspect about using a case 1 
the range is very decent ive been able to roam around my house with the phone in the living room with no receptionsound quality issues 1 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
steve martin delivers a really funny performance of a middleaged upper class uptight white guy 1 
do not make the same mistake as me 0 
jabra ear gels r the best 1 
i hate movies like that 0 
i swung in to give them a try but was deeply disappointed 0 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
very disappointed in accessoryone 0 
the poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying 0 
bad characters bad story and bad acting 0 
they were excellent 1 
sam shepards portrayal of a gung ho marine was sobering 1 
they really want to make your experience a good one 1 
what a waste 0 
excellent bluetooth headset 1 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
you can find better movies at youtube 0 
well just if you keep thinking how bad it is 0 
very bad experience 0 
what a mistake that was 0 
it felt like a very gripping intelligent stage play but without the overly theatrical feeling one actually gets from watching people on a stage which plays on everyones terror of a white lie escalating to monstrous consequences 1 
definitely not worth the 3 i paid 0 
we waited an hour for what was a breakfast i could have done 100 times better at home 0 
it has been a winner for us 1 
the shower area is outside so you can only rinse not take a full shower unless you dont mind being nude for everyone to see 0 
love the margaritas too 1 
it doesnt work in europe or asia 0 
i was totally fascinated by the music the dancing everything 1 
it was clear that she had the range and ability to pull off this part 1 
great phone 1 
very comfortable 1 
however after about a year the fliptop started to get loose and wobbly and eventually my screen went black and i couldnt receive and place calls 0 
i felt as though her going to ireland did absolutely nothing whatsoever 0 
i recommend this for everyone who loves film movies anythinga work of art 1 
the owner used to work at nobu so this place is really similar for half the price 1 
dont make the same mistake i did 0 
i went on motorolas website and followed all directions but could not get it to pair again 0 
i didnt know pulled pork could be soooo delicious 1 
paolo sorrentino has written a wonderful story about loneliness and tony has built one of the most unforgettable characters seen in movies in recent years 1 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
i gave it 5 stars then and im giving it 5 stars now 1 
delicious nyc bagels good selections of cream cheese real lox with capers even 1 
battery life is real good 1 
so for our enjoyment we get to see them run around play games and be dangerous 1 
i saw this movie and i thought this is a stupid movie 0 
but despite these few flaws this case is of exceptional quality and well worth the additional costs of owning an official oem product 1 
very cheap plastic creaks like an old wooden floor 0 
not good enough for the price 0 
the pairing of the two devices was so easy it barely took a couple minutes before i started making calls with the voice dialing feature 1 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
best headset ever 1 
a great film by a great director 1 
after charging overnight these batteries work great 1 
i checked out this place a couple years ago and was not impressed 0 
while you dont yet hear mickey speak there are tons of sound effects and music throughout the filmsomething we take for granted now but which was a huge crowd pleaser in 1928 1 
the refried beans that came with my meal were dried out and crusty and the food was bland 0 
it is worth the drive 1 
im happy about this purchase good quality and low price 1 
i was disgusted because i was pretty sure that was human hair 0 
i asked multiple times for the wine list and after some time of being ignored i went to the hostess and got one myself 0 
some may say this buffet is pricey but i think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot 1 
cant upload ringtones from a third party 0 
the acting by the whole cast could be put on a scale and balanced perfectly between overacting and underacting 0 
not too screamy not to masculine but just right 1 
well never go again 0 
but the actingeven that of such professionals as drago and debbie rochonwas terrible the directing worse perhaps contributory to the former the dialog chimplike and the camera work barely tolerable 0 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
how stupid is that 0 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
this movie contained an allstar cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i havent seen before 1 
i knew when i saw the film that more great things were to come from this gifted actor 1 
very very sad 0 
classywarm atmosphere fun and fresh appetizers succulent steaks baseball steak 1 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
my salad had a bland vinegrette on the baby greens and hearts of palm 0 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
there is no plot or storyline 0 
would not recommend to others 0 
it didnt work people can not hear me when i talk 0 
this phone is very fast with sending any kind of messages and web browsing is significantly faster than previous phones i have used 1 
does not fit 0 
there is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again 0 
but other than that the movie seemed to drag and the heroes didnt really work for their freedom 0 
they brought a fresh batch of fries and i was thinking yay something warm but no 0 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
the pancake was also really good and pretty large at that 1 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
the reception has been generally good 1 
i found this place by accident and i could not be happier 1 
this scene is very strong and unpleasant 0 
excellent product for the price 1 
its so bad its actually worth seeing just for that reason 0 
both do good jobs and are quite amusing 1 
i love my 350 headset my jabra350 bluetooth headset is great the reception is very good and the ear piece is a comfortable fit 1 
the attempts at humor were pitiful and story is so awful it dosent bear thinking about which basically involves a vulcan stealing the enterprise to find god seriously i just didnt care about any of this film and oh not to mention uhura does a belly dance to distract male guards 0 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
a cheap and cheerless heist movie with poor characterisation lots of underbite style stoic emoting think chow yun fat in a better tomorrow and some cheesy clichés thrown into an abandoned factory ready for a few poorly executed flying judo rolls a la john woo 0 
great pork sandwich 1 
nicest chinese restaurant ive been in a while 1 
any grandmother can make a roasted chicken better than this one 0 
lot of holes in the plot theres nothing about how he became the emperor nothing about where he spend 20 years between his childhood and mature age 0 
this one is simply a disappointment 0 
the worst experience ever 0 
excellent dualpurpose headset 1 
i searched the internet and found this one to be the best value 1 
this movie was kind of long in length but i enjoyed every minute of it 1 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
the secondary plot line is incomprehensible and its relation to the primary plot line is mystifying 0 
not sure who was more lost the flat characters or the audience nearly half of whom walked out 0 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
i had about two bites and refused to eat anymore 0 
how can that bethe audio quality is poor 0 
i have only had it for a few weeks but so far so good 1 
this film and i use that word loosely is an insult to the moviegoing public 0 
battery chargelife is quite long 1 
it was forced like everything in this movie 0 
delicious and i will absolutely be back 1 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
i did not expect this to be so good 1 
this is one of the best italian thrillers of the early 70s 1 
the waitress and manager are so friendly 1 
what on earth is irons doing in this film 0 
it doesnt work in europe or asia 0 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
highquality chicken on the chicken caesar salad 1 
the camera on the phone may be used as a dustpan when indoors id rather be using a disposable then this 0 
nice docking station for home or work 1 
for sushi on the strip this is the place to go 1 
best tacos in town by far 1 
i know this is not like the other restaurants at all something is very off here 0 
i always order from the vegetarian menu during dinner which has a wide array of options to choose from 1 
secondly hitchcock pretty much perfected the thriller and chase movie 1 
the steak and the shrimp are in my opinion the best entrees at gc 1 
also makes it easier to hold on to 1 
its one of the movies i need to see whenever it comes on tvnever mind the fact that i already have it memorized 1 
when i placed my treo into the case not only was it not snug but there was a lot of extra room on the sides 0 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
really bad 0 
and the sound quality is great 1 
my only complaint is the standard sound volume is a little low even when turned up to 5of 5 0 
a film not easily forgotten 1 
i would not recommend this place 0 
this movie contained an allstar cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i havent seen before 1 
its an empty hollow shell of a movie 0 
internet is excrutiatingly slow 0 
the sound is clear and the people i talk to on it are amazed at the quality too 1 
this movie totally grates on my nerves 0 
they keep getting better and better this is my third one and ive had numerous palms too 1 
the only good thing was our waiter he was very helpful and kept the bloddy marys coming 1 
not worth it 0 
reception is terrible and full of static 0 
these are the central themes of the film and they are handled ineptly stereotypically and with no depth of imagination 0 
dont waste your on this one 0 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
there arent death scenes like in previous movies and the fx are terrible 0 
it is not good 0 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
not recommended 0 
i am so pleased to know such a modern day genius is out there letting is passion for art drive him and taking us as an audience with him 1 
damian is so talented and versatile in so many ways of writing and portraying different characters on screen 1 
i use this product in a motor control center where there is a lot of high voltage humming from the equipment and it works great 1 
reception is terrible and full of static 0 
again no plot at all 0 
not a weekly haunt but definitely a place to come back to every once in a while 1 
the battery life is highly unacceptable 0 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
i love this thing 1 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
very serious spoilers this movie was a huge disappointment 0 
rating 010 grade z note the show is so bad that even mother of the cast pull her daughter out of the show 0 
the visual effects were awful 0 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
hands down my favorite italian restaurant 1 
nice spicy and tender 1 
this one works and was priced right 1 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
the plot well i said id let that one go 0 
o my gosh the best phone i have ever had 1 
very disappointing 0 
i dont think there are any redeeming qualities in this remake 0 
i can say that the desserts were yummy 1 
how stupid is that 0 
dont waste your time watching this rubbish nonresearched film 0 
does not fit 0 
the plot was the same as pretty much every other cheap horror 0 
i love the scream movies and all horror movies and this one ranks way up there 1 
its very slow 0 
it was a riot to see hugo weaving play a sexobsessed gay real estate salesman who uses his clients houses for his trysts with the flaming darren tom hollander 1 
i heart this place 1 
i had about two bites and refused to eat anymore 0 
excellent bluetooth headset 1 
for sushi on the strip this is the place to go 1 
the acting was decidely wooden though no worse than a period universal b movie 0 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
end of days is one of the worst bigbudget action movies ive ever seen 0 
everything about it is fine and reasonable for the price ie 1 
at least think to refill my water before i struggle to wave you over for 10 minutes 0 
i wear glasses and it fits fine with them 1 
the nachos are a must have 1 
crisp and clear 1 
i liked the patio and the service was outstanding 1 
i had to wait over 30 minutes to get my drink and longer to get 2 arepas 0 
prosgood camera very nice pictures also has cool styles like black and white and more 1 
i especially love the long battery life 1 
its quite simply the highest most superlative form of cinema imaginable 1 
i can think of no other film where something vitally important occurs every other minute 1 
this fixes all the problems 1 
it also took her forever to bring us the check when we asked for it 0 
i hope this place sticks around 1 
verizon tech support walked my through a few procedures none of which worked and i ended up having to do a hard reset wiping out all my data 0 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
good protection and does not make phone too bulky 1 
the only downside is the service 0 
new battery works great in phone 1 
worst customer service ever 0 
which has more depth and character than the man underneath it 0 
after one bite i was hooked 1 
but it wasnt anything at all just one big yawn 0 
it fits so securely that the ear hook does not even need to be used and the sound is better directed through your ear canal 1 
you need at least 3 mins to get to your phone book from the time you first turn on the phonebattery life is short 0 
its just lame 0 
i ate there twice on my last visit and especially enjoyed the salmon salad 1 
it really is impressive that the place hasnt closed down 0 
there was so much hype over this phone that i assumed it was the best my mistake 0 
we waited for forty five minutes in vain 0 
for a self proclaimed coffee cafe i was wildly disappointed 0 
product is exactly as described 1 
the movie seemed a little slow at first 0 
this was such an awesome movie that i bought it off of ebay 1 
the eargels channel the sound directly into your ear and seem to increase the sound volume and clarity 1 
all in all id expected a better consumer experience from motorola 0 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
later i found myself lost in the power of the film 1 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
ordered burger rare came in well done 0 
its very attractive and appears to be of good quality 1 
every thing on phone work perfectly she like it 1 
oh the charger seems to work fine 1 
just reading on the specs alone makes you say wow 1 
not tasty and the texture was just nasty 0 
it is so small and you dont even realize that it is there after a while of getting used to it 1 
ive had this for nearly 2 years and it has worked great for me 1 
im big fan of rpg games too but this movie its a disgrace to any selfrespecting rpger there is 0 
conclusion very filling meals 1 
they do not last forever but is not overly expensive to replaceeasy to operate and the sound is much better than others i have tried 1 
aside from its terrible lead this film has loads of other debits 0 
you cant go wrong with any of the food here 1 
i was not happy with this item 0 
i saw this movie and i thought this is a stupid movie 0 
everything about this product is wrongfirst 0 
the owners are super friendly and the staff is courteous 1 
bluetooth range is good a few days ago i left my phone in the trunk got a call and carried the conversation without a hitch 1 
the handsfree part works fine but then the car tries to download the address book and the treo rebootsoverall i still rate this device high 1 
jawbone era is awesome too 1 
crisp and clear 1 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
food was below average 0 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
the songs were the best and the muppets were so hilarious 1 
the basic premise is wasted since it is sidelined by the inexplicable focus on the documentary crew 0 
as for the service i thought it was good 1 
nargile i think you are great 1 
even the squibs look awful 0 
fans of the genre will be in heaven 1 
the characters were all funny and had the peculiarity of not having a true lead character 1 
think of the film being like a dream 1 
this movie is a good and humorous comment on life in 2006 1 
who in their right mind is gonna buy this battery 0 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
wont go back 0 
awesome device 1 
their daily specials are always a hit with my group 1 
it fits so securely that the ear hook does not even need to be used and the sound is better directed through your ear canal 1 
we are sending it back 0 
it was attached to a gas station and that is rarely a good sign 0 
it is perfect for a sitdown family meal or get together with a few friends 1 
dont waste your money 0 
there is nothing authentic about this place 0 
it dit not work most of the time with my nokia 5320 0 
the battery is completely useless to me 0 
i ended up sliding it on the edge of my pants or back pockets instead 1 
does not fit 0 
i really recommend this faceplates since it looks very nice elegant and cool 1 
this is was due to the fact that it took 20 minutes to be acknowledged then another 35 minutes to get our foodand they kept forgetting things 0 
this place lacked style 0 
great phone 1 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
it is a very well acted and done tv movie 1 
nine out of ten for a truly lovely film 1 
it is unusable in a moving car at freeway speed 0 
i hate those things as much as cheap quality black olives 0 
service is friendly and inviting 1 
the vegetables are so fresh and the sauce feels like authentic thai 1 
actually the graphics were good at the time 1 
a bit predictable 0 
the story is beyond stupid 0 
the descriptions said yum yum sauce and another said eel sauce yet another said spicy mayowell none of the rolls had sauces on them 0 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
by far the best cheesecurds we have ever had 1 
i had the mac salad and it was pretty bland so i will not be getting that again 0 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
there is so much good food in vegas that i feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to rice and company 0 
del taco is pretty nasty and should be avoided if possible 0 
raw and sublimely moving 1 
the chicken i got was definitely reheated and was only ok the wedges were cold and soggy 0 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
its a piece of crap 0 
i liked the patio and the service was outstanding 1 
in fact this stinker smells like a directtovideo release 0 
i was shocked because no signs indicate cash only 0 
ordered burger rare came in well done 0 
this item worked great but it broke after 6 months of use 0 
the characters were all funny and had the peculiarity of not having a true lead character 1 
great phone 1 
im pleased 1 
you cant go wrong with any of the food here 1 
its kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly its embarrassing how childlike the company is 0 
the folks at otto always make us feel so welcome and special 1 
very poor service 0 
i tried the cape cod ravoli chickenwith cranberrymmmm 1 
i seriously cannot believe that the owner has so many unexperienced employees that all are running around like chickens with their heads cut off 0 
an extensive menu provides lots of options for breakfast 1 
the acting is beyond abysmal 0 
the restaurant atmosphere was exquisite 1 
the steak and the shrimp are in my opinion the best entrees at gc 1 
the script is bad very bad  it contains both cheesiness and unethical joke that you normally see in rated r or nc17 movie 0 
so i had to take the battery out of the phone put it all back together and then restart it 0 
would recommend this item 1 
talk about useless customer service 0 
it was a good thing that the tickets only cost five dollars because i would be mad if id have paid 750 to see this crap 0 
the staff is friendly and the joint is always clean 1 
i love the scream movies and all horror movies and this one ranks way up there 1 
this is a great deal 1 
not too screamy not to masculine but just right 1 
we loved the biscuits 1 
it quit working after id used it for about 18 months so i just purchased another one because this is the best headset ive ever owned 1 
there arent death scenes like in previous movies and the fx are terrible 0 
its like a bad two hour tv movie 0 
i have had problems wit hit dropping signal and more 0 
the worst phone from samsungcrap this crappy samsung e715 is the worst i have ever seeen 0 
very disappointed 0 
everything on the menu is terrific and we were also thrilled that they made amazing accommodations for our vegetarian daughter 1 
at any rate this film stinks its not funny and fulci should have stayed with giallo and supernatural zombie movies 0 
i dont know what the big deal is about this place but i wont be back yaall 0 
the script is bad very bad  it contains both cheesiness and unethical joke that you normally see in rated r or nc17 movie 0 
punishment park is a brilliant piece of cinema 1 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
i checked everywhere and there is no feature for it which is really disappointing 0 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
simply beautiful 1 
much less than the jawbone i was going to replace it with 1 
ive never been treated so bad 0 
special mention should be made of the superb music score and sound effects which are an integral element in helping to make this such a memorable and enjoyable cartoon 1 
i found this move beautiful enjoyable and uplifting 1 
if you do go see this movie bring a pillow or a girlfriendboyfriend to keep you occupied through out 0 
the film has great actors a master director a significant themeat least a wouldbe significant theme undertone of fifties existential worldweariness aerial scenes that ought to have thrilled both senses and imagination and characters about which one might deeply care 1 
even the squibs look awful 0 
problem is that the ear loops are made of weak material and break easily 0 
i was mortified 0 
you need two hands to operate the screenthis software interface is decade old and cannot compete with new software designs 0 
the malta settings are as dry and as barren as the dialogue 0 
i guess i should have known that this place would suck because it is inside of the excalibur but i didnt use my common sense 0 
service stinks here 0 
this product had a strong rubberpetroleum smell that was unbearable after a while and caused me to return it 0 
the fried rice was dry as well 0 
what a waste of time 0 
yes i am simplifying things here for the sake of brevity for this really is at the core of the problems with this film it has too much going on without any real fulfilling explanation 0 
if good intentions made a film great then this film might be one of the greatest films ever made 1 
what the hell kind of crap is that 0 
and there wasnt a single sour note struck actingwise either some surprisingly solid casting here 1 
this movie suffered because of the writing it needed more suspense 0 
this is the kind of money that is wasted properly 1 
20th century foxs road house 1948 is not only quite a silly noir but is an implausible unmitigated bore of a movie 0 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
highly recommended for all ages although the younger set will probably not appreciate some of the more subtle references they will certainly appreciate one galley scene in particular 1 
easy to pair with my samsung cell 1 
i love this thing 1 
after the disappointing dinner we went elsewhere for dessert 0 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
its practically perfect in all of them  a true masterpiece in a sea of faux masterpieces 1 
absolutel junk 0 
not tasty and the texture was just nasty 0 
so absolutley fantastic 1 
judith light is one of my favorite actresses and i think she does a superb job in this film 1 
never been to hard rock casino before will never ever step forward in it again 0 
this is infuriating 0 
would not reccommend 0 
the football scenes at the end were perplexing 0 
then i watched it again two sundays ago march 20th 2005 and i began to really enjoy it and this time i taped the entire thing 1 
made very sturdy 1 
i love this place 1 
i mean really how do you get so famous for your fish and chips when its so terrible 0 
waitress was good though 1 
highly recommended a 1 
her lines seem to have been written by a fifteen year old though they are trying oh so so hard to sound like how a fifteen year old would really um you know well talk 0 
also the fries are without a doubt the worst fries ive ever had 0 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
on the ground right next to our table was a large smeared beensteppedinandtrackedeverywhere pile of green bird poop 0 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
service is perfect and the family atmosphere is nice to see 1 
if that bug never showed up i would have given a 4 for sure but on the other side of the wall where this bug was climbing was the kitchen 0 
delicious and i will absolutely be back 1 
when it opens the battery connection is broken and the device is turned off 0 
doesnt work at all i bougth it for my l7c and its not working 0 
i dont like this nokia either 0 
this device is great in several situations1 1 
it does everything the description said it would 1 
damn good steak 1 
there is a totally unnecessary trainroller coaster scene 0 
warning do not buy 0 
it also took her forever to bring us the check when we asked for it 0 
terrible service 0 
trouble is the writing and directing make it impossible to establish those things that make a movie watchable like character story theme and so on 0 
sooooo good 1 
after charging overnight these batteries work great 1 
it was just too horrible 0 
fast service 1 
very good lunch spot 1 
the management is rude 0 
i really do recommend this place you can go wrong with this donut place 1 
this item is great installed it let it charged up overnite and it has been working good every since with no problems 1 
bad choice 0 
dont buy this product it fails 0 
battery has no life 0 
john garfield ann revere lilli plmer william conrad canada leeand filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screenjames wong howe 1 
a good quality bargain i bought this after i bought a cheapy from big lots that sounded awful and people on the other end couldnt hear me 1 
honeslty it didnt taste that fresh 0 
good prices 1 
the two main characters may be two of the most believable children i ever saw put on screen 1 
it is practically useless and did not add any kind of boost to my reception after i bought it 0 
my only complaint is the standard sound volume is a little low even when turned up to 5of 5 0 
the servers are not pleasant to deal with and they dont always honor pizza hut coupons 0 
i wasted my little money with this earpiece 0 
great time family dinner on a sunday night 1 
we watched our waiter pay a lot more attention to other tables and ignore us 0 
well never go again 0 
their research and development division obviously knows what theyre doing 1 
he is almost unbearable to watch on screen he has little to no charisma and terrible comedic timing 0 
the jerky camera movements were also annoying 0 
stay away from the q 0 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
itll be a regular stop on my trips to phoenix 1 
pretty piece of junk 0 
reversible plug works great 1 
i was deeply impressed with the character he played 1 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
this is a great deal 1 
im terribly disappointed that this film would receive so many awards and accolades especially when there are far more deserving works of film out there 0 
but kevin spacey is an excellent verbal tsunami as buddy ackerman  and totally believable because he is a great actor 1 
bad fit way too big 0 
the sets especially designed to work with the camera are amazingstylized beautiful and effective 1 
food was really boring 0 
i am going to have to be the first to negatively review this product 0 
the handsfree part works fine but then the car tries to download the address book and the treo rebootsoverall i still rate this device high 1 
i would not recommend this place 0 
raw and sublimely moving 1 
con spotty service 0 
their onscreen chemistry critical to the entire film is genuine 1 
every element of this story was so over the top excessively phony and contrived that it was painful to sit through 0 
overall i wasnt very impressed with noca 0 
i have to mention this and it is a huge spoiler i loved the ending how all the characters of the three films were the remaining survivors of the ferry disaster with valentine and the young judge together and the old man watching it on her tv solidifying his happiness over the suffering which he dealt with for those many years 1 
as for the killer dont expect anything original or even remotely frightening 0 
artless camerawork endlessly presents us with the ugliest setting imaginable ie 0 
overall i was not impressed and would not go back 0 
crisp and clear 1 
will never ever go back and have told many people what had happened 0 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
your brain will attempt to shutdown as part of a primal impulse of selfpreservation 0 
great earpiece 1 
all i can do is whine on the internet so here it goesthe more i use the thing the less i like it 0 
full of unconvincing cardboard characters it is blandly written by edward chodorov who also produced and is surprisingly directed by jean negulesco from whom one would expect a great deal more 0 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
what this film lacks is a convincing script 0 
its this pandering to the audience that sabotages most of his films 0 
however my girl was complain that some time the phone doesnt wake up like normal phone does 0 
i especially love the long battery life 1 
i always order from the vegetarian menu during dinner which has a wide array of options to choose from 1 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
even in my bmw 3 series which is fairly quiet i have trouble hearing what the other person is saying 0 
very bad experience 0 
this is such a fun and funny movie 1 
if you dont find it too bad as again the unit comes with one earpad onlyi would not recommend this to anyone 0 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
but even the talented carrell cant save this 0 
i ordered the voodoo pasta and it was the first time id had really excellent pasta since going gluten free several years ago 1 
we had 7 at our table and the service was pretty fast 1 
i love their fries and their beans 1 
a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it 1 
im returning them 0 
also were served hot bread and butter and home made potato chips with bacon bits on topvery original and very good 1 
first of all there are enough racial stereotypes and racial jokes to offend everyone 0 
easy to use 1 
thank you for such great service 1 
i mean really how do you get so famous for your fish and chips when its so terrible 0 
i was disgusted because i was pretty sure that was human hair 0 
the problem was the script 0 
in fact i liked it better than interview with a vampire and i liked this lestat stuart townsend better than cruises attempt 1 
price is good too 1 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
well never go again 0 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
car charger as well as ac charger are included to make sure you never run out of juicehighy recommended 1 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
i let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this bad idea we both hated it 0 
avoid at any and all costs 0 
i thought it was bad 0 
that one didnt work either 0 
personally i think it shows that people should learn to find a compromise them self without involving other people into issue 1 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
who in their right mind is gonna buy this battery 0 
highly recommended a 1 
good value great food great service 1 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
the vanilla ice cream was creamy and smooth while the profiterole choux pastry was fresh enough 1 
the restaurant atmosphere was exquisite 1 
for that its worth checking out 1 
dont waste your time watching this rubbish nonresearched film 0 
1010 1 
the bathrooms are clean and the place itself is well decorated 1 
and those baby owls were adorable 1 
the sweet potato fries were very good and seasoned well 1 
i like the fact that it rests lightly against your ear rather than inside 1 
really good product 1 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
bacon is hella salty 1 
an amazing finale to possibly the best trilogy of all time 1 
we will not be coming back 0 
seafood was limited to boiled shrimp and crab legs but the crab legs definitely did not taste fresh 0 
its a gloriously fun fast paced and fairly accurate portrayal of the night of a raver 1 
the waiter wasnt helpful or friendly and rarely checked on us 0 
we have tried 2 units and they both failed within 2 months pros 0 
heres where the movie really pied me off 0 
not even a hello we will be right with you 0 
highquality chicken on the chicken caesar salad 1 
service is perfect and the family atmosphere is nice to see 1 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
needless to say i wont be going back anytime soon 0 
very good product well made 1 
these headphones were a great find and i think they are perhaps the best purchase ive made in the last several years seriously 1 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
sooooo good 1 
but despite these few flaws this case is of exceptional quality and well worth the additional costs of owning an official oem product 1
