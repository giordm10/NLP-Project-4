avoid at any and all costs 0 
unfortunately it was not good 0 
the structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema 1 
beware this is not a trashy cult movie this is trash period 0 
the charger arrived within the promised timeframe but it did not work 0 
painful on the ear 0 
the jabra eargels fit my ears very well 1 
uncomfortable in the ear dont use with lg vx9900 env 0 
ps the only scene in the movie that was cool is when the central character finds her room blown up 1 
i guess maybe we went on an off night but it was disgraceful 0 
no complaints 1 
then i had to continue pairing it periodically since it somehow kept dropping 0 
anne heche was utterly convincing 1 
it has everything i need and i couldnt ask for more 1 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
i hate writing bad reviews about films especially those in which i really like the star but this film is so bad i dont believe for one second that anyone could have been proud of it 0 
i guess that nobody at the network that aired this dribble watched it before putting it on 0 
this place is great 1 
the only thing really worth watching was the scenery and the house because it is beautiful 1 
nine out of ten for a truly lovely film 1 
the only good thing was that it fits comfortably on small ears 1 
i was deeply impressed with the character he played 1 
i wish i could return the unit and get back my money 0 
this is a great little item 1 
best fish ive ever had in my life 1 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
perabo has a nice energy level and is obviously very comfortable in front of a camera 1 
the characters were all funny and had the peculiarity of not having a true lead character 1 
i was bored throughout the whole damn thing 0 
if you plan to use this in a car forget about it 0 
the potatoes were like rubber and you could tell they had been made up ahead of time being kept under a warmer 0 
it rocked my world and is certainly a must see for anyone with no social or physical outlets 1 
i bought this to use with my kindle fire and absolutely loved it 1 
seems like a good quick place to grab a bite of some familiar pub food but do yourself a favor and look elsewhere 0 
i highly recommend this case 1 
excellent product for the price 1 
these were so good we ordered them twice 1 
the point is the journey a journey that touches every member of the family 1 
we thought youd have to venture further away to get good sushi but this place really hit the spot that night 1 
dont buy it 0 
this phone tries very hard to do everything but fails at its very ability to be a phone 0 
i would recommend this 1 
this movie now joins revenge of the boogeyman and zombiez as part of the hellish trinity of horror films 0 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
i was very disappointed in the movie 0 
i bought this battery with a coupon from amazon and im very happy with my purchase 1 
we waited an hour for what was a breakfast i could have done 100 times better at home 0 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
simply beautiful 1 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
the food came out at a good pace 1 
do not waste your time 0 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
however paul schrader has indeed made a film about mishima that is both superb complex 1 
an hour and a half i wish i could bring back 0 
i could not recommend these more 0 
i waited and waited 0 
the cast is good 1 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
first time there and might just be the last 0 
keep up the good work amazon 1 
we have tried 2 units and they both failed within 2 months pros 0 
so flavorful and has just the perfect amount of heat 1 
in other words the content level of this film is enough to easily fill a dozen other films 1 
dont waste your time here 0 
from here on the widmark character turns unintentionally comical 0 
50 down the drain 0 
recommend with confidence 1 
its really easy 1 
i was totally fascinated by the music the dancing everything 1 
the dialogue sucked 0 
i dont have very many words to say about this place but it does everything pretty well 1 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
having to humour him just to get by and get through the day was so apt 1 
these headphones were a great find and i think they are perhaps the best purchase ive made in the last several years seriously 1 
i wont be back 0 
coming here is like experiencing an underwhelming relationship where both parties cant wait for the other person to ask to break up 0 
i can barely ever hear on it and am constantly saying what 0 
the characters are interesting even if a bit predictable 1 
bad day or not i have a very low tolerance for rude customer service people it is your job to be nice and polite wash dishes otherwise 0 
kids pizza is always a hit too with lots of great side dish options for the kiddos 1 
if you see it you should probably just leave it on the shelf 0 
excellent product for the price 1 
the warm beer didnt help 0 
dessert panna cotta was amazing 1 
disappointed 0 
this film offers many delights and surprises 1 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
food was delicious 1 
it was that year however that reminded us that huston was still at the top of his game as evinced by his faithful adaptation of james joyces acclaimed novella the dead 1 
i dont each much pasta but i love the homemade hand made pastas and thin pizzas here 1 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
well im satisfied 1 
using all earpieces left or right this thing will not stay on my ear 0 
if you check the directors filmography on this site you will see why this film didnt have a chance 0 
lewis blacks considerable talent is wasted here too as he is at his most incendiary when he is unrestrained which the pg13 rating certainly wont allow 0 
nice quality build unlike some cheap s out there 1 
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
i dont have to be an accountant to know im getting screwed 0 
i have eaten here multiple times and each time the food was delicious 1 
its kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly its embarrassing how childlike the company is 0 
dont buy this product 0 
i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
you cant beat the price on these 1 
eew this location needs a complete overhaul 0 
the result is a powerhouse achievement made more timely now perhaps because of our cultures disturbing fascination with celebrity and its distorted interpretations of fame 1 
the atmosphere was great with a lovely duo of violinists playing songs we requested 1 
the greek dressing was very creamy and flavorful 1 
this was one of the worst films i have ever seen 0 
its a feelgood film and thats how i felt when i came out of the cinema 1 
it was awesome 1 
a week later after i activated it it suddenly died 0 
it is very comfortable to wear as well which is probably the most important aspect about using a case 1 
then i had to continue pairing it periodically since it somehow kept dropping 0 
i will not return 0 
the only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive 1 
the best place to go for a tasty bowl of pho 1 
this place is way too overpriced for mediocre food 0 
the story unfolds in 18th century jutland and the use of period music played on period instruments is just one more fine touch 1 
the desserts were a bit strange 0 
total waste of time 0 
better than new 1 
very unreliable service from tmobile 0 
dont buy it 0 
awesome service and food 1 
the least said about the acting the better 0 
i am also very happy with the price 1 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
the bipolarity of the ruthless thug one minute a ruthless killer the next minute a luvs diaper commercial is completely unconvincing 0 
mark my words this is one of those cult films like evil dead 2 or phantasm that people will still be discovering and falling in love with 20 30 40 years down the line 1 
the selection of food was not the best 0 
i dont know what the big deal is about this place but i wont be back yaall 0 
so they performed 1 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
mark my words this is one of those cult films like evil dead 2 or phantasm that people will still be discovering and falling in love with 20 30 40 years down the line 1 
very bad experience 0 
overall a great experience 1 
i checked out this place a couple years ago and was not impressed 0 
there are so many problems i dont know where to start 0 
so for our enjoyment we get to see them run around play games and be dangerous 1 
awesome selection of beer 1 
when my order arrived one of the gyros was missing 0 
i do think tom hanks is a good actor 1 
not much dialogue not much music the whole film was shot as elaborately and aesthetically like a sculpture 1 
my salad had a bland vinegrette on the baby greens and hearts of palm 0 
all in all i can assure you ill be back 1 
the pizza selections are good 1 
my sanyo has survived dozens of drops on blacktop without ill effect 1 
lot of holes in the plot theres nothing about how he became the emperor nothing about where he spend 20 years between his childhood and mature age 0 
in particular the relationship between the bakery assistant and the waitress just didnt work for me at all 0 
we had fantastic service and were pleased by the atmosphere 1 
very easy to use 1 
very tough and very short on flavor 0 
both do good jobs and are quite amusing 1 
the food came out at a good pace 1 
a good film by a great director 1 
this was like the final blow 0 
the acting was decidely wooden though no worse than a period universal b movie 0 
2 thumbs up to this seller 1 
i guess i liked the details of his dysfunctionhe was believable 1 
only had this a month but its worked flawlessly so far 1 
there is a totally unnecessary trainroller coaster scene 0 
i would highly recommend this 1 
a film not easily forgotten 1 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
down the drain because of a weak snap 0 
this scene is very strong and unpleasant 0 
then scene where they debated whether or not to sack the trumpeter who falsely was accused for the murder is pure horror really stupid 0 
the refried beans that came with my meal were dried out and crusty and the food was bland 0 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
bt50 battery junk 0 
only had this a month but its worked flawlessly so far 1 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
as an earlier review noted plug in this charger and nothing happens 0 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
the crêpe was delicate and thin and moist 1 
the least said about the acting the better 0 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
its a total package 1 
otherwise dont even waste your time on this 0 
the sweet potato fries were very good and seasoned well 1 
the good cinematography also makes her and monica bellucci look very beautiful 1 
their chow mein is so good 1 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
although i very much liked the look and sound of this place the actual experience was a bit disappointing 0 
works well 1 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
often the dialogue doesnt really follow from one line to another or fit the surroundings 0 
the two main characters may be two of the most believable children i ever saw put on screen 1 
there is nothing privileged about workingeating there 0 
the file browser offers all the options that one needshandsfree is great 1 
lot of holes in the plot theres nothing about how he became the emperor nothing about where he spend 20 years between his childhood and mature age 0 
i had high hopes for this place since the burgers are cooked over a charcoal grill but unfortunately the taste fell flat way flat 0 
barney is definitely super de duper 1 
good prices 1 
overall i am psyched to have a phone which has all my appointments and contacts in and gets great reception 1 
battery life is real good 1 
check it out 1 
in fact this stinker smells like a directtovideo release 0 
you can even take self portraits with the outside exterior display very cool 1 
1010 1 
really really good rice all the time 1 
very happy with this product 1 
has been working great 1 
but i thought his acting was skilled 1 
it didnt work people can not hear me when i talk 0 
ive tried several different earpieces for my cell phone and this jabra one is the first one ive found that fits my ear comfortably 1 
this place deserves one star and 90 has to do with the food 0 
for sushi on the strip this is the place to go 1 
its quite simply the highest most superlative form of cinema imaginable 1 
this is cool because most cases are just open there allowing the screen to get all scratched up 1 
i ended up sliding it on the edge of my pants or back pockets instead 1 
im very disappointed with my decision 0 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
reaching for the bottom row is uncomfortable and the send and end keys are not where i expect them to be3 0 
someone shouldve invented this sooner 1 
its the best headset i have used 1 
very good food great atmosphere1 1 
it wasnt busy either also the building was freezing cold 0 
it was delicious 1 
i checked everywhere and there is no feature for it which is really disappointing 0 
you get incredibly fresh fish prepared with care 1 
ive had no trouble accessing the internet downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions 1 
hes a national treasure 1 
an hour seriously 0 
truly awful 0 
i will come back here every time im in vegas 1 
it had some average acting from the main person and it was a low budget as you clearly can see 0 
dee snider just plain sucks 0 
that was done in the second movie 0 
the food was excellent and service was very good 1 
i give wirefly 1 stari will contact cingularatt and inform them of this practice 0 
only had this a month but its worked flawlessly so far 1 
i was amazed at the quick arrival of the two original lg cell phone batteries and and at a fraction of the price 1 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
painful on the ear 0 
ray charles life provided excellent biographical material for the film which goes well beyond being just another movie about a musician 1 
all the pretty pictures in the world cannot make up for a piece of work that is flawed at the core 0 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
the film deserves strong kudos for taking this stand for having exceptional acting from its mostly lesserknown cast and for the superintelligent script that doesnt insult the audience or take the easy way out when it comes to white racism 1 
the jabra eargels fit my ears very well 1 
i hate movies like that 0 
waiter was a jerk 0 
cumbersome design 0 
and if that isnt enough of a mess of a movie for you the picture is also marred with a constant use of studio sets and indoor exteriors 0 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
this does not fit the palm tungsten e2 and it broke the first time i tried to plug it in 0 
i could not understand what kind of idiot would produce this mess in the first place not to mention several season 0 
they do not last forever but is not overly expensive to replaceeasy to operate and the sound is much better than others i have tried 1 
its too bad the food is so damn generic 0 
crisp and clear 1 
of course the footage from the 70s was grainy but that only enhanced the film 1 
the hockey scenes are terrible defensemen playing like theyre 5 years old goalies diving at shots that are 10 feet wide of the net etc 0 
must have been an off night at this place 0 
either way it sucks 0 
it was delicious 1 
this place should honestly be blown up 0 
it looses connection to the phone even when it is within a couple feet between the two 0 
then i had to continue pairing it periodically since it somehow kept dropping 0 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
their steaks are 100 recommended 1 
i great reception all the time 1 
i mean really how do you get so famous for your fish and chips when its so terrible 0 
say bye bye to your tip lady 0 
i have never had such bland food which surprised me considering the article we read focused so much on their spices and flavor 0 
verizons bills however are difficult to understand even though their pricing plans are simple 0 
i will never forget it now 1 
its so bad its actually worth seeing just for that reason 0 
i would avoid this place if you are staying in the mirage 0 
youll love how thin it is 1 
ill be looking for a new earpiece 0 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
great software for motorolas 1 
if you plan to use this in a car forget about it 0 
when my order arrived one of the gyros was missing 0 
rude inconsiderate management 0 
uncomfortable in the ear dont use with lg vx9900 env 0 
excellent product 1 
seems like a good quick place to grab a bite of some familiar pub food but do yourself a favor and look elsewhere 0 
people couldnt hear me talk and i had to pull out the earphone and talk on the phone 0 
best headset ever 1 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
worst customer service ever 0 
some may say this buffet is pricey but i think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot 1 
service sucks 0 
we were promptly greeted and seated 1 
i kept looking at the time and it had soon become 35 minutes yet still no food 0 
the movie showed a lot of florida at its best made it look very appealing 1 
first the bathrooms at this location were dirty seat covers were not replenished just plain yucky 0 
i have 23 bars on my cell phone when i am home but you cant not hear anything 0 
hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in 0 
think it over when you plan to own this onethis sure is the last moto phone for me 0 
essentially you can forget microsofts tech support 0 
some great music and terrific scenery 1 
schrader has made a resume full of lousy amateurish films 0 
beware this is not a trashy cult movie this is trash period 0 
it felt too light and tinny 0 
does not fit 0 
my girlfriends veal was very bad 0 
made very sturdy 1 
frozen pucks of disgust with some of the worst people behind the register 0 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
so i am here to warn youdo not rent this movie it is the dumbest thing you have never seen 0 
good audio quality 1 
i purcashed this for the car charger and it does not work 0 
my 5year old nokia 2160 from tracfone holds the charge a lot better than this 0 
that being said for a phone the camera is very nice many cool effects to play with and video is decent as well 1 
my husband and i ate lunch here and were very disappointed with the food and service 0 
i bought this battery with a coupon from amazon and im very happy with my purchase 1 
this company charge me a restocking fee and still not given me my refund back 0 
lucy bell is so much higher than this crap and for her to sink this low is quite depressing 0 
is pretty funny 1 
i exchanged the sony ericson z500a for this and im pretty happy with that decision 1 
then theres the plot holes 0 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
anne heche was utterly convincing 1 
great phone 1 
the shrimp tender and moist 1 
end of days is one of the worst bigbudget action movies ive ever seen 0 
highly recommend for any one who has a blue tooth phone 1 
conclusion very filling meals 1 
for a product that costs as much as this one does i expect it to work far better and with greater ease than this thing does 0 
really bad 0 
for the price on amazon it is an excellent product which i would highly recommend 1 
unfortunately the ability to actually know you are receiving a call is a rather important feature and this phone is pitiful in that respect 0 
how can you call yourself a steakhouse if you cant properly cook a steak i dont understand 0 
the story line is totally predictable 0 
their daily specials are always a hit with my group 1 
see both films if you can 1 
i recently had problems where i could not stay connected for more than 10 minutes before being disconnected 0 
what a great double cheeseburger 1 
cheap but hey it works was pleasantly suprised given the low cost of this item 1 
there are massive levels massive unlockable characters its just a massive game 1 
i believe the screenwriter did a good job of tying up the loose ends 1 
not my thing 0 
it lasts less than 3o minutes if i actually try to use the phonemy wife has the same phone with the same problem 0 
camerawork again bad 0 
talk about useless customer service 0 
it was way over fried 0 
i guess that nobody at the network that aired this dribble watched it before putting it on 0 
doesnt work 0 
food was below average 0 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
really really good rice all the time 1 
the waitress and manager are so friendly 1 
this place is amazing 1 
i would highly recommend this product 1 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
that company is a joke 0 
everything captain howdy says is either laughable or just plain stupid 0 
the worst phone from samsungcrap this crappy samsung e715 is the worst i have ever seeen 0 
tried to go here for lunch and it was a madhouse 0 
penne vodka excellent 1 
of course the acting is blah 0 
it is so small and you dont even realize that it is there after a while of getting used to it 1 
very tough and very short on flavor 0 
i love it 1 
thus far have only visited twice and the food was absolutely delicious each time 1 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
the movie has almost no action scenes in it and very little comedy 0 
bland and flavorless is a good way of describing the barely tepid meat 0 
never been to hard rock casino before will never ever step forward in it again 0 
if she had not rolled the eyes we may have stayed not sure if we will go back and try it again 0 
im in az all the time and now have my new spot 1 
definitely will come back here again 1 
in short dont bother with this movie 0 
after trying many many handsfree gadgets this is the one that finally works well 1 
its just lame 0 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
his losing his marbles so early in the proceedings is totally implausible and unconvincing 0 
the movie in movie situations in the beginning and through the game that is played with her by the acting coach are fascinating 1 
the menu is always changing food quality is going down service is extremely slow 0 
does not fit 0 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
this is a good joint 1 
they could serve it with just the vinaigrette and it may make for a better overall dish but it was still very good 1 
but i definitely would not eat here again 0 
overall i like there food and the service 1 
but i dont like it 0 
and considering the two of us left there very full and happy for about 20 you just cant go wrong 1 
what a mistake that was 0 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
furthermore you cant even find hours of operation on the website 0 
there is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again 0 
doesnt hold charge 0 
the only thing really worth watching was the scenery and the house because it is beautiful 1 
i received my orders well within the shipping timeframe everything was in good working order and overall i am very excited to have this source 1 
i got the car charger and not even after a week the charger was brokeni went to plug it in and it started smoking 0 
long whiny and pointless 0 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
its kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly its embarrassing how childlike the company is 0 
these are fabulous 1 
the potatoes were great and so was the biscuit 1 
beware this is not a trashy cult movie this is trash period 0 
it was that loudglad to say that the plantronics 510 maintains a flawless connection to my cell and with no static during normal use 1 
avoid at all costs 0 
the staff is always super friendly and helpful which is especially cool when you bring two small boys and a baby 1 
i recently had problems where i could not stay connected for more than 10 minutes before being disconnected 0 
and generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode 0 
both of the egg rolls were fantastic 1 
the food is about on par with dennys which is to say not good at all 0 
owners are really great people 1 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
i was left shattered from the experience of watching this film and i took a good two hours to fully recover 0 
all of the main players are mesmerising 1 
i have seen many movies starring jaclyn smith but my god this was one of her best though it came out 12 years ago 1 
it does everything the description said it would 1 
i am so tired of clichés that is just lazy writing and here they come in thick and fast 0 
worthless product 0 
it is worth the drive 1 
this is an extraordinary film 1 
i bought this to use with my kindle fire and absolutely loved it 1 
what a disappointment 0 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
loved the casting of jimmy buffet as the science teacher 1 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
i have to use the smallest earpieces provided but it stays on pretty well 1 
what a mistake 0 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
is it possible for a movie to get any worse than this 0 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
nice case feels good in your hands 1 
this place is pretty good nice little vibe in the restaurant 1 
its this pandering to the audience that sabotages most of his films 0 
my sashimi was poor quality being soggy and tasteless 0 
the films dialogue is natural real to life 1 
we would recommend these to others 1 
jamie foxx absolutely is ray charles 1 
this is high adventure at its best 1 
i was particularly pleased with the acting ability of dwight schultz 1 
but other than that the movie seemed to drag and the heroes didnt really work for their freedom 0 
what on earth is irons doing in this film 0 
you cant beat the price on these 1 
i like steiners because its dark and it feels like a bar 1 
nine out of ten for a truly lovely film 1 
after the first charge kept going dead after 12 minutes 0 
the design might be ergonomic in theory but i could not stand having these in my ear 0 
my friend loved the salmon tartar 1 
i have eaten here multiple times and each time the food was delicious 1 
its extremely slow and takes forever to do anything with it 0 
im pleased 1 
i literally vomited while watching this film 0 
this is a beautiful phone 1 
verizon tech support walked my through a few procedures none of which worked and i ended up having to do a hard reset wiping out all my data 0 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
in my house i was getting dropped coverage upstairs and no coverage in my basement 0 
unfortunately cover girl is an example of how hollywood used to exploit women for financial gain 0 
the atmosphere was great with a lovely duo of violinists playing songs we requested 1 
the owner used to work at nobu so this place is really similar for half the price 1 
the basic premise is wasted since it is sidelined by the inexplicable focus on the documentary crew 0 
not much seafood and like 5 strings of pasta at the bottom 0 
waste of 13 bucks 0 
an italian reviewer called this a small great film and thats right 1 
sorry i will not be getting food from here anytime soon 0 
bad script bad direction and horrible acting make this one plain bad 0 
the folks at otto always make us feel so welcome and special 1 
restored my phone to like new performance 1 
love it great armband 1 
after 20 minutes wait i got a table 0 
avoid at all cost 0 
disappointment i hate anything that goes in my ear 0 
the folks at otto always make us feel so welcome and special 1 
my sashimi was poor quality being soggy and tasteless 0 
best ive found so far ive tried 2 other bluetooths and this one has the best quality for both me and the listener as well as ease of using 1 
my drink was never empty and he made some really great menu suggestions 1 
you need at least 3 mins to get to your phone book from the time you first turn on the phonebattery life is short 0 
excellent starter wireless headset 0 
i just saw this film and i recommend it 1 
ive had better not only from dedicated boba tea spots but even from jenni pho 0 
as an earlier review noted plug in this charger and nothing happens 0 
he was very impressed when going from the original battery to the extended battery 1 
exceptionally bad 0 
what a disappointment 0 
the worst phone from samsungcrap this crappy samsung e715 is the worst i have ever seeen 0 
not loud enough and doesnt turn on like it should 0 
but then they came back cold 0 
director paul matthews who also wrotedirected the weak 1995 monster movie grim clearly doesnt know how to pace his films 0 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
service is quick and even to go orders are just like we like it 1 
excellent product for the price 1 
i love lane but ive never seen her in a movie this lousy 0 
the burrittos blah 0 
tasted like dirt 0 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
this place is not worth your time let alone vegas 0 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
the only suspense i was feeling was the frustration at just how retarded the girls were 0 
there is no plot or storyline 0 
i am so pleased to know such a modern day genius is out there letting is passion for art drive him and taking us as an audience with him 1 
i recommend this for everyone who loves film movies anythinga work of art 1 
i give it 2 thumbs down 0 
good value works fine power via usb car or wall outlet 1 
the movie is full of wonderful dancing hence the title 1 
we loved the biscuits 1 
also great directing and photography 1 
the camera although rated at an impressive 13 megapixels renders images that fall well below expectations of such a relatively high resolution 0 
the best part about nurse betty is its unpredictability 1 
the fries were great too 1 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
you could drive a semi truck into these holes 0 
food was really boring 0 
yes i am simplifying things here for the sake of brevity for this really is at the core of the problems with this film it has too much going on without any real fulfilling explanation 0 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
everything about this film is simply incredible 1 
chinese forgeries abound 0 
best headset ever 1 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
highly recommend for any one who has a blue tooth phone 1 
top line dont waste your time and money on this one its as bad as it comes 0 
there are the usual hitchcock logic flaws 0 
favorite place in town for shawarrrrrrma 1 
price is good too 1 
it never condescends all the characters have good genuine hearts and believable problems 1 
the instructions didnt explain that a microphone jack could be used 0 
if you hate earbugs avoid this phone by all means 0 
battery has no life 0 
it is perfect for a sitdown family meal or get together with a few friends 1 
i also didnt like the on button it felt like it would crack with use 0 
every thing on phone work perfectly she like it 1 
first the bathrooms at this location were dirty seat covers were not replenished just plain yucky 0 
it never condescends all the characters have good genuine hearts and believable problems 1 
i recommend igo to anyone with different brand cell phonesmp3 players in the family 1 
we literally sat there for 20 minutes with no one asking to take our order 0 
worth every penny 1 
worse theres an incredibly weak subplot thrown in that follows a little band of latterday mansonites as they go after a reporter whos working on a story on the anniversary of the killings 0 
its uncomfortable and the sound quality is quite poor compared with the phone razr or with my previous wired headset that plugged into an lg 0 
10 out of 10 for both the movie and trilogy 1 
its a piece of crap 0 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
they will customize your order any way youd like my usual is eggplant with green bean stir fry love it 1 
definitely will come back here again 1 
i saw this film over christmas and what a great film it was 1 
i still maintain that monkeys shouldnt make headphones we just obviously dont share enough dna to copy the design over to humans 0 
it wasnt busy either also the building was freezing cold 0 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
no ear loop needed its tiny and the sound is great 1 
i mean in a realistic world she would never have gotten into that ballet repertory the whole thing was quite pathetic 0 
i only hear garbage for audio 0 
leopard print is wonderfully wild 1 
excellent sound quality 1 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
reaching for the bottom row is uncomfortable and the send and end keys are not where i expect them to be3 0 
one of my favorite purchases ever 1 
will not be back 0 
this film has no redeeming features 0 
the sweet potato tots were good but the onion rings were perfection or as close as i have had 1 
i consider this theft 0 
terrible my car will not accept this cassette 0 
there is a totally unnecessary trainroller coaster scene 0 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
this is high adventure at its best 1 
really bad 0 
the steak and the shrimp are in my opinion the best entrees at gc 1 
yes its that bad 0 
the best scene in the movie was when gerardo is trying to find a song that keeps running through his head 1 
worked great 1 
the only suspense i was feeling was the frustration at just how retarded the girls were 0 
similarly the delivery man did not say a word of apology when our food was 45 minutes late 0 
you need two hands to operate the screenthis software interface is decade old and cannot compete with new software designs 0 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
the poor actors 0 
also the fries are without a doubt the worst fries ive ever had 0 
waiter was a jerk 0 
this was a poor remake of my best friends wedding 0 
please dont waste your money 0 
the seller is very understanding and patient i would definitely buy from them again 1 
very disappointed in accessoryone 0 
the movie has almost no action scenes in it and very little comedy 0 
case was more or less an extra that i originally put on but later discarded because it scratched my ear 0 
never again will i be dining at this place 0 
i have eaten here multiple times and each time the food was delicious 1 
crust is not good 0 
everything is appalling 0 
again no plot at all 0 
unfortunately it did not work 0 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
i swung in to give them a try but was deeply disappointed 0 
the food was delicious our bartender was attentive and personable and we got a great deal 1 
even the squibs look awful 0 
setup went very smoothly 1 
overall i wasnt very impressed with noca 0 
when it opens the battery connection is broken and the device is turned off 0 
not only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic but it also managed to give away the entire movie and im not exaggerating every moment every plot point every joke is told in the trailer 0 
the most annoying thing about cover girl is the way in which rita hayworth is put up on a pedestal 0 
i was not happy with this item 0 
the nokia ca42 usb cable did not work with my phone 0 
however bt headsets are currently not good for real time games like firstperson shooters since the audio delay messes me up 0 
greatno problems at all 1 
great sound and service 1 
god and i can never get that 90 minutes back 0 
it shouldnt take 30 min for pancakes and eggs 0 
a must study for anyone interested in the worst sins of industrial design 0 
try them in the airport to experience some tasty food and speedy friendly service 1 
the cashier had no care what so ever on what i had to say it still ended up being wayyy overpriced 0 
i ate there twice on my last visit and especially enjoyed the salmon salad 1 
the best phone in market 1 
nice case feels good in your hands 1 
the grilled chicken was so tender and yellow from the saffron seasoning 1 
this is a simple little phone to use but the breakage is unacceptible 0 
i wont say any more i dont like spoilers so i dont want to be one but i believe this film is worth your time 1 
the chicken i got was definitely reheated and was only ok the wedges were cold and soggy 0 
there are massive levels massive unlockable characters its just a massive game 1 
they are so cool 1 
i recommend igo to anyone with different brand cell phonesmp3 players in the family 1 
the turkey and roast beef were bland 0 
logitech bluetooth headset is a 10 1 
youll love it 1 
you never know if you pushed it hard enough or the right number of times for the function you want or not 0 
nice quality build unlike some cheap s out there 1 
this is not moviemaking 0 
i could barely stomach the meal but didnt complain because it was a business lunch 0 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
the sangria was about half of a glass wine full and was 12 ridiculous 0 
enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film 1 
i loved it it was really scary 1 
the volume for the ringer is real good you have choices how loud 1 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
i had the mac salad and it was pretty bland so i will not be getting that again 0 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
it was an inexpensive piece but i would still have expected better quality 0 
this hole in the wall has great mexican street tacos and friendly staff 1 
this one works and was priced right 1 
the things that the four kids get themselves into is absolutely hilarious to watch 1 
the use of slowmotion needlessly repeats itself throughout the movie but is well backed up by bad acting and bad is a kind word here no continuity scenes that are thrown in for no reason whatsoever vehicles that looked like they were made from a corn flakes box and a directorial style that bordered on stupidity 0 
this is hands down the best phone ive ever had 1 
the warm beer didnt help 0 
its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
great food and great service in a clean and friendly setting 1 
sounds good reasonably priced and effective its that simple 1 
ive had better not only from dedicated boba tea spots but even from jenni pho 0 
what this film lacks is a convincing script 0 
the good cinematography also makes her and monica bellucci look very beautiful 1 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
bad script bad direction and horrible acting make this one plain bad 0 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
this is definitely one of the better documentaries i have seen looking at family relationships and marriage 1 
i tried talking real loud but shouting on the telephone gets old and i was still told it wasnt great 0 
kind of flops around 0 
but i thought his acting was skilled 1 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
characters are onedimensional even the good guys and especially the bad guys 0 
great food and service huge portions and they give a military discount 1 
still waiting im sure this item would work well if i ever recieve it 0 
the pizza tasted old super chewy in not a good way 0 
this is was due to the fact that it took 20 minutes to be acknowledged then another 35 minutes to get our foodand they kept forgetting things 0 
i found this place by accident and i could not be happier 1 
you can even take self portraits with the outside exterior display very cool 1 
the price was very good and with the free shipping and all it was a good purchase 1 
the hockey scenes are terrible defensemen playing like theyre 5 years old goalies diving at shots that are 10 feet wide of the net etc 0 
best tacos in town by far 1 
overall the film is interesting and thoughtprovoking 1 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
i rate this movie 910 1 
see it with your kids if you have a chanceit will open up some amazing dialog about how far race relations have come in the last 50 years 1 
it was a great phone 1 
the turkey and roast beef were bland 0 
i did not bother contacting the company for few dollar product but i learned the lesson that i should not have bought this form online anyway 0 
very much disappointed with this company 0 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
the handsfree part works fine but then the car tries to download the address book and the treo rebootsoverall i still rate this device high 1 
i thought errol flynn was brilliant as custer and has since become my favourite actor 1 
iam very pleased with my purchase 1 
i can say that the desserts were yummy 1 
my brother in law who works at the mall ate here same day and guess what he was sick all night too 0 
the file browser offers all the options that one needshandsfree is great 1 
the story is beyond stupid 0 
very windresistant 1 
does not fit 0 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
their chow mein is so good 1 
overall i like there food and the service 1 
they do not care about the consumer one bit 0 
the lines the cuts the audio everything is wrong 0 
they are so cool 1 
perfect for someone me who only likes beer ice cold or in this case even colder 1 
this is a witty and delightful adaptation of the dr seuss book brilliantly animated by upas finest and thoroughly deserving of its academy award 1 
they brought a fresh batch of fries and i was thinking yay something warm but no 0 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
this phone is pretty sturdy and ive never had any large problems with it 1 
i thought errol flynn was brilliant as custer and has since become my favourite actor 1 
the only suspense i was feeling was the frustration at just how retarded the girls were 0 
i immediately said i wanted to talk to the manager but i did not want to talk to the guy who was doing shots of fireball behind the bar 0 
this gets a 1 out of 10 simply because theres nothing lower 0 
the design is very odd as the ear clip is not very comfortable at all 0 
its really easy 1 
the soundtrack wasnt terrible either 1 
for the price this was a great deal 1 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
great phone 1 
cant store anything but phone numbers to sim 0 
the roast beef sandwich tasted really good 1 
the movie is full of wonderful dancing hence the title 1 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
lucy bell is so much higher than this crap and for her to sink this low is quite depressing 0 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
but this movie is definitely a below average rent 0 
the vanilla ice cream was creamy and smooth while the profiterole choux pastry was fresh enough 1 
avoid this one if you can 0 
i dont each much pasta but i love the homemade hand made pastas and thin pizzas here 1 
i swung in to give them a try but was deeply disappointed 0 
barney is definitely super de duper 1 
the service was terrible food was mediocre 0 
have been going since 2007 and every meal has been awesome 1 
in particular the relationship between the bakery assistant and the waitress just didnt work for me at all 0 
the movie was so boring that i sometimes found myself occupied peaking in the paper instead of watching never happened during a columbo movie before 0 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
all the bread is made inhouse 1 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
see it with your kids if you have a chanceit will open up some amazing dialog about how far race relations have come in the last 50 years 1 
excellent bluetooth headset 1 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
i wish i could enter negative values admins 0 
no complaints 1 
the pairing of the two devices was so easy it barely took a couple minutes before i started making calls with the voice dialing feature 1 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
last time buying from you 0 
but kevin spacey is an excellent verbal tsunami as buddy ackerman  and totally believable because he is a great actor 1 
definitely worth seeing its the sort of thought provoking film that forces you to question your own threshold of loneliness 1 
but its just not funny 0 
while you dont yet hear mickey speak there are tons of sound effects and music throughout the filmsomething we take for granted now but which was a huge crowd pleaser in 1928 1 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
poor quality and service 0 
ill even say it again  this is torture 0 
everyone is treated equally special 1 
the use of slowmotion needlessly repeats itself throughout the movie but is well backed up by bad acting and bad is a kind word here no continuity scenes that are thrown in for no reason whatsoever vehicles that looked like they were made from a corn flakes box and a directorial style that bordered on stupidity 0 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
i must say i have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again 1 
i am so tired of clichés that is just lazy writing and here they come in thick and fast 0 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
the cashier was friendly and even brought the food out to me 1 
def coming back to bowl next time 1 
if i take a picture the battery drops a bar and starts beeping letting me know its dieing 0 
this is was due to the fact that it took 20 minutes to be acknowledged then another 35 minutes to get our foodand they kept forgetting things 0 
the transfers are very good 1 
have been going since 2007 and every meal has been awesome 1 
the phone loads super 1 
comes with a strong light that you can use to light up your camera shots and even flash sos signals seriously 1 
this place is overpriced not consistent with their boba and it really is overpriced 0 
very cheap plastic creaks like an old wooden floor 0 
however this didnt make up for the fact that overall this was a tremendously boring movie 0 
as for the service im a fan because its quick and youre being served by some nice folks 1 
food was great and so was the serivce 1 
delicious nyc bagels good selections of cream cheese real lox with capers even 1 
i was left shattered from the experience of watching this film and i took a good two hours to fully recover 0 
ive never been treated so bad 0 
plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job 1 
its a mediocre miserable hollow laughable and predictable piece of garbage 0 
i consider this theft 0 
you have to hold the phone at a particular angle for the other party to hear you clearly 0 
the staff is great the food is delish and they have an incredible beer selection 1 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
plus its only 8 bucks 1 
so badwellits just bad 0 
the 12 mega pixel camera being a part of a phone is reasonably good7 1 
you have to hold the phone at a particular angle for the other party to hear you clearly 0 
after the disappointing dinner we went elsewhere for dessert 0 
doesnt work 0 
you can even take self portraits with the outside exterior display very cool 1 
but the service was beyond bad 0 
ive only had my bluetooth for a few weeks but i really like it 1 
coming here is like experiencing an underwhelming relationship where both parties cant wait for the other person to ask to break up 0 
this is the place where i first had pho and it was amazing 1 
i bought this battery with a coupon from amazon and im very happy with my purchase 1 
great audio 1 
what i really like there is the crepe station 1 
bland not a liking this place for a number of reasons and i dont want to waste time on bad reviewing ill leave it at that 0 
not a good item it worked for a while then started having problems in my auto reverse tape player 0 
appetite instantly gone 0 
the sound is clear and the people i talk to on it are amazed at the quality too 1 
i understand that its supposed to be a cheap popcorn comedy but that doesnt mean that it has to completely insult our intelligence and have writing so incredibly hackneyed that it borders on offensive 0 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
my only complaint is the standard sound volume is a little low even when turned up to 5of 5 0 
we started with the tuna sashimi which was brownish in color and obviously wasnt fresh 0 
see it 1 
five star plus plus 1 
the cashier was friendly and even brought the food out to me 1 
my husband and i ate lunch here and were very disappointed with the food and service 0 
it works 1 
it is the best charger i have seen on the market yet 1 
the salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop which was perfectly cooked 1 
the ending is so so perfect youll shed a tear 1 
just as good as when i had it more than a year ago 1 
i get absolutely horrible reception in my apartment where with other phones i have not had this problem 0 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
the range is very decent ive been able to roam around my house with the phone in the living room with no receptionsound quality issues 1 
nargile i think you are great 1 
each day of the week they have a different deal and its all so delicious 1 
headset works great was packaged nicely to avoid any damage 1 
it was clear that she had the range and ability to pull off this part 1 
i never come again 0 
the spaghetti is nothing special whatsoever 0 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
the characters are interesting even if a bit predictable 1 
excellent product for the price 1 
conclusion very filling meals 1 
plantronics bluetooth excelent buy 1 
all the pretty pictures in the world cannot make up for a piece of work that is flawed at the core 0 
i had ordered a motorola data cable got a very well finished and working product 1 
it looks very nice 1 
adapter does not provide enough charging current 0 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
this item is fantastic and works perfectly 1 
the service here is fair at best 0 
so there is no way for me to plug it in here in the us unless i go by a converter 0 
the waitress was friendly and happy to accomodate for veganveggie options 1 
there is a totally unnecessary trainroller coaster scene 0 
the best place to go for a tasty bowl of pho 1 
the pancake was also really good and pretty large at that 1 
it is not good 0 
worth every penny 1 
you share general loewenhielms exquisite joy in his partaking of the cailles en sarcophage even though you are just watching a movie but you do wish for just a small sample to savor 1 
this place is pretty good nice little vibe in the restaurant 1 
glad i didnt pay to see it 0 
the food wasnt good 0 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
reception is terrible and full of static 0 
im returning them 0 
for service i give them no stars 0 
this scene is very strong and unpleasant 0 
that company is a joke 0 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
seriously its not worth wasting your or your kids time on 0 
doesnt do the job 0 
honeslty it didnt taste that fresh 0 
if the food isnt bad enough for you then enjoy dealing with the worlds worstannoying drunk people 0 
then the film just dropped the ball 0 
of all the dishes the salmon was the best but all were great 1 
the food was very good 1 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
doesnt hold charge 0 
i ordered the voodoo pasta and it was the first time id had really excellent pasta since going gluten free several years ago 1 
it was quite comfortable in the ear 1 
it was so bad i had lost the heart to finish it 0 
trouble is the writing and directing make it impossible to establish those things that make a movie watchable like character story theme and so on 0 
i was particularly pleased with the acting ability of dwight schultz 1 
we have gotten a lot of compliments on it 1 
i mean really how do you get so famous for your fish and chips when its so terrible 0 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
this is simply the best bluetooth headset for sound quality 1 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
i give it 2 thumbs down 0 
this phone is pretty sturdy and ive never had any large problems with it 1 
server did a great job handling our large rowdy table 1 
the film gives meaning to the phrase never in the history of human conflict has so much been owed by so many to so few 1 
things happen characters personalities change plot twists occur for no real reason other than that script calls for it 0 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
none of it works just dont buy it 0 
nevertheless yet another wonderful film from the great masters stable 1 
this is a great place to eat 1 
walked in and the place smelled like an old grease trap and only 2 others there eating 0 
excellent phone 1 
its a fresh subtle and rather sublime effect 1 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
wont ever go here again 0 
the stories were powerful explorations of the nature of man and of art 1 
its like a bad two hour tv movie 0 
the acting was decidely wooden though no worse than a period universal b movie 0 
the interplay between martin and emilio contains the same wonderful chemistry we saw in wall street with martin and charlie 1 
the food wasnt good 0 
i was left shattered from the experience of watching this film and i took a good two hours to fully recover 0 
being a 90s child i truly enjoyed this show and i can proudly say that i enjoyed it big time and even more than the classical wb cartoons 1 
i had high hopes for this place since the burgers are cooked over a charcoal grill but unfortunately the taste fell flat way flat 0 
my salad had a bland vinegrette on the baby greens and hearts of palm 0 
when my order arrived one of the gyros was missing 0 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
what did bother me was the slow service 0 
prosgood camera very nice pictures also has cool styles like black and white and more 1 
the mic there is a joke and the volume is quite low 0 
so just beware 0 
definitely not worth the 3 i paid 0 
i want to first say our server was great and we had perfect service 1 
in addition to having one of the most lovely songs ever written french cancan also boasts one of the cutest leading ladies ever to grace the screen 1 
do not waste your money here 0 
give this one a look 1 
it has kept up very well 1 
dont buy this product 0 
great place to relax and have an awesome burger and beer 1 
they could serve it with just the vinaigrette and it may make for a better overall dish but it was still very good 1 
its a little geeky but i think thats its sex on toast and it rocks and oozes sex right down to its battery embedded sleek stylish leather case 1 
fantastic earphones 1 
nice solid keyboard 1 
all in all id expected a better consumer experience from motorola 0 
they have a really nice atmosphere 1 
great service and food 1 
this movie totally grates on my nerves 0 
the flair bartenders are absolutely amazing 1 
four stars for the food the guy in the blue shirt for his great vibe still letting us in to eat 1 
his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic 1 
my rating just 3 out of 10 0 
the things that the four kids get themselves into is absolutely hilarious to watch 1 
save your money ive had this item for 11 months now 0 
headset works great was packaged nicely to avoid any damage 1 
loved the casting of jimmy buffet as the science teacher 1 
walked in and the place smelled like an old grease trap and only 2 others there eating 0 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
i go to far too many places and ive never seen any restaurant that serves a 1 egg breakfast especially for 400 0 
do not buy do not buyit sucks 0 
also the area where my unit broke im not too fond of the magnetic strap 0 
great hands free device 1 
not a good bargain 0 
rip off over charge shipping 0 
really pleased with this product so far 1 
five star plus plus 1 
they do not care about the consumer one bit 0 
one more thing i can tolerate political incorrectness very well im all for artistic freedom and suspension of disbelief but the slavic female character was just too much 0 
it was attached to a gas station and that is rarely a good sign 0 
ive only had my bluetooth for a few weeks but i really like it 1 
the memories are murky but i can only say that i enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show 1 
as a sushi lover avoid this place by all means 0 
id say that would be the hardest decision honestly all of ms dishes taste how they are supposed to taste amazing 1 
i definitly recommend 1 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
the art style has the appearance of crayonpencil drawings and is wonderfully colorful and fanciful 1 
thanks good a movie like this was done and released 1 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
the film is well paced understated and one of the best courtroom documentaries ive seen 1 
avoid this one if you can 0 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
highquality chicken on the chicken caesar salad 1 
great pocket pc phone combination 1 
you cant go wrong with any of the food here 1 
so far it has worked like a charm 1 
its uncomfortable and the sound quality is quite poor compared with the phone razr or with my previous wired headset that plugged into an lg 0 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
the atmosphere is modern and hip while maintaining a touch of coziness 1 
this was such an awesome movie that i bought it off of ebay 1 
happy so far 1 
juano hernandez an exceptional actor who played supporting roles in many films of the era is a proud black man who is accused of murdering a white man in the south 1 
it felt like a very gripping intelligent stage play but without the overly theatrical feeling one actually gets from watching people on a stage which plays on everyones terror of a white lie escalating to monstrous consequences 1 
bad purchase 0 
much better than the other ayce sushi place i went to in vegas 1 
beware this is not a trashy cult movie this is trash period 0 
now you know why i gave it a 10 1 
i really like this product over the motorola because it is allot clearer on the ear piece and the mic 1 
iam very pleased with my purchase 1 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
how can you call yourself a steakhouse if you cant properly cook a steak i dont understand 0 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
i have to use the smallest earpieces provided but it stays on pretty well 1 
and sometimes it was so embarrassing that i had to look away 0 
about 30 minutes of footage is wasted to show mediocre elderly actors awkwardly babbling overwrought pseudosatanic gibberish corny enough to make a teen goth blush almost always in olde english and sometimes in latin that may or may not be made up words 0 
overall a great experience 1 
the feel of the dining room was more college cooking course than high class dining and the service was slow at best 0 
i liked the patio and the service was outstanding 1 
only pros large seating area nice bar area great simple drink menu the best brick oven pizza with homemade dough 1 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
worst service to boot but that is the least of their worries 0 
if the food isnt bad enough for you then enjoy dealing with the worlds worstannoying drunk people 0 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
overall i rate this movie a 10 out of a 110 scale 1 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
im surprised this is a good quality car charger and theres not much reviews about it 1 
some may say this buffet is pricey but i think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot 1 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
its just painful 0 
after arguing with verizon regarding the dropped calls we returned the phones after two days 0 
nice ambiance 1 
the salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop which was perfectly cooked 1 
strike 2 who wants to be rushed 0 
a lot of websites have been rating this a very good phone and so do i 1 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
worst phone ever 0 
started watching this but didnt believe in any of the characters 0 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
what a waste 0 
the cow tongue and cheek tacos are amazing 1 
plus it was wellpaced and suited its relatively short run time 1 
the meat was pretty dry i had the sliced brisket and pulled pork 0 
highly recommended a 1 
the basic premise is wasted since it is sidelined by the inexplicable focus on the documentary crew 0 
im not sure what he was trying to do with this film 0 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
the service was great even the manager came and helped with our table 1 
point your finger at any item on the menu order it and you wont be disappointed 1 
i could care less the interior is just beautiful 1 
both great 1 
very funny 1 
this is some seriously good pizza and im an expertconnisseur on the topic 1 
design flaw 0 
no ear loop needed its tiny and the sound is great 1 
disappointed 0 
sooooo good 1 
crash is a depressing little nothing that provokes emotion but teaches you nothing if you already know racism and prejudice are bad things 0 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
its one of the movies i need to see whenever it comes on tvnever mind the fact that i already have it memorized 1 
i used bitpim a free program you can find on the internetto transfer data to the phonethe price of the cable was excellent 1 
it plays louder than any other speaker of this size the price is so low that most would think the quality is lacking however its not 1 
small sleek impressive looking practical setup with ample storage in place 1 
total waste of time 0 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
it is the best charger i have seen on the market yet 1 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
the film deserves strong kudos for taking this stand for having exceptional acting from its mostly lesserknown cast and for the superintelligent script that doesnt insult the audience or take the easy way out when it comes to white racism 1 
if good intentions made a film great then this film might be one of the greatest films ever made 1 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
and generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode 0 
lets start with all the problemsthe acting especially from the lead professor was very very bad 0 
disappointing experience 0 
dont buy this product 0 
i wouldnt return 0 
but whatever it was that cost them so much it didnt translate to quality thats for sure 0 
for 40 bucks a head i really expect better food 0 
worst phone ever 0 
not good when wearing a hat or sunglasses 0 
this game rocks 1 
fast service 1 
im glad the film didnt go for the most obvious choice as a lesser film certainly would have 1 
and i just love the colors 1 
the microphone also works well but according to people i have called it applifies everything 1 
it was absolutely amazing 1 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
good servicecheck 1 
their daily specials are always a hit with my group 1 
i had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get some relief 0 
there are many continuity errors one other user commented on different cars in the garage joes glassesthe one that got to me the most was the fact joes facial hair configuration seemed to change from scene to scene 0 
arrived quickly and much less expensive than others being sold 1 
one of the worst shows of all time 0 
almost everyone involved must be return to school acting is utterly predictable and bad script is pile of garbage all round 0 
the construction of the headsets is poor 0 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
the malta settings are as dry and as barren as the dialogue 0 
things happen characters personalities change plot twists occur for no real reason other than that script calls for it 0 
its kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly its embarrassing how childlike the company is 0 
the jerky camera movements were also annoying 0 
plus it was wellpaced and suited its relatively short run time 1 
the lines the cuts the audio everything is wrong 0 
soyo technology sucks 0 
while you dont yet hear mickey speak there are tons of sound effects and music throughout the filmsomething we take for granted now but which was a huge crowd pleaser in 1928 1 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
mishima is extremely uninteresting 0 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
great brunch spot 1 
nothing special 0 
we are so glad we found this place 1 
ordered an appetizer and took 40 minutes and then the pizza another 10 minutes 0 
enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film 1 
at any rate this film stinks its not funny and fulci should have stayed with giallo and supernatural zombie movies 0 
the phone was unusable and was not new 0 
the scenery that the two daughters paint and photograph are beautiful 1 
service was fantastic 1 
they will customize your order any way youd like my usual is eggplant with green bean stir fry love it 1 
i dont think ill be running back to carlys anytime soon for food 0 
this phone might well be the worst ive ever had in any brand 0 
i wasted my little money with this earpiece 0 
but the movie makes a lot of serious mistakes 0 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
of all the dishes the salmon was the best but all were great 1 
blue ant is easy to use 1 
any ring toneoverall good phone to buy 1 
it was a waste of my money 0 
also great directing and photography 1 
though the wind and the lion is told largely through the eyes of the son every member of the family can identify with one of the characters whether it be sean connerys noble brigand candace bergens feisty heroine john hustons wily john hay or steve kanalys spiffy radiant ruthless cando lieutenant roosevelts big stick 1 
mic doesnt work 0 
great hands free device 1 
it was too predictable even for a chick flick 0 
the service here is fair at best 0 
does everything it should and more 1 
first of all there are enough racial stereotypes and racial jokes to offend everyone 0 
the design might be ergonomic in theory but i could not stand having these in my ear 0 
the first thing that happened was that the tracking was off 0 
i dont think ive ever gone to a movie and disliked it as much 0 
trouble is the writing and directing make it impossible to establish those things that make a movie watchable like character story theme and so on 0 
best breakfast buffet 1 
a piece of junk that broke after being on my phone for 2 days 0 
good value great food great service 1 
the best part about nurse betty is its unpredictability 1 
seriously flavorful delights folks 1 
they really want to make your experience a good one 1 
it is just the sort of pap that is screened in the afternoon to punish the unemployed for not having jobs 0 
just what i wanted 1 
i would give this television series a 10 plus if i could 1 
dont waste your time 0 
it is the best charger i have seen on the market yet 1 
restaurant is always full but never a wait 1 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
top line dont waste your time and money on this one its as bad as it comes 0 
so far so good 1 
i have to use the smallest earpieces provided but it stays on pretty well 1 
bad day or not i have a very low tolerance for rude customer service people it is your job to be nice and polite wash dishes otherwise 0 
the characters are interesting and you really care for them 1 
good price 1 
if you check the directors filmography on this site you will see why this film didnt have a chance 0 
they were goldencrispy and delicious 1 
rip off over charge shipping 0 
great earpiece 1 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
the best scene in the movie was when gerardo is trying to find a song that keeps running through his head 1 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
the only thing i wasnt too crazy about was their guacamole as i dont like it puréed 0 
my breakfast was perpared great with a beautiful presentation of 3 giant slices of toast lightly dusted with powdered sugar 1 
the seasonal fruit was fresh white peach puree 1 
service sucks 0 
we walked away stuffed and happy about our first vegas buffet experience 1 
any grandmother can make a roasted chicken better than this one 0 
this place is not worth your time let alone vegas 0 
verizon tech support walked my through a few procedures none of which worked and i ended up having to do a hard reset wiping out all my data 0 
i have read others reviews here but i havent had any problem with it 1 
its not hard to make a decent hamburger 0 
i would recommend purchasing the jabra jx10 series 2 which works flawlessly with my moto q go figure 1 
predictable but not a bad watch 1 
its pretty surprising that this wonderful film was made in 1949 as hollywood generally had its collective heads in the sand concerning black and white issues at that time 1 
i believe that pitch black was done well 1 
it is zillion times away from reality 0 
for that its worth checking out 1 
cheap but hey it works was pleasantly suprised given the low cost of this item 1 
nine out of ten for a truly lovely film 1 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
sooooo good 1 
it is rare when a filmmaker takes the time to tell a worthy moral tale with care and love that doesnt fall into the trap of being overly syrupy or over indulgent 1 
very good lunch spot 1 
works great when my cat attacked the phone he scratched the protective strip instead of destroying the screen 1 
now we were chosen to be tortured with this disgusting piece of blatant american propaganda 0 
the cg opening sequence in space looked like it could have been created on microsoft slideshow for gods sake 0 
im in az all the time and now have my new spot 1 
i was very disappointed 0 
it always cuts out and makes a beep beep beep sound then says signal failed 0 
good servicecheck 1 
great product 1 
speaking of the music it is unbearably predictably and kitchy 0 
seafood was limited to boiled shrimp and crab legs but the crab legs definitely did not taste fresh 0 
we had 7 at our table and the service was pretty fast 1 
definitely worth seeing its the sort of thought provoking film that forces you to question your own threshold of loneliness 1 
this is an excellent film 1 
im so happy to be here 1 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
i didnt know pulled pork could be soooo delicious 1 
product is exactly as described 1 
nice headset priced right 1 
anne heche was utterly convincing 1 
server did a great job handling our large rowdy table 1 
this place is pretty good nice little vibe in the restaurant 1 
i purchased this and within 2 days it was no longer working 0 
i ate there twice on my last visit and especially enjoyed the salmon salad 1 
this does not fit the palm tungsten e2 and it broke the first time i tried to plug it in 0 
even worse than ticker 0 
battery has no life 0 
the acting was bad the dialogs were extremely shallow and insincere 0 
i guess maybe we went on an off night but it was disgraceful 0 
the worst was the salmon sashimi 0 
how can you call yourself a steakhouse if you cant properly cook a steak i dont understand 0 
the service here is fair at best 0 
this is probably one of the least effective and utterly unoriginal films i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
the han nan chicken was also very tasty 1 
battery is holding up well 1 
the chips and sals a here is amazing 1 
this is the phone to get for 2005 i just bought my s710a and all i can say is wow 1 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
these are certainly very comfortable and functionality is decent 1 
this pair of headphones is the worst that i have ever had soundwise 0 
buyerbe very careful 0 
favorite place in town for shawarrrrrrma 1 
it didnt charge for me 0 
echo problemvery unsatisfactory 0 
your servers suck wait correction our server heimer sucked 0 
there is really nothing for me at postinos hope your experience is better 0 
better than expected 1 
cool phone 1 
i was very disappointed in the movie 0 
favorite place in town for shawarrrrrrma 1 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
in short dont bother with this movie 0 
this battery is an excellent bargain 1 
each day of the week they have a different deal and its all so delicious 1 
in fact i liked it better than interview with a vampire and i liked this lestat stuart townsend better than cruises attempt 1 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
the croutons also taste homemade which is an extra plus 1 
by the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant i was bored and didnt care what happened next and so i switched off 0 
left very frustrated 0 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
food is way overpriced and portions are fucking small 0 
it wasnt busy either also the building was freezing cold 0 
i am going to have to be the first to negatively review this product 0 
not much flavor to them and very poorly constructed 0 
that was funny 1 
the music in the film is really nice too 1 
john wayne did an incredible job for being so young in the movie industry 1 
krussel always good 1 
i tried the cape cod ravoli chickenwith cranberrymmmm 1 
the jerky camera movements were also annoying 0 
i felt insulted and disrespected how could you talk and judge another human being like that 0 
crash is a depressing little nothing that provokes emotion but teaches you nothing if you already know racism and prejudice are bad things 0 
a truly truly bad film 0 
i will not return 0 
the entire audience applauded at the conclusion of the film 1 
my sashimi was poor quality being soggy and tasteless 0 
i had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get some relief 0 
the last 15 minutes of movie are also not bad as well 1 
it had some average acting from the main person and it was a low budget as you clearly can see 0 
strike 2 who wants to be rushed 0 
hell no will i go back 0 
this film tries to be a serious and sophisticated thrillerhorror flick and it fails miserably 0 
this movie is bad 0 
best ive found so far ive tried 2 other bluetooths and this one has the best quality for both me and the listener as well as ease of using 1 
great product 1 
these are the central themes of the film and they are handled ineptly stereotypically and with no depth of imagination 0 
good audio quality 1 
i dont know exactly what it is about this movie but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our familys memories 1 
victor mclaglen was even bad and brian donlevy was almost unrecognizable 0 
good price 1 
they keep getting better and better this is my third one and ive had numerous palms too 1 
i especially love the long battery life 1 
while you dont yet hear mickey speak there are tons of sound effects and music throughout the filmsomething we take for granted now but which was a huge crowd pleaser in 1928 1 
yes its that bad 0 
see it 1 
im glad the film didnt go for the most obvious choice as a lesser film certainly would have 1 
main thing i didnt enjoy is that the crowd is of older crowd around mid 30s and up 0 
probably never coming back and wouldnt recommend it 0 
its very slow 0 
excellent sound quality 1 
the food is good 1 
i knew when i saw the film that more great things were to come from this gifted actor 1 
insults profound deuchebaggery and had to go outside for a smoke break while serving just to solidify it 0 
poor construction 0 
i keep watching it over and over 1 
it doesnt work in europe or asia 0 
this was a poor remake of my best friends wedding 0 
not enough volume 0 
lately they have been extremely nice and helpful on the phone 1 
saggy floppy piece of junk 0 
my only complaint is the standard sound volume is a little low even when turned up to 5of 5 0 
i cant wait to go back 1 
the food is about on par with dennys which is to say not good at all 0 
overall a great experience 1 
in particular the relationship between the bakery assistant and the waitress just didnt work for me at all 0 
cool phone 1 
both films are terrible but to the credit of the 1986 version it was watchable 0 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
last night was my second time dining here and i was so happy i decided to go back 1 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
the only downside is the service 0 
my headset works just peachykeen 1 
on three different occasions i asked for well done or medium well and all three times i got the bloodiest piece of meat on my plate 0 
not good for the money 0 
the dialogue is composed of things that make little sense 0 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
this is simply the best bluetooth headset for sound quality 1 
both of the egg rolls were fantastic 1 
worst foodservice ive had in a while 0 
the only downside is the service 0 
what a waste 0 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
service is quick and even to go orders are just like we like it 1 
in addition to having one of the most lovely songs ever written french cancan also boasts one of the cutest leading ladies ever to grace the screen 1 
by this time our side of the restaurant was almost empty so there was no excuse 0 
things that went wrong they burned the saganaki 0 
its very slow 0 
great software for motorolas 1 
eew this location needs a complete overhaul 0 
the movie was so boring that i sometimes found myself occupied peaking in the paper instead of watching never happened during a columbo movie before 0 
this movie is a good and humorous comment on life in 2006 1 
their chow mein is so good 1 
it is simple to use and i like it 1 
the seller is very understanding and patient i would definitely buy from them again 1 
service was very prompt 1 
the real disappointment was our waiter 0 
verizon tech support walked my through a few procedures none of which worked and i ended up having to do a hard reset wiping out all my data 0 
that just screams legit in my booksomethats also pretty rare here in vegas 1 
there is nothing authentic about this place 0 
disappointing experience 0 
my rating just 3 out of 10 0 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
i cant tell you how disappointed i was 0 
this film tries to be a serious and sophisticated thrillerhorror flick and it fails miserably 0 
great food 1 
the goat taco didnt skimp on the meat and wow what flavor 1 
very disappointed 0 
anne heche was utterly convincing 1 
victor mclaglen was even bad and brian donlevy was almost unrecognizable 0 
i gave it 5 stars because of the sound quality 1 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
this is an excellent tool especially when paired with your phones autoanswer 1 
the service here is fair at best 0 
it is a joy to use 1 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
i paid the bill but did not tip because i felt the server did a terrible job 0 
the han nan chicken was also very tasty 1 
otherwise dont even waste your time on this 0 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
its very attractive and appears to be of good quality 1 
the reception is excellent 1 
would not reccommend 0 
i have tried these cables with my computer and my ipod and it works just fine 1 
they dropped more than the ball 0 
this place is overpriced not consistent with their boba and it really is overpriced 0 
there are many continuity errors one other user commented on different cars in the garage joes glassesthe one that got to me the most was the fact joes facial hair configuration seemed to change from scene to scene 0 
the pan cakes everyone are raving about taste like a sugary disaster tailored to the palate of a six year old 0 
a standout scene 1 
poorly contstruct hinge 0 
it was either too cold not enough flavor or just bad 0 
fantastic service here 1 
beautiful styling though 1 
shes poised and amazing 1 
go rent it 1 
dont bother go to the store 0 
a piece of junk that broke after being on my phone for 2 days 0 
it defeats the purpose of a bluetooth headset 0 
ill be looking for a new earpiece 0 
friends pasta also bad he barely touched it 0 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
works as described 1 
its like a bad two hour tv movie 0 
i really liked that 1 
the management is rude 0 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
the worst was the salmon sashimi 0 
i am so tired of clichés that is just lazy writing and here they come in thick and fast 0 
after one bite i was hooked 1 
i wear glasses and it fits fine with them 1 
works great 1 
its a piece of crap 0 
i love the look and feel of samsung flipphones 1 
bluetooth does not work phone locks up screens just flash up and now it just makes calls randomly while in my pocket locked 0 
we were promptly greeted and seated 1 
the cocktails are all handmade and delicious 1 
it doesnt work in europe or asia 0 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
i ordered the voodoo pasta and it was the first time id had really excellent pasta since going gluten free several years ago 1 
the noise shield is incrediable 1 
these were so good we ordered them twice 1 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
gets the job done 1 
disappointing experience 0 
this place is not worth your time let alone vegas 0 
my headset works just peachykeen 1 
comfortable in my hand 1 
the vanilla ice cream was creamy and smooth while the profiterole choux pastry was fresh enough 1 
they made this case too small and is very difficult to install 0 
the best electronics of the available fm transmitters 1 
try them in the airport to experience some tasty food and speedy friendly service 1 
one of the most disappointing aspects is the lack of notable gore 0 
best tater tots in the southwest 1 
poor sound quality 0 
horrible horrible protector 0 
the construction of the headsets is poor 0 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
what a piece of junk i lose more calls on this phone 0 
down the drain because of a weak snap 0 
i loved it it was really scary 1 
perabo has a nice energy level and is obviously very comfortable in front of a camera 1 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
no additional ear gels provided and no instructions whatsoever 0 
one of the worst shows of all time 0 
this place is overpriced not consistent with their boba and it really is overpriced 0 
the show would begin with smart ass ed comments to each other that would be totally off the wall and uncalled for 0 
w810i is just superb 1 
i am so pleased to know such a modern day genius is out there letting is passion for art drive him and taking us as an audience with him 1 
this is a beautiful phone 1 
magical help 1 
the shower area is outside so you can only rinse not take a full shower unless you dont mind being nude for everyone to see 0 
motorola finally got the voice quality of a bluetooth headset right 1 
he also came back to check on us regularly excellent service 1 
the selection was probably the worst ive seen in vegasthere was none 0 
excellent starter wireless headset 0 
brilliant 1 
i ordered this for sony ericsson w810i but i think it only worked once thats when i first used it 0 
i love the ownerchef his one authentic japanese cool dude 1 
rating 010 grade z note the show is so bad that even mother of the cast pull her daughter out of the show 0 
great place to eat reminds me of the little mom and pop shops in the san francisco bay area 1 
the atmosphere was great with a lovely duo of violinists playing songs we requested 1 
my husband said she was very rude did not even apologize for the bad food or anything 0 
this place is horrible and way overpriced 0 
coming here is like experiencing an underwhelming relationship where both parties cant wait for the other person to ask to break up 0 
its a feelgood film and thats how i felt when i came out of the cinema 1 
both rickman and stowe play their roles to the hilt in this tale of a childrens book writer who maybe has written a subversive tract 1 
best tater tots in the southwest 1 
id love to go back 1 
very dissapointing performance 0 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
battery life is real good 1 
worst ever 0 
it dit not work most of the time with my nokia 5320 0 
customer service was terrible 0 
thus far have only visited twice and the food was absolutely delicious each time 1 
i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
four stars for the food the guy in the blue shirt for his great vibe still letting us in to eat 1 
the desserts were a bit strange 0 
not too screamy not to masculine but just right 1 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
everything is appalling 0 
this is a good joint 1 
phone falls out easily 0 
as for the killer dont expect anything original or even remotely frightening 0 
and if that isnt enough of a mess of a movie for you the picture is also marred with a constant use of studio sets and indoor exteriors 0 
the instructions didnt explain that a microphone jack could be used 0 
better than youd expect 1 
not as good as i had hoped 0 
it didnt charge for me 0 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
cheap but hey it works was pleasantly suprised given the low cost of this item 1 
disappointment i hate anything that goes in my ear 0 
then the film just dropped the ball 0 
the food is not tasty at all not to say its real traditional hunan style 0 
i would avoid this place if you are staying in the mirage 0 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
if you havent choked in your own vomit by the end by all the cheap drama and worthless dialogue youve must have bored yourself to death with this waste of time 0 
very well made and fits my surefire gx2 perfectly 1 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
before i go in to why i gave a 1 star rating please know that this was my third time eating at bachi burger before writing a review 0 
i had high hopes for this place since the burgers are cooked over a charcoal grill but unfortunately the taste fell flat way flat 0 
here in the wind and the lion we see a wonderful rendering of americas own imperial age 1 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
dont waste your on this one 0 
poor sound quality 0 
see both films if you can 1 
very disappointed 0 
its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
nice blanket of moz over top but i feel like this was done to cover up the subpar food 1 
i am very impressed with the job that motorola did on the sturdiness of this phone 1 
i really recommend this faceplates since it looks very nice elegant and cool 1 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
definitely worth checking out 1 
what a big waste of time 0 
i have tried these cables with my computer and my ipod and it works just fine 1 
this place is amazing 1 
best ive found so far ive tried 2 other bluetooths and this one has the best quality for both me and the listener as well as ease of using 1 
the decor is nice and the piano music soundtrack is pleasant 1 
great product and price 1 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
i cant use this case because the smell is disgusting 0 
great place to eat reminds me of the little mom and pop shops in the san francisco bay area 1 
the atmosphere is modern and hip while maintaining a touch of coziness 1 
my only problem is i thought the actor playing the villain was a low rent michael ironside 0 
it rocked my world and is certainly a must see for anyone with no social or physical outlets 1 
frozen pucks of disgust with some of the worst people behind the register 0 
this phone is slim and light and the display is beautiful 1 
omg i felt like i had never eaten thai food until this dish 1 
nothing at all to recommend 0 
after trying many many handsfree gadgets this is the one that finally works well 1 
works fine 1 
omg the food was delicioso 1 
nothing new there 0 
this is definitely one of the better documentaries i have seen looking at family relationships and marriage 1 
despite the pans of reviewers i liked this movie 1 
it is just the sort of pap that is screened in the afternoon to punish the unemployed for not having jobs 0 
but its just not funny 0 
weird vibe from owners 0 
the acting as youd expect from this cast is top notch 1 
awesome device 1 
poor sound quality 0 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
i struggle to find anything bad to say about it 1 
i must say i have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again 1 
this is a beautiful phone 1 
there is nothing authentic about this place 0 
the cast of veteran actors are more than just a nostalgia trip 1 
but this movie is definitely a below average rent 0 
useless phone simply deaf 0 
no complaints 1 
also the fries are without a doubt the worst fries ive ever had 0 
good quality 1 
using all earpieces left or right this thing will not stay on my ear 0 
this movie was kind of long in length but i enjoyed every minute of it 1 
waiter was a jerk 0 
pretty piece of junk 0 
brilliant 1 
i literally vomited while watching this film 0 
its too bad the food is so damn generic 0 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
an excellent new restaurant by an experienced frenchman 1 
their monster chicken fried steak and eggs is my all time favorite 1 
i gave it a 10 1 
spend your money elsewhere 0 
much more interesting more action more suspense and less of the unneeded controversy 1 
much more interesting more action more suspense and less of the unneeded controversy 1 
dont go here 0 
leopard print is wonderfully wild 1 
this is a great little item 1 
left very frustrated 0 
the acting sucked 0 
in addition it feels amp looks as if the phone is all lightweight cheap plastic 0 
the acting is terrible and the writing is worse 0 
they have great dinners 1 
ill be looking for a new earpiece 0 
no plot whatsoever 0 
the service here is fair at best 0 
i have purchased these for both family and friends and all enjoy their clarity and ease of use 1 
attempting artiness with black white and clever camera angles the movie disappointed became even more ridiculous as the acting was poor and the plot and lines almost nonexistent 0 
this was one of the worst films i have ever seen 0 
a very good film indeed about great and unconditional love 1 
exactly what i wanted 1 
i love the ringtones because they are so upbeat 1 
oh the charger seems to work fine 1 
not nearly as good looking as the amazon picture makes it look 0 
the classic maine lobster roll was fantastic 1 
i came over from verizon because cingulair has nicer cell phones the first thing i noticed was the really bad service 0 
it has northern humour and positive about the community it represents 1 
a disappointment 0 
i guess i liked the details of his dysfunctionhe was believable 1 
definitely a bargain 1 
i have purchased these for both family and friends and all enjoy their clarity and ease of use 1 
highquality chicken on the chicken caesar salad 1 
ill give this film 10 out of 10 1 
he is one of my favourite directors and one of the most talented directors in the history of cinema 1 
great phone 1 
i waited and waited 0 
we sat another ten minutes and finally gave up and left 0 
i wasnt really impressed with strip steak 0 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
it was also the right balance of war and love 1 
excellent product for the price 1 
so i had to take the battery out of the phone put it all back together and then restart it 0 
horrible phone 0 
i purchased this and within 2 days it was no longer working 0 
love this place hits the spot when i want something healthy but not lacking in quantity or flavor 1 
this is the place where i first had pho and it was amazing 1 
it was a riot to see hugo weaving play a sexobsessed gay real estate salesman who uses his clients houses for his trysts with the flaming darren tom hollander 1 
the performances are not improved by improvisation because the actors now have twice as much to worry about not only whether theyre delivering the line well but whether the line itself is any good 0 
if you stay in vegas you must get breakfast here at least once 1 
however after finally watching this film i realized that not only had i had a closed mind to the brilliance it depicts i also found myself watching it over and over again 1 
nevertheless yet another wonderful film from the great masters stable 1 
this hole in the wall has great mexican street tacos and friendly staff 1 
the songs were the best and the muppets were so hilarious 1 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
definitely not worth the 3 i paid 0 
do not waste your money here 0 
this place is way too overpriced for mediocre food 0 
his losing his marbles so early in the proceedings is totally implausible and unconvincing 0 
razr battery good buy 1 
its also great to see that renowned silent screenwriter frances marion hasnt missed a step going from silent to sound 1 
im glad i found this product on amazon it is hard to find it wasnt high priced 1 
i will not be eating there again 0 
but it does get better reception and clarity than any phone ive had before 1 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
we had fantastic service and were pleased by the atmosphere 1 
freezes frequently4 0 
now you know why i gave it a 10 1 
saggy floppy piece of junk 0 
the holster that arrived did not match the photo in the ad 0 
its kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly its embarrassing how childlike the company is 0 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
the story unfolds in 18th century jutland and the use of period music played on period instruments is just one more fine touch 1 
graphics is far from the best part of the game 0 
total letdown i would much rather just go to the camelback flower shop and cartel coffee 0 
for the price on amazon it is an excellent product which i would highly recommend 1 
gets the job done 1 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
last time buying from you 0 
when i received my pita it was huge it did have a lot of meat in it so thumbs up there 1 
best breakfast buffet 1 
what a great double cheeseburger 1 
things that went wrong they burned the saganaki 0 
the spaghetti is nothing special whatsoever 0 
there is nothing privileged about workingeating there 0 
love the margaritas too 1 
his costars dont fare much better with people like morgan freeman jonah hill and ed helms just wasted 0 
i have never had such bland food which surprised me considering the article we read focused so much on their spices and flavor 0 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
he was terrible 0 
the plot simply rumbles on like a machine desperately depending on the addition of new scenes 0 
it finds my cell phone right away when i enter the car 1 
we are sending it back 0 
great product for the price 1 
i connected my wifes bluetoothmotorola hs850 to my phone and it worked like a charm whether the phone was in my pocket or the case 1 
im not eating here 0 
even worse than ticker 0 
dessert panna cotta was amazing 1 
these are fabulous 1 
you need two hands to operate the screenthis software interface is decade old and cannot compete with new software designs 0 
everyone is treated equally special 1 
but the premise of the film was so ridiculous that the president of the us 0 
i literally vomited while watching this film 0 
that one didnt work either 0 
and the red curry had so much bamboo shoots and wasnt very tasty to me 0 
poor talk time performance 0 
in fact its hard to remember that the part of ray charles is being acted and not played by the man himself 1 
great case and price 1 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
my headset works just peachykeen 1 
overall a great experience 1 
will definitely be back 1 
not good for the money 0 
restored my phone to like new performance 1 
very good phone 1 
the only thing really worth watching was the scenery and the house because it is beautiful 1 
cant upload ringtones from a third party 0 
hayao miyazakis latest and eighth film for studio ghibili gake no ue no ponyo ponyo on the cliff by the sea is a wonderfully fun and imaginative look at childhood 1 
yes its shiny on front side and i love it 1 
the phone gets extremely hot 0 
good food good service 1 
walked in and the place smelled like an old grease trap and only 2 others there eating 0 
the football scenes at the end were perplexing 0 
thanks again to amazon for having the things i need for a good price 1 
very cheap plastic creaks like an old wooden floor 0 
i bought this phone as a replacement for my startac and have regretted it since 0 
this place is way too overpriced for mediocre food 0 
the feel of the dining room was more college cooking course than high class dining and the service was slow at best 0 
never again will i be dining at this place 0 
if you are reading this please dont go there 0 
nice headset priced right 1 
highly unprofessional and rude to a loyal patron 0 
is pretty funny 1 
i waited and waited 0 
from what my dinner companions told meeverything was very fresh with nice texture and taste 1 
the calls drop the phone comes on and off at will the screen goes black and the worst of all it stops ringing intermittently 0 
frozen pucks of disgust with some of the worst people behind the register 0 
the spaghetti is nothing special whatsoever 0 
service is friendly and inviting 1 
light weight i hardly notice it is there 1 
one of the best mexican movies ever and one of the less understood even by mexican themselves no matter how identified the should have felt with it 1 
seems like a good quick place to grab a bite of some familiar pub food but do yourself a favor and look elsewhere 0 
this place has it 1 
dont do it 0 
what should have been a hilarious yummy christmas eve dinner to remember was the biggest fail of the entire trip for us 0 
bacon is hella salty 1 
what a great double cheeseburger 1 
dont do it 0 
the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach 0 
it was so bad i had lost the heart to finish it 0 
excellent phone 1 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
he really didnt seem to want to be hosting his voiceovers were monotonous didnt get involved with the guests 0 
the movie is littered with overt racial slurs towards the black cast members and in return the whites are depicted as morons and boobs 0 
happy so far 1 
the food is about on par with dennys which is to say not good at all 0 
price is good too 1 
and i really did find them funny 1 
their menu is diverse and reasonably priced 1 
i give it 2 thumbs down 0 
seriously its not worth wasting your or your kids time on 0 
i get absolutely horrible reception in my apartment where with other phones i have not had this problem 0 
highly unprofessional and rude to a loyal patron 0 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
it clicks into place in a way that makes you wonder how long that mechanism would last 0 
the cast was great 1 
delicious nyc bagels good selections of cream cheese real lox with capers even 1 
garbo who showed right off the bat that her talents could carry over from the silent era i wanted to see some of her silent work but netflix doesnt seem to be stocking them 1 
this allows the possibility of double booking for the same date and time after the first 0 
the worst phone ive ever had only had it for a few months 0 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
awesome service and food 1 
this place should honestly be blown up 0 
but she is still a bad actress repeating her robotic face moves in each of her pictures 0 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
this is a witty and delightful adaptation of the dr seuss book brilliantly animated by upas finest and thoroughly deserving of its academy award 1 
lange had become a great actress 1 
so far it has worked like a charm 1 
the instruction manual is lacking 0 
worse theres an incredibly weak subplot thrown in that follows a little band of latterday mansonites as they go after a reporter whos working on a story on the anniversary of the killings 0 
only pros large seating area nice bar area great simple drink menu the best brick oven pizza with homemade dough 1 
all in all i can assure you ill be back 1 
my mother and brother had to do thiswhen i saw robert ryan portraying this type of man it was a very good imitation of this type of individual and i was impressed 1 
great earpiece 1 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
worst customer service ever 0 
frozen pucks of disgust with some of the worst people behind the register 0 
a great way to finish a great 1 
this is a good joint 1 
they have a really nice atmosphere 1 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
you never know if you pushed it hard enough or the right number of times for the function you want or not 0 
the jamaican mojitos are delicious 1 
its pure brilliance 1 
i didnt know pulled pork could be soooo delicious 1 
ordered a double cheeseburger got a single patty that was falling apart picture uploaded yeah still sucks 0 
say bye bye to your tip lady 0 
not nearly as good looking as the amazon picture makes it look 0 
the place was fairly clean but the food simply wasnt worth it 0 
this movie has a cutting edge to it 1 
they have great dinners 1 
as for the service im a fan because its quick and youre being served by some nice folks 1 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
brilliance indeed 1 
it is an hour and half waste of time following a bunch of very pretty high schoolers whine and cry about life 0 
i really liked that 1 
im pleased 1 
if you look for authentic thai food go else where 0 
the ripped banana was not only ripped but petrified and tasteless 0 
very well made and fits my surefire gx2 perfectly 1 
their daily specials are always a hit with my group 1 
the crêpe was delicate and thin and moist 1 
i would recommend this 1 
the movie seemed a little slow at first 0 
dont make the same mistake i did 0 
a truly truly bad film 0 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
the cashew cream sauce was bland and the vegetables were undercooked 0 
gave up trying to eat any of the crust teeth still sore 0 
i think i was one of the people who found this another one of roths pearls 1 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
i waited and waited 0 
worst hour and a half of my lifeoh my gosh 0 
everything captain howdy says is either laughable or just plain stupid 0 
otherwise easy to install and use clear sound 1 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
if she had not rolled the eyes we may have stayed not sure if we will go back and try it again 0 
perhaps i caught them on an off night judging by the other reviews but im not inspired to go back 0 
this is infuriating 0 
piece of junk 0 
everything about it is fine and reasonable for the price ie 1 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
the battery works great 1 
victor mclaglen was even bad and brian donlevy was almost unrecognizable 0 
this is one of peter watkins most accessible films 1 
waste of money 0 
it was a drive to get there 0 
it is just the sort of pap that is screened in the afternoon to punish the unemployed for not having jobs 0 
but it wasnt anything at all just one big yawn 0 
victor mclaglen was even bad and brian donlevy was almost unrecognizable 0 
another note about this phones appearance is that it really looks rather bland especially in the all black model 0 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
very funny 1 
a happy wonderful feel good ending 1 
here in the wind and the lion we see a wonderful rendering of americas own imperial age 1 
at first i thought i was grtting a good deal at 744 until i plugged it into my phone v3c razr 0 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
but it wasnt anything at all just one big yawn 0 
the folks at otto always make us feel so welcome and special 1 
perabo has a nice energy level and is obviously very comfortable in front of a camera 1 
essentially you can forget microsofts tech support 0 
fast service 1 
clear skype calls long battery life long range 1 
better than youd expect 1 
the result is a powerhouse achievement made more timely now perhaps because of our cultures disturbing fascination with celebrity and its distorted interpretations of fame 1 
not recommended 0 
this place is handsdown one of the best places to eat in the phoenix metro area 1 
the phone loads super 1 
the waitress and manager are so friendly 1 
waiter was a jerk 0 
you need two hands to operate the screenthis software interface is decade old and cannot compete with new software designs 0 
the food is about on par with dennys which is to say not good at all 0 
very good product well made 1 
it was a waste of my money 0 
totally different with loads of understatement and black comedy this is a film few get to see but those who do will remember it 1 
its a case of so bad it is laughable 0 
i probably would not go here again 0 
it rocked my world and is certainly a must see for anyone with no social or physical outlets 1 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
i am very impressed with this headset from plantronics 1 
it was a very superficial movie and it gave me the feeling that i was watching play rather than a film 0 
then as if i hadnt wasted enough of my life there they poured salt in the wound by drawing out the time it took to bring the check 0 
the kids are annoying 0 
its a little geeky but i think thats its sex on toast and it rocks and oozes sex right down to its battery embedded sleek stylish leather case 1 
i own 2 of these cases and would order another 1 
fantastic service here 1 
very much disappointed with this company 0 
terrible phone holder 0 
ive had no trouble accessing the internet downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions 1 
definitely not worth the 3 i paid 0 
we had so much to say about the place before we walked in that he expected it to be amazing but was quickly disappointed 0 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
everything on the menu is terrific and we were also thrilled that they made amazing accommodations for our vegetarian daughter 1 
love this phone 1 
total letdown i would much rather just go to the camelback flower shop and cartel coffee 0 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
the sergeant pepper beef sandwich with auju sauce is an excellent sandwich as well 1 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
the success of the film depends on the casting of sydney greenstreet as the alexander yardley character 1 
the service was poor and thats being nice 0 
i dressed up to be treated so rudely 0 
this case seems well made 1 
the food is very good for your typical bar food 1 
i am so pleased to know such a modern day genius is out there letting is passion for art drive him and taking us as an audience with him 1 
we watched our waiter pay a lot more attention to other tables and ignore us 0 
great food and great service in a clean and friendly setting 1 
it was horrible 0 
the worst experience ever 0 
it is light has plenty of battery capacity and is very confortable to wear for somewhat extended periods of time 1 
i just cant explain this movie more than romanticcharminghilariousand adorablethe junkyard scenes are funnyall the junkyard dogs have something specialtoo funny i laughedkids will love itbuy it when it comes outit has new features 1 
first of all there are enough racial stereotypes and racial jokes to offend everyone 0 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
love this headset 1 
excellent cast story line performances 1 
this is an excellent tool especially when paired with your phones autoanswer 1 
i really like this product over the motorola because it is allot clearer on the ear piece and the mic 1 
i would avoid this place if you are staying in the mirage 0 
great audio 1 
and there wasnt a single sour note struck actingwise either some surprisingly solid casting here 1 
this was my first and only vegas buffet and it did not disappoint 1 
its worth driving up from tucson 1 
great place to eat reminds me of the little mom and pop shops in the san francisco bay area 1 
the scenery that the two daughters paint and photograph are beautiful 1 
first of all there are enough racial stereotypes and racial jokes to offend everyone 0 
do not waste your money here 0 
after a year the battery went completely dead on my headset 0 
we made the drive all the way from north scottsdale and i was not one bit disappointed 1 
waitress was sweet and funny 1 
i felt insulted and disrespected how could you talk and judge another human being like that 0 
this is not moviemaking 0 
an excellent new restaurant by an experienced frenchman 1 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
we waited for forty five minutes in vain 0 
whatever prompted such a documentary is beyond me 0 
reasonably priced also 1 
everything about this product is wrongfirst 0 
it plays louder than any other speaker of this size the price is so low that most would think the quality is lacking however its not 1 
ive dropped my phone more times than i can say even on concrete and my phone is still great knock on wood 1 
top line dont waste your time and money on this one its as bad as it comes 0 
i had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get some relief 0 
hackneyed writing certainly but made even worse by the bad directing 0 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
this is an outstanding little restaurant with some of the best food i have ever tasted 1 
worked great 1 
this is an excellent film 1 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
great case and price 1 
now the burgers arent as good the pizza which used to be amazing is doughy and flavorless 0 
your servers suck wait correction our server heimer sucked 0 
works for me 1 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
in short dont bother with this movie 0 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
host staff were for lack of a better word bitches 0 
seriously its not worth wasting your or your kids time on 0 
very friendly staff 1 
do not buy do not buyit sucks 0 
i wont spoil it but the ending in pretty amazing 1 
really pleased with this product so far 1 
cheap but hey it works was pleasantly suprised given the low cost of this item 1 
big disappointment with calendar sync 0 
worthwhile 1 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
again lame 0 
the acting was bad the dialogs were extremely shallow and insincere 0 
avoid at all costs 0 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
i am very happy 1 
i am sorry i made this purchase 0 
love the margaritas too 1 
worth every penny 1 
avoid this establishment 0 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
worst foodservice ive had in a while 0 
i purchased this and within 2 days it was no longer working 0 
it was delicious 1 
which is precisely why i am giving it such a bad review 0 
this place is horrible and way overpriced 0 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
thank you for such great service 1 
he was terrible 0 
its practically perfect in all of them  a true masterpiece in a sea of faux masterpieces 1 
this review is long overdue since i consider a tale of two sisters to be the single greatest film ever made 1 
the block was amazing 1 
the lighting is just dark enough to set the mood 1 
definitely not worth the 3 i paid 0 
i cant wait to go back 1 
this place is amazing 1 
we waited an hour for what was a breakfast i could have done 100 times better at home 0 
fast service 1 
avoid at any and all costs 0 
comes with a strong light that you can use to light up your camera shots and even flash sos signals seriously 1 
the service here leaves a lot to be desired 0 
best tacos in town by far 1 
its so bad its actually worth seeing just for that reason 0 
what happened next was prettyoff putting 0 
whatever prompted such a documentary is beyond me 0 
very nice and relaxing late night viewing 1 
the battery is working well as a replacement for the original that came with the phone over 2 years ago 1 
i dont understand how this garbage got on the shelves of the movie store its not even a real movie 0 
i got the aluminum case for my new palm vx and it worked really wellit has protected my handheld perfectly so far 1 
sorry i will not be getting food from here anytime soon 0 
excellent cast story line performances 1 
after the first charge kept going dead after 12 minutes 0 
the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach 0 
i never come again 0 
for service i give them no stars 0 
i felt as though her going to ireland did absolutely nothing whatsoever 0 
the chicken i got was definitely reheated and was only ok the wedges were cold and soggy 0 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
but the service was beyond bad 0 
great value 1 
mobile phone tools are a must have 1 
the battery is completely useless to me 0 
needless to say i wont be going back anytime soon 0 
the warmth it generates is in contrast to its austere backdrop 1 
again lame 0 
wow what a bad film 0 
also difficult to put onid recommend avoiding this product 0 
integrated seamlessly with the motorola razr phone 1 
not loud enough and doesnt turn on like it should 0 
dont buy this product it fails 0 
it was quite comfortable in the ear 1 
im returning them 0 
this is one of peter watkins most accessible films 1 
the results well are a shame 0 
each day of the week they have a different deal and its all so delicious 1 
despite the pans of reviewers i liked this movie 1 
too bad you have to pay up to a month for the service 0 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
better than expected 1 
it was delicious 1 
generally it just lacked imagination 0 
the food was outstanding and the prices were very reasonable 1 
why was this film made 0 
the wind and the lion is well written and superbly acted 1 
it came free with a dvd player i bought but i still turned the thing off halfway through because i was embarrassed for howell 0 
the food wasnt good 0 
i know this is not like the other restaurants at all something is very off here 0 
when im on this side of town this will definitely be a spot ill hit up again 1 
fantastic service here 1 
warning stay away 0 
i will be back many times soon 1 
adapter does not provide enough charging current 0 
the flat reenactments dont hold your attention because they are emotionally adrift and stagy 0 
no complaints 1 
now this is a movie i really dislike 0 
this isnt a small family restaurant this is a fine dining establishment 1 
has been working great 1 
it isnt even an achievement as a sobaditsgood or sobaditsmemorable movie 0 
service was exceptional and food was a good as all the reviews 1 
the success of the film depends on the casting of sydney greenstreet as the alexander yardley character 1 
i love being able to use one headset for both by landline and cell 1 
excellent sound battery life and inconspicuous to boot 1 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
this is a great place to eat 1 
the headsets are easy to use and everyone loves them 1 
i dont know exactly what it is about this movie but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our familys memories 1 
buttons are too small 0 
the real disappointment was our waiter 0 
and those baby owls were adorable 1 
blue ant is easy to use 1 
the handsfree part works fine but then the car tries to download the address book and the treo rebootsoverall i still rate this device high 1 
it deserves strong love 1 
a usable keyboard actually turns a pda into a realworld useful machine instead of just a neat gadget 1 
absolutely great 1 
enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film 1 
hell no will i go back 0 
the price was very good and with the free shipping and all it was a good purchase 1 
later i found myself lost in the power of the film 1 
it was either too cold not enough flavor or just bad 0 
it also took her forever to bring us the check when we asked for it 0 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
so badwellits just bad 0 
there is no real plot 0 
i would have given no star if i was able 0 
i was very disappointed in the movie 0 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
we ordered the duck rare and it was pink and tender on the inside with a nice char on the outside 1 
ambience is perfect 1 
i could not recommend these more 0 
paolo sorrentino has written a wonderful story about loneliness and tony has built one of the most unforgettable characters seen in movies in recent years 1 
avoid at all cost 0 
the acting was bad 0 
its a great tool for entertainment communication and data managementoh be sure to use activesync 42 for optimal data synchronization results 1 
the dialogue sucked 0 
often the dialogue doesnt really follow from one line to another or fit the surroundings 0 
i was very pleased to see that i could replace my well travled swivel holster for my blackberry flip 1 
i ended up sliding it on the edge of my pants or back pockets instead 1 
john wayne did an incredible job for being so young in the movie industry 1 
my gyro was basically lettuce only 0 
see it with your kids if you have a chanceit will open up some amazing dialog about how far race relations have come in the last 50 years 1 
it sure does beat the nachos at the movies but i would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant 0 
i saw this short film on hbo the other day and absolutely loved it 1 
there is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again 0 
superb phone on a great network 1 
so badwellits just bad 0 
the lines the cuts the audio everything is wrong 0 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
worthwhile 1 
furthermore you cant even find hours of operation on the website 0 
the cg opening sequence in space looked like it could have been created on microsoft slideshow for gods sake 0 
it plays louder than any other speaker of this size the price is so low that most would think the quality is lacking however its not 1 
started watching this but didnt believe in any of the characters 0 
love this product 1 
happy so far 1 
good quality 1 
this is a great deal 1 
duris has a wholesome appearance and gives a fine performance 1 
i bought two of them and neither will charge 0 
how can you call yourself a steakhouse if you cant properly cook a steak i dont understand 0 
earbud piece breaks easily 0 
really awful 0 
oh this is such a thing of beauty this restaurant 1 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
tried to go here for lunch and it was a madhouse 0 
great product for the price 1 
the cow tongue and cheek tacos are amazing 1 
kind of flops around 0 
its so bad its actually worth seeing just for that reason 0 
it was clear that she had the range and ability to pull off this part 1 
there is simply no excuse for something this poorly done 0 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
i had about two bites and refused to eat anymore 0 
i will not be eating there again 0 
im super pissd 0 
i checked out this place a couple years ago and was not impressed 0 
if you do go see this movie bring a pillow or a girlfriendboyfriend to keep you occupied through out 0 
i love the ringtones because they are so upbeat 1 
it was horrible 0 
truly awful 0 
its reception is very very poor 0 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
i checked everywhere and there is no feature for it which is really disappointing 0 
both do good jobs and are quite amusing 1 
their onscreen chemistry critical to the entire film is genuine 1 
glad i didnt pay to see it 0 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
i used bitpim a free program you can find on the internetto transfer data to the phonethe price of the cable was excellent 1 
you need at least 3 mins to get to your phone book from the time you first turn on the phonebattery life is short 0 
thats how id describe this painfully dreary timewaster of a film 0 
the best phone in market 1 
do not purchase this phone 0 
the ending is so so perfect youll shed a tear 1 
the presentation of the food was awful 0 
i have seen many movies starring jaclyn smith but my god this was one of her best though it came out 12 years ago 1 
works for me 1 
dont waste your time here 0 
the acting was decidely wooden though no worse than a period universal b movie 0 
restaurant is always full but never a wait 1 
i saw mirrormask last night and it was an unsatisfactory experience 0 
i hate movies like that 0 
beware this is not a trashy cult movie this is trash period 0 
i dont think i will be back for a very long time 0 
its uncomfortable and the sound quality is quite poor compared with the phone razr or with my previous wired headset that plugged into an lg 0 
but the premise of the film was so ridiculous that the president of the us 0 
easy to use 1 
totally believable 1 
magical help 1 
your servers suck wait correction our server heimer sucked 0 
he owns the film just as spacek owned coal miners daughter and quaid owned great balls of fire 1 
this is such a fun and funny movie 1 
best ive found so far ive tried 2 other bluetooths and this one has the best quality for both me and the listener as well as ease of using 1 
the ambiance was incredible 1 
well never go again 0 
makes it easier to keep up with my bluetooth when im not wearing it 0 
ive had this bluetoooth headset for some time now and still not comfortable with the way it fits on the ear 0 
i have always used corded headsets and the freedom from the wireless is very helpful 1 
the croutons also taste homemade which is an extra plus 1 
improper description i had to return it 0 
i was amazed at the quick arrival of the two original lg cell phone batteries and and at a fraction of the price 1 
the charger worked for about a week and then completely stopped charging my phone 0 
the jerky camera movements were also annoying 0 
now we were chosen to be tortured with this disgusting piece of blatant american propaganda 0 
but in terms of the writing its very fresh and bold 1 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
hard to judge whether these sides were good because we were grossed out by the melted styrofoam and didnt want to eat it for fear of getting sick 0 
the only good thing was that it fits comfortably on small ears 1 
this is just a great movie 1 
the movie seemed a little slow at first 0 
item does not match picture 0 
each day of the week they have a different deal and its all so delicious 1 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
i have been to very few places to eat that under no circumstances would i ever return to and this tops the list 0 
earbud piece breaks easily 0 
i got to enjoy the seafood salad with a fabulous vinegrette 1 
although i very much liked the look and sound of this place the actual experience was a bit disappointing 0 
it was also the right balance of war and love 1 
you can even take self portraits with the outside exterior display very cool 1 
once your food arrives its meh 0 
the acting by the whole cast could be put on a scale and balanced perfectly between overacting and underacting 0 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
this was reflected not only in the cast but also in the belowpar script which borrowed much from the earlier classic 0 
the chefs were friendly and did a good job 1 
the script is a big flawed mess 0 
this was such an awesome movie that i bought it off of ebay 1 
about ten minutes into this film i started having second thoughts 0 
i dressed up to be treated so rudely 0 
this is hands down the best phone ive ever had 1 
total waste of time 0 
i ordered the voodoo pasta and it was the first time id had really excellent pasta since going gluten free several years ago 1 
the script is a big flawed mess 0 
good item low price 1 
he really didnt seem to want to be hosting his voiceovers were monotonous didnt get involved with the guests 0 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
10 out of 10 stars 1 
service is also cute 1 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
the sound quality is excellent as well 1 
soggy and not good 0 
the plastic breaks really easy on this clip 0 
this product is clearly not ready for prime time i dont care how cool it looks if you cant tell a call is coming in its worthless 0 
the greek dressing was very creamy and flavorful 1 
id like to return it 0 
before i go in to why i gave a 1 star rating please know that this was my third time eating at bachi burger before writing a review 0 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
one of the best mexican movies ever and one of the less understood even by mexican themselves no matter how identified the should have felt with it 1 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
very windresistant 1 
it features an outlandish array of memorable psychotic but lovable nuts 1 
i highly recommend this movie for anyone interested in art poetry theater politics or japanese history 1 
reception is terrible and full of static 0 
what happened next was prettyoff putting 0 
if only someone involved with it knew how to string together narrative 0 
it is just the sort of pap that is screened in the afternoon to punish the unemployed for not having jobs 0 
it is shameful 0 
used and dirty 0 
very bad experience 0 
they are so cool 1 
his costars dont fare much better with people like morgan freeman jonah hill and ed helms just wasted 0 
not even a hello we will be right with you 0 
for those that havent seen it dont waste your time 0 
best service and food ever maria our server was so good and friendly she made our day 1 
however this didnt make up for the fact that overall this was a tremendously boring movie 0 
theres also enough hypocrisy in this film to make me vomit 0 
the selection was probably the worst ive seen in vegasthere was none 0 
but above all the exquisite visual composition of each moment with inventive and elegant use of closeup camera angle and lighting including pointillistic faux home movie footage is a wonder and joy to behold 1 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
well never go again 0 
this place is way too overpriced for mediocre food 0 
both the hot sour the egg flower soups were absolutely 5 stars 1 
ray charles life provided excellent biographical material for the film which goes well beyond being just another movie about a musician 1 
it is not good 0 
this is some seriously good pizza and im an expertconnisseur on the topic 1 
logitech bluetooth headset is a 10 1 
sucked most of the stuff does not work with my phone 0 
i must say i have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again 1 
this is so embarassing and also my ears hurt if i try to push the ear plug into my ear 0 
the potatoes were great and so was the biscuit 1 
i bought two of them and neither will charge 0 
cinematography noteworthy including fine views of barcelona and its famed gaudi towers 1 
steamboat willie is an amazingly important film to our cinema history 1 
i didnt want the clip going over the top of my ear causing discomfort 0 
att is not clear sound is very distorted and you have to yell when you talk 0 
you cant relate with them hell you barely can understand them 0 
none of it works just dont buy it 0 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
as an earlier review noted plug in this charger and nothing happens 0 
that being said for a phone the camera is very nice many cool effects to play with and video is decent as well 1 
it was a drive to get there 0 
again no plot at all 0 
it was a very superficial movie and it gave me the feeling that i was watching play rather than a film 0 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
the worst was the salmon sashimi 0 
best tacos in town by far 1 
this is a great place to eat 1 
its very slow 0 
the dining space is tiny but elegantly decorated and comfortable 1 
it looked like a wonderful story 1 
service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is vegas and located inside the crystals shopping mall by aria 1 
a piece of junk that broke after being on my phone for 2 days 0 
poor voice clarity 0 
so anyone near you will hear part of your conversation 0 
love this product 1 
an hour and a half i wish i could bring back 0 
this place receives stars for their appetizers 1 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
wonderful lil tapas and the ambience made me feel all warm and fuzzy inside 1 
im still trying to get over how bad it was 0 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
an extensive menu provides lots of options for breakfast 1 
it was that loudglad to say that the plantronics 510 maintains a flawless connection to my cell and with no static during normal use 1 
i will not return 0 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
my rating just 3 out of 10 0 
personally i think it shows that people should learn to find a compromise them self without involving other people into issue 1 
i work in the hospitality industry in paradise valley and have refrained from recommending cibo any longer 0 
my 5year old nokia 2160 from tracfone holds the charge a lot better than this 0 
will never ever go back 0 
drinks took close to 30 minutes to come out at one point 0 
i bought two of them and neither will charge 0 
ive dropped my phone more times than i can say even on concrete and my phone is still great knock on wood 1 
for the price on amazon it is an excellent product which i would highly recommend 1 
bad quality 0 
what a mistake 0 
the seasonal fruit was fresh white peach puree 1 
weird vibe from owners 0 
you get what you pay for i guess 0 
their menu is diverse and reasonably priced 1 
cool phone 1 
if there were zero stars i would give it zero stars 0 
disapointing results 0 
it is practically useless and did not add any kind of boost to my reception after i bought it 0 
ill even say it again  this is torture 0 
i highly recommend this movie for anyone interested in art poetry theater politics or japanese history 1 
this fixes all the problems 1 
think it over when you plan to own this onethis sure is the last moto phone for me 0 
terrible my car will not accept this cassette 0 
come hungry leave happy and stuffed 1 
my only complaint is the standard sound volume is a little low even when turned up to 5of 5 0 
i rate this movie 910 1 
gave up trying to eat any of the crust teeth still sore 0 
the only thing i wasnt too crazy about was their guacamole as i dont like it puréed 0 
will definitely be back 1 
it was a waste of my money 0 
not good by any stretch of the imagination 0 
this is a really fantastic thai restaurant which is definitely worth a visit 1 
we started with the tuna sashimi which was brownish in color and obviously wasnt fresh 0 
this is an excellent film 1 
i would highly recommend this 1 
but it wasnt until i watched this film that i realised how great he actually was 1 
we definately enjoyed ourselves 1 
this phone might well be the worst ive ever had in any brand 0 
the phone takes forever to charge like 2 to 5 hours literally 0 
i had ordered a motorola data cable got a very well finished and working product 1 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
very disappointed in accessoryone 0 
i bought this battery with a coupon from amazon and im very happy with my purchase 1 
not only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic but it also managed to give away the entire movie and im not exaggerating every moment every plot point every joke is told in the trailer 0 
i struggle to find anything bad to say about it 1 
this is actually a very smart movie 1 
you learn a lot about the real inside emotions of people in this movie and a lot about the movie business itself 1 
i had strawberry tea which was good 1 
meredith m was better than all right 1 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
the story is also both funny and poignant at times 1 
these were so good we ordered them twice 1 
just whatever you do avoid groove as its the antithesis of all that is good about human traffic 0 
this convention never worked well in the past and certainly doesnt work here 0 
the food was terrible 0 
the microphone also works well but according to people i have called it applifies everything 1 
the dining space is tiny but elegantly decorated and comfortable 1 
rip off over charge shipping 0 
definitely a turn off for me i doubt ill be back unless someone else is buying 0 
the yellowtail carpaccio was melt in your mouth fresh 1 
i would recommend saving room for this 1 
essentially you can forget microsofts tech support 0 
the camera although rated at an impressive 13 megapixels renders images that fall well below expectations of such a relatively high resolution 0 
one of my favorite purchases ever 1 
the scenery that the two daughters paint and photograph are beautiful 1 
the phone takes forever to charge like 2 to 5 hours literally 0 
i have bought this nokia cell phone a few weeks ago and it was a nightmare 0 
waiter was a jerk 0 
i wish i could return the unit and get back my money 0 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
for people who are first timers in film making i think they did an excellent job 1 
the phone was unusable and was not new 0 
i love my 350 headset my jabra350 bluetooth headset is great the reception is very good and the ear piece is a comfortable fit 1 
the characters are fleshed out surprisingly well particularly grimes and blake and all the actors deliver their sharply scripted lines with just the right amount of deadpan tongue in cheek to make the dialogue both hilarious and realistic 1 
there are the usual hitchcock logic flaws 0 
one character is totally annoying with a voice that gives me the feeling of fingernails on a chalkboard 0 
finally after three or four times the spring of the latch broke and i could not use it any longer on the visor 0 
the burger had absolutely no flavor the meat itself was totally bland the burger was overcooked and there was no charcoal flavor 0 
it shouldnt take 30 min for pancakes and eggs 0 
but this movie is definitely a below average rent 0 
yeah the movie pretty much sucked 0 
poorly contstruct hinge 0 
very disappointed 0 
this place has it 1 
i have always used corded headsets and the freedom from the wireless is very helpful 1 
this movie totally grates on my nerves 0 
w810i is just superb 1 
nargile i think you are great 1 
its just lame 0 
even if you love bad movies do not watch this movie 0 
nice blanket of moz over top but i feel like this was done to cover up the subpar food 1 
this place deserves one star and 90 has to do with the food 0 
i recently tried caballeros and i have been back every week since 1 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
i even dropped this phone into a stream and it was submerged for 15 seconds and it still works great 1 
great phone 1 
the only thing worse than taylors acting was stanwycks singing 0 
it finds my cell phone right away when i enter the car 1 
highly entertaining at all angles 1 
highly unrecommended 0 
i really like this product over the motorola because it is allot clearer on the ear piece and the mic 1 
i dont think i will be back for a very long time 0 
you cant relate with them hell you barely can understand them 0 
i really hope the team behind this movie makes more movies and that they will continue to do so in their own some kinda weird style 1 
the cow tongue and cheek tacos are amazing 1 
dont miss it 1 
hands down my favorite italian restaurant 1 
the pan cakes everyone are raving about taste like a sugary disaster tailored to the palate of a six year old 0 
perhaps my phone is defective but people cannot hear me when i use this 0 
the menu is always changing food quality is going down service is extremely slow 0 
during several different 2 minute calls i experienced 5 drops and it was in an area that had 5 bars 0 
great hands free device 1 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
great product and price 1 
its practically perfect in all of them  a true masterpiece in a sea of faux masterpieces 1 
i connected my wifes bluetoothmotorola hs850 to my phone and it worked like a charm whether the phone was in my pocket or the case 1 
dont go here 0 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
it was either too cold not enough flavor or just bad 0 
really pleased with this product so far 1 
unfortunately this is a bad movie that is just plain bad 0 
overall i rate this movie a 10 out of a 110 scale 1 
item does not match picture 0 
it is simple to use and i like it 1 
the staff are also very friendly and efficient 1 
greatno problems at all 1 
a great touch 1 
so flavorful and has just the perfect amount of heat 1 
nothing new there 0 
i really like this product over the motorola because it is allot clearer on the ear piece and the mic 1 
the lines the cuts the audio everything is wrong 0 
the chips and salsa were really good the salsa was very fresh 1 
the steak was amazingrge fillet relleno was the best seafood plate i have ever had 1 
i also decided not to send it back because our waitress looked like she was on the verge of having a heart attack 0 
this is an outstanding little restaurant with some of the best food i have ever tasted 1 
the movie is not completely perfect but titta di girolamo will stay with you for a long time after the vision of the movie 1 
the service was extremely slow 0 
i recently had problems where i could not stay connected for more than 10 minutes before being disconnected 0 
i ordered the voodoo pasta and it was the first time id had really excellent pasta since going gluten free several years ago 1 
the only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive 1 
so just beware 0 
the cg opening sequence in space looked like it could have been created on microsoft slideshow for gods sake 0 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
i tried the cape cod ravoli chickenwith cranberrymmmm 1 
we are so glad we found this place 1 
love this phone 1 
nothing special 0 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
the fries were not hot and neither was my burger 0 
its kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly its embarrassing how childlike the company is 0 
the potatoes were great and so was the biscuit 1 
this place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver 0 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
fantastic food 1 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
great product and price 1 
very good phone 1 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
treo and tmobile refused to replace it again and forced me to buy another phone without any kind of upgrade discount 0 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
the entire audience applauded at the conclusion of the film 1 
and considering the two of us left there very full and happy for about 20 you just cant go wrong 1 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
i am very impressed with this headset from plantronics 1 
the han nan chicken was also very tasty 1 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
these are the nicest restaurant owners ive ever come across 1 
the art style has the appearance of crayonpencil drawings and is wonderfully colorful and fanciful 1 
battery is holding up well 1 
this is an outstanding little restaurant with some of the best food i have ever tasted 1 
beware this is not a trashy cult movie this is trash period 0 
i never walked out of a movie faster 0 
im so sorry but i really cant recommend it to anyone 0 
this place deserves one star and 90 has to do with the food 0 
echo problemvery unsatisfactory 0 
you need two hands to operate the screenthis software interface is decade old and cannot compete with new software designs 0 
do not waste your money here 0 
the attempts at humor were pitiful and story is so awful it dosent bear thinking about which basically involves a vulcan stealing the enterprise to find god seriously i just didnt care about any of this film and oh not to mention uhura does a belly dance to distract male guards 0 
my drink was never empty and he made some really great menu suggestions 1 
spend your money and time some place else 0 
then scene where they debated whether or not to sack the trumpeter who falsely was accused for the murder is pure horror really stupid 0 
i had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get some relief 0 
appears to actually outperform the original battery from china that came with my v325i 1 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
waaaaaayyyyyyyyyy over rated is all i am saying 0 
we loved the biscuits 1 
warning stay away 0 
i cant use this case because the smell is disgusting 0 
i mean really how do you get so famous for your fish and chips when its so terrible 0 
this place receives stars for their appetizers 1 
i love lane but ive never seen her in a movie this lousy 0 
if youre not familiar check it out 1 
crust is not good 0 
10 out of 10 stars 1 
what a great double cheeseburger 1 
ive had this bluetoooth headset for some time now and still not comfortable with the way it fits on the ear 0 
bought mainly for the charger which broke soon after purchasing 0 
the calls drop the phone comes on and off at will the screen goes black and the worst of all it stops ringing intermittently 0 
its too bad the food is so damn generic 0 
buttons are too small 0 
otherwise dont even waste your time on this 0 
a film not easily forgotten 1 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
its like a bad two hour tv movie 0 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
i dont know what the big deal is about this place but i wont be back yaall 0 
i cant believe theres even a sequel to this 0 
i would recommend this 1 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
im still trying to get over how bad it was 0 
i waited and waited 0 
my sashimi was poor quality being soggy and tasteless 0 
never heard of any of them except cole who was totally unbelievable in the part 0 
good audio quality 1 
this was reflected not only in the cast but also in the belowpar script which borrowed much from the earlier classic 0 
i will come back here every time im in vegas 1 
everything about this movie is stupid 0 
juano hernandez an exceptional actor who played supporting roles in many films of the era is a proud black man who is accused of murdering a white man in the south 1 
we waited for forty five minutes in vain 0 
the waitress was friendly and happy to accomodate for veganveggie options 1 
i have 23 bars on my cell phone when i am home but you cant not hear anything 0 
if you want a sandwich just go to any firehouse 1 
i hate writing bad reviews about films especially those in which i really like the star but this film is so bad i dont believe for one second that anyone could have been proud of it 0 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
updatewent back for a second time and it was still just as amazing 1 
when my order arrived one of the gyros was missing 0 
then i watched it again two sundays ago march 20th 2005 and i began to really enjoy it and this time i taped the entire thing 1 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
dont make the same mistake that i did and please dont buy this phone 0 
worst customer service ever 0 
it rocked my world and is certainly a must see for anyone with no social or physical outlets 1 
excellent short film 1 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
everything about this product is wrongfirst 0 
overall i wasnt very impressed with noca 0 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
good transmit audio 1 
the acting is terrible and the writing is worse 0 
it was pretty gross 0 
the battery is working well as a replacement for the original that came with the phone over 2 years ago 1 
the potatoes were like rubber and you could tell they had been made up ahead of time being kept under a warmer 0 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
the poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying 0 
the eargels channel the sound directly into your ear and seem to increase the sound volume and clarity 1 
i am pairing this with my iphone and i could not be happier with it so far 1 
in the span of an hour i had two people exclaim whoa is that the new phone on tv 1 
you could only take 2 videos at a time and the quality was very poor 0 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
it was forced like everything in this movie 0 
i would recommend it 1 
this case has passed the one year mark and while it shows signs of wear it is 100 functional 1 
on the negative its insipid enough to cause regret for another 2 hours of life wasted in front of the screen 0 
again no plot at all 0 
but this movie really got to me 1 
cheap but hey it works was pleasantly suprised given the low cost of this item 1 
i think the most wonderful parts literally full of wonder are the excerpts from his works 1 
i believe the screenwriter did a good job of tying up the loose ends 1 
will go back next trip out 1 
customer service was terrible 0 
an extensive menu provides lots of options for breakfast 1 
you can find better movies at youtube 0 
great food and great service in a clean and friendly setting 1 
there were several moments in the movie that just didnt need to be there and were excruciatingly slow moving 0 
about 30 minutes of footage is wasted to show mediocre elderly actors awkwardly babbling overwrought pseudosatanic gibberish corny enough to make a teen goth blush almost always in olde english and sometimes in latin that may or may not be made up words 0 
someone shouldve invented this sooner 1 
setup went very smoothly 1 
very comfortable 1 
restaurant is always full but never a wait 1 
it was a waste of my money 0 
im probably one of the few people to ever go to ians and not like it 0 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
the cable looks so thin and flimsy it is scary 0 
this product is clearly not ready for prime time i dont care how cool it looks if you cant tell a call is coming in its worthless 0 
damian is so talented and versatile in so many ways of writing and portraying different characters on screen 1 
frozen pucks of disgust with some of the worst people behind the register 0 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
when i opened the sandwich i was impressed but not in a good way 0 
i wont say any more i dont like spoilers so i dont want to be one but i believe this film is worth your time 1 
just dont know why they were so slow 0 
its been my choice headset for yearsgreat sound good volume good noise cancellation 1 
lame would be the best way to describe it 0 
the films dialogue is natural real to life 1 
this film tries to be a serious and sophisticated thrillerhorror flick and it fails miserably 0 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
unless youre just out to visually collect all extant films of austens work you can skip this one 0 
ray charles life provided excellent biographical material for the film which goes well beyond being just another movie about a musician 1 
the attempts at humor were pitiful and story is so awful it dosent bear thinking about which basically involves a vulcan stealing the enterprise to find god seriously i just didnt care about any of this film and oh not to mention uhura does a belly dance to distract male guards 0 
cinematography noteworthy including fine views of barcelona and its famed gaudi towers 1 
obviously they have a terrible customer service so you get what you pay for 0 
better than expected 1 
it makes very strange ticking noises before it ends the call 0 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
do not waste your time 0 
just as good as when i had it more than a year ago 1 
i have only had it for a few weeks but so far so good 1 
this film highlights the fundamental flaws of the legal process that its not about discovering guilt or innocence but rather is about who presents better in court 1 
the acting was bad the dialogs were extremely shallow and insincere 0 
never again will i be dining at this place 0 
the movie is littered with overt racial slurs towards the black cast members and in return the whites are depicted as morons and boobs 0 
i am so pleased to know such a modern day genius is out there letting is passion for art drive him and taking us as an audience with him 1 
motorola finally got the voice quality of a bluetooth headset right 1 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
i recently had problems where i could not stay connected for more than 10 minutes before being disconnected 0 
the acting helps the writing along very well maybe the idiotsavant sister could have been played better and it is a real joy to watch 1 
food was below average 0 
bad reception 0 
great food 1 
food arrived quickly 1 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
any ring toneoverall good phone to buy 1 
great choice 1 
its pretty surprising that this wonderful film was made in 1949 as hollywood generally had its collective heads in the sand concerning black and white issues at that time 1 
i advise everyone do not be fooled 0 
dessert panna cotta was amazing 1 
dont waste your money 0 
very disappointed 0 
perfect for the ps3 1 
im pleased 1 
sooooo good 1 
i received my headset in good time and was happy with it 1 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
the only thing worse than taylors acting was stanwycks singing 0 
there was a warm feeling with the service and i felt like their guest for a special treat 1 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
if you do go see this movie bring a pillow or a girlfriendboyfriend to keep you occupied through out 0 
their onscreen chemistry critical to the entire film is genuine 1 
i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
not even a hello we will be right with you 0 
what a waste 0 
this is was due to the fact that it took 20 minutes to be acknowledged then another 35 minutes to get our foodand they kept forgetting things 0 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
an italian reviewer called this a small great film and thats right 1 
very displeased 0 
you cant go wrong with any of the food here 1 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
there is no plot or storyline 0 
this would not even be good as a made for tv flick 0 
the concert sequences just sucked 0 
thus far have only visited twice and the food was absolutely delicious each time 1 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
i have yet to run this new battery below two bars and thats three days without charging 1 
and i just love the colors 1 
after one bite i was hooked 1 
you truly take this journey through the eyes and soul of a child 1 
worked perfectly 1 
a truly truly bad film 0 
very disappointed 0 
the film gives meaning to the phrase never in the history of human conflict has so much been owed by so many to so few 1 
it wasnt busy either also the building was freezing cold 0 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
the directing seems too pretentious 0 
the flat reenactments dont hold your attention because they are emotionally adrift and stagy 0 
i paid the bill but did not tip because i felt the server did a terrible job 0 
it looses connection to the phone even when it is within a couple feet between the two 0 
great phone 1 
today the graphics are crap 0 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
bad script bad direction and horrible acting make this one plain bad 0 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
fantastic food 1 
bad day or not i have a very low tolerance for rude customer service people it is your job to be nice and polite wash dishes otherwise 0 
it deserves strong love 1 
so they performed 1 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
this phone is slim and light and the display is beautiful 1 
my order was not correct 0 
the scenes are often funny and occasionally touching as the characters evaluate their lives and where they are going 1 
i have had problems wit hit dropping signal and more 0 
the owners really really need to quit being soooooo cheap let them wrap my freaking sandwich in two papers not one 0 
this particular model would not work with my motorola q smartphone 0 
it is wonderful and inspiring to watch and i hope that it gets released again on to video or dvd 1 
you get what you pay for i guess 0 
this is cool because most cases are just open there allowing the screen to get all scratched up 1 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
unfortunately it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees 0 
magical help 1 
first of all there are enough racial stereotypes and racial jokes to offend everyone 0 
probably never coming back and wouldnt recommend it 0 
this film tries to be a serious and sophisticated thrillerhorror flick and it fails miserably 0 
ambience is perfect 1 
other than that the leather is nice and soft the fit is very tight the cut out for the face is a good shape 1 
after trying many many handsfree gadgets this is the one that finally works well 1 
the performances are not improved by improvisation because the actors now have twice as much to worry about not only whether theyre delivering the line well but whether the line itself is any good 0 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
none of it works just dont buy it 0 
in fact i liked it better than interview with a vampire and i liked this lestat stuart townsend better than cruises attempt 1 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
due to this happening on every call i was forced to stop using this headset 0 
very true to shakespear and a must for all shakespear fans 1 
its a feelgood film and thats how i felt when i came out of the cinema 1 
the majority of the logitech earbud headsets failed 0 
i got the car charger and not even after a week the charger was brokeni went to plug it in and it started smoking 0 
i really liked that 1 
they have been around for years and carries the highest quality of antiglare screen protector that i have found to date 1 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
as an earlier review noted plug in this charger and nothing happens 0 
not worth it 0 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
setup couldnt have been simpler 1 
spend your money and time some place else 0 
i wouldnt return 0 
the potatoes were great and so was the biscuit 1 
im surprised this is a good quality car charger and theres not much reviews about it 1 
i have been very happy with the 510 and have had no complaints from any one regarding my sound quality on their end 1 
is pretty funny 1 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
sauce was tasteless 0 
steamboat willie is an amazingly important film to our cinema history 1 
they work about 2 weeks then break 0 
really ugly 0 
the phone is sturdy and waterproof 1 
2 thumbs up to this seller 1 
avoid this establishment 0 
it is the best charger i have seen on the market yet 1 
110 and only because there is no setting for 010 0 
really pleased with this product so far 1 
you cant beat the price on these 1 
ive only had my bluetooth for a few weeks but i really like it 1 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
this phone tries very hard to do everything but fails at its very ability to be a phone 0 
how awful she is 0 
cumbersome design 0 
just does not work 0 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
what makes this story different are the terrific production values faultless photography composition and editing the terrific casting the underappreciated brian keith playing a bully teddy and vivid history 1 
i must say i have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again 1 
now the burgers arent as good the pizza which used to be amazing is doughy and flavorless 0 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
im not sure what he was trying to do with this film 0 
mediocre food 0 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
steamboat willie is an amazingly important film to our cinema history 1 
im trying to return it for a refund 0 
lucy bell is so much higher than this crap and for her to sink this low is quite depressing 0 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
excellent sound battery life and inconspicuous to boot 1 
obviously they have a terrible customer service so you get what you pay for 0 
while i managed to bend the leaf spring back in place the metal now has enough stress that it will break on the next drop 0 
but it does get better reception and clarity than any phone ive had before 1 
in the span of an hour i had two people exclaim whoa is that the new phone on tv 1 
the desserts were a bit strange 0 
i have read others reviews here but i havent had any problem with it 1 
service was very prompt 1
