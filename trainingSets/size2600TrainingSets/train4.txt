the cg opening sequence in space looked like it could have been created on microsoft slideshow for gods sake 0 
just spicy enough perfect actually 1 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
battery is terrible 0 
rude inconsiderate management 0 
just as good as when i had it more than a year ago 1 
the two main characters may be two of the most believable children i ever saw put on screen 1 
a world better than 95 of the garbage in the theatres today 1 
the waitresses are very friendly 1 
there was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth but it didnt really work into the rest of the plot 0 
by far the best cheesecurds we have ever had 1 
this is simply the best bluetooth headset for sound quality 1 
good transmit audio 1 
this is a great little item 1 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
to be honest with you this is unbelievable nonsense and very foolish 0 
the refried beans that came with my meal were dried out and crusty and the food was bland 0 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
same problem as others have mentioned 0 
what a great double cheeseburger 1 
my boyfriend and i sat at the bar and had a completely delightful experience 1 
a very very very slowmoving aimless movie about a distressed drifting young man 0 
1010 1 
unfortunately inexperience of direction meant that scene after scene passed with little in the way of dramatic tension or conflict 0 
i had the chicken pho and it tasted very bland 0 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
very poor service 0 
definitely worth checking out 1 
dont bother go to the store 0 
the service was great even the manager came and helped with our table 1 
good transmit audio 1 
artless camerawork endlessly presents us with the ugliest setting imaginable ie 0 
unfortunately any virtue in this films production work was lost on a regrettable script 0 
do not buy if you want to use the holster 0 
no ear loop needed its tiny and the sound is great 1 
actually the graphics were good at the time 1 
here in the wind and the lion we see a wonderful rendering of americas own imperial age 1 
im super pissd 0 
i was very disappointed 0 
will never ever go back and have told many people what had happened 0 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
the volume for the ringer is real good you have choices how loud 1 
the cashew cream sauce was bland and the vegetables were undercooked 0 
the writers were smack on and i think the best actors and actresses were a bonus to the showthese characters were so real 1 
comfortable in my hand 1 
service was exceptional and food was a good as all the reviews 1 
but now that it is out of warranty the same problems reoccurebottom line put your money somewhere else cingular will not support it 0 
this is a simple little phone to use but the breakage is unacceptible 0 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
im so sorry but i really cant recommend it to anyone 0 
sending it back 0 
absolutel junk 0 
delicious 1 
doesnt hold charge 0 
the manager was the worst 0 
the majority of the logitech earbud headsets failed 0 
someone shouldve invented this sooner 1 
this one is simply a disappointment 0 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
the only suspense i was feeling was the frustration at just how retarded the girls were 0 
no real improvement 0 
it is shameful 0 
if there were zero stars i would give it zero stars 0 
this is probably the most irritating show i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
ive had this bluetoooth headset for some time now and still not comfortable with the way it fits on the ear 0 
and i just love the colors 1 
friends pasta also bad he barely touched it 0 
i liked this movie way too much 1 
by far the best cheesecurds we have ever had 1 
the service was a little slow considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace 0 
this fixes all the problems 1 
the folks at otto always make us feel so welcome and special 1 
the chefs were friendly and did a good job 1 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
i definitly recommend 1 
its practically perfect in all of them  a true masterpiece in a sea of faux masterpieces 1 
does not fit 0 
she ordered a toasted english muffin that came out untoasted 0 
it is an insane game 1 
a good commentary of todays love and undoubtedly a film worth seeing 1 
his performance is simply genius 1 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
i still maintain that monkeys shouldnt make headphones we just obviously dont share enough dna to copy the design over to humans 0 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
i can say that the desserts were yummy 1 
the tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu 0 
nothing new there 0 
this was my first and only vegas buffet and it did not disappoint 1 
excellent product for the price 1 
long whiny and pointless 0 
the only good thing was our waiter he was very helpful and kept the bloddy marys coming 1 
its one of the movies i need to see whenever it comes on tvnever mind the fact that i already have it memorized 1 
the biggest complaint i have is the battery drains superfast 0 
great earpiece 1 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
extremely tasty 1 
it doesnt work in europe or asia 0 
for people who are first timers in film making i think they did an excellent job 1 
essentially you can forget microsofts tech support 0 
this film tries to be a serious and sophisticated thrillerhorror flick and it fails miserably 0 
great software for motorolas 1 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
but then they came back cold 0 
it is zillion times away from reality 0 
the writers were smack on and i think the best actors and actresses were a bonus to the showthese characters were so real 1 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
the first thing that happened was that the tracking was off 0 
it was a very superficial movie and it gave me the feeling that i was watching play rather than a film 0 
the selection on the menu was great and so were the prices 1 
worst ever 0 
couldnt use the unit with sunglasses not good in texas 0 
after 3 months screen just went black all of a sudden 0 
feelings thoughtsgabriels discomfort during the danceall these intangibles leap to life and come within the viewers grasp in hustons portrayal 1 
highquality chicken on the chicken caesar salad 1 
the service was extremely slow 0 
however after about a year the fliptop started to get loose and wobbly and eventually my screen went black and i couldnt receive and place calls 0 
in a word it is embarrassing 0 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
overall a delight 1 
the performances are not improved by improvisation because the actors now have twice as much to worry about not only whether theyre delivering the line well but whether the line itself is any good 0 
on the up side their cafe serves really good food 1 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
20th century foxs road house 1948 is not only quite a silly noir but is an implausible unmitigated bore of a movie 0 
the han nan chicken was also very tasty 1 
disappointing experience 0 
one of the best mexican movies ever and one of the less understood even by mexican themselves no matter how identified the should have felt with it 1 
this was such an awesome movie that i bought it off of ebay 1 
leopard print is wonderfully wild 1 
i recommend this for everyone who loves film movies anythinga work of art 1 
it has everything i need and i couldnt ask for more 1 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
i highly recommend these and encourage people to give them a try 1 
there are so many problems i dont know where to start 0 
dont buy this product 0 
highly recommended for all ages although the younger set will probably not appreciate some of the more subtle references they will certainly appreciate one galley scene in particular 1 
i was particularly pleased with the acting ability of dwight schultz 1 
for readers who have already seen one of miyazakis films he is still in top form and made another worthwhile experience 1 
not good by any stretch of the imagination 0 
friends pasta also bad he barely touched it 0 
i recommend this for everyone who loves film movies anythinga work of art 1 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
now we were chosen to be tortured with this disgusting piece of blatant american propaganda 0 
highly recommended for all ages although the younger set will probably not appreciate some of the more subtle references they will certainly appreciate one galley scene in particular 1 
yet plantronincs continues to use the same flawed charger design 0 
this is a disgrace 0 
the selection of food was not the best 0 
this mostly routine factbased tv drama gets a boost from the fine performance by cole 1 
duris has a wholesome appearance and gives a fine performance 1 
this was like the final blow 0 
there still are good actors around 1 
we had 7 at our table and the service was pretty fast 1 
updatewent back for a second time and it was still just as amazing 1 
anyway the plot flowed smoothly and the malebonding scenes were a hoot 1 
the burger had absolutely no flavor the meat itself was totally bland the burger was overcooked and there was no charcoal flavor 0 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
i agree with jessica this movie is pretty bad 0 
other than that the leather is nice and soft the fit is very tight the cut out for the face is a good shape 1 
for a product that costs as much as this one does i expect it to work far better and with greater ease than this thing does 0 
best tacos in town by far 1 
director paul matthews who also wrotedirected the weak 1995 monster movie grim clearly doesnt know how to pace his films 0 
i loved it 1 
not even a hello we will be right with you 0 
battery lasts only a few hours 0 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
i love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it 1 
after i pulled up my car i waited for another 15 minutes before being acknowledged 0 
only pros large seating area nice bar area great simple drink menu the best brick oven pizza with homemade dough 1 
i got to enjoy the seafood salad with a fabulous vinegrette 1 
the acting is fantastic the stories are seamlessly woven together and the dogs are splendid a must rent view or see 1 
classywarm atmosphere fun and fresh appetizers succulent steaks baseball steak 1 
same problem as others have mentioned 0 
great earpiece 1 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
you need two hands to operate the screenthis software interface is decade old and cannot compete with new software designs 0 
the only thing really worth watching was the scenery and the house because it is beautiful 1 
some applause should be given to the prelude however 1 
however my girl was complain that some time the phone doesnt wake up like normal phone does 0 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
almost everyone involved must be return to school acting is utterly predictable and bad script is pile of garbage all round 0 
for the price on amazon it is an excellent product which i would highly recommend 1 
furthermore you cant even find hours of operation on the website 0 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
i saw this short film on hbo the other day and absolutely loved it 1 
i bought two of them and neither will charge 0 
everything about this product is wrongfirst 0 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
its kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly its embarrassing how childlike the company is 0 
then as if i hadnt wasted enough of my life there they poured salt in the wound by drawing out the time it took to bring the check 0 
will not be back 0 
for readers who have already seen one of miyazakis films he is still in top form and made another worthwhile experience 1 
see it 1 
spend your money and time some place else 0 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
i consider this theft 0 
my boyfriend and i came here for the first time on a recent trip to vegas and could not have been more pleased with the quality of food and service 1 
cant store anything but phone numbers to sim 0 
the cast of veteran actors are more than just a nostalgia trip 1 
i just saw this film and i recommend it 1 
damian is so talented and versatile in so many ways of writing and portraying different characters on screen 1 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
after all the rave reviews i couldnt wait to eat herewhat a disappointment 0 
the selection of food was not the best 0 
this is hands down the best phone ive ever had 1 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
great character actors telly savalas and peter boyle 1 
i was very disappointed 0 
if good intentions made a film great then this film might be one of the greatest films ever made 1 
works for me 1 
would come back again if i had a sushi craving while in vegas 1 
this movie now joins revenge of the boogeyman and zombiez as part of the hellish trinity of horror films 0 
theres barely a boring moment in the film and there are plenty of humorous parts 1 
it deserves strong love 1 
there are many continuity errors one other user commented on different cars in the garage joes glassesthe one that got to me the most was the fact joes facial hair configuration seemed to change from scene to scene 0 
not only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic but it also managed to give away the entire movie and im not exaggerating every moment every plot point every joke is told in the trailer 0 
highly recommend for any one who has a blue tooth phone 1 
this is high adventure at its best 1 
there are many continuity errors one other user commented on different cars in the garage joes glassesthe one that got to me the most was the fact joes facial hair configuration seemed to change from scene to scene 0 
which are small and not worth the price 0 
love this headset 1 
everything about this product is wrongfirst 0 
incredible 1 
one of the best mexican movies ever and one of the less understood even by mexican themselves no matter how identified the should have felt with it 1 
the loudspeaker option is great the bumpers with the lights is very appealing 0 
i have to use the smallest earpieces provided but it stays on pretty well 1 
thanks again to amazon for having the things i need for a good price 1 
i wont spoil it but the ending in pretty amazing 1 
the worst sappiest dialogue i could go on and on 0 
overall i am psyched to have a phone which has all my appointments and contacts in and gets great reception 1 
lucy bell is so much higher than this crap and for her to sink this low is quite depressing 0 
worst service to boot but that is the least of their worries 0 
pricing is a bit of a concern at mellow mushroom 0 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
but the movie makes a lot of serious mistakes 0 
i felt asleep the first time i watched it so i can recommend it for insomniacs 0 
not much flavor to them and very poorly constructed 0 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
the scallop dish is quite appalling for value as well 0 
dont do it 0 
easy to pair with my samsung cell 1 
this would not even be good as a made for tv flick 0 
i highly recommend this modest priced cellular phone 1 
love this product 1 
this phone is pretty sturdy and ive never had any large problems with it 1 
good product good seller 1 
the characters are interesting and you really care for them 1 
i have had this phone for over a year now and i will tell you its not that great 0 
long whiny and pointless 0 
here in the wind and the lion we see a wonderful rendering of americas own imperial age 1 
i have never had such bland food which surprised me considering the article we read focused so much on their spices and flavor 0 
the food is rich so order accordingly 1 
works good 1 
ordered a double cheeseburger got a single patty that was falling apart picture uploaded yeah still sucks 0 
i hope this place sticks around 1 
this pair of headphones is the worst that i have ever had soundwise 0 
the sweet potato tots were good but the onion rings were perfection or as close as i have had 1 
it wasnt busy at all and now we know why 0 
maybe there would be a reasonable explanation for this atrocity 0 
the salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop which was perfectly cooked 1 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
then our food came out disappointment ensued 0 
their research and development division obviously knows what theyre doing 1 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
works great 1 
good servicecheck 1 
the screen size is big key pad lit well enough and the camera quality is excellent for a camera phone 1 
im glad i found this product on amazon it is hard to find it wasnt high priced 1 
the vanilla ice cream was creamy and smooth while the profiterole choux pastry was fresh enough 1 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
it sure does beat the nachos at the movies but i would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant 0 
but storm trooper is not even bad enough to make it to the list of wonderfully terrible movies 0 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
great for ipods too 1 
used and dirty 0 
it is light has plenty of battery capacity and is very confortable to wear for somewhat extended periods of time 1 
appears to actually outperform the original battery from china that came with my v325i 1 
however paul schrader has indeed made a film about mishima that is both superb complex 1 
after two i felt disgusting 0 
i even fully charged it before i went to bed and turned off blue tooth and wifi and noticed that it only had 20 left in the morning 0 
this is the phone to get for 2005 i just bought my s710a and all i can say is wow 1 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
i wasnt the least bit interested 0 
so just beware 0 
if you want healthy authentic or ethic food try this place 1 
in my house i was getting dropped coverage upstairs and no coverage in my basement 0 
at a time when it seems that film animation has been dominated by disneypixars cgi masterpieces it is both refreshing and comforting to know that miyazaki is still relying on traditional handdrawn animation to tell his charming and enchanting stories 1 
i just dont know how this place managed to served the blandest food i have ever eaten when they are preparing indian cuisine 0 
it makes very strange ticking noises before it ends the call 0 
i dont like this nokia either 0 
i love the ownerchef his one authentic japanese cool dude 1 
if you check the directors filmography on this site you will see why this film didnt have a chance 0 
the fries were not hot and neither was my burger 0 
its a piece of crap 0 
very slow at seating even with reservation 0 
i was seated immediately 1 
what should have been a hilarious yummy christmas eve dinner to remember was the biggest fail of the entire trip for us 0 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
ive bought 5 wired headphones that sound better than these 0 
but whatever it was that cost them so much it didnt translate to quality thats for sure 0 
i am a fan of his this movie sucked really bad 0 
an hour and a half i wish i could bring back 0 
everything about this film is simply incredible 1 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
worked perfectly 1 
what a waste of time 0 
the battery runs down quickly 0 
good quality 1 
i purchased this and within 2 days it was no longer working 0 
has been working great 1 
we watched our waiter pay a lot more attention to other tables and ignore us 0 
very disappointed in accessoryone 0 
i immediately said i wanted to talk to the manager but i did not want to talk to the guy who was doing shots of fireball behind the bar 0 
for people who are first timers in film making i think they did an excellent job 1 
i dont think ill be running back to carlys anytime soon for food 0 
very good stuff for the price 1 
i was particularly pleased with the acting ability of dwight schultz 1 
helen baxendale is a very credible lady macbeth who can be very cheerfull at times and sometimes she just looks like a naughty girl but deadly in her taste for blood and evil 1 
clear crisp sound 1 
i wont be back 0 
the camera really likes her in this movie 1 
i have had mine for about a year and this christmas i bought some for the rest of the family 1 
case was more or less an extra that i originally put on but later discarded because it scratched my ear 0 
bad characters bad story and bad acting 0 
waited and waited and waited 0 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
punishment park is a brilliant piece of cinema 1 
i do not know if this was emilio estevezs directorial debut but the pacing the interplay and development of the characters as well as some clever camera work surrounding the character estevez plays all suggest a natural eye 1 
the cast is good 1 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
it was a good thing that the tickets only cost five dollars because i would be mad if id have paid 750 to see this crap 0 
secondly hitchcock pretty much perfected the thriller and chase movie 1 
i did not have any problem with this item and would order it again if needed 1 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
the majority of the logitech earbud headsets failed 0 
this movie suffered because of the writing it needed more suspense 0 
waiter was a jerk 0 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
now you know why i gave it a 10 1 
a good time 1 
the phone crashed completely and now i have to get it replaced 0 
definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly will return next time im in vegas 1 
iam very pleased with my purchase 1 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
if you havent choked in your own vomit by the end by all the cheap drama and worthless dialogue youve must have bored yourself to death with this waste of time 0 
extremely tasty 1 
i must say i have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again 1 
my 810 score is mostly for the plot 1 
i dont have to be an accountant to know im getting screwed 0 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
its a sad movie but very good 1 
im in az all the time and now have my new spot 1 
my breakfast was perpared great with a beautiful presentation of 3 giant slices of toast lightly dusted with powdered sugar 1 
you get extra minutes so that you can carry out the call and not get cut off 1 
the selection on the menu was great and so were the prices 1 
i am going to have to be the first to negatively review this product 0 
it was way over fried 0 
if you do go see this movie bring a pillow or a girlfriendboyfriend to keep you occupied through out 0 
after 20 minutes wait i got a table 0 
highly recommended a 1 
otherwise dont even waste your time on this 0 
ive never been treated so bad 0 
piece of trash 0 
funny clever hip just like prays previous film hype 1 
nice case feels good in your hands 1 
about 30 minutes of footage is wasted to show mediocre elderly actors awkwardly babbling overwrought pseudosatanic gibberish corny enough to make a teen goth blush almost always in olde english and sometimes in latin that may or may not be made up words 0 
this wonderful experience made this place a muststop whenever we are in town again 1 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
all in all ha long bay was a bit of a flop 0 
this particular model would not work with my motorola q smartphone 0 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
these are the nicest restaurant owners ive ever come across 1 
i felt asleep the first time i watched it so i can recommend it for insomniacs 0 
just really good so far probably the best bt headset i have ever had 1 
very unreliable service from tmobile 0 
i enjoyed it 1 
i am a fan of his this movie sucked really bad 0 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
a bit predictable 0 
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 
first of all it doesnt wear well 0 
both films are terrible but to the credit of the 1986 version it was watchable 0 
fantastic food 1 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
there is a lot of beautiful places 1 
some may say this buffet is pricey but i think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot 1 
i believe every one should see this movie as i think few people outside of south africa understand its past and what is being attempted in the truth and reconciliation process 1 
works for me 1 
shrimp when i unwrapped it i live only 12 a mile from brushfire it was literally ice cold 0 
interesting decor 1 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
avoid this establishment 0 
my rating just 3 out of 10 0 
i swung in to give them a try but was deeply disappointed 0 
it didnt make me scared horrified or make me sympathetic towards the characters it was simply annoying 0 
on the negative its insipid enough to cause regret for another 2 hours of life wasted in front of the screen 0 
another thing i didnt really like is when a character got punched in the face a gallon of blood would spew forth soon after 0 
i was particularly pleased with the acting ability of dwight schultz 1 
great price too 1 
feelings thoughtsgabriels discomfort during the danceall these intangibles leap to life and come within the viewers grasp in hustons portrayal 1 
if i take a picture the battery drops a bar and starts beeping letting me know its dieing 0 
the interplay between martin and emilio contains the same wonderful chemistry we saw in wall street with martin and charlie 1 
i have two more years left in this contract and i hate this phone 0 
doesnt work 0 
but this movie is definitely a below average rent 0 
also the story and acting were weak 0 
good quality 1 
i like armand assante my cable companys summary sounded interesting so i watched it twice already and probably will again 1 
the memories are murky but i can only say that i enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show 1 
an awesome new look for fall 2000 1 
this totally unfunny movie is so over the top and pathetic and unrealistic that throughout the whole 90 minutes of utter torture i probably looked at my watch about 70000 times 0 
item arrived quickly and works great with my metro pcs samsung schr450 slider phone and sony premium sound in ear plugs 1 
jawbone era is awesome too 1 
the headsets are easy to use and everyone loves them 1 
an instant classic with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits 1 
better than expected 1 
this phone might well be the worst ive ever had in any brand 0 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
1010 1 
a truly truly bad film 0 
i was hoping for more 0 
i believe the screenwriter did a good job of tying up the loose ends 1 
i didnt realize how wonderful the short really is until the last two scenes 1 
its a piece of crap 0 
arrived quickly and much less expensive than others being sold 1 
and the beans and rice were mediocre at best 0 
it fits so securely that the ear hook does not even need to be used and the sound is better directed through your ear canal 1 
the keyboard is a nice compromise between a full qwerty and the basic cell phone number keypad 1 
the servers went back and forth several times not even so much as an are you being helped 0 
i cant believe theres even a sequel to this 0 
just really good so far probably the best bt headset i have ever had 1 
id like to return it 0 
definitely a turn off for me i doubt ill be back unless someone else is buying 0 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
this totally unfunny movie is so over the top and pathetic and unrealistic that throughout the whole 90 minutes of utter torture i probably looked at my watch about 70000 times 0 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
the price is reasonable and the service is great 1 
were jerks on the phone 0 
punishment park is a brilliant piece of cinema 1 
the acting is fantastic the stories are seamlessly woven together and the dogs are splendid a must rent view or see 1 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
just as good as when i had it more than a year ago 1 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
but above all the exquisite visual composition of each moment with inventive and elegant use of closeup camera angle and lighting including pointillistic faux home movie footage is a wonder and joy to behold 1 
from what my dinner companions told meeverything was very fresh with nice texture and taste 1 
battery lasts only a few hours 0 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
i consider this theft 0 
that just screams legit in my booksomethats also pretty rare here in vegas 1 
hands down my favorite italian restaurant 1 
good food good service 1 
but i thought his acting was skilled 1 
the shower area is outside so you can only rinse not take a full shower unless you dont mind being nude for everyone to see 0 
this is an unbelievable bargain 1

after i pulled up my car i waited for another 15 minutes before being acknowledged 0 
i recently tried caballeros and i have been back every week since 1 
the owners really really need to quit being soooooo cheap let them wrap my freaking sandwich in two papers not one 0 
after watching this film i wanted to learn more about the works of this artist 1 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
after charging overnight these batteries work great 1 
ive missed numerous calls because of this reason 0 
i was seated immediately 1

this item worked great but it broke after 6 months of use 0 
greatno problems at all 1 
the cast is good 1 
love this product 1 
it dit not work most of the time with my nokia 5320 0 
we wont be going back anytime soon 0 
the movie has almost no action scenes in it and very little comedy 0 
not worth it 0 
fits comfortably came with three sizes of earbud tips 1 
the inside is really quite nice and very clean 1 
the awful dialogue and hopeless overacting by everyone who gets shot top off a real waste of space and time 0 
a great way to finish a great 1 
my sister has one also and she loves it 1 
my wife had the lobster bisque soup which was lukewarm 0 
this phone tries very hard to do everything but fails at its very ability to be a phone 0 
good service very clean and inexpensive to boot 1 
dessert panna cotta was amazing 1 
i really recommend this faceplates since it looks very nice elegant and cool 1 
doesnt work 0 
hands down my favorite italian restaurant 1 
it was so funny 1 
you get extra minutes so that you can carry out the call and not get cut off 1 
good case 1 
disappointing accessory from a good manufacturer 0 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
everything about this film is simply incredible 1 
i wont spoil it but the ending in pretty amazing 1 
however after finally watching this film i realized that not only had i had a closed mind to the brilliance it depicts i also found myself watching it over and over again 1 
you wont regret it 1 
clear skype calls long battery life long range 1 
i even dropped this phone into a stream and it was submerged for 15 seconds and it still works great 1 
setup couldnt have been simpler 1 
i would advise to not purchase this item it never worked very well 0 
the first time i ever came here i had an amazing experience i still tell people how awesome the duck was 1 
i have only had it for a few weeks but so far so good 1 
clever and a real crowdpleaserthis film still ranks among mickeys best films even after 80 wonderful years 1 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
this was my first time and i cant wait until the next 1 
it is a joy to use 1 
the volume switch rocketed out of the unit to a destination unknown 0 
nonlinear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well 1 
i also didnt like the on button it felt like it would crack with use 0 
i have been to very few places to eat that under no circumstances would i ever return to and this tops the list 0 
although i very much liked the look and sound of this place the actual experience was a bit disappointing 0 
this movie is greatespecially if you enjoy visual arts 1 
i wont spoil it but the ending in pretty amazing 1 
eew this location needs a complete overhaul 0 
some great music and terrific scenery 1 
there is nothing authentic about this place 0 
some applause should be given to the prelude however 1 
dont do it 0 
i had a pretty satifying experience 1 
the service was not up to par either 0 
the tracfonewebsite is user friendly and makes it easy toactivate etc 1 
soyo technology sucks 0 
i kept looking at the time and it had soon become 35 minutes yet still no food 0 
in fact this stinker smells like a directtovideo release 0 
my boyfriend and i came here for the first time on a recent trip to vegas and could not have been more pleased with the quality of food and service 1 
it never condescends all the characters have good genuine hearts and believable problems 1 
the jamaican mojitos are delicious 1 
i had heard good things about this place but it exceeding every hope i could have dreamed of 1 
and his subtle connections between the three films are awesome 1 
the potatoes were like rubber and you could tell they had been made up ahead of time being kept under a warmer 0 
this is a masterful piece of filmmaking with many themes simmering and occasionally boiling over in this warts and all study of the poets bohemian selfindulgent wartime years that span the aerial bombardments of london and the outward tranquillity of a welsh coastal retreat the borderlines between friendship lust and love dedication to art and experience versus practical concerns jealousy rivalry cowardice and egotism versus heroism and selfsacrifice and more 1 
works great 1 
so absolutley fantastic 1 
if you stay in vegas you must get breakfast here at least once 1 
i came over from verizon because cingulair has nicer cell phones the first thing i noticed was the really bad service 0 
this movie is greatespecially if you enjoy visual arts 1 
i gave it 5 stars because of the sound quality 1 
i really dont see how anyone could enjoy this movie 0 
but this movie really got to me 1 
phenomenal food service and ambiance 1 
you need two hands to operate the screenthis software interface is decade old and cannot compete with new software designs 0 
my only problem is i thought the actor playing the villain was a low rent michael ironside 0 
so far so good 1 
anyways the food was definitely not filling at all and for the price you pay you should expect more 0 
as always the evening was wonderful and the food delicious 1 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
everything about it is just bad 0 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
once your food arrives its meh 0 
to sum the film up breeders is a terrible cheaply made horror movie that should be avoided like the ebola virus 0 
their chow mein is so good 1 
this is a great place to eat 1 
bad reception 0 
this is the phone to get for 2005 i just bought my s710a and all i can say is wow 1 
would not reccommend 0 
i wouldnt see this movie again for free 0 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
it clicks into place in a way that makes you wonder how long that mechanism would last 0 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
great brunch spot 1 
the staff are great the ambiance is great 1 
yes i am simplifying things here for the sake of brevity for this really is at the core of the problems with this film it has too much going on without any real fulfilling explanation 0 
razr battery good buy 1 
damn good steak 1 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
very serious spoilers this movie was a huge disappointment 0 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
ill put this gem up against any movie in terms of screenplay cinematography acting postproduction editing directing or any other aspect of filmmaking 1 
fits comfortably came with three sizes of earbud tips 1 
there is no plot or storyline 0 
what makes this story different are the terrific production values faultless photography composition and editing the terrific casting the underappreciated brian keith playing a bully teddy and vivid history 1 
the movie has almost no action scenes in it and very little comedy 0 
the screen does get smudged easily because it touches your ear and face 0 
however my girl was complain that some time the phone doesnt wake up like normal phone does 0 
id love to go back 1 
in an interesting part of town this place is amazing 1 
there are the usual hitchcock logic flaws 0 
each day of the week they have a different deal and its all so delicious 1 
ive only had my bluetooth for a few weeks but i really like it 1 
great value 1 
dont waste your money and time 0 
i contacted the company and they told me that although the unit was still under warranty if i couldnt produce my receipt i was out of luck 0 
it had some average acting from the main person and it was a low budget as you clearly can see 0 
often the dialogue doesnt really follow from one line to another or fit the surroundings 0 
if there were zero stars i would give it zero stars 0 
ive had this bluetoooth headset for some time now and still not comfortable with the way it fits on the ear 0 
the construction of the headsets is poor 0 
this was like the final blow 0 
the potatoes were great and so was the biscuit 1 
i loved it it was really scary 1 
i was hoping for more 0 
i paid the bill but did not tip because i felt the server did a terrible job 0 
best service and food ever maria our server was so good and friendly she made our day 1 
then the film just dropped the ball 0 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
each track commands sentiment actually contributing to the scenes and characters 1 
design flaw 0 
car charger as well as ac charger are included to make sure you never run out of juicehighy recommended 1 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
i would highly recommend this product 1 
price is good too 1 
i am very happy 1 
i love the look and feel of samsung flipphones 1 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
my boyfriend and i sat at the bar and had a completely delightful experience 1 
good audio quality 1 
the food amazing 1 
first of all it doesnt wear well 0 
the secondary plot line is incomprehensible and its relation to the primary plot line is mystifying 0 
this is my new fav vegas buffet spot 1 
would come back again if i had a sushi craving while in vegas 1 
very prompt service 1 
unfortunately cover girl is an example of how hollywood used to exploit women for financial gain 0 
i promise they wont disappoint 1 
but i thought his acting was skilled 1 
thanks again to amazon for having the things i need for a good price 1 
another note about this phones appearance is that it really looks rather bland especially in the all black model 0 
in the span of an hour i had two people exclaim whoa is that the new phone on tv 1 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
for that price i can think of a few place i would have much rather gone 0 
good case excellent value 1 
very disappointed and wondered how it could be in the oscar shortlist 0 
if you havent choked in your own vomit by the end by all the cheap drama and worthless dialogue youve must have bored yourself to death with this waste of time 0 
sound quality on both end is excellent i use headset to call my wife and ask my wife to use headset to call me 2 1 
great steak great sides great wine amazing desserts 1 
crust is not good 0 
of course the acting is blah 0 
this results in the phone being either stuck at max volume or mute 0 
we loved the place 1 
the characters are interesting and you want to find out more about them the longer the movie goes on and i think people will be surprised by who does and doesnt make it 1 
so good i am going to have to review this place twice once hereas a tribute to the place and once as a tribute to an event held here last night 1 
really good product 1 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
you learn a lot about the real inside emotions of people in this movie and a lot about the movie business itself 1 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
i have to mention this and it is a huge spoiler i loved the ending how all the characters of the three films were the remaining survivors of the ferry disaster with valentine and the young judge together and the old man watching it on her tv solidifying his happiness over the suffering which he dealt with for those many years 1 
its a sad movie but very good 1 
this movie does an excellent job of revealing the complexity of the task and the incredible challenges facing south africa 1 
a piece of cinematic garbage captured on celluloid 0 
nargile i think you are great 1 
the worst experience ever 0 
the sangria was about half of a glass wine full and was 12 ridiculous 0 
the construction of the headsets is poor 0 
echo problemvery unsatisfactory 0 
its one of the most boring horror movies from the 90s mainly because it starts slow and centers in a boring atmosphere 0 
the jalapeno bacon is soooo good 1 
the stories were as unbelievable as the actors 0 
the movie has almost no action scenes in it and very little comedy 0 
brilliance indeed 1 
its quite simply the highest most superlative form of cinema imaginable 1 
the reception is excellent 1 
lovely little thriller from hitchcock with lots of nice shenanigans surrounding a murdered spy a kidnapped child a nasty church a foreign plot and some random taxidermists 1 
rude inconsiderate management 0 
terrible phone holder 0 
this place lacked style 0 
this place receives stars for their appetizers 1 
battery is holding up well 1 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
this product is great it makes working a lot easier i can go to the copier while waiting on hold for something 1 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
i enjoyed reading this book to my children when they were little 1 
mobile phone tools are a must have 1 
thus far have only visited twice and the food was absolutely delicious each time 1 
an awesome new look for fall 2000 1 
i sat riveted to the tv screen 1 
the best place in vegas for breakfast just check out a sat or sun 1 
problem is that the ear loops are made of weak material and break easily 0 
the movie has almost no action scenes in it and very little comedy 0 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
i will be back many times soon 1 
1 long lasting battery you dont have to recharge it as frequentyly as some of the flip phones2 0 
started watching this but didnt believe in any of the characters 0 
good value works fine power via usb car or wall outlet 1 
it plays louder than any other speaker of this size the price is so low that most would think the quality is lacking however its not 1 
trying to make a call on these is an exercise in frustration 0 
every thing on phone work perfectly she like it 1 
punishment park is a brilliant piece of cinema 1 
i ordered the voodoo pasta and it was the first time id had really excellent pasta since going gluten free several years ago 1 
the chains which im no fan of beat this place easily 0 
sprint charges for this service 0 
it is the best charger i have seen on the market yet 1 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
it was pretty gross 0 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
and his subtle connections between the three films are awesome 1 
not good by any stretch of the imagination 0 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
a very good film indeed about great and unconditional love 1 
those phones are working just fine now 1 
i do love sushi but i found kabuki to be overpriced overhip and underservices 0 
blue ant is easy to use 1 
all the characters in this film are tremendously well played 1 
also the story and acting were weak 0 
integrated seamlessly with the motorola razr phone 1 
good audio quality 1 
its kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly its embarrassing how childlike the company is 0 
macbeth jason connery moved me to tears with his final monolog out brief candle outhe gave the sphere of moral decay and dark forces a human face which makes it the more interesting 1 
summary the witticisms werent witty 0 
best headset ever 1 
items stated as included from the description are not included 0 
everything was perfect the night we were in 1 
bad reception 0 
a cheap and cheerless heist movie with poor characterisation lots of underbite style stoic emoting think chow yun fat in a better tomorrow and some cheesy clichés thrown into an abandoned factory ready for a few poorly executed flying judo rolls a la john woo 0 
this movie suffered because of the writing it needed more suspense 0 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
good service very clean and inexpensive to boot 1 
it probably would have been better if the director hadnt spent most of the movie showcasing his own art work which really isnt that noteworthy 0 
there were too many close ups 0 
attempting artiness with black white and clever camera angles the movie disappointed became even more ridiculous as the acting was poor and the plot and lines almost nonexistent 0 
the film is well paced understated and one of the best courtroom documentaries ive seen 1 
great food and great service in a clean and friendly setting 1 
buyerbe very careful 0 
babie bop is very cute 1 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
the burger i got the gold standard a 17 burger and was kind of disappointed 0 
i connected my wifes bluetoothmotorola hs850 to my phone and it worked like a charm whether the phone was in my pocket or the case 1 
i think it was robert ryans best film because he portrayed someone like my father and he was a schizophrenic in real lifemy father although he never murdered anyone but was affected more so during the second world war which made him worse 1 
doesnt do the job 0 
on the good side the staff was genuinely pleasant and enthusiastic a real treat 1 
50 down the drain 0 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
it just blew 0 
very poor service 0 
the lead man is charismafree 0 
steve martin delivers a really funny performance of a middleaged upper class uptight white guy 1 
i will continue to come here on ladies night andddd date night highly recommend this place to anyone who is in the area 1 
audio quality is poor very poor 0 
the story starts too fast with absolutely no suspense or buildup in the slightest 0 
not my thing 0 
with great sound effects and impressive special effects i cant recommend this movie enough 1 
i got it because it was so small and adorable 1 
the stories were powerful explorations of the nature of man and of art 1 
even if you love bad movies do not watch this movie 0 
i agree with jessica this movie is pretty bad 0 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
for that its worth checking out 1 
this is a stunning movie 1 
i know that sounds funny but to me it seemed like sketchy technology that wouldnt work wellwell this one works great 1 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
excellent product for the price 1 
first time there and might just be the last 0 
the atmosphere was great with a lovely duo of violinists playing songs we requested 1 
this is a great place to eat 1 
his performance is simply genius 1 
you cant beat that 1 
i have read others reviews here but i havent had any problem with it 1 
the tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu 0 
this is essentially a communications tool that does not communicate 0 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
highly recommend for any one who has a blue tooth phone 1 
the acting is beyond abysmal 0 
this is a very average phone with bad battery life that operates on a weak network 0 
i found this place by accident and i could not be happier 1 
howeverthe riingtones are not the best and neither are the games 0 
best breakfast buffet 1 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
as i said abovepretty useless 0 
the food was excellent and service was very good 1 
customer service was terrible 0 
poor construction 0 
disappointed 0 
no ear loop needed its tiny and the sound is great 1 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
i couldnt think of a better way to end the film but a smile on my face great way to wrap up an amazing film and trilogy 1 
great bluetooth 1 
too bad cause i know its family owned i really wanted to like this place 0 
the buttons for on and off are bad 0 
good audio quality 1 
this would not even be good as a made for tv flick 0 
still its quite interesting and entertaining to follow 1 
thats how id describe this painfully dreary timewaster of a film 0 
this scene is very strong and unpleasant 0 
this place is not quality sushi it is not a quality restaurant 0 
i am a fan of his this movie sucked really bad 0 
service is perfect and the family atmosphere is nice to see 1 
thus far have only visited twice and the food was absolutely delicious each time 1 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
highly recommended for all ages although the younger set will probably not appreciate some of the more subtle references they will certainly appreciate one galley scene in particular 1 
i received my headset in good time and was happy with it 1 
the best place in vegas for breakfast just check out a sat or sun 1 
poor sound quality 0 
summary the witticisms werent witty 0 
cinematography the film was shot in an interesting way 1 
reception is terrible and full of static 0 
definitely not worth the 3 i paid 0 
the films dialogue is natural real to life 1 
dont waste your money and time 0 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
really good product 1 
the soundtrack sucked 0 
those phones are working just fine now 1 
i would not recommend this place 0 
i thought errol flynn was brilliant as custer and has since become my favourite actor 1 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
lets start with all the problemsthe acting especially from the lead professor was very very bad 0 
i even dropped this phone into a stream and it was submerged for 15 seconds and it still works great 1 
good case excellent value 1 
they keep getting better and better this is my third one and ive had numerous palms too 1 
the acting is beyond abysmal 0 
oh this is such a thing of beauty this restaurant 1 
it was either too cold not enough flavor or just bad 0 
unfortunately this is a bad movie that is just plain bad 0 
my 810 score is mostly for the plot 1 
the movie was very interesting from beginning to the end 1 
obviously they have a terrible customer service so you get what you pay for 0 
the films dialogue is natural real to life 1 
i highly recommend this case 1 
the acting is beyond abysmal 0 
im trying to return it for a refund 0 
for a product that costs as much as this one does i expect it to work far better and with greater ease than this thing does 0 
my girlfriends veal was very bad 0 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
good price 1 
you get what you pay for i guess 0 
its like a bad two hour tv movie 0 
the stories were powerful explorations of the nature of man and of art 1 
the food is about on par with dennys which is to say not good at all 0 
items stated as included from the description are not included 0 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
either way it sucks 0 
feelings thoughtsgabriels discomfort during the danceall these intangibles leap to life and come within the viewers grasp in hustons portrayal 1 
started watching this but didnt believe in any of the characters 0 
i guess it was supposed to be clever twist then shed some light on the situation but it was just stupid 0 
seriously flavorful delights folks 1 
whatever prompted such a documentary is beyond me 0 
clear skype calls long battery life long range 1 
its a sad movie but very good 1 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
this place is not quality sushi it is not a quality restaurant 0 
i am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this 1 
a good commentary of todays love and undoubtedly a film worth seeing 1 
shes poised and amazing 1 
he came running after us when he realized my husband had left his sunglasses on the table 1 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
i will be back many times soon 1 
the worst was the salmon sashimi 0 
the salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop which was perfectly cooked 1 
the phone is sturdy and waterproof 1 
another note about this phones appearance is that it really looks rather bland especially in the all black model 0 
it was a pale color instead of nice and char and has no flavor 0 
i hate those things as much as cheap quality black olives 0 
crash is a depressing little nothing that provokes emotion but teaches you nothing if you already know racism and prejudice are bad things 0 
the burger is good beef cooked just right 1 
what a mistake 0 
someone shouldve invented this sooner 1 
battery life is also great 1 
they keep getting better and better this is my third one and ive had numerous palms too 1 
i would recommend it 1 
phenomenal food service and ambiance 1 
will not be back 0 
when achille and philippa beautifully sing a duet from don giovanni that perfectly describes their situation in the movie you appreciate the subtle layers of this excellent film 1 
seller shipped quickly and much cheaper than the competitors 1 
level 5 spicy was perfect where spice didnt overwhelm the soup 1 
everything was good and tasty 1 
ray charles is legendary 1 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
restaurant is always full but never a wait 1 
his losing his marbles so early in the proceedings is totally implausible and unconvincing 0 
love this headset 1 
i wear glasses and it fits fine with them 1 
this was one of the worst films i have ever seen 0 
the potatoes were like rubber and you could tell they had been made up ahead of time being kept under a warmer 0 
however after seeing the short again after about 25 years i was amazed at how timeless the film actually is 1 
i am very impressed with the job that motorola did on the sturdiness of this phone 1 
i especially liked the noncliche choices with the parents in other movies i could predict the dialog verbatim but the writing in this movie made better selections 1 
after i pulled up my car i waited for another 15 minutes before being acknowledged 0 
i use this product in a motor control center where there is a lot of high voltage humming from the equipment and it works great 1 
her lines seem to have been written by a fifteen year old though they are trying oh so so hard to sound like how a fifteen year old would really um you know well talk 0 
this was such an awesome movie that i bought it off of ebay 1 
this company charge me a restocking fee and still not given me my refund back 0 
the construction of the headsets is poor 0 
nice design and quality 1 
bad day or not i have a very low tolerance for rude customer service people it is your job to be nice and polite wash dishes otherwise 0 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
2 thumbs up to this seller 1 
and if that isnt enough of a mess of a movie for you the picture is also marred with a constant use of studio sets and indoor exteriors 0 
secondly hitchcock pretty much perfected the thriller and chase movie 1 
my sanyo has survived dozens of drops on blacktop without ill effect 1 
i really do recommend this place you can go wrong with this donut place 1 
we ordered the duck rare and it was pink and tender on the inside with a nice char on the outside 1 
no one at the table thought the food was above average or worth the wait that we had for it 0 
this is just a great movie 1 
it is rare when a filmmaker takes the time to tell a worthy moral tale with care and love that doesnt fall into the trap of being overly syrupy or over indulgent 1 
waitress was good though 1 
lot of holes in the plot theres nothing about how he became the emperor nothing about where he spend 20 years between his childhood and mature age 0 
the range is very decent ive been able to roam around my house with the phone in the living room with no receptionsound quality issues 1 
we recently witnessed her poor quality of management towards other guests as well 0 
im in az all the time and now have my new spot 1 
it is very educational for children 1 to 8 years old 1 
omit watching this 0 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
this item is great installed it let it charged up overnite and it has been working good every since with no problems 1 
those phones are working just fine now 1 
id rather eat airline food seriously 0 
problem is that the ear loops are made of weak material and break easily 0 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
phenomenal food service and ambiance 1 
worked perfectly 1 
i dont like this nokia either 0 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
well never go again 0 
the movie is not completely perfect but titta di girolamo will stay with you for a long time after the vision of the movie 1 
i was hoping for more 0 
this place receives stars for their appetizers 1 
the decor is nice and the piano music soundtrack is pleasant 1 
i had heard good things about this place but it exceeding every hope i could have dreamed of 1 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
earbud piece breaks easily 0 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
very unreliable service from tmobile 0 
not even a hello we will be right with you 0 
just really good so far probably the best bt headset i have ever had 1 
so just beware 0 
it makes very strange ticking noises before it ends the call 0 
overall i wasnt very impressed with noca 0 
i enjoyed it 1 
i hope this place sticks around 1 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
the first thing that happened was that the tracking was off 0 
as many people complained i found this headsets microphone was very weak 0 
highquality chicken on the chicken caesar salad 1 
it didnt work people can not hear me when i talk 0 
generally it just lacked imagination 0 
dont waste your money 0 
overall a great experience 1 
the voice recognition thru the handset is excellent 1 
the server was very negligent of our needs and made us feel very unwelcome i would not suggest this place 0 
ample portions and good prices 1 
not only did the software do a great job of this i could also make my own ringtones form my existing cds without an internet connection 1 
the scallop dish is quite appalling for value as well 0 
food was delicious 1 
good value works fine power via usb car or wall outlet 1 
easy to pair with my samsung cell 1 
my fella got the huevos rancheros and they didnt look too appealing 0 
the telephone repair man was really funny and his reactions to the nuts and bitchy boss were truly genuine 1 
actually the graphics were good at the time 1 
recommend with confidence 1 
the fries were great too 1 
the sides are delish mixed mushrooms yukon gold puree white corn beateous 1 
nicest chinese restaurant ive been in a while 1 
the owner used to work at nobu so this place is really similar for half the price 1 
i guess i liked the details of his dysfunctionhe was believable 1 
unfortunately inexperience of direction meant that scene after scene passed with little in the way of dramatic tension or conflict 0 
good service very clean and inexpensive to boot 1 
im really disappointed all i have now is a charger that doesnt work 0 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
i can assure you that you wont be disappointed 1 
everyone is very attentive providing excellent customer service 1 
the cast is always entertaining as usual 1 
this is one of the worst sandra bullock movie since speed 2 but not quite that bad 0 
great price also 1 
its extremely slow and takes forever to do anything with it 0 
painful on the ear 0 
i never come again 0 
ill even say it again  this is torture 0 
i would highly recommend this product 1 
i rate this movie 910 1 
now imagine that every single one of those decisions was made wrong 0 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
works as described 1 
i will never go back to this place and will never ever recommended this place to anyone 0 
the nachos are a must have 1 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
go and see it 1 
frankly after cotton club and unfaithful it was kind of embarrassing to watch lane and gere in this film because it is bad 0 
lastly the mozzarella sticks they were the best thing we ordered 1 
i just dont know how this place managed to served the blandest food i have ever eaten when they are preparing indian cuisine 0 
after trying many many handsfree gadgets this is the one that finally works well 1 
very funny 1 
phone now holds charge like it did when it was new 1 
im still infatuated with this phone 1 
obviously they have a terrible customer service so you get what you pay for 0 
not worth it 0 
i dont think ill be running back to carlys anytime soon for food 0 
there is so much good food in vegas that i feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to rice and company 0 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
but i thought his acting was skilled 1 
this place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver 0 
works for me 1 
the story line is just awful 0 
poor sound quality 0 
not good when wearing a hat or sunglasses 0 
there is nothing authentic about this place 0 
this movie does an excellent job of revealing the complexity of the task and the incredible challenges facing south africa 1 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
a lot of websites have been rating this a very good phone and so do i 1 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
no real improvement 0 
clear skype calls long battery life long range 1 
this is my new fav vegas buffet spot 1 
it is a really good show to watch 1 
also the area where my unit broke im not too fond of the magnetic strap 0 
superb phone on a great network 1 
bad reception 0 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
the staff are also very friendly and efficient 1 
this is high adventure at its best 1 
if you look for authentic thai food go else where 0 
cinematography noteworthy including fine views of barcelona and its famed gaudi towers 1 
coming here is like experiencing an underwhelming relationship where both parties cant wait for the other person to ask to break up 0 
the only place good for this film is in the garbage 0 
his performance as awarded was stunning 1 
nobody identifies with these characters because theyre all cardboard cutouts and stereotypes or predictably reversestereotypes 0 
that company is a joke 0 
i just dont know how this place managed to served the blandest food i have ever eaten when they are preparing indian cuisine 0 
the macarons here are insanely good 1 
the tracfonewebsite is user friendly and makes it easy toactivate etc 1 
great pork sandwich 1 
setup went very smoothly 1 
for readers who have already seen one of miyazakis films he is still in top form and made another worthwhile experience 1 
nice leather 1 
very bad experience 0 
it doesnt make you look cool 0 
when a song could explain the emotions of the subjects better such as when jay adams unfortunate life was a subject of talk the song old man by neil young was played which evokes many emotions 1 
improper description i had to return it 0 
terrible service 0 
worst ever 0 
steamboat willie is an amazingly important film to our cinema history 1 
i seriously cannot believe that the owner has so many unexperienced employees that all are running around like chickens with their heads cut off 0 
i wear glasses and it fits fine with them 1 
hence the whole story lacks a certain energy 0 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
not a good bargain 0 
his losing his marbles so early in the proceedings is totally implausible and unconvincing 0 
definitely will come back here again 1 
to sum the film up breeders is a terrible cheaply made horror movie that should be avoided like the ebola virus 0 
i tried talking real loud but shouting on the telephone gets old and i was still told it wasnt great 0 
youd have to have the iq of particularly stupid mollusk not to see that one coming 0 
it has everything i need and i couldnt ask for more 1 
good show samsung 1 
i gave it a 10 1 
what a disappointment 0 
not good when wearing a hat or sunglasses 0 
the han nan chicken was also very tasty 1 
really bad 0 
this place deserves no stars 0 
cant store anything but phone numbers to sim 0 
the portion was huge 1 
battery chargelife is quite long 1 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
amazon sucks 0 
i was very excited to get this headset because i thought it was really cute 1 
i love this thing 1 
will definitely be back 1 
the food was delicious our bartender was attentive and personable and we got a great deal 1 
will order from them again 1 
now this dish was quite flavourful 1 
the phone is sturdy and waterproof 1 
no ear loop needed its tiny and the sound is great 1 
the food is very good for your typical bar food 1 
not nearly as good looking as the amazon picture makes it look 0 
it is a really good show to watch 1 
there are massive levels massive unlockable characters its just a massive game 1 
it was probably dirt 0 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
nargile i think you are great 1 
i advise everyone do not be fooled 0 
the food was terrible 0 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
it really created a unique feeling though 1 
it was a pale color instead of nice and char and has no flavor 0 
nice ambiance 1 
wonderful lil tapas and the ambience made me feel all warm and fuzzy inside 1 
an interesting premise and billy drago is always good as a dangerous nutbag side note id love to see drago stephen mchattie and lance hendrikson in a flick together talk about raging cheekbones 1 
i think it was robert ryans best film because he portrayed someone like my father and he was a schizophrenic in real lifemy father although he never murdered anyone but was affected more so during the second world war which made him worse 1 
otherwise easy to install and use clear sound 1 
the presentation of the food was awful 0 
their menu is diverse and reasonably priced 1 
by this time our side of the restaurant was almost empty so there was no excuse 0 
the phone was unusable and was not new 0 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
dont do it 0 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
i use this product in a motor control center where there is a lot of high voltage humming from the equipment and it works great 1 
in a word it is embarrassing 0 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
the price is reasonable and the service is great 1 
their monster chicken fried steak and eggs is my all time favorite 1 
we would recommend these to others 1 
i immediately said i wanted to talk to the manager but i did not want to talk to the guy who was doing shots of fireball behind the bar 0 
the bathroom is just next door and very nice 1 
i felt asleep the first time i watched it so i can recommend it for insomniacs 0 
dont waste your time here 0 
the pizza selections are good 1 
my boyfriend tried the mediterranean chicken salad and fell in love 1 
despite the pans of reviewers i liked this movie 1 
great atmosphere friendly and fast service 1 
the only place good for this film is in the garbage 0 
its fits like a glove and is strong secure and durable 1 
definitely will come back here again 1 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
nevertheless yet another wonderful film from the great masters stable 1 
mediocre food 0 
very convenient since we were staying at the mgm 1 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
very slow at seating even with reservation 0 
being a 90s child i truly enjoyed this show and i can proudly say that i enjoyed it big time and even more than the classical wb cartoons 1 
great pork sandwich 1 
bluetooth range is good a few days ago i left my phone in the trunk got a call and carried the conversation without a hitch 1 
the movie in movie situations in the beginning and through the game that is played with her by the acting coach are fascinating 1 
this is hands down the best phone ive ever had 1 
i checked out this place a couple years ago and was not impressed 0 
you truly take this journey through the eyes and soul of a child 1 
so absolutley fantastic 1 
i got home to see the driest damn wings ever 0 
all this movie does is make you sick watching all these slackers make excuses for their stupid actions for 90 minutes 0 
i believe the screenwriter did a good job of tying up the loose ends 1 
there is a lot of beautiful places 1 
the worst one of the series 0 
the food amazing 1 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
i do think tom hanks is a good actor 1 
very good lunch spot 1 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
avoid this one if you can 0 
everything was fresh and delicious 1 
we will not be coming back 0 
jawbone era is awesome too 1 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
even in my bmw 3 series which is fairly quiet i have trouble hearing what the other person is saying 0 
great phone 1 
before i go in to why i gave a 1 star rating please know that this was my third time eating at bachi burger before writing a review 0 
but this movie really got to me 1 
for service i give them no stars 0 
i checked out this place a couple years ago and was not impressed 0 
pretty piece of junk 0 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
i mean in a realistic world she would never have gotten into that ballet repertory the whole thing was quite pathetic 0 
i had about two bites and refused to eat anymore 0 
there was no chemistry between ben affleck and sandra bullock in this film and i couldnt understand why he would consider even leaving his wifetobe for this chick that he supposedly was knocked out by 0 
one more thing i can tolerate political incorrectness very well im all for artistic freedom and suspension of disbelief but the slavic female character was just too much 0 
i want my money back 0 
doesnt last long 0 
even in my bmw 3 series which is fairly quiet i have trouble hearing what the other person is saying 0 
the kids are annoying 0 
you cant beat that 1 
the bus boy on the other hand was so rude 0 
ryans bar is definitely one edinburgh establishment i wont be revisiting 0 
poor quality 0 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
it was a pale color instead of nice and char and has no flavor 0 
very prompt service 1 
you will leave the theater wanting to go out and dance under the stars 1 
what a big waste of time 0 
i have purchased these for both family and friends and all enjoy their clarity and ease of use 1 
definitely worth checking out 1 
interesting decor 1 
the battery is unreliable as well as the service use antena 0 
awesome service and food 1 
in the summer you can dine in a charming outdoor patio so very delightful 1 
the only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port irda 0 
often the dialogue doesnt really follow from one line to another or fit the surroundings 0 
my first visit to hiro was a delight 1 
however my girl was complain that some time the phone doesnt wake up like normal phone does 0 
best headset ever 1 
someone shouldve invented this sooner 1 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
tied to charger for conversations lasting more than 45 minutesmajor problems 0 
everything about this product is wrongfirst 0 
the only consistent thread holding the series together were the amazing performances of leni parker and anita laselva as the two taelons in quiet idealogical conflict 0 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
ryans bar is definitely one edinburgh establishment i wont be revisiting 0 
when it opens the battery connection is broken and the device is turned off 0 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
waste of 13 bucks 0 
i would recommend purchasing the jabra jx10 series 2 which works flawlessly with my moto q go figure 1 
reception is terrible and full of static 0 
there are massive levels massive unlockable characters its just a massive game 1 
we wont be going back 0 
first of all there are enough racial stereotypes and racial jokes to offend everyone 0 
i heart this place 1 
having trouble with volume 0 
waste of money 0 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
raw and sublimely moving 1 
an hour and a half i wish i could bring back 0 
anne heche was utterly convincing 1 
but even the talented carrell cant save this 0 
basically the service was very bad 0 
audio quality is poor very poor 0 
i especially liked the noncliche choices with the parents in other movies i could predict the dialog verbatim but the writing in this movie made better selections 1 
everyone is very attentive providing excellent customer service 1 
when i placed my treo into the case not only was it not snug but there was a lot of extra room on the sides 0 
first of all there are enough racial stereotypes and racial jokes to offend everyone 0 
im probably one of the few people to ever go to ians and not like it 0 
we wont be returning 0 
ill definitely be in soon again 1 
if you are looking for a good quality motorola headset keep looking this isnt it 0 
1 long lasting battery you dont have to recharge it as frequentyly as some of the flip phones2 0 
ive had this bluetoooth headset for some time now and still not comfortable with the way it fits on the ear 0 
does not fit 0 
to summarize the food was incredible nay transcendant but nothing brings me joy quite like the memory of the pneumatic condiment dispenser 1 
i just cant explain this movie more than romanticcharminghilariousand adorablethe junkyard scenes are funnyall the junkyard dogs have something specialtoo funny i laughedkids will love itbuy it when it comes outit has new features 1 
if you do go see this movie bring a pillow or a girlfriendboyfriend to keep you occupied through out 0 
i am very impressed with the job that motorola did on the sturdiness of this phone 1 
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
the dining space is tiny but elegantly decorated and comfortable 1 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
i loved it 1 
that said our mouths and bellies were still quite pleased 1 
i probably would not go here again 0 
clear crisp sound 1 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
oh this is such a thing of beauty this restaurant 1 
the kids are annoying 0 
his performance is simply genius 1 
that was funny 1 
you wont forget this movie 1 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
i agree with jessica this movie is pretty bad 0 
very good lunch spot 1 
her lines seem to have been written by a fifteen year old though they are trying oh so so hard to sound like how a fifteen year old would really um you know well talk 0 
i exchanged the sony ericson z500a for this and im pretty happy with that decision 1 
it deserves strong love 1 
this is so embarassing and also my ears hurt if i try to push the ear plug into my ear 0 
the sound is clear and the people i talk to on it are amazed at the quality too 1 
the service was not up to par either 0 
great phone 1 
it has northern humour and positive about the community it represents 1 
it has everything i need and i couldnt ask for more 1 
it fits my ear well and is comfortable on 1 
itll be a regular stop on my trips to phoenix 1 
however i needed some better instructions 0 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
i hate writing bad reviews about films especially those in which i really like the star but this film is so bad i dont believe for one second that anyone could have been proud of it 0 
truly awful 0 
good transmit audio 1 
the calls drop the phone comes on and off at will the screen goes black and the worst of all it stops ringing intermittently 0 
the place was fairly clean but the food simply wasnt worth it 0 
sound quality on both end is excellent i use headset to call my wife and ask my wife to use headset to call me 2 1 
the warm beer didnt help 0 
appears to actually outperform the original battery from china that came with my v325i 1 
great audio 1 
it was delicious 1 
john garfield ann revere lilli plmer william conrad canada leeand filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screenjames wong howe 1 
i would have casted her in that role after ready the script 1 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
that being said for a phone the camera is very nice many cool effects to play with and video is decent as well 1 
soyo technology sucks 0 
verizons bills however are difficult to understand even though their pricing plans are simple 0 
bad reception 0 
it has everything i need and i couldnt ask for more 1 
the seasonal fruit was fresh white peach puree 1 
its pretty surprising that this wonderful film was made in 1949 as hollywood generally had its collective heads in the sand concerning black and white issues at that time 1 
total brunch fail 0 
however after finally watching this film i realized that not only had i had a closed mind to the brilliance it depicts i also found myself watching it over and over again 1 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
highly recommend for any one who has a blue tooth phone 1 
will not be back 0 
not only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic but it also managed to give away the entire movie and im not exaggerating every moment every plot point every joke is told in the trailer 0 
the dialogue is composed of things that make little sense 0 
i have been to very few places to eat that under no circumstances would i ever return to and this tops the list 0 
i have purchased these for both family and friends and all enjoy their clarity and ease of use 1 
the sangria was about half of a glass wine full and was 12 ridiculous 0 
i didnt realize how wonderful the short really is until the last two scenes 1 
horrible 0 
the manager was the worst 0 
this is a very average phone with bad battery life that operates on a weak network 0 
the fries were great too 1 
the stories were as unbelievable as the actors 0 
no ear loop needed its tiny and the sound is great 1 
phenomenal food service and ambiance 1 
highly unprofessional and rude to a loyal patron 0 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
this is a masterful piece of filmmaking with many themes simmering and occasionally boiling over in this warts and all study of the poets bohemian selfindulgent wartime years that span the aerial bombardments of london and the outward tranquillity of a welsh coastal retreat the borderlines between friendship lust and love dedication to art and experience versus practical concerns jealousy rivalry cowardice and egotism versus heroism and selfsacrifice and more 1 
nicest chinese restaurant ive been in a while 1 
good transmit audio 1 
definitely worth checking out 1 
the camera really likes her in this movie 1 
perhaps my phone is defective but people cannot hear me when i use this 0 
on the up side their cafe serves really good food 1 
its welldesigned and very sharp the blue is a very nice color 1 
this results in the phone being either stuck at max volume or mute 0 
we had 7 at our table and the service was pretty fast 1 
the worst experience ever 0 
phone falls out easily 0 
its this pandering to the audience that sabotages most of his films 0 
but even the talented carrell cant save this 0 
the camera although rated at an impressive 13 megapixels renders images that fall well below expectations of such a relatively high resolution 0 
made very sturdy 1 
so far so good 1 
if you see it you should probably just leave it on the shelf 0 
theres really nothing bad i can say about this headset 0 
they were goldencrispy and delicious 1 
i probably would not go here again 0 
it was not good 0 
the tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu 0 
duris has a wholesome appearance and gives a fine performance 1 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
the fried rice was dry as well 0 
it was equally awful 0 
best tacos in town by far 1 
if you love authentic mexican food and want a whole bunch of interesting yet delicious meats to choose from you need to try this place 1 
the structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema 1 
bland and flavorless is a good way of describing the barely tepid meat 0 
i let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this bad idea we both hated it 0 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
the poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying 0 
the structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema 1 
penne vodka excellent 1 
all in all i can assure you ill be back 1 
oh this is such a thing of beauty this restaurant 1 
if you simply want a small flip phone look elsewhere as the extra bells whistles are mediocre 0 
the desserts were a bit strange 0 
black water is a thriller that manages to completely transcend its limitations its an indie flick by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience 1 
its a little geeky but i think thats its sex on toast and it rocks and oozes sex right down to its battery embedded sleek stylish leather case 1 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
the service was meh 0 
there are massive levels massive unlockable characters its just a massive game 1 
it is not good 0 
the plot is nonsense that doesnt interest in the slightest way or have any uniqueness to it 0 
works like a charm it work the same as the one i got with the phone 1 
cant get the software to work with my computer 0 
performed awful muffled tinny incoming sound and severe echo for those on the other end of the call 0 
cheap but hey it works was pleasantly suprised given the low cost of this item 1 
you wont regret it 1 
the acting was bad 0 
on the good side the staff was genuinely pleasant and enthusiastic a real treat 1 
just reading on the specs alone makes you say wow 1 
the writers were smack on and i think the best actors and actresses were a bonus to the showthese characters were so real 1 
this place is great 1 
much better than the other ayce sushi place i went to in vegas 1 
disappointing 0 
a great touch 1 
garbo who showed right off the bat that her talents could carry over from the silent era i wanted to see some of her silent work but netflix doesnt seem to be stocking them 1 
waited and waited and waited 0 
the burger i got the gold standard a 17 burger and was kind of disappointed 0 
it quit working after id used it for about 18 months so i just purchased another one because this is the best headset ive ever owned 1 
in summary this was a largely disappointing dining experience 0 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
it was not good 0 
i could not recommend these more 0 
total waste of time 0 
after the disappointing dinner we went elsewhere for dessert 0 
this is cool because most cases are just open there allowing the screen to get all scratched up 1 
its a fresh subtle and rather sublime effect 1 
my only problem is i thought the actor playing the villain was a low rent michael ironside 0 
this company charge me a restocking fee and still not given me my refund back 0 
absolutel junk 0 
long whiny and pointless 0 
the cinematography is simply stunning to say the least and the fx are nothing if not stateoftheart 1 
bad quality 0 
the desserts were a bit strange 0 
it doesnt make you look cool 0 
easy to pair with my samsung cell 1 
this is a great place to eat 1 
1 long lasting battery you dont have to recharge it as frequentyly as some of the flip phones2 0 
the plug did not work very well 0 
ive had this for nearly 2 years and it has worked great for me 1 
his use of the colours of the french flag in the three films was nothing short of incredible every shot every scene was like a work of art 1 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
kieslowski never ceases to amaze me 1 
great case and price 1 
this second appearance of mickey mouse following the silent plane crazy earlier that year is probably his most famous filmmostly because it was so groundbreaking 1 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
i think not again 0 
worked perfectly 1 
i want to first say our server was great and we had perfect service 1 
i was very disappointed 0 
better than expected 1 
i am glad i purchased it 1 
very disappointed and wondered how it could be in the oscar shortlist 0 
best breakfast buffet 1 
food was great and so was the serivce 1 
it never condescends all the characters have good genuine hearts and believable problems 1 
the service was extremely slow 0 
awsome device works great 1 
oh and i forgot to also mention the weird color effect it has on your phone 0 
i let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this bad idea we both hated it 0 
if you stay in vegas you must get breakfast here at least once 1 
from what my dinner companions told meeverything was very fresh with nice texture and taste 1 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
im so happy to be here 1 
the lighting is awful 0 
this movie suffered because of the writing it needed more suspense 0 
this is a good joint 1 
the films sole bright spot was jonah hill who will look almost unrecognizable to fans of the recent superbad due to the amount of weight he lost in the interim 1 
the best phone in market 1 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
the chips that came out were dripping with grease and mostly not edible 0 
total letdown i would much rather just go to the camelback flower shop and cartel coffee 0 
10 out of 10 stars 1 
though the wind and the lion is told largely through the eyes of the son every member of the family can identify with one of the characters whether it be sean connerys noble brigand candace bergens feisty heroine john hustons wily john hay or steve kanalys spiffy radiant ruthless cando lieutenant roosevelts big stick 1 
great pizza and salads 1 
it is perfect for a sitdown family meal or get together with a few friends 1 
the cashier was friendly and even brought the food out to me 1 
i also decided not to send it back because our waitress looked like she was on the verge of having a heart attack 0 
this is actually a very smart movie 1 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
this place lacked style 0 
i could barely stomach the meal but didnt complain because it was a business lunch 0 
this movie was kind of long in length but i enjoyed every minute of it 1 
we had so much to say about the place before we walked in that he expected it to be amazing but was quickly disappointed 0 
his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic 1 
other than that the leather is nice and soft the fit is very tight the cut out for the face is a good shape 1 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
it didnt work people can not hear me when i talk 0 
everything was good and tasty 1 
greatno problems at all 1 
the characters are interesting and you really care for them 1 
first the bathrooms at this location were dirty seat covers were not replenished just plain yucky 0 
it definitely was not as good as my s11 1 
i dont like this nokia either 0 
and i really did find them funny 1 
i love this thing 1 
nice solid keyboard 1 
omg i felt like i had never eaten thai food until this dish 1 
very good phone 1 
it will drive you barking mad 0 
considering the relations off screen between taylor and stanwyck it was surprising how little chemistry there was on screen between the two of them 0 
i gave it 5 stars then and im giving it 5 stars now 1 
after my phone got to be about a year old its been slowly breaking despite much care on my part 0 
love this phone 1 
if you want healthy authentic or ethic food try this place 1 
this is probably the most irritating show i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
1010 1 
when i opened the sandwich i was impressed but not in a good way 0 
of course the footage from the 70s was grainy but that only enhanced the film 1 
third the cheese on my friends burger was cold 0 
it lasts less than 3o minutes if i actually try to use the phonemy wife has the same phone with the same problem 0 
my experience was terrible this was my fourth bluetooth headset and while it was much more comfortable than my last jabra which i hated 0 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
this phone is pretty sturdy and ive never had any large problems with it 1 
yes this film does require a rather significant amount of puzzlesolving but the pieces fit together to create a beautiful picture 1 
so far it has worked like a charm 1 
considering the relations off screen between taylor and stanwyck it was surprising how little chemistry there was on screen between the two of them 0 
everything captain howdy says is either laughable or just plain stupid 0 
this is the place where i first had pho and it was amazing 1 
jamie foxx absolutely is ray charles 1 
we were promptly greeted and seated 1 
this place is pretty good nice little vibe in the restaurant 1 
if you simply want a small flip phone look elsewhere as the extra bells whistles are mediocre 0 
the dialogue sucked 0 
if it were possible to give them zero stars theyd have it 0 
i hope this place sticks around 1 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
during several different 2 minute calls i experienced 5 drops and it was in an area that had 5 bars 0 
dont waste your money and time 0 
i dont think ive ever gone to a movie and disliked it as much 0 
incredible 1 
restaurant is always full but never a wait 1 
i mean really how do you get so famous for your fish and chips when its so terrible 0 
it sure does beat the nachos at the movies but i would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant 0 
im super pissd 0 
often the dialogue doesnt really follow from one line to another or fit the surroundings 0 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
having to humour him just to get by and get through the day was so apt 1 
after watching this film i wanted to learn more about the works of this artist 1 
sprint charges for this service 0 
overall a great experience 1 
lovely little thriller from hitchcock with lots of nice shenanigans surrounding a murdered spy a kidnapped child a nasty church a foreign plot and some random taxidermists 1 
this is some seriously good pizza and im an expertconnisseur on the topic 1 
the speaker is of low quality so as making the ring tones sound very cheap 0 
i believe the screenwriter did a good job of tying up the loose ends 1 
if you have several dozen or several hundred contacts then imagine the fun of sending each of them one by one 0 
its a little geeky but i think thats its sex on toast and it rocks and oozes sex right down to its battery embedded sleek stylish leather case 1 
wow what a bad film 0 
price is good too 1 
great steak great sides great wine amazing desserts 1 
i recently tried caballeros and i have been back every week since 1 
yet i enjoy watching it 1 
its really easy 1 
i will not return 0 
the story itself is just predictable and lazy 0 
i want to first say our server was great and we had perfect service 1 
we had 7 at our table and the service was pretty fast 1 
the acting is terrible and the writing is worse 0 
he was terrible 0 
both of them were truly unbelievably good and i am so glad we went back 1 
but in terms of the writing its very fresh and bold 1 
juano hernandez an exceptional actor who played supporting roles in many films of the era is a proud black man who is accused of murdering a white man in the south 1 
at first i thought i was grtting a good deal at 744 until i plugged it into my phone v3c razr 0 
having to humour him just to get by and get through the day was so apt 1 
then scene where they debated whether or not to sack the trumpeter who falsely was accused for the murder is pure horror really stupid 0 
pricing is a bit of a concern at mellow mushroom 0 
lousy product 0 
there is no real plot 0 
i purcashed this for the car charger and it does not work 0 
it didnt charge for me 0 
the fries were not hot and neither was my burger 0 
2 thumbs up 1 
end of days is one of the worst bigbudget action movies ive ever seen 0 
comfort for our whole family 1 
ambience is perfect 1 
before i go in to why i gave a 1 star rating please know that this was my third time eating at bachi burger before writing a review 0 
the plot doesnt hang together at all and the acting is absolutely appalling 0 
its not hard to make a decent hamburger 0 
not much flavor to them and very poorly constructed 0 
nonlinear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well 1 
i even fully charged it before i went to bed and turned off blue tooth and wifi and noticed that it only had 20 left in the morning 0 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
i mean in a realistic world she would never have gotten into that ballet repertory the whole thing was quite pathetic 0 
although i very much liked the look and sound of this place the actual experience was a bit disappointing 0 
the menu had so much good stuff on it i could not decide 1 
its been my choice headset for yearsgreat sound good volume good noise cancellation 1 
it lasts less than 3o minutes if i actually try to use the phonemy wife has the same phone with the same problem 0 
if you love death and decay and shakespears lyrics this is the one 1 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
great pork sandwich 1 
youd have to have the iq of particularly stupid mollusk not to see that one coming 0 
both great 1 
i could barely stomach the meal but didnt complain because it was a business lunch 0 
this really is how vegas fine dining used to be right down to the menus handed to the ladies that have no prices listed 1 
he owns the film just as spacek owned coal miners daughter and quaid owned great balls of fire 1 
i heart this place 1 
avoid this film at all costs 0 
now you know why i gave it a 10 1 
only pros large seating area nice bar area great simple drink menu the best brick oven pizza with homemade dough 1 
the chicken dishes are ok the beef is like shoe leather 0 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
great food and awesome service 1 
exceptionally bad 0 
this movie is also revealing 1 
summary the witticisms werent witty 0 
if you havent gone here go now 1 
i would have given no star if i was able 0 
i am sorry i made this purchase 0 
still i do like this movie for its empowerment of women theres not enough movies out there like this one 1 
nice case feels good in your hands 1 
items stated as included from the description are not included 0 
it was delicious 1 
now the burgers arent as good the pizza which used to be amazing is doughy and flavorless 0 
i want to first say our server was great and we had perfect service 1 
this was such an awesome movie that i bought it off of ebay 1 
we made the drive all the way from north scottsdale and i was not one bit disappointed 1 
i waited and waited 0 
he was extremely rude and really there are so many other restaurants i would love to dine at during a weekend in vegas 0 
truly awful 0 
ive never been more insulted or felt disrespected 0 
worst thai ever 0 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
the server was very negligent of our needs and made us feel very unwelcome i would not suggest this place 0 
the refried beans that came with my meal were dried out and crusty and the food was bland 0 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
the stories were powerful explorations of the nature of man and of art 1 
definitely a turn off for me i doubt ill be back unless someone else is buying 0 
i wasnt really impressed with strip steak 0 
this is the first phone ive had that has been so cheaply made 0 
the results well are a shame 0 
nobody identifies with these characters because theyre all cardboard cutouts and stereotypes or predictably reversestereotypes 0 
great brunch spot 1 
i love the ringtones because they are so upbeat 1 
unfortunately inexperience of direction meant that scene after scene passed with little in the way of dramatic tension or conflict 0 
im probably one of the few people to ever go to ians and not like it 0 
bt50 battery junk 0 
the use of slowmotion needlessly repeats itself throughout the movie but is well backed up by bad acting and bad is a kind word here no continuity scenes that are thrown in for no reason whatsoever vehicles that looked like they were made from a corn flakes box and a directorial style that bordered on stupidity 0 
this is some seriously good pizza and im an expertconnisseur on the topic 1 
things happen characters personalities change plot twists occur for no real reason other than that script calls for it 0 
definitely a turn off for me i doubt ill be back unless someone else is buying 0 
it is indescribably the most annoying and idiotic show i have ever seen 0 
didnt laugh or even smile once 0 
the first thing that happened was that the tracking was off 0 
there were several moments in the movie that just didnt need to be there and were excruciatingly slow moving 0 
paolo sorrentino has written a wonderful story about loneliness and tony has built one of the most unforgettable characters seen in movies in recent years 1 
cant say enough good things about this place 1 
not only did the software do a great job of this i could also make my own ringtones form my existing cds without an internet connection 1 
as i said abovepretty useless 0 
it dit not work most of the time with my nokia 5320 0 
ive missed numerous calls because of this reason 0 
not impressed 0 
i felt asleep the first time i watched it so i can recommend it for insomniacs 0 
it is very comfortable to wear as well which is probably the most important aspect about using a case 1 
is it possible for a movie to get any worse than this 0 
awesome service and food 1 
but when i check voice mail at night the keypad backlight turns off a few seconds into the first message and then im lost 0 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
lasted one day and then blew up 0 
i dont recommend unless your car breaks down in front of it and you are starving 0 
does not work for listening to music with the cingular 8125 0 
the restaurant is very clean and has a family restaurant feel to it 1 
jamie foxx absolutely is ray charles 1 
extremely tasty 1 
service is quick and even to go orders are just like we like it 1 
the story unfolds in 18th century jutland and the use of period music played on period instruments is just one more fine touch 1 
the script is a big flawed mess 0 
first off the reception sucks i have never had more than 2 bars ever 0 
but this movie is definitely a below average rent 0 
it shouldnt take 30 min for pancakes and eggs 0 
ryans bar is definitely one edinburgh establishment i wont be revisiting 0 
there is simply no excuse for something this poorly done 0 
very disappointed and wondered how it could be in the oscar shortlist 0 
there are the usual hitchcock logic flaws 0 
lastly the mozzarella sticks they were the best thing we ordered 1 
same evening him and i are both drastically sick 0 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
i think the most wonderful parts literally full of wonder are the excerpts from his works 1 
the price is reasonable and the service is great 1 
i use this product in a motor control center where there is a lot of high voltage humming from the equipment and it works great 1 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
i got home to see the driest damn wings ever 0 
dont go here 0 
the manager was the worst 0 
highly recommend for any one who has a blue tooth phone 1 
waste of money 0 
bad reception 0 
we wont be going back 0 
i struggle to find anything bad to say about it 1 
this if the first movie ive given a 10 to in years 1 
the shower area is outside so you can only rinse not take a full shower unless you dont mind being nude for everyone to see 0 
the screen does get smudged easily because it touches your ear and face 0 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
this was my first and only vegas buffet and it did not disappoint 1 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
2 thumbs up to this seller 1 
the keyboard is a nice compromise between a full qwerty and the basic cell phone number keypad 1 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
the plug did not work very well 0 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
very clear quality sound and you dont have to mess with the sound on your ipod since you have the sound buttons on the headset 1 
the service was not up to par either 0 
food was so gooodd 1 
highquality chicken on the chicken caesar salad 1 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
i will come back here every time im in vegas 1 
the characters were all funny and had the peculiarity of not having a true lead character 1 
the warmth it generates is in contrast to its austere backdrop 1 
big disappointment with calendar sync 0 
what a waste of time 0 
everything about this film is simply incredible 1 
the camera on the phone may be used as a dustpan when indoors id rather be using a disposable then this 0 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
after 20 minutes wait i got a table 0 
this phone is pretty sturdy and ive never had any large problems with it 1 
the servers went back and forth several times not even so much as an are you being helped 0 
yet plantronincs continues to use the same flawed charger design 0 
do not buy for d807wrongly advertised for d807 0 
dont go here 0 
the sweet potato tots were good but the onion rings were perfection or as close as i have had 1 
the design is very good4 1 
i was very pleased to see that i could replace my well travled swivel holster for my blackberry flip 1 
very disappointing 0 
excellent starter wireless headset 0 
lifetime does not air it enough so if anyone knows what store sells it let me know because this is a musthave 1 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
the acting is beyond abysmal 0 
insults profound deuchebaggery and had to go outside for a smoke break while serving just to solidify it 0 
this is a great deal 1 
oh yeah and the storyline was pathetic too 0 
yes its that bad 0 
also makes it easier to hold on to 1 
this movie is so awesome 1 
as always the evening was wonderful and the food delicious 1 
an instant classic with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits 1 
theres also enough hypocrisy in this film to make me vomit 0 
the plot simply rumbles on like a machine desperately depending on the addition of new scenes 0 
it is an insane game 1 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
not impressed 0 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
poor product 0 
they keep getting better and better this is my third one and ive had numerous palms too 1 
i let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this bad idea we both hated it 0 
i mean really how do you get so famous for your fish and chips when its so terrible 0 
why was this film made 0 
highly recommended for all ages although the younger set will probably not appreciate some of the more subtle references they will certainly appreciate one galley scene in particular 1 
overall i like there food and the service 1 
i left the theater with a lilt in my step joy in my heart and hope for the human race 1 
give this one a look 1 
the biggest complaint i have is the battery drains superfast 0 
disappointing accessory from a good manufacturer 0 
very much disappointed with this company 0 
the goat taco didnt skimp on the meat and wow what flavor 1 
i get absolutely horrible reception in my apartment where with other phones i have not had this problem 0 
if you do go see this movie bring a pillow or a girlfriendboyfriend to keep you occupied through out 0 
the attention given to every character and complex psychological portrayals detailing loyalty treachery love and hope are tremendous 1 
it crackles with an unpredictable youthful energy but honestly i found it hard to follow and concentrate on it meanders so badly 0 
razr battery good buy 1 
this place deserves no stars 0 
phone falls out easily 0 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
definitely a turn off for me i doubt ill be back unless someone else is buying 0 
however my girl was complain that some time the phone doesnt wake up like normal phone does 0 
as always the evening was wonderful and the food delicious 1 
good value works fine power via usb car or wall outlet 1 
what the hell kind of crap is that 0 
worst martini ever 0 
i was hoping for more 0 
but then they came back cold 0 
works well 1 
i recently tried caballeros and i have been back every week since 1 
just what i wanted 1 
all in all an excellent restaurant highlighted by great service a unique menu and a beautiful setting 1 
for that price i can think of a few place i would have much rather gone 0 
i liked this movie way too much 1 
i never walked out of a movie faster 0 
jamie foxx absolutely is ray charles 1 
this is just a great movie 1 
unfortunately inexperience of direction meant that scene after scene passed with little in the way of dramatic tension or conflict 0 
do not purchase this phone 0 
it was attached to a gas station and that is rarely a good sign 0 
good food good service 1 
it is super charged up for use as a small hybrid palmtopcameracellphone and excels in those roles 1 
were jerks on the phone 0 
we ordered the duck rare and it was pink and tender on the inside with a nice char on the outside 1 
if only someone involved with it knew how to string together narrative 0 
its a great item 1 
they know how to make them here 1 
the pairing of the two devices was so easy it barely took a couple minutes before i started making calls with the voice dialing feature 1 
perfect for someone me who only likes beer ice cold or in this case even colder 1 
conclusion very filling meals 1 
babie bop is very cute 1 
it was a waste of my money 0 
this is one of the worst sandra bullock movie since speed 2 but not quite that bad 0 
nice solid keyboard 1 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
con spotty service 0 
food is way overpriced and portions are fucking small 0 
not my thing 0 
still waiting im sure this item would work well if i ever recieve it 0 
i have purchased these for both family and friends and all enjoy their clarity and ease of use 1 
as many people complained i found this headsets microphone was very weak 0 
this is a stunning movie 1 
artless camerawork endlessly presents us with the ugliest setting imaginable ie 0 
for that price i can think of a few place i would have much rather gone 0 
the croutons also taste homemade which is an extra plus 1 
i put the latest os on it v115g and it now likes to slow to a crawl and lock up every once in a while 0 
if she had not rolled the eyes we may have stayed not sure if we will go back and try it again 0 
not good by any stretch of the imagination 0 
shrimp when i unwrapped it i live only 12 a mile from brushfire it was literally ice cold 0 
i dont understand how this garbage got on the shelves of the movie store its not even a real movie 0 
the acting was bad 0 
we waited an hour for what was a breakfast i could have done 100 times better at home 0 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
some may say this buffet is pricey but i think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot 1 
no one at the table thought the food was above average or worth the wait that we had for it 0 
the cinematographyif it can be called thatsucked 0 
it works 1 
but it does get better reception and clarity than any phone ive had before 1 
hard to judge whether these sides were good because we were grossed out by the melted styrofoam and didnt want to eat it for fear of getting sick 0 
this place is great 1 
delicious nyc bagels good selections of cream cheese real lox with capers even 1 
i wont be back 0 
this game rocks 1 
the sides are delish mixed mushrooms yukon gold puree white corn beateous 1 
i dont think there are any redeeming qualities in this remake 0 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
the steaks are all well trimmed and also perfectly cooked 1 
by far the best cheesecurds we have ever had 1 
none of the new ones have ever quite worked properly 0 
the film is way too long 0 
imdb ratings only go as low 1 for awful its time to get some negative numbers in there for cases such as these 0 
the kids are very cool too 1 
it was clear that she had the range and ability to pull off this part 1 
great product fast shipping 1 
seller shipped quickly and much cheaper than the competitors 1 
not loud enough and doesnt turn on like it should 0 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
after all the rave reviews i couldnt wait to eat herewhat a disappointment 0 
works well 1 
will definitely be back 1 
a good time 1 
okay i like to consider myself a fair critic so ill give credit where credits duethe creature effects were actually pretty cool 1 
however my girl was complain that some time the phone doesnt wake up like normal phone does 0 
the best example of how dumb the writing is when its established that you can turn the zombiestudents back into humans by removing a necklace containing a piece of the meteorite 0 
the cast of veteran actors are more than just a nostalgia trip 1 
from what my dinner companions told meeverything was very fresh with nice texture and taste 1 
i have bought this nokia cell phone a few weeks ago and it was a nightmare 0 
in conclusion i will not bother with this movie because a volcano in los angeles is nothing but nonsense 0 
very bad performance plays angela bennett a computer expert who is at home all the time 0 
very displeased 0 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
i love this place 1 
i knew when i saw the film that more great things were to come from this gifted actor 1 
works well 1 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
i hate to disagree with my fellow yelpers but my husband and i were so disappointed with this place 0 
this place is not worth your time let alone vegas 0 
service was good and the company was better 1 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
unless youre just out to visually collect all extant films of austens work you can skip this one 0 
i ordered the lemon raspberry ice cocktail which was also incredible 1 
its welldesigned and very sharp the blue is a very nice color 1 
his performance is simply genius 1 
i am so tired of clichés that is just lazy writing and here they come in thick and fast 0 
i am not a filmmaker nor am i a director but i would hide my head in the sand if id spent whatever amount of money and time on this movie 0 
and the rest of it just sits there being awful with soldiers singing songs about the masculinity they pledge themselves to hairsplitting about purity the admiration of swords etc 0 
another note about this phones appearance is that it really looks rather bland especially in the all black model 0 
she carries the movie well 1 
the buttons for on and off are bad 0 
i live in the neighborhood so i am disappointed i wont be back here because it is a convenient location 0 
maybe if they werent cold they would have been somewhat edible 0 
after trying many many handsfree gadgets this is the one that finally works well 1 
i saw this film over christmas and what a great film it was 1 
the characters are interesting even if a bit predictable 1 
there are the usual hitchcock logic flaws 0 
yet i enjoy watching it 1 
poor construction 0 
not much flavor to them and very poorly constructed 0 
it was that year however that reminded us that huston was still at the top of his game as evinced by his faithful adaptation of james joyces acclaimed novella the dead 1 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
it was pretty gross 0 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
this place is handsdown one of the best places to eat in the phoenix metro area 1 
it works 1 
doesnt hold charge 0 
what happened next was prettyoff putting 0 
battery is terrible 0 
att is not clear sound is very distorted and you have to yell when you talk 0 
each day of the week they have a different deal and its all so delicious 1 
the atmosphere is modern and hip while maintaining a touch of coziness 1 
we had a group of 70 when we claimed we would only have 40 and they handled us beautifully 1 
however the keypads are so tinny that i sometimes reach the wrong buttons 0 
its hard not to fall headoverheels in love with that girl 1 
and it was boring 0 
i could not understand what kind of idiot would produce this mess in the first place not to mention several season 0 
then i exchanged for the same phone even that had the same problem 0 
highquality chicken on the chicken caesar salad 1 
the 12 mega pixel camera being a part of a phone is reasonably good7 1 
this item worked great but it broke after 6 months of use 0 
wont ever go here again 0 
items stated as included from the description are not included 0 
has been working great 1 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
his use of the colours of the french flag in the three films was nothing short of incredible every shot every scene was like a work of art 1 
in fact its hard to remember that the part of ray charles is being acted and not played by the man himself 1 
extremely tasty 1 
this film tries to be a serious and sophisticated thrillerhorror flick and it fails miserably 0 
she carries the movie well 1 
but despite these few flaws this case is of exceptional quality and well worth the additional costs of owning an official oem product 1 
disappointing accessory from a good manufacturer 0 
treo and tmobile refused to replace it again and forced me to buy another phone without any kind of upgrade discount 0 
after one bite i was hooked 1 
im a big fan of this series mostly due to anne rices style sensitivities and treatments 1 
the kids are annoying 0 
third the cheese on my friends burger was cold 0 
my phone doesnt slide around my car now and the grip prevents my phone from slipping out of my hand 1 
attempting artiness with black white and clever camera angles the movie disappointed became even more ridiculous as the acting was poor and the plot and lines almost nonexistent 0 
im still infatuated with this phone 1 
the kids are very cool too 1 
incredible 1 
this is a chilly unremarkable movie about an author livingworking in a chilly abstruse culture 0 
after 3 months screen just went black all of a sudden 0 
each day of the week they have a different deal and its all so delicious 1 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
very clear quality sound and you dont have to mess with the sound on your ipod since you have the sound buttons on the headset 1 
we loved the place 1 
design flaw 0 
i love this phone it is very handy and has a lot of features 1 
good case excellent value 1 
trying to make a call on these is an exercise in frustration 0 
full of unconvincing cardboard characters it is blandly written by edward chodorov who also produced and is surprisingly directed by jean negulesco from whom one would expect a great deal more 0 
i do think tom hanks is a good actor 1 
very true to shakespear and a must for all shakespear fans 1 
service stinks here 0 
im happy about this purchase good quality and low price 1 
they never brought a salad we asked for 0 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
and the chef was generous with his time even came around twice so we can take pictures with him 1 
the seller is very understanding and patient i would definitely buy from them again 1 
in short dont bother with this movie 0 
it has northern humour and positive about the community it represents 1 
but its just not funny 0 
i also didnt like the on button it felt like it would crack with use 0 
this is the place where i first had pho and it was amazing 1 
ample portions and good prices 1 
the ambiance was incredible 1 
obviously they have a terrible customer service so you get what you pay for 0 
the only good thing was our waiter he was very helpful and kept the bloddy marys coming 1 
thanks good a movie like this was done and released 1 
the croutons also taste homemade which is an extra plus 1 
its this pandering to the audience that sabotages most of his films 0 
full of unconvincing cardboard characters it is blandly written by edward chodorov who also produced and is surprisingly directed by jean negulesco from whom one would expect a great deal more 0 
this was such an awesome movie that i bought it off of ebay 1 
it is a joy to use 1 
the tracfonewebsite is user friendly and makes it easy toactivate etc 1 
no shifting no bubbling no peeling not even a scratch nothingi couldnt be more happier with my new one for the droid 1 
no shifting no bubbling no peeling not even a scratch nothingi couldnt be more happier with my new one for the droid 1 
someone shouldve invented this sooner 1 
i was left shattered from the experience of watching this film and i took a good two hours to fully recover 0 
my breakfast was perpared great with a beautiful presentation of 3 giant slices of toast lightly dusted with powdered sugar 1 
they have great dinners 1 
im terribly disappointed that this film would receive so many awards and accolades especially when there are far more deserving works of film out there 0 
what a waste 0 
avoid this film at all costs 0 
i use this product in a motor control center where there is a lot of high voltage humming from the equipment and it works great 1 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
we watched our waiter pay a lot more attention to other tables and ignore us 0 
the movie seemed a little slow at first 0 
this gets a 1 out of 10 simply because theres nothing lower 0 
easy to pair with my samsung cell 1 
in fact this stinker smells like a directtovideo release 0 
come hungry leave happy and stuffed 1 
avoid avoid avoid 0 
his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic 1 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
it is indescribably the most annoying and idiotic show i have ever seen 0 
so i bought about 10 of these and saved alot of money 1 
this is a very average phone with bad battery life that operates on a weak network 0 
if you hate earbugs avoid this phone by all means 0 
my fella got the huevos rancheros and they didnt look too appealing 0 
pretty awesome place 1 
i love the look and feel of samsung flipphones 1 
having trouble with volume 0 
the biggest complaint i have is the battery drains superfast 0 
and generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode 0 
well im satisfied 1 
love it great armband 1 
much more interesting more action more suspense and less of the unneeded controversy 1 
this is an outstanding little restaurant with some of the best food i have ever tasted 1 
that company is a joke 0 
its a mediocre miserable hollow laughable and predictable piece of garbage 0 
everything was gross 0 
needless to say we will never be back here again 0 
good works fine 1 
it has everything i need and i couldnt ask for more 1 
my rating just 3 out of 10 0 
no plot whatsoever 0 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
all in all an excellent restaurant highlighted by great service a unique menu and a beautiful setting 1 
bt50 battery junk 0 
i could not stand to even watch it for very long for fear of losing iq 0 
awful 0 
the fish is badly made and some of its underwater shots are repeated a thousand times in the film 0 
same problem as others have mentioned 0 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
drinks took close to 30 minutes to come out at one point 0 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
ive never been treated so bad 0 
this movie was kind of long in length but i enjoyed every minute of it 1 
the service was a bit lacking 0 
no plot whatsoever 0 
a cheap and cheerless heist movie with poor characterisation lots of underbite style stoic emoting think chow yun fat in a better tomorrow and some cheesy clichés thrown into an abandoned factory ready for a few poorly executed flying judo rolls a la john woo 0 
i wear glasses and it fits fine with them 1 
the staff are great the ambiance is great 1 
i mean this in a terrible way 0 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
spoilers whatever else can or cant be said about it surface is superbly crafted 1 
it does everything the description said it would 1 
just spicy enough perfect actually 1 
im big fan of rpg games too but this movie its a disgrace to any selfrespecting rpger there is 0 
their research and development division obviously knows what theyre doing 1 
this place deserves no stars 0 
the movie showed a lot of florida at its best made it look very appealing 1 
i think i was one of the people who found this another one of roths pearls 1 
this is one of peter watkins most accessible films 1 
bacon is hella salty 1 
what possesed me to get this junk i have no idea 0 
the jabra eargels fit my ears very well 1 
i think it was robert ryans best film because he portrayed someone like my father and he was a schizophrenic in real lifemy father although he never murdered anyone but was affected more so during the second world war which made him worse 1 
we had a group of 70 when we claimed we would only have 40 and they handled us beautifully 1 
dee snider just plain sucks 0 
waste your money on this game 1 
after the disappointing dinner we went elsewhere for dessert 0 
doesnt work at all i bougth it for my l7c and its not working 0 
its reception is very very poor 0 
this place is great 1 
clear skype calls long battery life long range 1 
i am so pleased to know such a modern day genius is out there letting is passion for art drive him and taking us as an audience with him 1 
doesnt do the job 0 
oh yeah and the storyline was pathetic too 0 
i am pairing this with my iphone and i could not be happier with it so far 1 
i own a jabra earset and was very happy with it but the sound quality especially outgoing on this is better 1 
everything about it is fine and reasonable for the price ie 1 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
mark my words this is one of those cult films like evil dead 2 or phantasm that people will still be discovering and falling in love with 20 30 40 years down the line 1 
very good stuff for the price 1 
the only thing i did like was the prime rib and dessert section 1 
i could barely stomach the meal but didnt complain because it was a business lunch 0 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
the jalapeno bacon is soooo good 1 
a great way to finish a great 1 
i vomited in the bathroom mid lunch 0 
some may say this buffet is pricey but i think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot 1 
the problem i have is that they charge 1199 for a sandwich that is no bigger than a subway sub which offers better and more amount of vegetables 0 
my gyro was basically lettuce only 0 
great case and price 1 
so good i am going to have to review this place twice once hereas a tribute to the place and once as a tribute to an event held here last night 1 
the staff is great the food is delish and they have an incredible beer selection 1 
poor sound quality 0 
omelets are to die for 1 
nice leather 1 
steamboat willie is an amazingly important film to our cinema history 1 
excellent 1 
im so happy to be here 1 
the seasonal fruit was fresh white peach puree 1 
insults profound deuchebaggery and had to go outside for a smoke break while serving just to solidify it 0 
conclusion very filling meals 1 
its pretty easy 1 
it was so boring 0 
freezes frequently4 0 
while i managed to bend the leaf spring back in place the metal now has enough stress that it will break on the next drop 0 
it rocked my world and is certainly a must see for anyone with no social or physical outlets 1 
we wont be going back anytime soon 0 
i was sitting in my vehicle with the cradle on my belt and the headset lost signal 0 
this is a very average phone with bad battery life that operates on a weak network 0 
the camera although rated at an impressive 13 megapixels renders images that fall well below expectations of such a relatively high resolution 0 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
after charging overnight these batteries work great 1 
a truly truly bad film 0 
hard to judge whether these sides were good because we were grossed out by the melted styrofoam and didnt want to eat it for fear of getting sick 0 
the scallop dish is quite appalling for value as well 0 
great it was new packaged nice works good no problems and it came in less time then i expected 1 
i always order from the vegetarian menu during dinner which has a wide array of options to choose from 1 
love the margaritas too 1 
no im going to eat the potato that i found some strangers hair in it 0 
alexander nevsky is a great film 1 
dont buy it 0 
lastly the mozzarella sticks they were the best thing we ordered 1 
it was so cool 1 
this is one of peter watkins most accessible films 1 
i guess it was supposed to be clever twist then shed some light on the situation but it was just stupid 0 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
so they performed 1 
i find this inexcusable and so will probably be returning this phone and perhaps changing carriers 0 
it worked very well 1 
it was so bad i had lost the heart to finish it 0 
all the pretty pictures in the world cannot make up for a piece of work that is flawed at the core 0 
i literally vomited while watching this film 0 
the building itself seems pretty neat the bathroom is pretty trippy but i wouldnt eat here again 0 
i love the scream movies and all horror movies and this one ranks way up there 1 
if you havent choked in your own vomit by the end by all the cheap drama and worthless dialogue youve must have bored yourself to death with this waste of time 0 
battery is terrible 0 
im not sure how long we stood there but it was long enough for me to begin to feel awkwardly out of place 0 
i dont think ive ever gone to a movie and disliked it as much 0 
but above all the exquisite visual composition of each moment with inventive and elegant use of closeup camera angle and lighting including pointillistic faux home movie footage is a wonder and joy to behold 1 
ray charles life provided excellent biographical material for the film which goes well beyond being just another movie about a musician 1 
delicious 1 
the plot doesnt hang together at all and the acting is absolutely appalling 0 
so bad 0 
all of the main players are mesmerising 1 
this mostly routine factbased tv drama gets a boost from the fine performance by cole 1 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
i saw this short film on hbo the other day and absolutely loved it 1 
i hate to disagree with my fellow yelpers but my husband and i were so disappointed with this place 0 
the 12 mega pixel camera being a part of a phone is reasonably good7 1 
this is the first phone ive had that has been so cheaply made 0 
after 3 months screen just went black all of a sudden 0 
very serious spoilers this movie was a huge disappointment 0 
then i exchanged for the same phone even that had the same problem 0 
this second appearance of mickey mouse following the silent plane crazy earlier that year is probably his most famous filmmostly because it was so groundbreaking 1 
the plastic breaks really easy on this clip 0 
all of the main players are mesmerising 1 
i have purchased these for both family and friends and all enjoy their clarity and ease of use 1 
constantine gives everything the right intensity and seems to have a good understanding of the underlying psychological motivations 1 
it failed to convey the broad sweep of landscapes that were a great part of the original 0 
i found this place by accident and i could not be happier 1 
unfortunately it did not work 0 
bought mainly for the charger which broke soon after purchasing 0 
we will not be coming back 0 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
this movie is so awesome 1 
its kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly its embarrassing how childlike the company is 0 
easily none other cartoon made me laugh in a tender way before getting into dark sitcoms oriented for teenagers 1 
what a disappointment 0 
special thanks to dylan t for the recommendation on what to order all yummy for my tummy 1 
too politically correct 0 
here in the wind and the lion we see a wonderful rendering of americas own imperial age 1 
highly unprofessional and rude to a loyal patron 0 
i literally vomited while watching this film 0 
the service was a little slow considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace 0 
regrettably the film fails 0 
gotta love those closeups of slimy drooling teeth 1 
i received my headset in good time and was happy with it 1 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
product was excellent and works better than the verizon one and boy was it cheaper 1 
a good commentary of todays love and undoubtedly a film worth seeing 1 
the jabra eargels fit my ears very well 1 
could not get strong enough signal 0 
thus far have only visited twice and the food was absolutely delicious each time 1 
i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
i give wirefly 1 stari will contact cingularatt and inform them of this practice 0 
i love the ringtones because they are so upbeat 1 
i find this inexcusable and so will probably be returning this phone and perhaps changing carriers 0 
the pairing of the two devices was so easy it barely took a couple minutes before i started making calls with the voice dialing feature 1 
food was great and so was the serivce 1 
kris kristoffersen is good in this movie and really makes a difference 1 
nothing new there 0 
the plot doesnt hang together at all and the acting is absolutely appalling 0 
if you check the directors filmography on this site you will see why this film didnt have a chance 0 
unreliable im giving up 0 
this movie is excellentangel is beautiful and scamp is adorablehis little yelps when hes scaredand the funniest parts are whenscamp is caught under the curtain and when angel and scamp are singing ive never had this feeling beforei totally recommend this movieits coming out on special edition on june 20the cover has scamp on a garbage can and angel underneath the lid 1 
a usable keyboard actually turns a pda into a realworld useful machine instead of just a neat gadget 1 
he really didnt seem to want to be hosting his voiceovers were monotonous didnt get involved with the guests 0 
battery has no life 0 
putting the race card aside lets look at the major flaw in the film they destroy latifas character 0 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
anne heche was utterly convincing 1 
lovely little thriller from hitchcock with lots of nice shenanigans surrounding a murdered spy a kidnapped child a nasty church a foreign plot and some random taxidermists 1 
service is quick and even to go orders are just like we like it 1 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
the story which was told so eloquently by francis ford coppola 25 years earlier really unfolds gradually and leaves room for the characters to develop 1 
we ordered some old classics and some new dishes after going there a few times and were sorely disappointed with everything 0 
a truly truly bad film 0 
similarly the delivery man did not say a word of apology when our food was 45 minutes late 0 
great place to eat reminds me of the little mom and pop shops in the san francisco bay area 1 
also notable is john baileys fine crisp beautifully colored cinematography and the great production design costumes by eiko ishioka who went on to do the memorable costumes for coppolas dracula for which she received a well deserved oscar 1 
not my thing 0 
the screen size is big key pad lit well enough and the camera quality is excellent for a camera phone 1 
the hockey scenes are terrible defensemen playing like theyre 5 years old goalies diving at shots that are 10 feet wide of the net etc 0 
the design is very good4 1 
freezes frequently4 0 
the burger i got the gold standard a 17 burger and was kind of disappointed 0 
there is no plot or storyline 0 
a truly truly bad film 0 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
not even a hello we will be right with you 0 
i knew when i saw the film that more great things were to come from this gifted actor 1 
my brother in law who works at the mall ate here same day and guess what he was sick all night too 0 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
the good cinematography also makes her and monica bellucci look very beautiful 1 
not a good bargain 0 
the aerial scenes were welldone 1 
i like the fact that it rests lightly against your ear rather than inside 1 
small sleek impressive looking practical setup with ample storage in place 1 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
however the ear pads come off easily and after only one week i lost one 0 
good value works fine power via usb car or wall outlet 1 
also the phone doesnt seem to accept anything except cbr mp3s preferably ripped by windows media player 0 
so far it has worked like a charm 1 
special mention should be made of the superb music score and sound effects which are an integral element in helping to make this such a memorable and enjoyable cartoon 1 
these are fabulous 1 
i hate those things as much as cheap quality black olives 0 
ill even say it again  this is torture 0 
avoid avoid avoid 0 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
disappointment i hate anything that goes in my ear 0 
the construction of the headsets is poor 0 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
wow very spicy but delicious 1 
so i bought about 10 of these and saved alot of money 1 
definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly will return next time im in vegas 1 
there is no real plot 0 
awesome service and food 1 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
mediocre food 0 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
the service was not up to par either 0 
i mean this in a terrible way 0 
very disappointed 0 
im terribly disappointed that this film would receive so many awards and accolades especially when there are far more deserving works of film out there 0 
the file browser offers all the options that one needshandsfree is great 1 
worst service to boot but that is the least of their worries 0 
but i definitely would not eat here again 0 
rating 1 out of 10 0 
this is the phone to get for 2005 i just bought my s710a and all i can say is wow 1 
steve martin delivers a really funny performance of a middleaged upper class uptight white guy 1 
i thoroughly enjoyed it when christopher eccleston took control of the tardis and the continuation of the series 1 
he was extremely rude and really there are so many other restaurants i would love to dine at during a weekend in vegas 0 
nice spicy and tender 1 
i struggle to find anything bad to say about it 1 
i understand that its supposed to be a cheap popcorn comedy but that doesnt mean that it has to completely insult our intelligence and have writing so incredibly hackneyed that it borders on offensive 0 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
it is easy to turn on and off when you are in the car and the volume controls are quite accessable 1 
it has all the features i want 1 
the ambiance isnt much better 0 
much less than the jawbone i was going to replace it with 1 
nothing new there 0 
it works fine on my motorola 325 cellphone and a lot better than the wornout battery did 1 
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1 
i have had mine for about a year and this christmas i bought some for the rest of the family 1 
dont buy this product 0 
not a good bargain 0 
this is an extraordinary film 1 
very good food great atmosphere1 1 
i find this inexcusable and so will probably be returning this phone and perhaps changing carriers 0 
worst hour and a half of my lifeoh my gosh 0 
a lot of websites have been rating this a very good phone and so do i 1 
i was particularly pleased with the acting ability of dwight schultz 1 
does not fit 0 
what a waste 0 
the turkey and roast beef were bland 0 
i definitly recommend 1 
the phone takes forever to charge like 2 to 5 hours literally 0 
overall a great experience 1 
but storm trooper is not even bad enough to make it to the list of wonderfully terrible movies 0 
i would recommend it 1 
dont make the same mistake i did 0 
its a great tool for entertainment communication and data managementoh be sure to use activesync 42 for optimal data synchronization results 1 
also the phone doesnt seem to accept anything except cbr mp3s preferably ripped by windows media player 0 
this is an excellent film 1 
the stories were as unbelievable as the actors 0 
the tracfonewebsite is user friendly and makes it easy toactivate etc 1 
in the summer you can dine in a charming outdoor patio so very delightful 1 
comfortable in my hand 1 
this is a witty and delightful adaptation of the dr seuss book brilliantly animated by upas finest and thoroughly deserving of its academy award 1 
but it does get better reception and clarity than any phone ive had before 1 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
dont buy it 0 
i felt as though her going to ireland did absolutely nothing whatsoever 0 
the scripting of the subtle comedy is unmatched by any movie in recent years 1 
not tasty and the texture was just nasty 0 
however after seeing the short again after about 25 years i was amazed at how timeless the film actually is 1 
very disappointing 0 
crostini that came with the salad was stale 0 
this is some seriously good pizza and im an expertconnisseur on the topic 1 
dont waste your money and time 0 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
the movie was so boring that i sometimes found myself occupied peaking in the paper instead of watching never happened during a columbo movie before 0 
but kevin spacey is an excellent verbal tsunami as buddy ackerman  and totally believable because he is a great actor 1 
they refuse to refund or replace 0 
the service here is fair at best 0 
the cashier was friendly and even brought the food out to me 1 
special thanks to dylan t for the recommendation on what to order all yummy for my tummy 1 
very disappointing 0 
it was awesome 1 
a cheap and cheerless heist movie with poor characterisation lots of underbite style stoic emoting think chow yun fat in a better tomorrow and some cheesy clichés thrown into an abandoned factory ready for a few poorly executed flying judo rolls a la john woo 0 
this is an extraordinary film 1 
although i very much liked the look and sound of this place the actual experience was a bit disappointing 0 
lot of holes in the plot theres nothing about how he became the emperor nothing about where he spend 20 years between his childhood and mature age 0 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
this was a different cut than the piece the other day but still wonderful and tender s well as well flavored 1 
the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach 0 
the story line is just awful 0 
although i very much liked the look and sound of this place the actual experience was a bit disappointing 0 
used and dirty 0 
the turkey and roast beef were bland 0 
whatever the producer was going for he missed entirely 0 
this one wants to surf on the small wave of space movies in 1998 deep impact and armageddon and this one fails everywhere 0 
i love the look and feel of samsung flipphones 1 
price is good too 1 
i always order from the vegetarian menu during dinner which has a wide array of options to choose from 1 
on the good side the staff was genuinely pleasant and enthusiastic a real treat 1 
i received my headset in good time and was happy with it 1 
so i am here to warn youdo not rent this movie it is the dumbest thing you have never seen 0 
they were excellent 1 
to sum the film up breeders is a terrible cheaply made horror movie that should be avoided like the ebola virus 0 
now we were chosen to be tortured with this disgusting piece of blatant american propaganda 0 
i had strawberry tea which was good 1 
they know how to make them here 1 
will not be back 0 
this place is not worth your time let alone vegas 0 
there is so much good food in vegas that i feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to rice and company 0 
the selection was probably the worst ive seen in vegasthere was none 0 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
highly recommended for all ages although the younger set will probably not appreciate some of the more subtle references they will certainly appreciate one galley scene in particular 1 
ambience is perfect 1 
i did not expect this to be so good 1 
why are these sad little vegetables so overcooked 0 
it quit working after id used it for about 18 months so i just purchased another one because this is the best headset ive ever owned 1 
mobile phone tools are a must have 1 
i love the ownerchef his one authentic japanese cool dude 1 
the croutons also taste homemade which is an extra plus 1 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
motorola finally got the voice quality of a bluetooth headset right 1 
but now that it is out of warranty the same problems reoccurebottom line put your money somewhere else cingular will not support it 0 
my friend did not like his bloody mary 0 
ps the only scene in the movie that was cool is when the central character finds her room blown up 1 
the whole experience was underwhelming and i think well just go to ninja sushi next time 0 
mobile phone tools are a must have 1 
stopped by during the late may bank holiday off rick steve recommendation and loved it 1 
simply beautiful 1 
a good commentary of todays love and undoubtedly a film worth seeing 1 
the entire audience applauded at the conclusion of the film 1 
this is hands down the best phone ive ever had 1 
i asked multiple times for the wine list and after some time of being ignored i went to the hostess and got one myself 0 
a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it 1 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
the handsfree part works fine but then the car tries to download the address book and the treo rebootsoverall i still rate this device high 1 
the waitresses are very friendly 1 
then a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use 0 
omelets are to die for 1 
dont waste your money 0 
very disappointing 0 
only pros large seating area nice bar area great simple drink menu the best brick oven pizza with homemade dough 1 
this is an extraordinary film 1 
for the price on amazon it is an excellent product which i would highly recommend 1 
spend your money and time some place else 0 
also makes it easier to hold on to 1 
it isnt even an achievement as a sobaditsgood or sobaditsmemorable movie 0 
great food and service huge portions and they give a military discount 1 
if there was ever an indication of a writer and a directors ability to meld two highly volatile temperaments into a seamless union of creativity then this is it 1 
coming here is like experiencing an underwhelming relationship where both parties cant wait for the other person to ask to break up 0 
at a time when it seems that film animation has been dominated by disneypixars cgi masterpieces it is both refreshing and comforting to know that miyazaki is still relying on traditional handdrawn animation to tell his charming and enchanting stories 1 
to my disbelief each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods i have ever tasted 0 
id advise anyone to go and see it 1 
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1 
this is high adventure at its best 1 
the ear buds only play music in one ear 0 
i went to bachi burger on a friends recommendation and was not disappointed 1 
it was quite comfortable in the ear 1 
see both films if you can 1 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
worst thai ever 0 
the opening sequence of this gem is a classic and the cat n mouse games that follow are a delight to watch 1 
all in all ha long bay was a bit of a flop 0 
i immediately said i wanted to talk to the manager but i did not want to talk to the guy who was doing shots of fireball behind the bar 0 
the sets especially designed to work with the camera are amazingstylized beautiful and effective 1 
this is the place where i first had pho and it was amazing 1 
go and see it 1 
the fried rice was dry as well 0 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
almost everyone involved must be return to school acting is utterly predictable and bad script is pile of garbage all round 0 
unfortunately cover girl is an example of how hollywood used to exploit women for financial gain 0 
a lot of websites have been rating this a very good phone and so do i 1 
the kids are annoying 0 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
woa talk about awful 0 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
see it 1 
however bt headsets are currently not good for real time games like firstperson shooters since the audio delay messes me up 0 
do not make the same mistake as me 0 
i purchased this and within 2 days it was no longer working 0 
in particular the relationship between the bakery assistant and the waitress just didnt work for me at all 0 
i wasnt the least bit interested 0 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
i cant wait to go back 1 
what this film lacks is a convincing script 0 
it never condescends all the characters have good genuine hearts and believable problems 1 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0

at a time when it seems that film animation has been dominated by disneypixars cgi masterpieces it is both refreshing and comforting to know that miyazaki is still relying on traditional handdrawn animation to tell his charming and enchanting stories 1

i am glad i purchased it 1

the things that the four kids get themselves into is absolutely hilarious to watch 1

the keyboard is a nice compromise between a full qwerty and the basic cell phone number keypad 1 
it is cheap and it feel and look just as cheap 0 
service is friendly and inviting 1 
the acting by the whole cast could be put on a scale and balanced perfectly between overacting and underacting 0

not to mention the combination of pears almonds and bacon is a big winner 1 
i exchanged the sony ericson z500a for this and im pretty happy with that decision 1

nice solid keyboard 1 
will never ever go back and have told many people what had happened 0 
ive never been more insulted or felt disrespected 0 
all the bread is made inhouse 1 
i love the camera its really pretty good quality 1 
what a big waste of time 0 
and generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode 0 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
i wear it everyday and it holds up very well 1 
what a waste of money and time 0 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
prosgood camera very nice pictures also has cool styles like black and white and more 1

great phone 1 
after my phone got to be about a year old its been slowly breaking despite much care on my part 0 
i was very excited to get this headset because i thought it was really cute 1 
worst hour and a half of my lifeoh my gosh 0 
now this dish was quite flavourful 1 
the film deserves strong kudos for taking this stand for having exceptional acting from its mostly lesserknown cast and for the superintelligent script that doesnt insult the audience or take the easy way out when it comes to white racism 1 
and the sound quality is great 1 
will go back next trip out 1

i saw this film over christmas and what a great film it was 1 
there were several moments in the movie that just didnt need to be there and were excruciatingly slow moving 0 
black water is a thriller that manages to completely transcend its limitations its an indie flick by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience 1

battery is holding up well 1 
this is definitely a cult classic well worth viewing and sharing with others 1 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
they have great dinners 1 
also the phone doesnt seem to accept anything except cbr mp3s preferably ripped by windows media player 0 
oh and i forgot to also mention the weird color effect it has on your phone 0 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
good service very clean and inexpensive to boot 1 
using all earpieces left or right this thing will not stay on my ear 0 
its a great item 1 
this is simply the best bluetooth headset for sound quality 1 
really really good rice all the time 1 
the volume switch rocketed out of the unit to a destination unknown 0 
i like design and look of jabra behing the ear headsets and 5020 is pretty comfortible to wear 24 hours a day without pain in the ear 1 
i would highly recommend this product 1 
waste of 13 bucks 0 
whatever the producer was going for he missed entirely 0 
but then they came back cold 0 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
we waited an hour for what was a breakfast i could have done 100 times better at home 0 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
the waitresses are very friendly 1 
light weight i hardly notice it is there 1 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
i found this place by accident and i could not be happier 1 
on the ground right next to our table was a large smeared beensteppedinandtrackedeverywhere pile of green bird poop 0 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
i consider this theft 0 
the two main characters may be two of the most believable children i ever saw put on screen 1 
the lead man is charismafree 0 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
great movie 1 
total letdown i would much rather just go to the camelback flower shop and cartel coffee 0 
works for me 1 
it came free with a dvd player i bought but i still turned the thing off halfway through because i was embarrassed for howell 0 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
great price too 1 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
i must say i have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again 1 
excellent short film 1 
great for ipods too 1 
its so stupid to have to keep buying new chargers car chargers cradles headphones and car kits every time a new phone comes out 0 
i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
my sister has one also and she loves it 1 
generous portions and great taste 1 
i saw this movie and i thought this is a stupid movie 0 
i bought this phone as a replacement for my startac and have regretted it since 0 
it was pretty gross 0 
linksys should have some way to exchange a bad phone for a refurb unit or something 0 
this place was such a nice surprise 1 
we wont be going back 0 
it is a really good show to watch 1 
this movie is so awesome 1 
special thanks to dylan t for the recommendation on what to order all yummy for my tummy 1 
and the rest of it just sits there being awful with soldiers singing songs about the masculinity they pledge themselves to hairsplitting about purity the admiration of swords etc 0 
end of days is one of the worst bigbudget action movies ive ever seen 0 
id rather eat airline food seriously 0 
voice recognition is tremendous 1 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
all this movie does is make you sick watching all these slackers make excuses for their stupid actions for 90 minutes 0 
setup went very smoothly 1
