i wont spoil it but the ending in pretty amazing 1 
for sushi on the strip this is the place to go 1 
it dit not work most of the time with my nokia 5320 0 
we started with the tuna sashimi which was brownish in color and obviously wasnt fresh 0 
seems like a good quick place to grab a bite of some familiar pub food but do yourself a favor and look elsewhere 0 
soggy and not good 0 
the very idea of it was lame take a minor character from a mediocre pg13 film and make a complete nonsequel while changing its tone to a pgrated family movie 0 
very dissapointing performance 0 
great food and awesome service 1 
was not happy 0 
when i opened the sandwich i was impressed but not in a good way 0 
they could be used as exemplars for any set designer 1 
improper description i had to return it 0 
i think that it is a must see older john wayne film 1 
we definately enjoyed ourselves 1 
the sound quality for the device is unacceptableunless you are in a really quiet area you almost hear nothing 0 
a good quality bargain i bought this after i bought a cheapy from big lots that sounded awful and people on the other end couldnt hear me 1 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
dee snider just plain sucks 0 
worst customer service ever 0 
oh this is such a thing of beauty this restaurant 1 
everything was good and tasty 1 
the plot simply rumbles on like a machine desperately depending on the addition of new scenes 0 
lousy product 0 
and the rest of it just sits there being awful with soldiers singing songs about the masculinity they pledge themselves to hairsplitting about purity the admiration of swords etc 0 
id love to go back 1 
whatever the producer was going for he missed entirely 0 
great phone 1 
any ring toneoverall good phone to buy 1 
but she is still a bad actress repeating her robotic face moves in each of her pictures 0 
bland and flavorless is a good way of describing the barely tepid meat 0 
im pleased 1 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
i exchanged the sony ericson z500a for this and im pretty happy with that decision 1 
and then tragedy struck 0 
using all earpieces left or right this thing will not stay on my ear 0 
couldnt ask for a more satisfying meal 1 
buyerbe very careful 0 
give this one a look 1 
great food and great service in a clean and friendly setting 1 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
how awful she is 0 
plus its only 8 bucks 1 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
hes a national treasure 1 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
i give wirefly 1 stari will contact cingularatt and inform them of this practice 0 
now this dish was quite flavourful 1 
aside from its terrible lead this film has loads of other debits 0 
the instructions didnt explain that a microphone jack could be used 0 
just does not work 0 
jawbone era is awesome too 1 
when it opens the battery connection is broken and the device is turned off 0 
i gave it 5 stars then and im giving it 5 stars now 1 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
i saw this film over christmas and what a great film it was 1 
items stated as included from the description are not included 0 
this is a great phone 1 
i even fully charged it before i went to bed and turned off blue tooth and wifi and noticed that it only had 20 left in the morning 0 
hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in 0 
i also didnt like the on button it felt like it would crack with use 0 
my ribeye steak was cooked perfectly and had great mesquite flavor 1 
when im on this side of town this will definitely be a spot ill hit up again 1 
at least think to refill my water before i struggle to wave you over for 10 minutes 0 
basically the service was very bad 0 
the acting by the whole cast could be put on a scale and balanced perfectly between overacting and underacting 0 
never going back 0 
the fried rice was dry as well 0 
none of them are engaging or exciting 0 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
poor sound quality 0 
overall the film is interesting and thoughtprovoking 1 
if you see it you should probably just leave it on the shelf 0 
wow very spicy but delicious 1 
lets start with all the problemsÂ—the acting especially from the lead professor was very very bad 0 
i had to wait over 30 minutes to get my drink and longer to get 2 arepas 0 
absolutely great 1 
all in all an excellent restaurant highlighted by great service a unique menu and a beautiful setting 1 
sound quality on both end is excellent i use headset to call my wife and ask my wife to use headset to call me 2 1 
i love this thing 1 
it wasnt busy at all and now we know why 0 
to call this movie a drama is ridiculous 0 
i dont each much pasta but i love the homemade hand made pastas and thin pizzas here 1 
also notable is john baileys fine crisp beautifully colored cinematography and the great production design costumes by eiko ishioka who went on to do the memorable costumes for coppolas dracula for which she received a well deserved oscar 1 
garbo who showed right off the bat that her talents could carry over from the silent era i wanted to see some of her silent work but netflix doesnt seem to be stocking them 1 
disapointing results 0 
i love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it 1 
i felt asleep the first time i watched it so i can recommend it for insomniacs 0 
service was fantastic 1 
the menu is always changing food quality is going down service is extremely slow 0 
they have horrible attitudes towards customers and talk down to each one when customers dont enjoy their food 0 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
as for the service im a fan because its quick and youre being served by some nice folks 1 
the delivery was on time 1 
my sister has one also and she loves it 1 
i swung in to give them a try but was deeply disappointed 0 
that just screams legit in my booksomethats also pretty rare here in vegas 1 
the voice recognition thru the handset is excellent 1 
i wear it everyday and it holds up very well 1 
from what my dinner companions told meeverything was very fresh with nice texture and taste 1 
this place is way too overpriced for mediocre food 0 
pretty good beer selection too 1 
the story is also both funny and poignant at times 1 
the new characters werent all that memorable and i found myself forgetting who was who 0 
a happy wonderful feel good ending 1 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
the service was terrible food was mediocre 0 
their rotating beers on tap is also a highlight of this place 1 
the only good thing was our waiter he was very helpful and kept the bloddy marys coming 1 
would come back again if i had a sushi craving while in vegas 1 
perfect for the ps3 1 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
after charging overnight these batteries work great 1 
too bad you have to pay up to a month for the service 0 
this movie has a cutting edge to it 1 
while i managed to bend the leaf spring back in place the metal now has enough stress that it will break on the next drop 0 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
i especially liked the noncliche choices with the parents in other movies i could predict the dialog verbatim but the writing in this movie made better selections 1 
this place is pretty good nice little vibe in the restaurant 1 
i just cant explain this movie more than romanticcharminghilariousand adorablethe junkyard scenes are funnyall the junkyard dogs have something specialtoo funny i laughedkids will love itbuy it when it comes outit has new features 1 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
this was one of the worst films i have ever seen 0 
product is useless since it does not have enough charging current to charge the 2 cellphones i was planning to use it with 0 
for the price this was a great deal 1 
im a bit disappointed 0 
just spicy enough perfect actually 1 
1010 1 
but it picked up speed and got right to the point 1 
these headphones were a great find and i think they are perhaps the best purchase ive made in the last several years seriously 1 
if you have not seen this movie i definitely recommend it 1 
great place to eat reminds me of the little mom and pop shops in the san francisco bay area 1 
soggy and not good 0 
the building itself seems pretty neat the bathroom is pretty trippy but i wouldnt eat here again 0 
great character actors telly savalas and peter boyle 1 
20th century foxs road house 1948 is not only quite a silly noir but is an implausible unmitigated bore of a movie 0 
works for me 1 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
the film has great actors a master director a significant themeat least a wouldbe significant theme undertone of fifties existential worldweariness aerial scenes that ought to have thrilled both senses and imagination and characters about which one might deeply care 1 
service stinks here 0 
overall i rate this movie a 10 out of a 110 scale 1 
it showed exactly how the government and the scientist argued for humanity and the reasons of the gadget 1 
i love this thing 1 
not a pleasant voyage of selfdiscovery 0 
excellent starter wireless headset 0 
the film is well paced understated and one of the best courtroom documentaries ive seen 1 
and generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode 0 
overall i wasnt very impressed with noca 0 
i do think tom hanks is a good actor 1 
which are small and not worth the price 0 
it isnt even an achievement as a sobaditsgood or sobaditsmemorable movie 0 
i tried talking real loud but shouting on the telephone gets old and i was still told it wasnt great 0 
theres really nothing bad i can say about this headset 0 
great place to eat reminds me of the little mom and pop shops in the san francisco bay area 1 
i can think of no other film where something vitally important occurs every other minute 1 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
i gave it 5 stars then and im giving it 5 stars now 1 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
im super pissd 0 
verizons bills however are difficult to understand even though their pricing plans are simple 0 
there arent death scenes like in previous movies and the fx are terrible 0 
comes with a strong light that you can use to light up your camera shots and even flash sos signals seriously 1 
easily none other cartoon made me laugh in a tender way before getting into dark sitcoms oriented for teenagers 1 
not nearly as good looking as the amazon picture makes it look 0 
best tater tots in the southwest 1 
i have had problems wit hit dropping signal and more 0 
the only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive 1 
excellent hands free tool 1 
even the squibs look awful 0 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
phone falls out easily 0 
jawbone era is awesome too 1 
i wont be back 0 
the ripped banana was not only ripped but petrified and tasteless 0 
i do not know if this was emilio estevezs directorial debut but the pacing the interplay and development of the characters as well as some clever camera work surrounding the character estevez plays all suggest a natural eye 1 
if you stay in vegas you must get breakfast here at least once 1 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
we waited for forty five minutes in vain 0 
generous portions and great taste 1 
lovely little thriller from hitchcock with lots of nice shenanigans surrounding a murdered spy a kidnapped child a nasty church a foreign plot and some random taxidermists 1 
there is no plot or storyline 0 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
its a piece of crap 0 
bad fit way too big 0 
good product incredible value 1 
both rickman and stowe play their roles to the hilt in this tale of a childrens book writer who maybe has written a subversive tract 1 
i always order from the vegetarian menu during dinner which has a wide array of options to choose from 1 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
this is was due to the fact that it took 20 minutes to be acknowledged then another 35 minutes to get our foodand they kept forgetting things 0 
i have never had such bland food which surprised me considering the article we read focused so much on their spices and flavor 0 
nothing special 0 
the screen size is big key pad lit well enough and the camera quality is excellent for a camera phone 1 
i dont like this nokia either 0 
i think that it is a must see older john wayne film 1 
not much seafood and like 5 strings of pasta at the bottom 0 
really awful 0 
the budget was evidently very limited 0 
i love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it 1 
what a big waste of time 0 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
a drive thru means you do not want to wait around for half an hour for your food but somehow when we end up going here they make us wait and wait 0 
what a disappointment 0 
i had the mac salad and it was pretty bland so i will not be getting that again 0 
as for the mains also uninspired 0 
during several different 2 minute calls i experienced 5 drops and it was in an area that had 5 bars 0 
i think i was one of the people who found this another one of roths pearls 1 
im not really sure how joeys was voted best hot dog in the valley by readers of phoenix magazine 0 
i could not understand what kind of idiot would produce this mess in the first place not to mention several season 0 
best of luck to the rude and noncustomer service focused new management 0 
i recommend this for everyone who loves film movies anythinga work of art 1 
aside from its terrible lead this film has loads of other debits 0 
i have seen many movies starring jaclyn smith but my god this was one of her best though it came out 12 years ago 1 
if you love authentic mexican food and want a whole bunch of interesting yet delicious meats to choose from you need to try this place 1 
i couldnt think of a better way to end the film but a smile on my face great way to wrap up an amazing film and trilogy 1 
perabo has a nice energy level and is obviously very comfortable in front of a camera 1 
the battery is completely useless to me 0 
emily watsons character is very strong and she has only to give a quick glance and you understand everything 1 
the battery is completely useless to me 0 
to those who find this movie intelligent or even masterful i can only say its your intelligence and your imagination you obviously used to try and make some sense of this pitiful attempt its in our human nature to try and make sense of things 0 
his losing his marbles so early in the proceedings is totally implausible and unconvincing 0 
im in az all the time and now have my new spot 1 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
wow what a bad film 0 
this product is great it makes working a lot easier i can go to the copier while waiting on hold for something 1 
crostini that came with the salad was stale 0 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
plug was the wrong size 0 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
sauce was tasteless 0 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
but it picked up speed and got right to the point 1 
even when the women finally show up there is no sign of improvement the most expected things happen and by the time the film is over you might be far asleep 0 
also if your phone is dropped this case is not going to save it specially when dropped face down 0 
updatewent back for a second time and it was still just as amazing 1 
very comfortable 1 
very disappointing 0 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
i always order from the vegetarian menu during dinner which has a wide array of options to choose from 1 
reasonably priced also 1 
our server was super nice and checked on us many times 1 
woa talk about awful 0 
its like a bad two hour tv movie 0 
dee snider just plain sucks 0 
trying to make a call on these is an exercise in frustration 0 
i love all the features and form factor 1 
the sides are delish mixed mushrooms yukon gold puree white corn beateous 1 
the script is was there a script 0 
after 20 minutes wait i got a table 0 
i love all the features and form factor 1 
definitely worth checking out 1 
lastly the mozzarella sticks they were the best thing we ordered 1 
im not sure what he was trying to do with this film 0 
poor quality 0 
id love to go back 1 
the presentation of the food was awful 0 
save your money ive had this item for 11 months now 0 
the bt headset was such a disapoinment 0 
that was nice 1 
item arrived quickly and works great with my metro pcs samsung schr450 slider phone and sony premium sound in ear plugs 1 
the jerky camera movements were also annoying 0 
not recommended 0 
none of them are engaging or exciting 0 
a good quality bargain i bought this after i bought a cheapy from big lots that sounded awful and people on the other end couldnt hear me 1 
good value works fine power via usb car or wall outlet 1 
owners are really great people 1 
we watched our waiter pay a lot more attention to other tables and ignore us 0 
amazon sucks 0 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
very serious spoilers this movie was a huge disappointment 0 
you wont forget this movie 1 
it really is impressive that the place hasnt closed down 0 
i also decided not to send it back because our waitress looked like she was on the verge of having a heart attack 0 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
this greedy corporation will never see another dime from me 0 
we are so glad we found this place 1 
it sure does beat the nachos at the movies but i would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant 0 
it was too predictable even for a chick flick 0 
comfortable in my hand 1 
by the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant i was bored and didnt care what happened next and so i switched off 0 
i advise you to look out for it 1 
useless phone simply deaf 0 
the owners are super friendly and the staff is courteous 1 
it presents a idyllic yet serious portrayal of the ups and downs of the characters lives 1 
it also had a new problem 0 
the best electronics of the available fm transmitters 1 
we ordered the duck rare and it was pink and tender on the inside with a nice char on the outside 1 
i never walked out of a movie faster 0 
i love the pho and the spring rolls oh so yummy you have to try 1 
its been my choice headset for yearsgreat sound good volume good noise cancellation 1 
the food wasnt good 0 
generous portions and great taste 1 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
id love to go back 1 
what a waste of time 0 
i had heard good things about this place but it exceeding every hope i could have dreamed of 1 
not a good item it worked for a while then started having problems in my auto reverse tape player 0 
he was extremely rude and really there are so many other restaurants i would love to dine at during a weekend in vegas 0 
there is however some pretty good acting at least for this type of film 1 
this was one of the worst films i have ever seen 0 
great place to relax and have an awesome burger and beer 1 
reversible plug works great 1 
cant get the software to work with my computer 0 
i mean in a realistic world she would never have gotten into that ballet repertory the whole thing was quite pathetic 0 
lastly the mozzarella sticks they were the best thing we ordered 1 
this is an extraordinary film 1 
in fact i liked it better than interview with a vampire and i liked this lestat stuart townsend better than cruises attempt 1 
the battery is unreliable as well as the service use antena 0 
the script is horrendously stupid 0 
it was absolutely amazing 1 
he really didnt seem to want to be hosting his voiceovers were monotonous didnt get involved with the guests 0 
say bye bye to your tip lady 0 
i just cant explain this movie more than romanticcharminghilariousand adorablethe junkyard scenes are funnyall the junkyard dogs have something specialtoo funny i laughedkids will love itbuy it when it comes outit has new features 1 
it never condescends all the characters have good genuine hearts and believable problems 1 
these were so good we ordered them twice 1 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
excellent sound battery life and inconspicuous to boot 1 
i have had this phone for over a year now and i will tell you its not that great 0 
owners are really great people 1 
sound quality on both end is excellent i use headset to call my wife and ask my wife to use headset to call me 2 1 
it was that loudglad to say that the plantronics 510 maintains a flawless connection to my cell and with no static during normal use 1 
the movie in movie situations in the beginning and through the game that is played with her by the acting coach are fascinating 1 
we ordered some old classics and some new dishes after going there a few times and were sorely disappointed with everything 0 
with the originality and freshness of the first movie now spent this remake had little else to offer 0 
this is a beautiful phone 1 
very bad performance plays angela bennett a computer expert who is at home all the time 0 
the movie is not completely perfect but titta di girolamo will stay with you for a long time after the vision of the movie 1 
it did not work in my cell phone plug i am very up set with the charger 0 
at least think to refill my water before i struggle to wave you over for 10 minutes 0 
the aerial scenes were welldone 1 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
i let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this bad idea we both hated it 0 
in fact i liked it better than interview with a vampire and i liked this lestat stuart townsend better than cruises attempt 1 
the owner used to work at nobu so this place is really similar for half the price 1 
the only place good for this film is in the garbage 0 
it doesnt make you look cool 0 
not only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic but it also managed to give away the entire movie and im not exaggerating every moment every plot point every joke is told in the trailer 0 
they keep getting better and better this is my third one and ive had numerous palms too 1 
i have always used corded headsets and the freedom from the wireless is very helpful 1 
and it was boring 0 
waiter was a jerk 0 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
this may be the only bad film he ever made 0 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
so just beware 0 
after the first charge kept going dead after 12 minutes 0 
elias koteasjack palance play good roles angelina is hot and gets nakedbilly drago appears in this and is cool as usual a cameo by sven ole thorsen helps make this a very enjoyable movie with good acting and a decent budget 1 
bad characters bad story and bad acting 0 
a piece of junk that broke after being on my phone for 2 days 0 
will definitely be back 1 
the story itself is just predictable and lazy 0 
fantastic buy and will get again for whatever my next phone is 1 
service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is vegas and located inside the crystals shopping mall by aria 1 
what a mistake that was 0 
good audio quality 1 
the bartender was also nice 1 
punishment park is a brilliant piece of cinema 1 
the plantains were the worst ive ever tasted 0 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
the only consistent thread holding the series together were the amazing performances of leni parker and anita laselva as the two taelons in quiet idealogical conflict 0 
the show would begin with smart ass ed comments to each other that would be totally off the wall and uncalled for 0 
do not buy do not buyit sucks 0 
will never ever go back 0 
you get what you pay for i guess 0 
needless to say i wont be going back anytime soon 0 
linksys should have some way to exchange a bad phone for a refurb unit or something 0 
i swung in to give them a try but was deeply disappointed 0 
great atmosphere friendly and fast service 1 
lastly the mozzarella sticks they were the best thing we ordered 1 
the films dialogue is natural real to life 1 
it was too predictable even for a chick flick 0 
i couldnt think of a better way to end the film but a smile on my face great way to wrap up an amazing film and trilogy 1 
i was shocked because no signs indicate cash only 0 
great service and food 1 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
whatever prompted such a documentary is beyond me 0 
the script is bad very bad Â– it contains both cheesiness and unethical joke that you normally see in rated r or nc17 movie 0 
i bought this battery with a coupon from amazon and im very happy with my purchase 1 
the ripped banana was not only ripped but petrified and tasteless 0 
their menu is diverse and reasonably priced 1 
i didnt want the clip going over the top of my ear causing discomfort 0 
the service was terrible food was mediocre 0 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
this frog phone charm is adorable and very eye catching 1 
this place lacked style 0 
if you hate earbugs avoid this phone by all means 0 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
plug was the wrong size 0 
wow very spicy but delicious 1 
overall i like this place a lot 1 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
highly recommended a 1 
they refuse to refund or replace 0 
this was reflected not only in the cast but also in the belowpar script which borrowed much from the earlier classic 0 
otherwise dont even waste your time on this 0 
id advise anyone to go and see it 1 
what i really like there is the crepe station 1 
a greasy unhealthy meal 0 
good value great food great service 1 
it is well made easy to access the phone and has a handy detachable belt clip 1 
third the cheese on my friends burger was cold 0 
what on earth is irons doing in this film 0 
i highly recommend this device to everyone 1 
your servers suck wait correction our server heimer sucked 0 
the delivery was on time 1 
up there with the best of melville 1 
when i opened the sandwich i was impressed but not in a good way 0 
nine out of ten for a truly lovely film 1 
the nachos are a must have 1 
things that went wrong they burned the saganaki 0 
i like steiners because its dark and it feels like a bar 1 
i liked it 1 
their steaks are 100 recommended 1 
excellent bluetooth headset 1 
i just wanted to leave 0 
i had ordered a motorola data cable got a very well finished and working product 1 
extremely tasty 1 
the bt headset was such a disapoinment 0 
the han nan chicken was also very tasty 1 
i was able to do voice dialing in the car with no problem 1 
this was utterly confusing at first which caused me to lose a couple of very very important contacts 0 
this was such an awesome movie that i bought it off of ebay 1 
i dont think you will be disappointed 1 
his performance as awarded was stunning 1 
crust is not good 0 
this allows the possibility of double booking for the same date and time after the first 0 
great phone 1 
buttons are too small 0 
its a little geeky but i think thats its sex on toast and it rocks and oozes sex right down to its battery embedded sleek stylish leather case 1 
the text messaging feature is really tricky to use 0 
i could not understand what kind of idiot would produce this mess in the first place not to mention several season 0 
they never brought a salad we asked for 0 
it is simple to use and i like it 1 
at least think to refill my water before i struggle to wave you over for 10 minutes 0 
howeverthe riingtones are not the best and neither are the games 0 
definitely worth checking out 1 
that was nice 1 
too bad you have to pay up to a month for the service 0 
and his subtle connections between the three films are awesome 1 
i dont think it would hold it too securly on your belt 0 
gets the job done 1 
also the story and acting were weak 0 
i wont be back 0 
after a year the battery went completely dead on my headset 0 
freezes frequently4 0 
the delivery was on time 1 
worst ever 0 
so i basically threw my money out the window for nothing 0 
he came running after us when he realized my husband had left his sunglasses on the table 1 
to call this movie a drama is ridiculous 0 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
they keep getting better and better this is my third one and ive had numerous palms too 1 
the best place to go for a tasty bowl of pho 1 
im not sure what he was trying to do with this film 0 
seller shipped quickly and much cheaper than the competitors 1 
the servers went back and forth several times not even so much as an are you being helped 0 
the buttons for on and off are bad 0 
using all earpieces left or right this thing will not stay on my ear 0 
i could barely stomach the meal but didnt complain because it was a business lunch 0 
car charger as well as ac charger are included to make sure you never run out of juicehighy recommended 1 
price is good too 1 
the selection on the menu was great and so were the prices 1 
in conclusion i will not bother with this movie because a volcano in los angeles is nothing but nonsense 0 
great phone 1 
not worth it 0 
better than expected 1 
the staff is friendly and the joint is always clean 1 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
i really enjoyed crema cafÃ© before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
how awesome is that 1 
i couldnt think of a better way to end the film but a smile on my face great way to wrap up an amazing film and trilogy 1 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
it was just too horrible 0 
the range is very decent ive been able to roam around my house with the phone in the living room with no receptionsound quality issues 1 
but i dont like it 0 
this phone is very fast with sending any kind of messages and web browsing is significantly faster than previous phones i have used 1 
what on earth is irons doing in this film 0 
just whatever you do avoid groove as its the antithesis of all that is good about human traffic 0 
delicious and i will absolutely be back 1 
who in their right mind is gonna buy this battery 0 
on a positive note our server was very attentive and provided great service 1 
it rocked my world and is certainly a must see for anyone with no social or physical outlets 1 
the food was terrible 0 
i really enjoyed eating here 1 
it was so cool 1 
another thing i didnt really like is when a character got punched in the face a gallon of blood would spew forth soon after 0 
it failed to convey the broad sweep of landscapes that were a great part of the original 0 
total waste of time 0 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
the accompanied software is almost brilliant 1 
this place is handsdown one of the best places to eat in the phoenix metro area 1 
tied to charger for conversations lasting more than 45 minutesmajor problems 0 
and i really did find them funny 1 
10 out of 10 stars 1 
i found this move beautiful enjoyable and uplifting 1 
the service here leaves a lot to be desired 0 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
ive owned this phone for 7 months now and can say that its the best mobile phone ive had 1 
the best place to go for a tasty bowl of pho 1 
i hate those things as much as cheap quality black olives 0 
some highlights great quality nigiri here 1 
the whole experience was underwhelming and i think well just go to ninja sushi next time 0 
only like 3 or 4 buildings used a couple of locations maybe poor hummh 0 
chinese forgeries abound 0 
this battery is an excellent bargain 1 
i couldnt think of a better way to end the film but a smile on my face great way to wrap up an amazing film and trilogy 1 
mediocre food 0 
a happy wonderful feel good ending 1 
the script is bad very bad Â– it contains both cheesiness and unethical joke that you normally see in rated r or nc17 movie 0 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
i am a fan of his this movie sucked really bad 0 
the attractive set used throughout most of the film is an eyepleasing gem 1 
the macarons here are insanely good 1 
go and see it 1 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
this case seems well made 1 
if you hate earbugs avoid this phone by all means 0 
this is a simple little phone to use but the breakage is unacceptible 0 
the mic is great 1 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
went for lunch service was slow 0 
would recommend this item 1 
also the story and acting were weak 0 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
i ordered the lemon raspberry ice cocktail which was also incredible 1 
reversible plug works great 1 
jabra ear gels r the best 1 
the structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema 1 
well never go again 0 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
you cant go wrong with any of the food here 1 
in conclusion i will not bother with this movie because a volcano in los angeles is nothing but nonsense 0 
not too screamy not to masculine but just right 1 
very good food great atmosphere1 1 
but this movie really got to me 1 
as for the killer dont expect anything original or even remotely frightening 0 
the best place to go for a tasty bowl of pho 1 
waitress was good though 1 
her lines seem to have been written by a fifteen year old though they are trying oh so so hard to sound like how a fifteen year old would really um you know well talk 0 
crust is not good 0 
any ring toneoverall good phone to buy 1 
the owners really really need to quit being soooooo cheap let them wrap my freaking sandwich in two papers not one 0 
we loved the biscuits 1 
it probably would have been better if the director hadnt spent most of the movie showcasing his own art work which really isnt that noteworthy 0 
spend your money and time some place else 0 
i bought two of them and neither will charge 0 
how awesome is that 1 
while i managed to bend the leaf spring back in place the metal now has enough stress that it will break on the next drop 0 
there is no real plot 0 
it was an inexpensive piece but i would still have expected better quality 0 
the acting was bad the dialogs were extremely shallow and insincere 0 
didnt laugh or even smile once 0 
the volume for the ringer is real good you have choices how loud 1 
her lines seem to have been written by a fifteen year old though they are trying oh so so hard to sound like how a fifteen year old would really um you know well talk 0 
you wont be disappointed 1 
the film succeeds despite or perhaps because of an obviously meagre budget 1 
i believe the screenwriter did a good job of tying up the loose ends 1 
unfortunately this is a bad movie that is just plain bad 0 
even worse than ticker 0 
buttons are too small 0 
just dont know why they were so slow 0 
there was so much hype over this phone that i assumed it was the best my mistake 0 
was not happy 0 
dont waste your money 0 
i had the chicken pho and it tasted very bland 0 
i believe every one should see this movie as i think few people outside of south africa understand its past and what is being attempted in the truth and reconciliation process 1 
good service very clean and inexpensive to boot 1 
best of all is the rotating feature very helpful 1 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
if good intentions made a film great then this film might be one of the greatest films ever made 1 
these are the central themes of the film and they are handled ineptly stereotypically and with no depth of imagination 0 
ill put this gem up against any movie in terms of screenplay cinematography acting postproduction editing directing or any other aspect of filmmaking 1 
there is really nothing for me at postinos hope your experience is better 0 
overall the film is interesting and thoughtprovoking 1 
all the pretty pictures in the world cannot make up for a piece of work that is flawed at the core 0 
i believe every one should see this movie as i think few people outside of south africa understand its past and what is being attempted in the truth and reconciliation process 1 
strike 2 who wants to be rushed 0 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
jawbone era is awesome too 1 
very windresistant 1 
the fries were not hot and neither was my burger 0 
i didnt want the clip going over the top of my ear causing discomfort 0 
i would have given no star if i was able 0 
soggy and not good 0 
and the beans and rice were mediocre at best 0 
i swung in to give them a try but was deeply disappointed 0 
then theres the plot holes 0 
it was that year however that reminded us that huston was still at the top of his game as evinced by his faithful adaptation of james joyces acclaimed novella the dead 1 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
i can barely ever hear on it and am constantly saying what 0 
great food and great service in a clean and friendly setting 1 
talk about great customer service of course we will be back 1 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
after watching this film i wanted to learn more about the works of this artist 1 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
i would have given no star if i was able 0 
it has everything i need and i couldnt ask for more 1 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
this pda rocks 1 
it is well made easy to access the phone and has a handy detachable belt clip 1 
i can think of no other film where something vitally important occurs every other minute 1 
my boyfriend tried the mediterranean chicken salad and fell in love 1 
he came running after us when he realized my husband had left his sunglasses on the table 1 
the chips and salsa were really good the salsa was very fresh 1 
we are so glad we found this place 1 
four stars for the food the guy in the blue shirt for his great vibe still letting us in to eat 1 
there is no plot here to keep you going in the first place 0 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
it was a good thing that the tickets only cost five dollars because i would be mad if id have paid 750 to see this crap 0 
the only good thing was our waiter he was very helpful and kept the bloddy marys coming 1 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichÃ©s to be admitted elsewhere 0 
there was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth but it didnt really work into the rest of the plot 0 
okay i like to consider myself a fair critic so ill give credit where credits duethe creature effects were actually pretty cool 1 
comfortable in my hand 1 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
didnt laugh or even smile once 0 
in the summer you can dine in a charming outdoor patio so very delightful 1 
ill put this gem up against any movie in terms of screenplay cinematography acting postproduction editing directing or any other aspect of filmmaking 1 
performed awful muffled tinny incoming sound and severe echo for those on the other end of the call 0 
waaaaaayyyyyyyyyy over rated is all i am saying 0 
their daily specials are always a hit with my group 1 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
the color is even prettier than i thought it would be and the graphics are incredibly sharp 1 
the story is lame not interesting and never really explains the sinister origins of the puppets 0 
ambience is perfect 1 
very convenient since we were staying at the mgm 1 
ray charles is legendary 1 
very very fun chef 1 
its still wild stuff though and is highly recommended to fans of giallo cinema 1 
i was left shattered from the experience of watching this film and i took a good two hours to fully recover 0 
your servers suck wait correction our server heimer sucked 0 
i love lane but ive never seen her in a movie this lousy 0 
this is a very average phone with bad battery life that operates on a weak network 0 
there are massive levels massive unlockable characters its just a massive game 1 
you could drive a semi truck into these holes 0 
jabra ear gels r the best 1 
this is one of the best italian thrillers of the early 70s 1 
this is truly an art movieit actually has a lot of art in it 1 
the nokia ca42 usb cable did not work with my phone 0 
very windresistant 1 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
before i go in to why i gave a 1 star rating please know that this was my third time eating at bachi burger before writing a review 0 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
too bad you have to pay up to a month for the service 0 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
nice spicy and tender 1 
it was an inexpensive piece but i would still have expected better quality 0 
i immediately said i wanted to talk to the manager but i did not want to talk to the guy who was doing shots of fireball behind the bar 0 
the script is bad very bad Â– it contains both cheesiness and unethical joke that you normally see in rated r or nc17 movie 0 
frozen pucks of disgust with some of the worst people behind the register 0 
the lighting is awful 0 
the only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive 1 
this place receives stars for their appetizers 1 
no one at the table thought the food was above average or worth the wait that we had for it 0 
overall the film is interesting and thoughtprovoking 1 
we thought youd have to venture further away to get good sushi but this place really hit the spot that night 1 
my salad had a bland vinegrette on the baby greens and hearts of palm 0 
i am very impressed with the job that motorola did on the sturdiness of this phone 1 
buyerbe very careful 0 
love this place hits the spot when i want something healthy but not lacking in quantity or flavor 1 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
having trouble with volume 0 
i would recommend purchasing the jabra jx10 series 2 which works flawlessly with my moto q go figure 1 
also notable is john baileys fine crisp beautifully colored cinematography and the great production design costumes by eiko ishioka who went on to do the memorable costumes for coppolas dracula for which she received a well deserved oscar 1 
overall i like there food and the service 1 
this is one of the best italian thrillers of the early 70s 1 
battery life is also great 1 
i want to first say our server was great and we had perfect service 1 
the phone was unusable and was not new 0 
overall i like there food and the service 1 
i was bored throughout the whole damn thing 0 
i want my money back 0 
the folks at otto always make us feel so welcome and special 1 
plus it was wellpaced and suited its relatively short run time 1 
horrible horrible protector 0 
very pleased with this headset 1 
oh and i forgot to also mention the weird color effect it has on your phone 0 
but it does get better reception and clarity than any phone ive had before 1 
it was that loudglad to say that the plantronics 510 maintains a flawless connection to my cell and with no static during normal use 1 
whatever prompted such a documentary is beyond me 0 
waste of money 0 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
end of days is one of the worst bigbudget action movies ive ever seen 0 
i am very happy 1 
the good cinematography also makes her and monica bellucci look very beautiful 1 
nothing short of magnificent photographycinematography in this film 1 
disappointment i hate anything that goes in my ear 0 
jawbone era is awesome too 1 
my boyfriend and i came here for the first time on a recent trip to vegas and could not have been more pleased with the quality of food and service 1 
this is an outstanding little restaurant with some of the best food i have ever tasted 1 
you wont regret it 1 
totally believable 1 
i keep watching it over and over 1 
the restaurant atmosphere was exquisite 1 
the service was a little slow considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace 0 
however after finally watching this film i realized that not only had i had a closed mind to the brilliance it depicts i also found myself watching it over and over again 1 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
audio quality is poor very poor 0 
what i really like there is the crepe station 1 
i was so insulted 0 
aailiyah was pretty good as akasha in places compelling her first entrance and mini dance scene 1 
what should have been a hilarious yummy christmas eve dinner to remember was the biggest fail of the entire trip for us 0 
the tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu 0 
i was mortified 0 
initially the local sites in the film which was filmed here in buffalo intrigued me 1 
the awful dialogue and hopeless overacting by everyone who gets shot top off a real waste of space and time 0 
also great directing and photography 1 
in fact this stinker smells like a directtovideo release 0 
i was totally fascinated by the music the dancing everything 1 
great product 1 
will be back again 1 
went for lunch service was slow 0 
good audio quality 1 
if you see it you should probably just leave it on the shelf 0 
im trying to return it for a refund 0 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
the selection of food was not the best 0 
this is my new fav vegas buffet spot 1 
he was extremely rude and really there are so many other restaurants i would love to dine at during a weekend in vegas 0 
not my thing 0 
rating 010 grade z note the show is so bad that even mother of the cast pull her daughter out of the show 0 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
im really disappointed all i have now is a charger that doesnt work 0 
my rating just 3 out of 10 0 
it is a very well acted and done tv movie 1 
unfortunately the ability to actually know you are receiving a call is a rather important feature and this phone is pitiful in that respect 0 
i am pairing this with my iphone and i could not be happier with it so far 1 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
im a bit disappointed 0 
predictable but not a bad watch 1 
i didnt know pulled pork could be soooo delicious 1 
this is my new fav vegas buffet spot 1 
nice design and quality 1 
easily none other cartoon made me laugh in a tender way before getting into dark sitcoms oriented for teenagers 1 
the warmth it generates is in contrast to its austere backdrop 1 
the bus boy on the other hand was so rude 0 
being a 90s child i truly enjoyed this show and i can proudly say that i enjoyed it big time and even more than the classical wb cartoons 1 
its extremely slow and takes forever to do anything with it 0 
point your finger at any item on the menu order it and you wont be disappointed 1 
four stars for the food the guy in the blue shirt for his great vibe still letting us in to eat 1 
if i take a picture the battery drops a bar and starts beeping letting me know its dieing 0 
my boyfriend tried the mediterranean chicken salad and fell in love 1 
the update procedure is difficult and cumbersome 0 
everything on the menu is terrific and we were also thrilled that they made amazing accommodations for our vegetarian daughter 1 
i saw this film over christmas and what a great film it was 1 
none of them are engaging or exciting 0 
ordered burger rare came in well done 0 
its also great to see that renowned silent screenwriter frances marion hasnt missed a step going from silent to sound 1 
there arent death scenes like in previous movies and the fx are terrible 0 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
almost everyone involved must be return to school acting is utterly predictable and bad script is pile of garbage all round 0 
the entire audience applauded at the conclusion of the film 1 
not only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic but it also managed to give away the entire movie and im not exaggerating every moment every plot point every joke is told in the trailer 0 
the entire audience applauded at the conclusion of the film 1 
we also ordered the spinach and avocado salad the ingredients were sad and the dressing literally had zero taste 0 
her role was played well 1 
its worth driving up from tucson 1 
but it wasnt until i watched this film that i realised how great he actually was 1 
couldnt figure it out 0 
we were promptly greeted and seated 1 
this pair of headphones is the worst that i have ever had soundwise 0 
product is exactly as described 1 
the volume for the ringer is real good you have choices how loud 1 
it is very educational for children 1 to 8 years old 1 
wont ever go here again 0 
i really enjoyed eating here 1 
great place to relax and have an awesome burger and beer 1 
the scripting of the subtle comedy is unmatched by any movie in recent years 1 
works for me 1 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
i wish i could return the unit and get back my money 0 
the burrittos blah 0 
sam shepards portrayal of a gung ho marine was sobering 1 
it was way over fried 0 
this place deserves no stars 0 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
i gave it a 10 1 
it has a very good plot it holds your complete attention the acting is superb tom wilkinson was fantastic and emily watson was also very good 1 
watching washing machine twirling around wouldnt hurt your eyes as much as this show 0 
this is essentially a communications tool that does not communicate 0 
my sister has one also and she loves it 1 
the owner used to work at nobu so this place is really similar for half the price 1 
i believe every one should see this movie as i think few people outside of south africa understand its past and what is being attempted in the truth and reconciliation process 1 
the battery is unreliable as well as the service use antena 0 
first of all it doesnt wear well 0 
one of the worst shows of all time 0 
i got to enjoy the seafood salad with a fabulous vinegrette 1 
the story is beyond stupid 0 
this product is clearly not ready for prime time i dont care how cool it looks if you cant tell a call is coming in its worthless 0 
i mean in a realistic world she would never have gotten into that ballet repertory the whole thing was quite pathetic 0 
no ear loop needed its tiny and the sound is great 1 
camerawork again bad 0 
i would highly recommend this 1 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
the service was terrible though 0 
if i take a picture the battery drops a bar and starts beeping letting me know its dieing 0 
this place is good 1 
the food is not tasty at all not to say its real traditional hunan style 0 
last night was my second time dining here and i was so happy i decided to go back 1 
camerawork again bad 0 
great pocket pc phone combination 1 
ive never been more insulted or felt disrespected 0 
and i just love the colors 1 
a world better than 95 of the garbage in the theatres today 1 
phone is sturdy as all nokia bar phones are 1 
go to place for gyros 1 
kieslowski never ceases to amaze me 1 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
worst ever 0 
excellent sound quality 1 
i guess maybe we went on an off night but it was disgraceful 0 
big disappointment with calendar sync 0 
nothing short of magnificent photographycinematography in this film 1 
i could not understand what kind of idiot would produce this mess in the first place not to mention several season 0 
the cast of veteran actors are more than just a nostalgia trip 1 
we have tried 2 units and they both failed within 2 months pros 0 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
its a feelgood film and thats how i felt when i came out of the cinema 1 
the characters are interesting even if a bit predictable 1 
hackneyed writing certainly but made even worse by the bad directing 0 
it also had a new problem 0 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
phenomenal food service and ambiance 1 
the aerial scenes were welldone 1 
it didnt charge for me 0 
unfortunately cover girl is an example of how hollywood used to exploit women for financial gain 0 
maybe its just their vegetarian fare but ive been twice and i thought it was average at best 0 
i love that they put their food in nice plastic containers as opposed to cramming it in little paper takeout boxes 1 
this if the first movie ive given a 10 to in years 1 
i am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this 1 
the battery works great 1 
the classic maine lobster roll was fantastic 1 
does not work 0 
ray charles is legendary 1 
and i really did find them funny 1 
i went on motorolas website and followed all directions but could not get it to pair again 0 
too bad cause i know its family owned i really wanted to like this place 0 
rude inconsiderate management 0 
its still wild stuff though and is highly recommended to fans of giallo cinema 1 
the only thing i did like was the prime rib and dessert section 1 
excellent cast story line performances 1 
i love the scream movies and all horror movies and this one ranks way up there 1 
everything stinks 0 
this is some seriously good pizza and im an expertconnisseur on the topic 1 
will order from them again 1 
works great 1 
i was mortified 0 
spend your money and time some place else 0 
some highlights great quality nigiri here 1 
full of unconvincing cardboard characters it is blandly written by edward chodorov who also produced and is surprisingly directed by jean negulesco from whom one would expect a great deal more 0 
updatewent back for a second time and it was still just as amazing 1 
this movie is terrible 0 
great phone 1 
must have been an off night at this place 0 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
in fact i liked it better than interview with a vampire and i liked this lestat stuart townsend better than cruises attempt 1 
nice case feels good in your hands 1 
maybe if they werent cold they would have been somewhat edible 0 
seriously killer hot chai latte 1 
verizons bills however are difficult to understand even though their pricing plans are simple 0 
last time buying from you 0 
her lines seem to have been written by a fifteen year old though they are trying oh so so hard to sound like how a fifteen year old would really um you know well talk 0 
his losing his marbles so early in the proceedings is totally implausible and unconvincing 0 
this is definitely a cult classic well worth viewing and sharing with others 1 
i could not understand what kind of idiot would produce this mess in the first place not to mention several season 0 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
i love that they put their food in nice plastic containers as opposed to cramming it in little paper takeout boxes 1 
shes poised and amazing 1 
this is a great deal 1 
the bartender was also nice 1 
the manager was the worst 0 
overall i like this place a lot 1 
i received my orders well within the shipping timeframe everything was in good working order and overall i am very excited to have this source 1 
the company shipped my product very promptly and it works well 1 
not easy to watch 0 
these products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet 0 
its like a bad two hour tv movie 0 
i found the product to be easy to set up and use 1 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
nice spicy and tender 1 
the food is rich so order accordingly 1 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
i sat riveted to the tv screen 1 
she ordered a toasted english muffin that came out untoasted 0 
it showed exactly how the government and the scientist argued for humanity and the reasons of the gadget 1 
i think the most wonderful parts literally full of wonder are the excerpts from his works 1 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
the food was terrible 0 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
setup couldnt have been simpler 1 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
its this pandering to the audience that sabotages most of his films 0 
will never ever go back and have told many people what had happened 0 
i could eat their bruschetta all day it is devine 1 
first off the reception sucks i have never had more than 2 bars ever 0 
an extensive menu provides lots of options for breakfast 1 
the acting was bad the dialogs were extremely shallow and insincere 0 
my ribeye steak was cooked perfectly and had great mesquite flavor 1 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
i bought two of them and neither will charge 0 
an extensive menu provides lots of options for breakfast 1 
the pizza tasted old super chewy in not a good way 0 
the film has great actors a master director a significant themeat least a wouldbe significant theme undertone of fifties existential worldweariness aerial scenes that ought to have thrilled both senses and imagination and characters about which one might deeply care 1 
love this product 1 
not my thing 0 
this product is great it makes working a lot easier i can go to the copier while waiting on hold for something 1 
great value 1 
this is a great phone 1 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
it is worth the drive 1 
what a disappointment 0 
the cow tongue and cheek tacos are amazing 1 
this place is amazing 1 
both actors truly understand and become their particular character delivering a convincing sincere performance 1 
i ordered this for sony ericsson w810i but i think it only worked once thats when i first used it 0 
you can find better movies at youtube 0 
worthwhile 1 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
it was a good thing that the tickets only cost five dollars because i would be mad if id have paid 750 to see this crap 0 
however paul schrader has indeed made a film about mishima that is both superb complex 1 
highquality chicken on the chicken caesar salad 1 
now this is a movie i really dislike 0 
very unreliable service from tmobile 0 
and the red curry had so much bamboo shoots and wasnt very tasty to me 0 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
the plastic breaks really easy on this clip 0 
it seems completely secure both holding on to my belt and keeping the iphone inside 1 
the dialogue is composed of things that make little sense 0 
they do not care about the consumer one bit 0 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
if you are razr owneryou must have this 1 
that company is a joke 0 
piece of trash 0 
i could barely stomach the meal but didnt complain because it was a business lunch 0 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
the kids are very cool too 1 
eew this location needs a complete overhaul 0 
so i basically threw my money out the window for nothing 0 
the only very disappointing thing was there was no speakerphone 0 
best breakfast buffet 1 
the headsets are easy to use and everyone loves them 1 
this case seems well made 1 
these are certainly very comfortable and functionality is decent 1 
the poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying 0 
as a sushi lover avoid this place by all means 0 
i dont each much pasta but i love the homemade hand made pastas and thin pizzas here 1 
that movie was bad 0 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
its just lame 0 
i guess maybe we went on an off night but it was disgraceful 0 
excellent dualpurpose headset 1 
this is just a great movie 1 
it really is impressive that the place hasnt closed down 0 
worked perfectly 1 
cool phone 1 
i believe every one should see this movie as i think few people outside of south africa understand its past and what is being attempted in the truth and reconciliation process 1 
dont waste your money and time 0 
the manager was the worst 0 
it is light has plenty of battery capacity and is very confortable to wear for somewhat extended periods of time 1 
i would highly recommend this product 1 
the grilled chicken was so tender and yellow from the saffron seasoning 1 
it probably would have been better if the director hadnt spent most of the movie showcasing his own art work which really isnt that noteworthy 0 
nice headphones for the price and they work great 1 
an excellent new restaurant by an experienced frenchman 1 
the black eyed peas and sweet potatoes unreal 1 
i got the aluminum case for my new palm vx and it worked really wellit has protected my handheld perfectly so far 1 
one of the most disappointing aspects is the lack of notable gore 0 
will be back again 1 
we made the drive all the way from north scottsdale and i was not one bit disappointed 1 
very funny 1 
the script is bad very bad Â– it contains both cheesiness and unethical joke that you normally see in rated r or nc17 movie 0 
you get extra minutes so that you can carry out the call and not get cut off 1 
one thing i hate is the mode set button at the side 0 
very good quality though 1 
good value works fine power via usb car or wall outlet 1 
so in a nutshell 1 the restaraunt smells like a combination of a dirty fish market and a sewer 0 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
ordered burger rare came in well done 0 
the service was poor and thats being nice 0 
ray charles is legendary 1 
mic doesnt work 0 
dont waste your money 0 
highly recommended a 1 
too bad you have to pay up to a month for the service 0 
those phones are working just fine now 1 
my wife had the lobster bisque soup which was lukewarm 0 
emily watsons character is very strong and she has only to give a quick glance and you understand everything 1 
the battery is completely useless to me 0 
poor quality and service 0 
the movie had you on the edge of your seat and made you somewhat afraid to go to your car at the end of the night 1 
finally after three or four times the spring of the latch broke and i could not use it any longer on the visor 0 
the explosion of the gas tanks at the end was just as awful 0 
the acting as youd expect from this cast is top notch 1 
so for our enjoyment we get to see them run around play games and be dangerous 1 
strike 2 who wants to be rushed 0 
the vanilla ice cream was creamy and smooth while the profiterole choux pastry was fresh enough 1 
if you are razr owneryou must have this 1 
it is worth the drive 1 
just really good so far probably the best bt headset i have ever had 1 
its very slow 0 
all of the tapas dishes were delicious 1 
really good product 1 
it seems completely secure both holding on to my belt and keeping the iphone inside 1 
just what i wanted 1 
i love my 350 headset my jabra350 bluetooth headset is great the reception is very good and the ear piece is a comfortable fit 1 
the movie has almost no action scenes in it and very little comedy 0 
the plot simply rumbles on like a machine desperately depending on the addition of new scenes 0 
i had the mac salad and it was pretty bland so i will not be getting that again 0 
dont buy this product it fails 0 
we also ordered the spinach and avocado salad the ingredients were sad and the dressing literally had zero taste 0 
delicious and i will absolutely be back 1 
great hands free device 1 
the file browser offers all the options that one needshandsfree is great 1 
lets start with all the problemsÂ—the acting especially from the lead professor was very very bad 0 
it has all the features i want 1 
you cant beat that 1 
what a waste of money and time 0 
comfortable fit you need your headset to be comfortable for at least an hour at a time if not for an entire day 1 
still i do like this movie for its empowerment of women theres not enough movies out there like this one 1 
muddy low quality sound and the casing around the wires insert was poorly super glued and slid off 0 
best service and food ever maria our server was so good and friendly she made our day 1 
after a year the battery went completely dead on my headset 0 
both great 1 
wonderful lil tapas and the ambience made me feel all warm and fuzzy inside 1 
putting the race card aside lets look at the major flaw in the film they destroy latifas character 0 
i got the aluminum case for my new palm vx and it worked really wellit has protected my handheld perfectly so far 1 
you never know if you pushed it hard enough or the right number of times for the function you want or not 0 
if you love death and decay and shakespears lyrics this is the one 1 
definitely worth checking out 1 
worst thai ever 0 
this was reflected not only in the cast but also in the belowpar script which borrowed much from the earlier classic 0 
this film has no redeeming features 0 
i am a fan of his this movie sucked really bad 0 
its just lame 0 
the chefs were friendly and did a good job 1 
seriously its not worth wasting your or your kids time on 0 
it didnt make me scared horrified or make me sympathetic towards the characters it was simply annoying 0 
product was excellent and works better than the verizon one and boy was it cheaper 1 
great price also 1 
at least think to refill my water before i struggle to wave you over for 10 minutes 0 
its like a really sexy party in your mouth where youre outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party 1 
this allows the possibility of double booking for the same date and time after the first 0 
aside from its terrible lead this film has loads of other debits 0 
it is light has plenty of battery capacity and is very confortable to wear for somewhat extended periods of time 1 
it was so funny 1 
dont make the same mistake that i did and please dont buy this phone 0 
there still are good actors around 1 
if she had not rolled the eyes we may have stayed not sure if we will go back and try it again 0 
good product incredible value 1 
awesome device 1 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
i would not recommend this place 0 
and service was super friendly 1 
the good cinematography also makes her and monica bellucci look very beautiful 1 
excellent bluetooth headset 1 
this movie is also revealing 1 
im using it with an iriver spinn with case and it fits fine 1 
the real disappointment was our waiter 0 
food was delicious 1 
it also had a new problem 0 
didnt laugh or even smile once 0 
it was so bad i had lost the heart to finish it 0 
sounds good reasonably priced and effective its that simple 1 
i consider this theft 0 
painful on the ear 0 
id advise anyone to go and see it 1 
secondly hitchcock pretty much perfected the thriller and chase movie 1 
the phone crashed completely and now i have to get it replaced 0 
it was a pale color instead of nice and char and has no flavor 0 
great place to relax and have an awesome burger and beer 1 
great product and price 1 
the whole experience was underwhelming and i think well just go to ninja sushi next time 0 
this is actually a very smart movie 1 
never going back 0 
the headsets are easy to use and everyone loves them 1 
my salad had a bland vinegrette on the baby greens and hearts of palm 0 
you have to hold the phone at a particular angle for the other party to hear you clearly 0 
ive bought 5 wired headphones that sound better than these 0 
good value works fine power via usb car or wall outlet 1 
editing the editing of this film was phenomenal in my opinion 1 
very unreliable service from tmobile 0 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
my boyfriend tried the mediterranean chicken salad and fell in love 1 
the folks at otto always make us feel so welcome and special 1 
they do not last forever but is not overly expensive to replaceeasy to operate and the sound is much better than others i have tried 1 
and the chef was generous with his time even came around twice so we can take pictures with him 1 
trying to make a call on these is an exercise in frustration 0 
excellent product for the price 1 
perabo has a nice energy level and is obviously very comfortable in front of a camera 1 
it is simple to use and i like it 1 
i would recommend this 1 
never going back 0 
works great 1 
i dont know what kind it is but they have the best iced tea 1 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
service sucks 0 
the goat taco didnt skimp on the meat and wow what flavor 1 
it dit not work most of the time with my nokia 5320 0 
horrible 0 
punishment park is a brilliant piece of cinema 1 
it was horrendous 0 
watching washing machine twirling around wouldnt hurt your eyes as much as this show 0 
my breakfast was perpared great with a beautiful presentation of 3 giant slices of toast lightly dusted with powdered sugar 1 
it was a pale color instead of nice and char and has no flavor 0 
it is wonderful and inspiring to watch and i hope that it gets released again on to video or dvd 1 
i paid too much 0 
the lighting is awful 0 
when i saw it in the theater i thought i was going to be sick 0 
but this movie really got to me 1 
i had heard good things about this place but it exceeding every hope i could have dreamed of 1 
i had the mac salad and it was pretty bland so i will not be getting that again 0 
ambience is perfect 1 
dont miss it 1 
it showed exactly how the government and the scientist argued for humanity and the reasons of the gadget 1 
the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach 0 
seller shipped quickly and much cheaper than the competitors 1 
you cant go wrong with any of the food here 1 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
his costars dont fare much better with people like morgan freeman jonah hill and ed helms just wasted 0 
he surely doesnt know how to make a coherent action movie from the screenwriter of air force one who was only obliged to write the script just for a big sum of money 0 
rude inconsiderate management 0 
it is a very well acted and done tv movie 1 
the visual effects were awful 0 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
this second appearance of mickey mouse following the silent plane crazy earlier that year is probably his most famous filmmostly because it was so groundbreaking 1 
please dont waste your money 0 
best headset ever 1 
this place is not worth your time let alone vegas 0 
reversible plug works great 1 
conclusion very filling meals 1 
best tater tots in the southwest 1 
this film offers many delights and surprises 1 
sprint charges for this service 0 
if this premise sound stupid thats because it is 0 
i really like this product over the motorola because it is allot clearer on the ear piece and the mic 1 
this is a great restaurant at the mandalay bay 1 
not good by any stretch of the imagination 0 
delicious and i will absolutely be back 1 
i used bitpim a free program you can find on the internetto transfer data to the phonethe price of the cable was excellent 1 
i have to use the smallest earpieces provided but it stays on pretty well 1 
again no plot at all 0 
nothing special 0 
wonderful lil tapas and the ambience made me feel all warm and fuzzy inside 1 
and generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode 0 
this place deserves one star and 90 has to do with the food 0 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
i was mortified 0 
a fly was in my apple juice a fly 0 
service stinks here 0 
i would recommend purchasing the jabra jx10 series 2 which works flawlessly with my moto q go figure 1 
eclectic selection 1 
victor mclaglen was even bad and brian donlevy was almost unrecognizable 0 
the cast is good 1 
i would give this television series a 10 plus if i could 1 
i got the aluminum case for my new palm vx and it worked really wellit has protected my handheld perfectly so far 1 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
this is a witty and delightful adaptation of the dr seuss book brilliantly animated by upas finest and thoroughly deserving of its academy award 1 
i hate those things as much as cheap quality black olives 0 
everyone is very attentive providing excellent customer service 1 
i let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this bad idea we both hated it 0 
it seems completely secure both holding on to my belt and keeping the iphone inside 1 
a film not easily forgotten 1 
left very frustrated 0 
i really hope the team behind this movie makes more movies and that they will continue to do so in their own some kinda weird style 1 
only like 3 or 4 buildings used a couple of locations maybe poor hummh 0 
john wayne did an incredible job for being so young in the movie industry 1 
so i am here to warn youdo not rent this movie it is the dumbest thing you have never seen 0 
20th century foxs road house 1948 is not only quite a silly noir but is an implausible unmitigated bore of a movie 0 
i mean this in a terrible way 0 
the crÃªpe was delicate and thin and moist 1 
with great sound effects and impressive special effects i cant recommend this movie enough 1 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
i paid the bill but did not tip because i felt the server did a terrible job 0 
the only downside is the service 0 
the acting helps the writing along very well maybe the idiotsavant sister could have been played better and it is a real joy to watch 1 
great steak great sides great wine amazing desserts 1 
very prompt service 1 
i especially liked the noncliche choices with the parents in other movies i could predict the dialog verbatim but the writing in this movie made better selections 1 
after watching this film i wanted to learn more about the works of this artist 1 
they refuse to refund or replace 0 
the worst piece of crap ever along with the verizon customer service 0 
the food wasnt good 0 
yes its that bad 0 
i could care less the interior is just beautiful 1 
tonight i had the elk filet specialand it sucked 0 
i want my money back 0 
if you are reading this please dont go there 0 
you need at least 3 mins to get to your phone book from the time you first turn on the phonebattery life is short 0 
the staff are also very friendly and efficient 1 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
dont buy this product it fails 0 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
an hour and a half i wish i could bring back 0 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
judith light is one of my favorite actresses and i think she does a superb job in this film 1 
disapointing results 0 
the ending is so so perfect youll shed a tear 1 
at first i thought i was grtting a good deal at 744 until i plugged it into my phone v3c razr 0 
this movie contained an allstar cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i havent seen before 1 
for the price this was a great deal 1 
the greek dressing was very creamy and flavorful 1 
im a bit disappointed 0 
the cocktails are all handmade and delicious 1 
ive also had problems with the phone reading the memory card in which i always turn it on and then off again 0 
if you are reading this please dont go there 0 
thanks good a movie like this was done and released 1 
anyway the plot flowed smoothly and the malebonding scenes were a hoot 1 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
and generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode 0 
a disappointment 0 
comfortable in my hand 1 
i have eaten here multiple times and each time the food was delicious 1 
it has a very good plot it holds your complete attention the acting is superb tom wilkinson was fantastic and emily watson was also very good 1 
for the price this was a great deal 1 
will not be back 0 
after the first charge kept going dead after 12 minutes 0 
bland and flavorless is a good way of describing the barely tepid meat 0 
i found this move beautiful enjoyable and uplifting 1 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
it is an insane game 1 
the wind and the lion is well written and superbly acted 1 
still i do like this movie for its empowerment of women theres not enough movies out there like this one 1 
the characters were all funny and had the peculiarity of not having a true lead character 1 
good product incredible value 1 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
i would give this television series a 10 plus if i could 1 
no one at the table thought the food was above average or worth the wait that we had for it 0 
its a great item 1 
50 down the drain 0 
there is a lot of beautiful places 1 
very good though 1 
but even the talented carrell cant save this 0 
i find wasting food to be despicable but this just wasnt food 0 
this is the place where i first had pho and it was amazing 1 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
one of the most disappointing aspects is the lack of notable gore 0 
ive dropped my phone more times than i can say even on concrete and my phone is still great knock on wood 1 
the food was terrible 0 
unfortunately it did not work 0 
at around 4 pm i bought it at around 8pm i started to watch at around 815pm i fast forwarded the remaining film to see if there was anything left watchable for a human being with a brain but there wasnt 0 
there was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters 0 
product is useless since it does not have enough charging current to charge the 2 cellphones i was planning to use it with 0 
i like the fact that it rests lightly against your ear rather than inside 1 
amazon sucks 0 
the restaurant is very clean and has a family restaurant feel to it 1 
and those baby owls were adorable 1 
i rather enjoyed it 1 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
nine out of ten for a truly lovely film 1 
he cant act one of the least scary villains i have ever seen he cant write did he write this damn movie in his sleep 0 
due to this happening on every call i was forced to stop using this headset 0 
i never walked out of a movie faster 0 
the live music on fridays totally blows 0 
insults profound deuchebaggery and had to go outside for a smoke break while serving just to solidify it 0 
but what really made it unwatchable was the direction 0 
i was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar not only because the quality is great but the service is fast and the food impeccable 1 
i enjoyed reading this book to my children when they were little 1 
not even good for camp value 0 
seriously killer hot chai latte 1 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
the steak and the shrimp are in my opinion the best entrees at gc 1 
we sat another ten minutes and finally gave up and left 0 
but this movie really got to me 1 
this film offers many delights and surprises 1 
excellent bluetooth headset 1 
this is my new fav vegas buffet spot 1 
not even good for camp value 0 
its so stupid to have to keep buying new chargers car chargers cradles headphones and car kits every time a new phone comes out 0 
yeah the movie pretty much sucked 0 
its too bad the food is so damn generic 0 
maybe if they werent cold they would have been somewhat edible 0 
not nearly as good looking as the amazon picture makes it look 0 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
great place to relax and have an awesome burger and beer 1 
i had strawberry tea which was good 1 
the food was outstanding and the prices were very reasonable 1 
they have a plethora of salads and sandwiches and everything ive tried gets my seal of approval 1 
hell no will i go back 0 
every time he opened his mouth you expect to hear you see kids pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show 0 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
this place lacked style 0 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
item does not match picture 0 
its a feelgood film and thats how i felt when i came out of the cinema 1 
and the sound quality is great 1 
overall i am psyched to have a phone which has all my appointments and contacts in and gets great reception 1 
the chicken dishes are ok the beef is like shoe leather 0 
its still wild stuff though and is highly recommended to fans of giallo cinema 1 
food is way overpriced and portions are fucking small 0 
ive missed numerous calls because of this reason 0 
fantastic earphones 1 
and considering the two of us left there very full and happy for about 20 you just cant go wrong 1 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
it didnt work people can not hear me when i talk 0 
service was exceptional and food was a good as all the reviews 1 
awful 0 
great pocket pc phone combination 1 
great earpiece 1 
youll love how thin it is 1 
this movie is also revealing 1 
i love it 1 
we waited an hour for what was a breakfast i could have done 100 times better at home 0 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
for a product that costs as much as this one does i expect it to work far better and with greater ease than this thing does 0 
bad reception 0 
overall i like this place a lot 1 
i felt insulted and disrespected how could you talk and judge another human being like that 0 
so just beware 0 
ordered an appetizer and took 40 minutes and then the pizza another 10 minutes 0 
the text messaging feature is really tricky to use 0 
spend your money elsewhere 0 
left very frustrated 0 
dont waste your time watching this rubbish nonresearched film 0 
this does not fit the palm tungsten e2 and it broke the first time i tried to plug it in 0 
i will be back many times soon 1 
probably never coming back and wouldnt recommend it 0 
the films dialogue is natural real to life 1 
these products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet 0 
then theres the plot holes 0 
to be honest with you this is unbelievable nonsense and very foolish 0 
the story unfolds in 18th century jutland and the use of period music played on period instruments is just one more fine touch 1 
it definitely was not as good as my s11 1 
not recommended 0 
it quit working after id used it for about 18 months so i just purchased another one because this is the best headset ive ever owned 1 
just whatever you do avoid groove as its the antithesis of all that is good about human traffic 0 
really ugly 0 
the characters are interesting and you really care for them 1 
excellent sound quality 1 
the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach 0 
i highly recommend this movie for anyone interested in art poetry theater politics or japanese history 1 
it even has its sweet moments 1 
the worst piece of crap ever along with the verizon customer service 0 
works great 1 
the service was a bit lacking 0 
the best place to go for a tasty bowl of pho 1 
on three different occasions i asked for well done or medium well and all three times i got the bloodiest piece of meat on my plate 0 
avoid at all costs 0 
weird vibe from owners 0 
i highly recommend this movie for anyone interested in art poetry theater politics or japanese history 1 
ambience is perfect 1 
probably never coming back and wouldnt recommend it 0 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
i thoroughly enjoyed it when christopher eccleston took control of the tardis and the continuation of the series 1 
if you do go see this movie bring a pillow or a girlfriendboyfriend to keep you occupied through out 0 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
a piece of cinematic garbage captured on celluloid 0 
sound quality on both end is excellent i use headset to call my wife and ask my wife to use headset to call me 2 1 
if that bug never showed up i would have given a 4 for sure but on the other side of the wall where this bug was climbing was the kitchen 0 
almost all of the songs in cover girl are oldfashioned and not very tuneful 0 
as for the killer dont expect anything original or even remotely frightening 0 
50 down the drain 0 
looks great and is strong 1 
i dont know exactly what it is about this movie but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our familys memories 1 
very tough and very short on flavor 0 
otherwise easy to install and use clear sound 1 
this is a bad film with bad writing and good actorsan ugly cartoon crafted by paul haggis for people who cant handle anything but the bold strokes in storytellinga picture painted with crayons 0 
i used bitpim a free program you can find on the internetto transfer data to the phonethe price of the cable was excellent 1 
even allowing for poor production values for the time 1971 and the format some kind of miniseries this is baaaaaad 0 
very windresistant 1 
not worth it 0 
definitely not worth the 3 i paid 0 
the waitress and manager are so friendly 1 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
i was hoping for more 0 
absolutely great 1 
waited and waited and waited 0 
this movie totally grates on my nerves 0 
really bad 0 
i dont recommend unless your car breaks down in front of it and you are starving 0 
bacon is hella salty 1 
the aerial scenes were welldone 1 
an absolute must visit 1 
price is good too 1 
then i exchanged for the same phone even that had the same problem 0 
gets a signal when other verizon phones wont 1 
also if your phone is dropped this case is not going to save it specially when dropped face down 0 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
i paid too much 0 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
this one is simply a disappointment 0 
this item is fantastic and works perfectly 1 
this place is way too overpriced for mediocre food 0 
every thing on phone work perfectly she like it 1 
nice quality build unlike some cheap s out there 1 
the loudspeaker option is great the bumpers with the lights is very appealing 0 
for readers who have already seen one of miyazakis films he is still in top form and made another worthwhile experience 1 
tied to charger for conversations lasting more than 45 minutesmajor problems 0 
point your finger at any item on the menu order it and you wont be disappointed 1 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
good prices 1 
hated it 0 
after arguing with verizon regarding the dropped calls we returned the phones after two days 0 
if you look for authentic thai food go else where 0 
great phone 1 
the writer gorman bechard undoubtedly did his homework because all references are industry and characterage appropriate 1 
i advise everyone do not be fooled 0 
i know that sounds funny but to me it seemed like sketchy technology that wouldnt work wellwell this one works great 1 
i am pairing this with my iphone and i could not be happier with it so far 1 
add betty white and jean smart and you have a great cast everyone played their parts really well 1 
the service was a bit lacking 0 
you wont regret it 1 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
what makes this story different are the terrific production values faultless photography composition and editing the terrific casting the underappreciated brian keith playing a bully teddy and vivid history 1 
the chicken wings contained the driest chicken meat i have ever eaten 0 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
it did not work in my cell phone plug i am very up set with the charger 0 
otherwise easy to install and use clear sound 1 
ive missed numerous calls because of this reason 0 
it has been a winner for us 1 
good case excellent value 1 
a great film by a great director 1 
you can watch them preparing the delicious food 1 
it wasnt busy at all and now we know why 0 
service stinks here 0 
the seller is very understanding and patient i would definitely buy from them again 1 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
im so happy to be here 1 
the live music on fridays totally blows 0 
the food is not tasty at all not to say its real traditional hunan style 0 
food was so gooodd 1 
pretty good beer selection too 1 
this place was such a nice surprise 1 
the wind and the lion is well written and superbly acted 1 
the stories were powerful explorations of the nature of man and of art 1 
before i go in to why i gave a 1 star rating please know that this was my third time eating at bachi burger before writing a review 0 
my gyro was basically lettuce only 0 
but even the talented carrell cant save this 0 
wow what a bad film 0 
nice docking station for home or work 1 
to my disbelief each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods i have ever tasted 0 
my ribeye steak was cooked perfectly and had great mesquite flavor 1 
we are sending it back 0 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
this is a great place to eat 1 
the design is very good4 1 
very bad performance plays angela bennett a computer expert who is at home all the time 0 
fantastic food 1 
seriously killer hot chai latte 1 
but in any case the best part is you can download these pictures to your laptop using ir or even send pictures from your laptop to the phone 1 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
the screen does get smudged easily because it touches your ear and face 0 
and i just love the colors 1 
doesnt hold charge 0 
i was mortified 0 
im super pissd 0 
a great film by a great director 1 
weird vibe from owners 0 
dont waste your time watching this rubbish nonresearched film 0 
the only thing that i think could improve is the sound leaks out from the headset 0 
i love this place 1 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
its one of the movies i need to see whenever it comes on tvnever mind the fact that i already have it memorized 1 
the igo chargers and tips are really great 1 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
youll love how thin it is 1 
the dining space is tiny but elegantly decorated and comfortable 1 
the acting is terrible and the writing is worse 0 
camera color balance is awful 0 
the attractive set used throughout most of the film is an eyepleasing gem 1 
but it picked up speed and got right to the point 1 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
my fella got the huevos rancheros and they didnt look too appealing 0 
the best scene in the movie was when gerardo is trying to find a song that keeps running through his head 1 
i used bitpim a free program you can find on the internetto transfer data to the phonethe price of the cable was excellent 1 
this was one of the worst films i have ever seen 0 
the acting is fantastic the stories are seamlessly woven together and the dogs are splendid a must rent view or see 1 
filmiing was less expansive 0 
i would recommend purchasing the jabra jx10 series 2 which works flawlessly with my moto q go figure 1 
what a mistake that was 0 
oh the charger seems to work fine 1 
spend your money elsewhere 0 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
garbo who showed right off the bat that her talents could carry over from the silent era i wanted to see some of her silent work but netflix doesnt seem to be stocking them 1 
the story which was told so eloquently by francis ford coppola 25 years earlier really unfolds gradually and leaves room for the characters to develop 1 
i cant believe theres even a sequel to this 0 
i found this move beautiful enjoyable and uplifting 1 
babie bop is very cute 1 
this one is simply a disappointment 0 
the owners really really need to quit being soooooo cheap let them wrap my freaking sandwich in two papers not one 0 
this place is way too overpriced for mediocre food 0 
low quality 0 
total brunch fail 0 
cant upload ringtones from a third party 0 
not as good as i had hoped 0 
1010 1 
they have a plethora of salads and sandwiches and everything ive tried gets my seal of approval 1 
reversible plug works great 1 
this movie creates its own universe and is fascinating in every way 1 
you cant go wrong with any of the food here 1 
it has everything i need and i couldnt ask for more 1 
the awful dialogue and hopeless overacting by everyone who gets shot top off a real waste of space and time 0 
great food and awesome service 1 
omelets are to die for 1 
bt50 battery junk 0 
some great music and terrific scenery 1 
at first i thought i was grtting a good deal at 744 until i plugged it into my phone v3c razr 0 
he owns the film just as spacek owned coal miners daughter and quaid owned great balls of fire 1 
jabra ear gels r the best 1 
my breakfast was perpared great with a beautiful presentation of 3 giant slices of toast lightly dusted with powdered sugar 1 
good audio quality 1 
omg i felt like i had never eaten thai food until this dish 1 
there is simply no excuse for something this poorly done 0 
not my thing 0 
the selection of food was not the best 0 
the headsets are easy to use and everyone loves them 1 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
macbeth jason connery moved me to tears with his final monolog out brief candle outhe gave the sphere of moral decay and dark forces a human face which makes it the more interesting 1 
not good for the money 0 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
the best electronics of the available fm transmitters 1 
i was mortified 0 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
well just if you keep thinking how bad it is 0 
last night was my second time dining here and i was so happy i decided to go back 1 
the phone takes forever to charge like 2 to 5 hours literally 0 
hence the whole story lacks a certain energy 0 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
the restaurant atmosphere was exquisite 1 
waitress was a little slow in service 0 
this place is disgusting 0 
the food was great as always compliments to the chef 1 
poor reliability 0 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
bluetooth does not work phone locks up screens just flash up and now it just makes calls randomly while in my pocket locked 0 
duris has a wholesome appearance and gives a fine performance 1 
speaking of the music it is unbearably predictably and kitchy 0 
it is an insane game 1 
worked great 1 
bela lugosi was totally extraneous intoning odd lines 0 
so they performed 1 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
great food and great service in a clean and friendly setting 1 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
it wasnt busy either also the building was freezing cold 0 
it has everything i need and i couldnt ask for more 1 
awsome device works great 1 
fantastic food 1 
its the one movie that never ceases to interest me simply because it keeps me alert as i try to attempt to decipher its meanings 1 
he is almost unbearable to watch on screen he has little to no charisma and terrible comedic timing 0 
the only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive 1 
there was no chemistry between ben affleck and sandra bullock in this film and i couldnt understand why he would consider even leaving his wifetobe for this chick that he supposedly was knocked out by 0 
avoid this establishment 0 
favorite place in town for shawarrrrrrma 1 
yet i enjoy watching it 1 
the owner used to work at nobu so this place is really similar for half the price 1 
these are the nicest restaurant owners ive ever come across 1 
im a bit disappointed 0 
this is probably the most irritating show i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
the restaurant atmosphere was exquisite 1 
i had verizon 2 years ago and really liked their service 1 
the sweet potato tots were good but the onion rings were perfection or as close as i have had 1 
delicious and i will absolutely be back 1 
basically the service was very bad 0 
dont waste your money and time 0 
very very disappointed ordered the 35 big bay plater 0 
you get extra minutes so that you can carry out the call and not get cut off 1 
the wind and the lion is well written and superbly acted 1 
ample portions and good prices 1 
it is a true classic 1 
will never ever go back 0 
id like to return it 0 
very clear quality sound and you dont have to mess with the sound on your ipod since you have the sound buttons on the headset 1 
great phone 1 
it was also the right balance of war and love 1 
that was done in the second movie 0 
works great 1 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
the file browser offers all the options that one needshandsfree is great 1 
the movie has almost no action scenes in it and very little comedy 0 
the flat reenactments dont hold your attention because they are emotionally adrift and stagy 0 
this is some seriously good pizza and im an expertconnisseur on the topic 1 
not good when wearing a hat or sunglasses 0 
service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is vegas and located inside the crystals shopping mall by aria 1 
the food is good 1 
i know that sounds funny but to me it seemed like sketchy technology that wouldnt work wellwell this one works great 1 
ive tried several different earpieces for my cell phone and this jabra one is the first one ive found that fits my ear comfortably 1 
this place is disgusting 0 
the jamaican mojitos are delicious 1 
the soundtrack sucked 0 
the crÃªpe was delicate and thin and moist 1 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
this place deserves one star and 90 has to do with the food 0 
it has all the features i want 1 
sounds good reasonably priced and effective its that simple 1 
spend your money and time some place else 0 
keep up the good work amazon 1 
not enough volume 0 
the ngage is still lacking in earbuds 0 
the accompanied software is almost brilliant 1 
the fried rice was dry as well 0 
this movie now joins revenge of the boogeyman and zombiez as part of the hellish trinity of horror films 0 
what did bother me was the slow service 0 
my salad had a bland vinegrette on the baby greens and hearts of palm 0 
great atmosphere friendly and fast service 1 
at least think to refill my water before i struggle to wave you over for 10 minutes 0 
this battery is an excellent bargain 1 
the service here leaves a lot to be desired 0 
i left with a stomach ache and felt sick the rest of the day 0 
what a piece of junk i lose more calls on this phone 0 
you get extra minutes so that you can carry out the call and not get cut off 1 
some applause should be given to the prelude however 1 
if you look for authentic thai food go else where 0 
seriously its not worth wasting your or your kids time on 0 
its very slow 0 
looks great and is strong 1 
i have had problems wit hit dropping signal and more 0 
the acting is like watching wooden puppets moving around and reading from a book thats how bad it is 0 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
it just blew 0 
and the chef was generous with his time even came around twice so we can take pictures with him 1 
what happened next was prettyoff putting 0 
using all earpieces left or right this thing will not stay on my ear 0 
the restaurant atmosphere was exquisite 1 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
it has kept up very well 1 
comfortable in my hand 1 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
clever and a real crowdpleaserthis film still ranks among mickeys best films even after 80 wonderful years 1 
the cg opening sequence in space looked like it could have been created on microsoft slideshow for gods sake 0 
do not buy for d807wrongly advertised for d807 0 
in the span of an hour i had two people exclaim whoa is that the new phone on tv 1 
the majority of the logitech earbud headsets failed 0 
this is definitely a cult classic well worth viewing and sharing with others 1 
dessert panna cotta was amazing 1 
definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly will return next time im in vegas 1 
i bought this to use with my kindle fire and absolutely loved it 1 
what a disappointment 0 
hard to judge whether these sides were good because we were grossed out by the melted styrofoam and didnt want to eat it for fear of getting sick 0 
if there is a wind it is completely useless 0 
you need at least 3 mins to get to your phone book from the time you first turn on the phonebattery life is short 0 
battery chargelife is quite long 1 
great place fo take out or eat in 1 
i like design and look of jabra behing the ear headsets and 5020 is pretty comfortible to wear 24 hours a day without pain in the ear 1 
if you want a real scare rent this one 1 
after 20 minutes wait i got a table 0 
we got sitting fairly fast but ended up waiting 40 minutes just to place our order another 30 minutes before the food arrived 0 
even in my bmw 3 series which is fairly quiet i have trouble hearing what the other person is saying 0 
i only hear garbage for audio 0 
the sound quality is excellent as well 1 
i wont be back 0 
its very slow 0 
but she is still a bad actress repeating her robotic face moves in each of her pictures 0 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
in other words the content level of this film is enough to easily fill a dozen other films 1 
not enough volume 0 
constantine gives everything the right intensity and seems to have a good understanding of the underlying psychological motivations 1 
the battery is completely useless to me 0 
his costars dont fare much better with people like morgan freeman jonah hill and ed helms just wasted 0 
its a shame to see good actors like thomerson and james make a living in a mess like this 0 
a good quality bargain i bought this after i bought a cheapy from big lots that sounded awful and people on the other end couldnt hear me 1 
the budget was evidently very limited 0 
i kept looking at the time and it had soon become 35 minutes yet still no food 0 
the acting was bad 0 
i loved their mussels cooked in this wine reduction the duck was tender and their potato dishes were delicious 1 
insults profound deuchebaggery and had to go outside for a smoke break while serving just to solidify it 0 
this frog phone charm is adorable and very eye catching 1 
my 810 score is mostly for the plot 1 
i immediately said i wanted to talk to the manager but i did not want to talk to the guy who was doing shots of fireball behind the bar 0 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
it rocked my world and is certainly a must see for anyone with no social or physical outlets 1 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
krussel always good 1 
sam shepards portrayal of a gung ho marine was sobering 1 
overall i would recommend this phone over the new walkman 1 
food was below average 0 
i hope this place sticks around 1 
i know this is not like the other restaurants at all something is very off here 0 
also great directing and photography 1 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
cool phone 1 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
i love this cable it allows me to connect any miniusb device to my pc 1 
reception is terrible and full of static 0 
so there is no way for me to plug it in here in the us unless i go by a converter 0 
youll love how thin it is 1 
well im satisfied 1 
i found the product to be easy to set up and use 1 
i have been in more than a few bars in vegas and do not ever recall being charged for tap water 0 
omelets are to die for 1 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
the pizza tasted old super chewy in not a good way 0 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
battery is terrible 0 
the only downside is the service 0 
poor quality and service 0 
will never ever go back 0 
i love lane but ive never seen her in a movie this lousy 0 
great atmosphere friendly and fast service 1 
i found the product to be easy to set up and use 1 
ryans bar is definitely one edinburgh establishment i wont be revisiting 0 
horrible horrible protector 0 
appetite instantly gone 0 
our server was very nice and even though he looked a little overwhelmed with all of our needs he stayed professional and friendly until the end 1 
good case excellent value 1 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
very disappointing 0 
kieslowski never ceases to amaze me 1 
gotta love those closeups of slimy drooling teeth 1 
im surprised this is a good quality car charger and theres not much reviews about it 1 
the salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop which was perfectly cooked 1 
its pure brilliance 1 
this one works and was priced right 1 
predictable but not a bad watch 1 
will definitely be back 1 
the pancake was also really good and pretty large at that 1 
our server was very nice and even though he looked a little overwhelmed with all of our needs he stayed professional and friendly until the end 1 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
about 30 minutes of footage is wasted to show mediocre elderly actors awkwardly babbling overwrought pseudosatanic gibberish corny enough to make a teen goth blush almost always in olde english and sometimes in latin that may or may not be made up words 0 
its the one movie that never ceases to interest me simply because it keeps me alert as i try to attempt to decipher its meanings 1 
very very disappointed ordered the 35 big bay plater 0 
there is no plot here to keep you going in the first place 0 
bad characters bad story and bad acting 0 
exceptionally bad 0 
we recently witnessed her poor quality of management towards other guests as well 0 
it was a huge awkward 15lb piece of cow that was 34ths gristle and fat 0 
my 810 score is mostly for the plot 1 
weve have gotten a much better service from the pizza place next door than the services we received from this restaurant 0 
the cg opening sequence in space looked like it could have been created on microsoft slideshow for gods sake 0 
ive dropped my phone more times than i can say even on concrete and my phone is still great knock on wood 1 
he was extremely rude and really there are so many other restaurants i would love to dine at during a weekend in vegas 0 
great product and price 1 
took an hour to get our food only 4 tables in restaurant my food was luke warm our sever was running around like he was totally overwhelmed 0 
call me a nut but i think this is one of the best movies ever 1 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
i promise they wont disappoint 1 
the acting was decidely wooden though no worse than a period universal b movie 0 
his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic 1 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
nice docking station for home or work 1 
even in my bmw 3 series which is fairly quiet i have trouble hearing what the other person is saying 0 
we loved the place 1 
i had the chicken pho and it tasted very bland 0 
soyo technology sucks 0 
love this headset 1 
id say that would be the hardest decision honestly all of ms dishes taste how they are supposed to taste amazing 1 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
extremely tasty 1 
i love lane but ive never seen her in a movie this lousy 0 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
i work in the hospitality industry in paradise valley and have refrained from recommending cibo any longer 0 
it really created a unique feeling though 1 
you share general loewenhielms exquisite joy in his partaking of the cailles en sarcophage even though you are just watching a movie but you do wish for just a small sample to savor 1 
i guess that nobody at the network that aired this dribble watched it before putting it on 0 
the acting from all involved and that includes those like shatner and nimoy is bad and washed out and making them seem as old as they look in real life the special effects are tacky like when spock has to rescue kirk on a jet pack when he falls down from a mountain 0 
the scallop dish is quite appalling for value as well 0 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
secondly hitchcock pretty much perfected the thriller and chase movie 1 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
id say that would be the hardest decision honestly all of ms dishes taste how they are supposed to taste amazing 1 
i was able to do voice dialing in the car with no problem 1 
nothing short of magnificent photographycinematography in this film 1 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
the potatoes were like rubber and you could tell they had been made up ahead of time being kept under a warmer 0 
the reception is excellent 1 
top line dont waste your time and money on this one its as bad as it comes 0 
after the disappointing dinner we went elsewhere for dessert 0 
but i thought his acting was skilled 1 
and i just love the colors 1 
i enjoyed it 1 
rude inconsiderate management 0 
the worst one of the series 0 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
i only hear garbage for audio 0 
the classic maine lobster roll was fantastic 1 
the budget was evidently very limited 0 
the problem was the script 0 
i had to go to a store and bought a new nokia phone which is working great 1 
i great reception all the time 1 
trumbull on i love lucy 1 
obviously they have a terrible customer service so you get what you pay for 0 
alexander nevsky is a great film 1 
we made the drive all the way from north scottsdale and i was not one bit disappointed 1 
not loud enough and doesnt turn on like it should 0 
at no point in the proceedings does it look remotely like america 0 
i would have casted her in that role after ready the script 1 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
jamie foxx absolutely is ray charles 1 
the battery is completely useless to me 0 
you cant beat the price on these 1 
with the originality and freshness of the first movie now spent this remake had little else to offer 0 
its a sad movie but very good 1 
it worked very well 1 
it was horrible 0 
crash is a depressing little nothing that provokes emotion but teaches you nothing if you already know racism and prejudice are bad things 0 
though the wind and the lion is told largely through the eyes of the son every member of the family can identify with one of the characters whether it be sean connerys noble brigand candace bergens feisty heroine john hustons wily john hay or steve kanalys spiffy radiant ruthless cando lieutenant roosevelts big stick 1 
due to this happening on every call i was forced to stop using this headset 0 
for 40 bucks a head i really expect better food 0 
then as if i hadnt wasted enough of my life there they poured salt in the wound by drawing out the time it took to bring the check 0 
car charger as well as ac charger are included to make sure you never run out of juicehighy recommended 1 
at any rate this film stinks its not funny and fulci should have stayed with giallo and supernatural zombie movies 0 
total brunch fail 0 
he is almost unbearable to watch on screen he has little to no charisma and terrible comedic timing 0 
my only complaint is the standard sound volume is a little low even when turned up to 5of 5 0 
its a little geeky but i think thats its sex on toast and it rocks and oozes sex right down to its battery embedded sleek stylish leather case 1 
but storm trooper is not even bad enough to make it to the list of wonderfully terrible movies 0 
this phone tries very hard to do everything but fails at its very ability to be a phone 0 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
good prices 1 
classywarm atmosphere fun and fresh appetizers succulent steaks baseball steak 1 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
so anyone near you will hear part of your conversation 0 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
i would definitely recommend the jabra bt250v for those who are looking for comfort clarity and a great price 1 
better than new 1 
the acting is fantastic the stories are seamlessly woven together and the dogs are splendid a must rent view or see 1 
everything is appalling 0 
and considering the two of us left there very full and happy for about 20 you just cant go wrong 1 
eclectic selection 1 
the lines the cuts the audio everything is wrong 0 
hard to judge whether these sides were good because we were grossed out by the melted styrofoam and didnt want to eat it for fear of getting sick 0 
very disappointing 0 
the only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive 1 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
i did not bother contacting the company for few dollar product but i learned the lesson that i should not have bought this form online anyway 0 
no plot whatsoever 0 
i hate those things as much as cheap quality black olives 0 
here in the wind and the lion we see a wonderful rendering of americas own imperial age 1 
after arguing with verizon regarding the dropped calls we returned the phones after two days 0 
it was so cool 1 
be sure to order dessert even if you need to pack it togo the tiramisu and cannoli are both to die for 1 
they have been around for years and carries the highest quality of antiglare screen protector that i have found to date 1 
it was just not a fun experience 1 
a happy wonderful feel good ending 1 
ive tried several different earpieces for my cell phone and this jabra one is the first one ive found that fits my ear comfortably 1 
secondly hitchcock pretty much perfected the thriller and chase movie 1 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
the lead man is charismafree 0 
thank you for wasting my money 0 
the only possible way this movie could be redeemed would be as mst3k fodder 0 
this item worked great but it broke after 6 months of use 0 
also makes it easier to hold on to 1 
and if that isnt enough of a mess of a movie for you the picture is also marred with a constant use of studio sets and indoor exteriors 0 
however paul schrader has indeed made a film about mishima that is both superb complex 1 
i had verizon 2 years ago and really liked their service 1 
this second appearance of mickey mouse following the silent plane crazy earlier that year is probably his most famous filmmostly because it was so groundbreaking 1 
this movie is terrible 0 
portable and it works 1 
same evening him and i are both drastically sick 0 
worst ever 0 
so i am here to warn youdo not rent this movie it is the dumbest thing you have never seen 0 
very true to shakespear and a must for all shakespear fans 1 
i wear it everyday and it holds up very well 1 
the movie lacks visual interest drama expression of feeling and celebration of the very patriotism that underlines the narrative 0 
interesting decor 1 
very disappointing 0 
id like to return it 0 
this is simply the best bluetooth headset for sound quality 1 
if there is a wind it is completely useless 0 
everything was gross 0 
both do good jobs and are quite amusing 1 
i received my orders well within the shipping timeframe everything was in good working order and overall i am very excited to have this source 1 
dont buy this product it fails 0 
very good though 1 
they could be used as exemplars for any set designer 1 
all the other cases ive tried normally fall apart after a few months but this one seems to be in for the long haul 1 
i love the scream movies and all horror movies and this one ranks way up there 1 
great product and price 1 
its just painful 0 
would not go back 0 
it was absolutely amazing 1 
too bad cause i know its family owned i really wanted to like this place 0 
if you see it you should probably just leave it on the shelf 0 
the battery is working well as a replacement for the original that came with the phone over 2 years ago 1 
car charger as well as ac charger are included to make sure you never run out of juicehighy recommended 1 
a great way to finish a great 1 
this is a disgrace 0 
dont miss it 1 
if you want a real scare rent this one 1 
the worst phone from samsungcrap this crappy samsung e715 is the worst i have ever seeen 0 
lousy product 0 
the dining space is tiny but elegantly decorated and comfortable 1 
you cant beat the price on these 1 
i love it 1 
an instant classic with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits 1 
there is so much good food in vegas that i feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to rice and company 0 
product is exactly as described 1 
also the area where my unit broke im not too fond of the magnetic strap 0 
the selection of food was not the best 0 
disappointed with battery 0 
back to good bbq lighter fare reasonable pricing and tell the public they are back to the old ways 1 
honeslty it didnt taste that fresh 0 
also its a real treat to see anthony quinn playing crazy horse 1 
the cast of veteran actors are more than just a nostalgia trip 1 
so there is no way for me to plug it in here in the us unless i go by a converter 0 
be sure to order dessert even if you need to pack it togo the tiramisu and cannoli are both to die for 1 
i work in the hospitality industry in paradise valley and have refrained from recommending cibo any longer 0 
this is essentially a communications tool that does not communicate 0 
the only consistent thread holding the series together were the amazing performances of leni parker and anita laselva as the two taelons in quiet idealogical conflict 0 
when it opens the battery connection is broken and the device is turned off 0 
delicious nyc bagels good selections of cream cheese real lox with capers even 1 
characters are onedimensional even the good guys and especially the bad guys 0 
this is one of peter watkins most accessible films 1 
service stinks here 0 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
the only thing i did like was the prime rib and dessert section 1 
the movie was so boring that i sometimes found myself occupied peaking in the paper instead of watching never happened during a columbo movie before 0 
obviously they have a terrible customer service so you get what you pay for 0 
the burger is good beef cooked just right 1 
again lame 0 
lovely little thriller from hitchcock with lots of nice shenanigans surrounding a murdered spy a kidnapped child a nasty church a foreign plot and some random taxidermists 1 
this is infuriating 0 
its not what it says it is 0 
bela lugosi was totally extraneous intoning odd lines 0 
really good product 1 
the burger is good beef cooked just right 1 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
this place deserves one star and 90 has to do with the food 0 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
i must say i have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again 1 
food was so gooodd 1 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
the buffet at bellagio was far from what i anticipated 0 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
totally different with loads of understatement and black comedy this is a film few get to see but those who do will remember it 1 
a fly was in my apple juice a fly 0 
awsome device works great 1 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
a truly truly bad film 0 
tried to go here for lunch and it was a madhouse 0 
i can take a little bad service but the food sucks 0 
last night was my second time dining here and i was so happy i decided to go back 1 
last night was my second time dining here and i was so happy i decided to go back 1 
ambience is perfect 1 
the film has an ultracheap look to it 0 
he was terrible 0 
has been working great 1 
waste your money on this game 1 
total waste of time 0 
battery is holding up well 1 
my brother in law who works at the mall ate here same day and guess what he was sick all night too 0 
john garfield ann revere lilli plmer william conrad canada leeand filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screenjames wong howe 1 
i have two more years left in this contract and i hate this phone 0 
this movie suffered because of the writing it needed more suspense 0 
by this time our side of the restaurant was almost empty so there was no excuse 0 
it is not good 0 
they could serve it with just the vinaigrette and it may make for a better overall dish but it was still very good 1 
there is no plot here to keep you going in the first place 0 
judith light is one of my favorite actresses and i think she does a superb job in this film 1 
this game rocks 1 
the acting is like watching wooden puppets moving around and reading from a book thats how bad it is 0 
good quality 1 
for those that havent seen it dont waste your time 0 
just what i wanted 1 
excellent phone 1 
great phone 1 
this is high adventure at its best 1 
service is quick and even to go orders are just like we like it 1 
nice case feels good in your hands 1 
also its slim enough to fit into my alarm clock docking station without removing the case 1 
terrible management 0 
i believe that this place is a great stop for those with a huge belly and hankering for sushi 1 
my sister has one also and she loves it 1 
instead we got a bore fest about a whiny spoiled brat babysitting 0 
food was really good and i got full petty fast 1 
a great film by a great director 1 
just what i wanted 1 
i highly recommend this device to everyone 1 
im a big fan of this series mostly due to anne rices style sensitivities and treatments 1 
i really enjoyed eating here 1 
at a time when it seems that film animation has been dominated by disneypixars cgi masterpieces it is both refreshing and comforting to know that miyazaki is still relying on traditional handdrawn animation to tell his charming and enchanting stories 1 
sooooo good 1 
the decor is nice and the piano music soundtrack is pleasant 1 
utterly without merit on any level this is akin to torture 0 
the volume switch rocketed out of the unit to a destination unknown 0 
i would recommend this 1 
the good cinematography also makes her and monica bellucci look very beautiful 1 
great value 1 
my brother in law who works at the mall ate here same day and guess what he was sick all night too 0 
what a mistake that was 0 
everything on the menu is terrific and we were also thrilled that they made amazing accommodations for our vegetarian daughter 1 
works great when my cat attacked the phone he scratched the protective strip instead of destroying the screen 1 
the attractive set used throughout most of the film is an eyepleasing gem 1 
the movie in movie situations in the beginning and through the game that is played with her by the acting coach are fascinating 1 
appears to actually outperform the original battery from china that came with my v325i 1 
the show would begin with smart ass ed comments to each other that would be totally off the wall and uncalled for 0 
the manager was the worst 0 
very convenient since we were staying at the mgm 1 
i get absolutely horrible reception in my apartment where with other phones i have not had this problem 0 
great food and great service in a clean and friendly setting 1 
my boyfriend and i sat at the bar and had a completely delightful experience 1 
when my mom and i got home she immediately got sick and she only had a few bites of salad 0 
it was so funny 1 
the chicken dishes are ok the beef is like shoe leather 0 
not recommended 0 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
this is the place where i first had pho and it was amazing 1 
design flaw 0 
i will not return 0 
i wear it everyday and it holds up very well 1 
not even a hello we will be right with you 0 
for that its worth checking out 1 
it failed to convey the broad sweep of landscapes that were a great part of the original 0 
when my mom and i got home she immediately got sick and she only had a few bites of salad 0 
the battery works great 1 
his performance is simply genius 1 
my husband and i ate lunch here and were very disappointed with the food and service 0 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
plus its only 8 bucks 1 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
what a big waste of time 0 
reaching for the bottom row is uncomfortable and the send and end keys are not where i expect them to be3 0 
no ear loop needed its tiny and the sound is great 1 
the potato chip order was sad i could probably count how many chips were in that box and it was probably around 12 0 
i love the ownerchef his one authentic japanese cool dude 1 
summary the witticisms werent witty 0 
give this one a look 1 
unless youre just out to visually collect all extant films of austens work you can skip this one 0 
will not be back 0 
each track commands sentiment actually contributing to the scenes and characters 1 
there are the usual hitchcock logic flaws 0 
this movie suffered because of the writing it needed more suspense 0 
i understand that its supposed to be a cheap popcorn comedy but that doesnt mean that it has to completely insult our intelligence and have writing so incredibly hackneyed that it borders on offensive 0 
the story itself is just predictable and lazy 0 
i like the fact that it rests lightly against your ear rather than inside 1 
punishment park is a brilliant piece of cinema 1 
but now that it is out of warranty the same problems reoccurebottom line put your money somewhere else cingular will not support it 0 
fantastic earphones 1 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
watching washing machine twirling around wouldnt hurt your eyes as much as this show 0 
it was awesome 1 
the mic there is a joke and the volume is quite low 0 
this company charge me a restocking fee and still not given me my refund back 0 
you have to hold the phone at a particular angle for the other party to hear you clearly 0 
it was clear that she had the range and ability to pull off this part 1 
overall i would recommend this phone over the new walkman 1 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
i wish i could enter negative values admins 0 
overall i like this place a lot 1 
i cant believe theres even a sequel to this 0 
i was bored throughout the whole damn thing 0 
not a good item it worked for a while then started having problems in my auto reverse tape player 0 
it felt like a very gripping intelligent stage play but without the overly theatrical feeling one actually gets from watching people on a stage which plays on everyones terror of a white lie escalating to monstrous consequences 1 
lovely little thriller from hitchcock with lots of nice shenanigans surrounding a murdered spy a kidnapped child a nasty church a foreign plot and some random taxidermists 1 
first off the reception sucks i have never had more than 2 bars ever 0 
i really loved the story line and the poler bear was kinda cutebut if anyone has a question about fort steele just ask away 1 
battery has no life 0 
favorite place in town for shawarrrrrrma 1 
the film succeeds despite or perhaps because of an obviously meagre budget 1 
so badwellits just bad 0 
however the ear pads come off easily and after only one week i lost one 0 
great pork sandwich 1 
i never walked out of a movie faster 0 
food was average at best 0 
his costars dont fare much better with people like morgan freeman jonah hill and ed helms just wasted 0 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
i received my orders well within the shipping timeframe everything was in good working order and overall i am very excited to have this source 1 
i love lane but ive never seen her in a movie this lousy 0 
due to this happening on every call i was forced to stop using this headset 0 
i was not happy with this item 0 
i believe that pitch black was done well 1 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
yet plantronincs continues to use the same flawed charger design 0 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
id say that would be the hardest decision honestly all of ms dishes taste how they are supposed to taste amazing 1 
waste your money on this game 1 
its practically perfect in all of them Â– a true masterpiece in a sea of faux masterpieces 1 
owners are really great people 1 
this place deserves one star and 90 has to do with the food 0 
ordered an appetizer and took 40 minutes and then the pizza another 10 minutes 0 
both actors truly understand and become their particular character delivering a convincing sincere performance 1 
i was not happy with this item 0 
the update procedure is difficult and cumbersome 0 
otherwise easy to install and use clear sound 1 
this is a great little item 1 
1010 1 
great atmosphere friendly and fast service 1 
dont waste your time here 0 
the building itself seems pretty neat the bathroom is pretty trippy but i wouldnt eat here again 0 
i dont each much pasta but i love the homemade hand made pastas and thin pizzas here 1 
speaking of the music it is unbearably predictably and kitchy 0 
i love the pho and the spring rolls oh so yummy you have to try 1 
after all the rave reviews i couldnt wait to eat herewhat a disappointment 0 
how stupid is that 0 
its an empty hollow shell of a movie 0 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
finally after three or four times the spring of the latch broke and i could not use it any longer on the visor 0 
great steak great sides great wine amazing desserts 1 
waitress was good though 1 
sam shepards portrayal of a gung ho marine was sobering 1 
loved the casting of jimmy buffet as the science teacher 1 
i dont think there are any redeeming qualities in this remake 0 
i tried talking real loud but shouting on the telephone gets old and i was still told it wasnt great 0 
there is a lot of beautiful places 1 
great hands free device 1 
lightweight and works well 1 
there is nothing privileged about workingeating there 0 
the goat taco didnt skimp on the meat and wow what flavor 1 
i am going to have to be the first to negatively review this product 0 
we recently witnessed her poor quality of management towards other guests as well 0 
to be honest with you this is unbelievable nonsense and very foolish 0 
the lines the cuts the audio everything is wrong 0 
again lame 0 
this place is amazing 1 
its quite simply the highest most superlative form of cinema imaginable 1 
it never condescends all the characters have good genuine hearts and believable problems 1 
very good quality though 1 
the plot simply rumbles on like a machine desperately depending on the addition of new scenes 0 
took an hour to get our food only 4 tables in restaurant my food was luke warm our sever was running around like he was totally overwhelmed 0 
people who like european films and art movies will like this movie 1 
regardless the film fails on most levels 0 
things that went wrong they burned the saganaki 0 
this movie contained an allstar cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i havent seen before 1 
so i basically threw my money out the window for nothing 0 
this was one of the worst films i have ever seen 0 
highly unprofessional and rude to a loyal patron 0 
my boyfriend and i sat at the bar and had a completely delightful experience 1 
fantastic food 1 
its an empty hollow shell of a movie 0 
it really created a unique feeling though 1 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
in fact this stinker smells like a directtovideo release 0 
the worst phone ive ever had only had it for a few months 0 
do not buy if you want to use the holster 0 
as i said abovepretty useless 0 
almost all of the songs in cover girl are oldfashioned and not very tuneful 0 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
the fries were great too 1 
to sum the film up breeders is a terrible cheaply made horror movie that should be avoided like the ebola virus 0 
couldnt figure it out 0 
it was too predictable even for a chick flick 0 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
we enjoy their pizza and brunch 1 
i have to jiggle the plug to get it to line up right to get decent volume 0 
its so bad its actually worth seeing just for that reason 0 
good case 1 
obviously they have a terrible customer service so you get what you pay for 0 
an italian reviewer called this a small great film and thats right 1 
very good product well made 1 
we sat another ten minutes and finally gave up and left 0 
good protection and does not make phone too bulky 1 
im not impressed with the concept or the food 0 
dont waste your time watching this rubbish nonresearched film 0 
there was no chemistry between ben affleck and sandra bullock in this film and i couldnt understand why he would consider even leaving his wifetobe for this chick that he supposedly was knocked out by 0 
an excellent new restaurant by an experienced frenchman 1 
the worst phone from samsungcrap this crappy samsung e715 is the worst i have ever seeen 0 
i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
the service was a bit lacking 0 
great hands free device 1 
i highly recommend this modest priced cellular phone 1 
give this one a look 1 
basically the service was very bad 0 
tasted like dirt 0 
we received a white colored battery that goes dead after a couple hoursthe original used to last a week but still lasts longer than thereplacement 0 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
service is quick and even to go orders are just like we like it 1 
much more interesting more action more suspense and less of the unneeded controversy 1 
worst thai ever 0 
product is exactly as described 1 
he cant act one of the least scary villains i have ever seen he cant write did he write this damn movie in his sleep 0 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
all this movie does is make you sick watching all these slackers make excuses for their stupid actions for 90 minutes 0 
i would definitely recommend the jabra bt250v for those who are looking for comfort clarity and a great price 1 
excellent product 1 
i ordered this for sony ericsson w810i but i think it only worked once thats when i first used it 0 
before i go in to why i gave a 1 star rating please know that this was my third time eating at bachi burger before writing a review 0 
if you are looking for a good quality motorola headset keep looking this isnt it 0 
the volume switch rocketed out of the unit to a destination unknown 0 
that being said for a phone the camera is very nice many cool effects to play with and video is decent as well 1 
this movie is also revealing 1 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
the selection of food was not the best 0 
the dining space is tiny but elegantly decorated and comfortable 1 
everything from acting to cinematography was solid 1 
so they performed 1 
sweetest phone 1 
horrible 0 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
weird vibe from owners 0 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
similarly the delivery man did not say a word of apology when our food was 45 minutes late 0 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
dont waste your money and time 0 
the selection on the menu was great and so were the prices 1 
the worst one of the series 0 
this second appearance of mickey mouse following the silent plane crazy earlier that year is probably his most famous filmmostly because it was so groundbreaking 1 
if you are looking for a good quality motorola headset keep looking this isnt it 0 
this is actually a very smart movie 1 
too bad you have to pay up to a month for the service 0 
do not buy if you want to use the holster 0 
it is the best charger i have seen on the market yet 1 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
any ring toneoverall good phone to buy 1 
i had strawberry tea which was good 1 
their menu is diverse and reasonably priced 1 
its been my choice headset for yearsgreat sound good volume good noise cancellation 1 
never heard of any of them except cole who was totally unbelievable in the part 0 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
crostini that came with the salad was stale 0 
plus it was wellpaced and suited its relatively short run time 1 
too bad you have to pay up to a month for the service 0 
he deserves 5 stars 1 
i dont have to be an accountant to know im getting screwed 0 
i would not recommend this place 0 
cinematography the film was shot in an interesting way 1 
if there is a wind it is completely useless 0 
i was mortified 0 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
i will be back many times soon 1 
they never brought a salad we asked for 0 
the casting is also horrible cause all you see is a really really bad actors period 0 
id rather eat airline food seriously 0 
their rotating beers on tap is also a highlight of this place 1 
however the keypads are so tinny that i sometimes reach the wrong buttons 0 
and finally after all that we get to an ending that wouldve been great had it been handled by competent people and not jerry falwell 0 
i hate movies like that 0 
the movie seemed a little slow at first 0 
i have been very happy with the 510 and have had no complaints from any one regarding my sound quality on their end 1 
its like a bad two hour tv movie 0 
i can barely ever hear on it and am constantly saying what 0 
i am so pleased to know such a modern day genius is out there letting is passion for art drive him and taking us as an audience with him 1 
now this is a movie i really dislike 0 
this is one of the best italian thrillers of the early 70s 1 
this is definitely a cult classic well worth viewing and sharing with others 1 
pretty good beer selection too 1 
the kids are very cool too 1 
great for the jawbone 1 
comfortable fit you need your headset to be comfortable for at least an hour at a time if not for an entire day 1 
the hockey scenes are terrible defensemen playing like theyre 5 years old goalies diving at shots that are 10 feet wide of the net etc 0 
i could not understand what kind of idiot would produce this mess in the first place not to mention several season 0 
i felt asleep the first time i watched it so i can recommend it for insomniacs 0 
you wont forget this movie 1 
crust is not good 0 
he really didnt seem to want to be hosting his voiceovers were monotonous didnt get involved with the guests 0 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
gets the job done 1 
battery lasts only a few hours 0 
it was awesome 1 
highly recommend for any one who has a blue tooth phone 1 
an excellent new restaurant by an experienced frenchman 1 
all i have to say is the food was amazing 1 
never got it 0 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
if you are razr owneryou must have this 1 
i would definitely recommend the jabra bt250v for those who are looking for comfort clarity and a great price 1 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
poor reliability 0 
what a waste 0 
crash is a depressing little nothing that provokes emotion but teaches you nothing if you already know racism and prejudice are bad things 0 
if you look for authentic thai food go else where 0 
all the actors give a wonderful performance especially jennifer rubin as jamie harris who changes from the nervous starlet in the beginning through the strange events she is part of to the cool star 1 
their research and development division obviously knows what theyre doing 1 
i really enjoyed eating here 1 
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
one of the worst shows of all time 0 
do not make the same mistake as me 0 
there is no plot here to keep you going in the first place 0 
very good though 1 
i really recommend this faceplates since it looks very nice elegant and cool 1 
the ear buds only play music in one ear 0 
good item low price 1 
up there with the best of melville 1 
only like 3 or 4 buildings used a couple of locations maybe poor hummh 0 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
i immediately said i wanted to talk to the manager but i did not want to talk to the guy who was doing shots of fireball behind the bar 0 
service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is vegas and located inside the crystals shopping mall by aria 1 
also were served hot bread and butter and home made potato chips with bacon bits on topvery original and very good 1 
punishment park is a brilliant piece of cinema 1 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
the battery runs down quickly 0 
they have a really nice atmosphere 1 
cinematography noteworthy including fine views of barcelona and its famed gaudi towers 1 
this film offers many delights and surprises 1 
i swung in to give them a try but was deeply disappointed 0 
their menu is diverse and reasonably priced 1 
lousy product 0 
the han nan chicken was also very tasty 1 
not only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic but it also managed to give away the entire movie and im not exaggerating every moment every plot point every joke is told in the trailer 0 
this movie now joins revenge of the boogeyman and zombiez as part of the hellish trinity of horror films 0 
pretty cool i would say 1 
you have to hold the phone at a particular angle for the other party to hear you clearly 0 
the first thing that happened was that the tracking was off 0 
the chips and salsa were really good the salsa was very fresh 1 
keep up the good work amazon 1 
i wont be back 0 
i even dropped this phone into a stream and it was submerged for 15 seconds and it still works great 1 
i have to mention this and it is a huge spoiler i loved the ending how all the characters of the three films were the remaining survivors of the ferry disaster with valentine and the young judge together and the old man watching it on her tv solidifying his happiness over the suffering which he dealt with for those many years 1 
babie bop is very cute 1 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
you never know if you pushed it hard enough or the right number of times for the function you want or not 0 
its extremely slow and takes forever to do anything with it 0 
the visual effects were awful 0 
sorry i will not be getting food from here anytime soon 0 
design flaw 0 
garbo who showed right off the bat that her talents could carry over from the silent era i wanted to see some of her silent work but netflix doesnt seem to be stocking them 1 
dont waste your money 0 
seafood was limited to boiled shrimp and crab legs but the crab legs definitely did not taste fresh 0 
the earpiece on this is too large or too heavyit keeps falling out of my ear 0 
there is no real plot 0 
ill put this gem up against any movie in terms of screenplay cinematography acting postproduction editing directing or any other aspect of filmmaking 1 
same evening him and i are both drastically sick 0 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
this pda rocks 1 
not a pleasant voyage of selfdiscovery 0 
who in their right mind is gonna buy this battery 0 
i do love sushi but i found kabuki to be overpriced overhip and underservices 0 
an instant classic with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits 1 
its a feelgood film and thats how i felt when i came out of the cinema 1 
i checked out this place a couple years ago and was not impressed 0 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
it probably would have been better if the director hadnt spent most of the movie showcasing his own art work which really isnt that noteworthy 0 
im still trying to get over how bad it was 0 
your servers suck wait correction our server heimer sucked 0 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
the songs were the best and the muppets were so hilarious 1 
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0 
this pair of headphones is the worst that i have ever had soundwise 0 
exceptionally bad 0 
putting the race card aside lets look at the major flaw in the film they destroy latifas character 0 
i came back today since they relocated and still not impressed 0 
i will not return 0 
easy to pair with my samsung cell 1 
food arrived quickly 1 
even when the women finally show up there is no sign of improvement the most expected things happen and by the time the film is over you might be far asleep 0 
would come back again if i had a sushi craving while in vegas 1 
this place lacked style 0 
if you havent gone here go now 1 
this is a disgrace 0 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
the worst piece of crap ever along with the verizon customer service 0 
i have never had such bland food which surprised me considering the article we read focused so much on their spices and flavor 0 
some applause should be given to the prelude however 1 
the film has an ultracheap look to it 0 
but the movie makes a lot of serious mistakes 0 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
then i had to continue pairing it periodically since it somehow kept dropping 0 
spoilers whatever else can or cant be said about it surface is superbly crafted 1 
the burger is good beef cooked just right 1 
the sweet potato tots were good but the onion rings were perfection or as close as i have had 1 
total waste of time 0 
it was a drive to get there 0 
i always order from the vegetarian menu during dinner which has a wide array of options to choose from 1 
then theres the plot holes 0 
overall i like there food and the service 1 
first of all it doesnt wear well 0 
essentially you can forget microsofts tech support 0 
the last 15 minutes of movie are also not bad as well 1 
will never ever go back and have told many people what had happened 0 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
i wont say any more i dont like spoilers so i dont want to be one but i believe this film is worth your time 1 
the films sole bright spot was jonah hill who will look almost unrecognizable to fans of the recent superbad due to the amount of weight he lost in the interim 1 
the sweet potato tots were good but the onion rings were perfection or as close as i have had 1 
i believe the screenwriter did a good job of tying up the loose ends 1 
i have to jiggle the plug to get it to line up right to get decent volume 0 
really pleased with this product so far 1 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
dont waste your money 0 
omelets are to die for 1 
never going back 0 
very pleased with this headset 1 
all in all id expected a better consumer experience from motorola 0 
unfortunately this is a bad movie that is just plain bad 0 
i got the car charger and not even after a week the charger was brokeni went to plug it in and it started smoking 0 
he is one of my favourite directors and one of the most talented directors in the history of cinema 1 
sauce was tasteless 0 
i hope this place sticks around 1 
then theres the plot holes 0 
it was an inexpensive piece but i would still have expected better quality 0 
ordered an appetizer and took 40 minutes and then the pizza another 10 minutes 0 
waaaaaayyyyyyyyyy over rated is all i am saying 0 
it is worth the drive 1 
if you look for authentic thai food go else where 0 
the sweet potato fries were very good and seasoned well 1 
the good cinematography also makes her and monica bellucci look very beautiful 1 
bland not a liking this place for a number of reasons and i dont want to waste time on bad reviewing ill leave it at that 0 
this place is overpriced not consistent with their boba and it really is overpriced 0 
the crÃªpe was delicate and thin and moist 1 
thank you for wasting my money 0 
this is one of the best italian thrillers of the early 70s 1 
i bought two of them and neither will charge 0 
the script is was there a script 0 
plus it was wellpaced and suited its relatively short run time 1 
very displeased 0 
love this product 1 
the use of slowmotion needlessly repeats itself throughout the movie but is well backed up by bad acting and bad is a kind word here no continuity scenes that are thrown in for no reason whatsoever vehicles that looked like they were made from a corn flakes box and a directorial style that bordered on stupidity 0 
i think this restaurant suffers from not trying hard enough 0 
the movie is full of wonderful dancing hence the title 1 
what a great double cheeseburger 1 
will not be back 0 
i was sitting in my vehicle with the cradle on my belt and the headset lost signal 0 
i agree with jessica this movie is pretty bad 0 
this is actually a very smart movie 1 
wow what a bad film 0 
not even good for camp value 0 
everything about this product is wrongfirst 0 
this is a great phone 1 
only like 3 or 4 buildings used a couple of locations maybe poor hummh 0 
hackneyed writing certainly but made even worse by the bad directing 0 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
for sushi on the strip this is the place to go 1 
in particular the relationship between the bakery assistant and the waitress just didnt work for me at all 0 
they refuse to refund or replace 0 
i love the look and feel of samsung flipphones 1 
the best example of how dumb the writing is when its established that you can turn the zombiestudents back into humans by removing a necklace containing a piece of the meteorite 0 
it was a huge awkward 15lb piece of cow that was 34ths gristle and fat 0 
very disappointed 0 
it felt too light and tinny 0 
i saw this movie and i thought this is a stupid movie 0 
still its quite interesting and entertaining to follow 1 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
the story is also both funny and poignant at times 1 
a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it 1 
during several different 2 minute calls i experienced 5 drops and it was in an area that had 5 bars 0 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
everyone is very attentive providing excellent customer service 1 
this is was due to the fact that it took 20 minutes to be acknowledged then another 35 minutes to get our foodand they kept forgetting things 0 
i like design and look of jabra behing the ear headsets and 5020 is pretty comfortible to wear 24 hours a day without pain in the ear 1 
considering the relations off screen between taylor and stanwyck it was surprising how little chemistry there was on screen between the two of them 0 
if you do go see this movie bring a pillow or a girlfriendboyfriend to keep you occupied through out 0 
it failed to convey the broad sweep of landscapes that were a great part of the original 0 
i struggle to find anything bad to say about it 1 
good price 1 
bt50 battery junk 0 
the volume switch rocketed out of the unit to a destination unknown 0 
good food good service 1 
i will be back many times soon 1 
the acting by the whole cast could be put on a scale and balanced perfectly between overacting and underacting 0 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
not much seafood and like 5 strings of pasta at the bottom 0 
linksys should have some way to exchange a bad phone for a refurb unit or something 0 
very funny 1 
this one wants to surf on the small wave of space movies in 1998 deep impact and armageddon and this one fails everywhere 0 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
i know that sounds funny but to me it seemed like sketchy technology that wouldnt work wellwell this one works great 1 
this greedy corporation will never see another dime from me 0 
we wont be going back 0 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
the least said about the acting the better 0 
and the rest of it just sits there being awful with soldiers singing songs about the masculinity they pledge themselves to hairsplitting about purity the admiration of swords etc 0 
service is perfect and the family atmosphere is nice to see 1 
its also great to see that renowned silent screenwriter frances marion hasnt missed a step going from silent to sound 1 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
there is nothing authentic about this place 0 
plantronics bluetooth excelent buy 1 
the salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop which was perfectly cooked 1 
this phone tries very hard to do everything but fails at its very ability to be a phone 0 
the stories were powerful explorations of the nature of man and of art 1 
i love all the features and form factor 1 
however after finally watching this film i realized that not only had i had a closed mind to the brilliance it depicts i also found myself watching it over and over again 1 
disappointed 0 
this product had a strong rubberpetroleum smell that was unbearable after a while and caused me to return it 0 
i hate those things as much as cheap quality black olives 0 
it is perfect for a sitdown family meal or get together with a few friends 1 
this was my first time and i cant wait until the next 1 
2 thumbs up 1 
i cant wait to go back 1 
the accompanied software is almost brilliant 1 
the place was fairly clean but the food simply wasnt worth it 0 
during several different 2 minute calls i experienced 5 drops and it was in an area that had 5 bars 0 
what should have been a hilarious yummy christmas eve dinner to remember was the biggest fail of the entire trip for us 0 
works good 1 
my breakfast was perpared great with a beautiful presentation of 3 giant slices of toast lightly dusted with powdered sugar 1 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
then theres the plot holes 0 
so i had to take the battery out of the phone put it all back together and then restart it 0 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
it was so bad i had lost the heart to finish it 0 
i have never had such bland food which surprised me considering the article we read focused so much on their spices and flavor 0 
have been going since 2007 and every meal has been awesome 1 
the songs were the best and the muppets were so hilarious 1 
at around 4 pm i bought it at around 8pm i started to watch at around 815pm i fast forwarded the remaining film to see if there was anything left watchable for a human being with a brain but there wasnt 0 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
the bottowm lineanother worthless cheap gimmick from sprint 0 
this is high adventure at its best 1 
a film not easily forgotten 1 
dont bother coming here 0 
this place is not worth your time let alone vegas 0 
it felt too light and tinny 0 
all the other cases ive tried normally fall apart after a few months but this one seems to be in for the long haul 1 
i really recommend this faceplates since it looks very nice elegant and cool 1 
the film has an ultracheap look to it 0 
great headset very impressed h500 1 
the design might be ergonomic in theory but i could not stand having these in my ear 0 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of quÃ©bec 0 
works great 1 
this product had a strong rubberpetroleum smell that was unbearable after a while and caused me to return it 0 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
great product and price 1 
kind of flops around 0 
a must study for anyone interested in the worst sins of industrial design 0 
steve martin delivers a really funny performance of a middleaged upper class uptight white guy 1 
this is simply the best bluetooth headset for sound quality 1 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
logitech bluetooth headset is a 10 1 
loved the casting of jimmy buffet as the science teacher 1 
generous portions and great taste 1 
it is a really good show to watch 1 
waste of 13 bucks 0 
restaurant is always full but never a wait 1 
no ear loop needed its tiny and the sound is great 1 
i will be back many times soon 1 
i got to enjoy the seafood salad with a fabulous vinegrette 1 
they have been around for years and carries the highest quality of antiglare screen protector that i have found to date 1 
all i can do is whine on the internet so here it goesthe more i use the thing the less i like it 0 
no complaints 1 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
id like to return it 0 
but what really made it unwatchable was the direction 0 
the phone loads super 1 
the owners are super friendly and the staff is courteous 1 
worthwhile 1 
the food came out at a good pace 1 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
good product incredible value 1 
they do not care about the consumer one bit 0 
my only complaint is the standard sound volume is a little low even when turned up to 5of 5 0 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
they have a plethora of salads and sandwiches and everything ive tried gets my seal of approval 1 
the service was a bit lacking 0 
the food is very good for your typical bar food 1 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
i give it 2 thumbs down 0 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
the incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film 1 
it features an outlandish array of memorable psychotic but lovable nuts 1 
but when i check voice mail at night the keypad backlight turns off a few seconds into the first message and then im lost 0 
the eargels channel the sound directly into your ear and seem to increase the sound volume and clarity 1 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
i knew when i saw the film that more great things were to come from this gifted actor 1 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
total letdown i would much rather just go to the camelback flower shop and cartel coffee 0 
this second appearance of mickey mouse following the silent plane crazy earlier that year is probably his most famous filmmostly because it was so groundbreaking 1 
food arrived quickly 1 
you cant beat the price on these 1 
never heard of any of them except cole who was totally unbelievable in the part 0 
i have had this phone for over a year now and i will tell you its not that great 0 
worked perfectly 1 
the movie lacks visual interest drama expression of feeling and celebration of the very patriotism that underlines the narrative 0 
too bad you have to pay up to a month for the service 0 
he was terrible 0 
trying to make a call on these is an exercise in frustration 0 
good value great food great service 1 
20th century foxs road house 1948 is not only quite a silly noir but is an implausible unmitigated bore of a movie 0 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
generous portions and great taste 1 
a film not easily forgotten 1 
ive had no trouble accessing the internet downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions 1 
unreliable im giving up 0 
an italian reviewer called this a small great film and thats right 1 
everything is appalling 0 
the meat was pretty dry i had the sliced brisket and pulled pork 0 
i am a fan of his this movie sucked really bad 0 
iam very pleased with my purchase 1 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
the movie had you on the edge of your seat and made you somewhat afraid to go to your car at the end of the night 1 
he surely doesnt know how to make a coherent action movie from the screenwriter of air force one who was only obliged to write the script just for a big sum of money 0 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
i have 23 bars on my cell phone when i am home but you cant not hear anything 0 
my brother in law who works at the mall ate here same day and guess what he was sick all night too 0 
save your money ive had this item for 11 months now 0 
im super pissd 0 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
weird vibe from owners 0 
i have always used corded headsets and the freedom from the wireless is very helpful 1 
the design is very good4 1
