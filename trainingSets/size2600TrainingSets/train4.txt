i was sitting in my vehicle with the cradle on my belt and the headset lost signal 0 
the acting sucks the music sucks the script sucks the pacing sucks the special fx suck the directing sucks basically this movie sucks 0 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
i have eaten here multiple times and each time the food was delicious 1 
comes with a strong light that you can use to light up your camera shots and even flash sos signals seriously 1 
they are so easy to love but even more easy to identify with 1 
a very good film indeed about great and unconditional love 1 
the phone was unusable and was not new 0 
the chains which im no fan of beat this place easily 0 
couldnt use the unit with sunglasses not good in texas 0 
thats how id describe this painfully dreary timewaster of a film 0 
do not buy for d807wrongly advertised for d807 0 
this little device has transformed my organizational capability and made my life a whole lot easier 1 
i will come back here every time im in vegas 1 
the staff is always super friendly and helpful which is especially cool when you bring two small boys and a baby 1 
ive also had problems with the phone reading the memory card in which i always turn it on and then off again 0 
they were goldencrispy and delicious 1 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
mishima is extremely uninteresting 0 
i really loved the story line and the poler bear was kinda cutebut if anyone has a question about fort steele just ask away 1 
this is an excellent film 1 
will go back next trip out 1 
the films sole bright spot was jonah hill who will look almost unrecognizable to fans of the recent superbad due to the amount of weight he lost in the interim 1 
characters are onedimensional even the good guys and especially the bad guys 0 
poor voice clarity 0 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
very friendly staff 1 
this scene is very strong and unpleasant 0 
highquality chicken on the chicken caesar salad 1 
verizon tech support walked my through a few procedures none of which worked and i ended up having to do a hard reset wiping out all my data 0 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
the restaurant is very clean and has a family restaurant feel to it 1 
this phone tries very hard to do everything but fails at its very ability to be a phone 0 
if you love authentic mexican food and want a whole bunch of interesting yet delicious meats to choose from you need to try this place 1 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
if there was ever a movie that needed wordofmouth to promote this is it 1 
bland and flavorless is a good way of describing the barely tepid meat 0 
the voice recognition thru the handset is excellent 1 
this place is not worth your time let alone vegas 0 
all it took was one drop from about 6 inches above the kitchen counter and it was crackedi am not impressed and i am not laughing 0 
this movie is terrible 0 
we had so much to say about the place before we walked in that he expected it to be amazing but was quickly disappointed 0 
this would not even be good as a made for tv flick 0 
which is precisely why i am giving it such a bad review 0 
good service very clean and inexpensive to boot 1 
for readers who have already seen one of miyazakis films he is still in top form and made another worthwhile experience 1 
the inside is really quite nice and very clean 1 
but this movie really got to me 1 
it was absolutely amazing 1 
then i had to continue pairing it periodically since it somehow kept dropping 0 
but this movie is definitely a below average rent 0 
great phone 1 
i would have given no star if i was able 0 
it does everything the description said it would 1 
best of luck to the rude and noncustomer service focused new management 0 
the ambiance isnt much better 0 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
a piece of junk that broke after being on my phone for 2 days 0 
both films are terrible but to the credit of the 1986 version it was watchable 0 
what a mistake that was 0 
this is a very average phone with bad battery life that operates on a weak network 0 
we wont be going back 0 
i dont think ive ever gone to a movie and disliked it as much 0 
does not work for listening to music with the cingular 8125 0 
service is quick and even to go orders are just like we like it 1 
they made this case too small and is very difficult to install 0 
as a courtroom drama its compelling as an indictment on the american justice system its frightening 1 
best tater tots in the southwest 1 
there is a lot of beautiful places 1 
jawbone era is awesome too 1 
owners are really great people 1 
just does not work 0 
i believe every one should see this movie as i think few people outside of south africa understand its past and what is being attempted in the truth and reconciliation process 1 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
theres also enough hypocrisy in this film to make me vomit 0 
the accompanied software is almost brilliant 1 
the only thing that i think could improve is the sound leaks out from the headset 0 
still waiting im sure this item would work well if i ever recieve it 0 
there is nothing authentic about this place 0 
highquality chicken on the chicken caesar salad 1 
i paid the bill but did not tip because i felt the server did a terrible job 0 
id rather eat airline food seriously 0 
the problem was the script 0 
soggy and not good 0 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
i believe the screenwriter did a good job of tying up the loose ends 1 
attempting artiness with black white and clever camera angles the movie disappointed became even more ridiculous as the acting was poor and the plot and lines almost nonexistent 0 
our server was very nice and even though he looked a little overwhelmed with all of our needs he stayed professional and friendly until the end 1 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
its a great item 1 
any ring toneoverall good phone to buy 1 
dont waste your money 0 
nonlinear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well 1 
love this product 1 
it is indescribably the most annoying and idiotic show i have ever seen 0 
omelets are to die for 1 
they really want to make your experience a good one 1 
the file browser offers all the options that one needshandsfree is great 1 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
i have eaten here multiple times and each time the food was delicious 1 
one of the most disappointing aspects is the lack of notable gore 0 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
camerawork again bad 0 
it didnt make me scared horrified or make me sympathetic towards the characters it was simply annoying 0 
the 12 mega pixel camera being a part of a phone is reasonably good7 1 
one character is totally annoying with a voice that gives me the feeling of fingernails on a chalkboard 0 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
the food was great as always compliments to the chef 1 
rip off over charge shipping 0 
i wasnt expecting oscar material but this 0 
great time family dinner on a sunday night 1 
low quality 0 
i would recommend this 1 
its this pandering to the audience that sabotages most of his films 0 
the dining space is tiny but elegantly decorated and comfortable 1 
constantine gives everything the right intensity and seems to have a good understanding of the underlying psychological motivations 1 
hitchcock is a great director 1 
dont make the same mistake that i did and please dont buy this phone 0 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
the plot well i said id let that one go 0 
this is a great restaurant at the mandalay bay 1 
a cheap and cheerless heist movie with poor characterisation lots of underbite style stoic emoting think chow yun fat in a better tomorrow and some cheesy clichés thrown into an abandoned factory ready for a few poorly executed flying judo rolls a la john woo 0 
its like a really sexy party in your mouth where youre outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party 1 
the film is well paced understated and one of the best courtroom documentaries ive seen 1 
it only recognizes the phone as its storage device 0 
long whiny and pointless 0 
its a great item 1 
they could serve it with just the vinaigrette and it may make for a better overall dish but it was still very good 1 
seems like a good quick place to grab a bite of some familiar pub food but do yourself a favor and look elsewhere 0 
the battery life is highly unacceptable 0 
a piece of junk that broke after being on my phone for 2 days 0 
its very attractive and appears to be of good quality 1 
i dont think ill be running back to carlys anytime soon for food 0 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
i didnt want the clip going over the top of my ear causing discomfort 0 
great time family dinner on a sunday night 1 
it had some average acting from the main person and it was a low budget as you clearly can see 0 
the first thing that happened was that the tracking was off 0 
the worst phone from samsungcrap this crappy samsung e715 is the worst i have ever seeen 0 
the worst was the salmon sashimi 0 
an extensive menu provides lots of options for breakfast 1 
a happy wonderful feel good ending 1 
i only hear garbage for audio 0 
nice solid keyboard 1 
on the good side the staff was genuinely pleasant and enthusiastic a real treat 1 
at least think to refill my water before i struggle to wave you over for 10 minutes 0 
we waited an hour for what was a breakfast i could have done 100 times better at home 0 
my only complaint is the standard sound volume is a little low even when turned up to 5of 5 0 
i wouldnt see this movie again for free 0 
but other than that the movie seemed to drag and the heroes didnt really work for their freedom 0 
uncomfortable in the ear dont use with lg vx9900 env 0 
i also didnt like the on button it felt like it would crack with use 0 
exactly what i wanted 1 
however after seeing the short again after about 25 years i was amazed at how timeless the film actually is 1 
the inside is really quite nice and very clean 1 
punishment park is a brilliant piece of cinema 1 
service was good and the company was better 1 
one character is totally annoying with a voice that gives me the feeling of fingernails on a chalkboard 0 
my salad had a bland vinegrette on the baby greens and hearts of palm 0 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
we got sitting fairly fast but ended up waiting 40 minutes just to place our order another 30 minutes before the food arrived 0 
stopped by during the late may bank holiday off rick steve recommendation and loved it 1 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
and considering the two of us left there very full and happy for about 20 you just cant go wrong 1 
excellent phone 1 
used and dirty 0 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
the service was great even the manager came and helped with our table 1 
his losing his marbles so early in the proceedings is totally implausible and unconvincing 0 
last time buying from you 0 
jawbone era is awesome too 1 
well just if you keep thinking how bad it is 0 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
total waste of time 0 
no complaints 1 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
in summary this was a largely disappointing dining experience 0 
plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job 1 
the movie in movie situations in the beginning and through the game that is played with her by the acting coach are fascinating 1 
love this headset 1 
now this dish was quite flavourful 1 
i believe that pitch black was done well 1 
unfortunately we must have hit the bakery on leftover day because everything we ordered was stale 0 
we had a group of 70 when we claimed we would only have 40 and they handled us beautifully 1 
drinks took close to 30 minutes to come out at one point 0 
none of them are engaging or exciting 0 
but i definitely would not eat here again 0 
an italian reviewer called this a small great film and thats right 1 
at least think to refill my water before i struggle to wave you over for 10 minutes 0 
worked perfectly 1 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
awful service 0 
my husband and i ate lunch here and were very disappointed with the food and service 0 
mark my words this is one of those cult films like evil dead 2 or phantasm that people will still be discovering and falling in love with 20 30 40 years down the line 1 
every thing on phone work perfectly she like it 1 
but even the talented carrell cant save this 0 
everything was perfect the night we were in 1 
damn good steak 1 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
its a great item 1 
the tracfonewebsite is user friendly and makes it easy toactivate etc 1 
go to place for gyros 1 
often the dialogue doesnt really follow from one line to another or fit the surroundings 0 
the characters were all funny and had the peculiarity of not having a true lead character 1 
but this movie really got to me 1 
better than new 1 
the movie had you on the edge of your seat and made you somewhat afraid to go to your car at the end of the night 1 
there is no plot here to keep you going in the first place 0 
ill definitely be in soon again 1 
easy to pair with my samsung cell 1 
went in for happy hour great list of wines 1 
my sanyo has survived dozens of drops on blacktop without ill effect 1 
i recently had problems where i could not stay connected for more than 10 minutes before being disconnected 0 
this item is fantastic and works perfectly 1 
its this pandering to the audience that sabotages most of his films 0 
stopped by during the late may bank holiday off rick steve recommendation and loved it 1 
the pizza tasted old super chewy in not a good way 0 
this place was such a nice surprise 1 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
this is a very average phone with bad battery life that operates on a weak network 0 
the fact is this film is a wonderful heartwarming tale about two people chasing their dreams 1 
have been going since 2007 and every meal has been awesome 1 
fantastic earphones 1 
the battery is completely useless to me 0 
the movie is full of wonderful dancing hence the title 1 
the plastic breaks really easy on this clip 0 
disappointed with battery 0 
the soundtrack wasnt terrible either 1 
they brought a fresh batch of fries and i was thinking yay something warm but no 0 
i even fully charged it before i went to bed and turned off blue tooth and wifi and noticed that it only had 20 left in the morning 0 
the potato chip order was sad i could probably count how many chips were in that box and it was probably around 12 0 
the text messaging feature is really tricky to use 0 
everyone is treated equally special 1 
spoilers whatever else can or cant be said about it surface is superbly crafted 1 
still i do like this movie for its empowerment of women theres not enough movies out there like this one 1 
ive never been more insulted or felt disrespected 0 
if you love death and decay and shakespears lyrics this is the one 1 
kieslowski never ceases to amaze me 1 
ps the only scene in the movie that was cool is when the central character finds her room blown up 1 
i was totally fascinated by the music the dancing everything 1 
too politically correct 0 
its a case of so bad it is laughable 0 
phone now holds charge like it did when it was new 1 
this review is long overdue since i consider a tale of two sisters to be the single greatest film ever made 1 
the menu is always changing food quality is going down service is extremely slow 0 
crisp and clear 1 
food quality has been horrible 0 
we ordered the duck rare and it was pink and tender on the inside with a nice char on the outside 1 
great case and price 1 
the phone crashed completely and now i have to get it replaced 0 
it feels poorly constructed the menus are difficult to navigate and the buttons are so recessed that it is difficult to push them 0 
i highly recommend this movie for anyone interested in art poetry theater politics or japanese history 1 
we wont be going back 0 
i started this review with two stars but im editing it to give it only one 0 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
the cashew cream sauce was bland and the vegetables were undercooked 0 
and generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode 0 
to my disbelief each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods i have ever tasted 0 
brilliance indeed 1 
you share general loewenhielms exquisite joy in his partaking of the cailles en sarcophage even though you are just watching a movie but you do wish for just a small sample to savor 1 
i found this move beautiful enjoyable and uplifting 1 
i know he was a contract player with little control over his scripts but the acting was as bad as the script 0 
at any rate this film stinks its not funny and fulci should have stayed with giallo and supernatural zombie movies 0 
its extremely slow and takes forever to do anything with it 0 
i love my 350 headset my jabra350 bluetooth headset is great the reception is very good and the ear piece is a comfortable fit 1 
total waste of time 0 
every time he opened his mouth you expect to hear you see kids pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show 0 
great brunch spot 1 
great choice 1 
star trek v the final frontier is the worst in the series 0 
i hate to disagree with my fellow yelpers but my husband and i were so disappointed with this place 0 
the igo chargers and tips are really great 1 
with great sound effects and impressive special effects i cant recommend this movie enough 1 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
the mic there is a joke and the volume is quite low 0 
i would have casted her in that role after ready the script 1 
of course the acting is blah 0 
really awful 0 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
must have been an off night at this place 0 
i really enjoyed eating here 1 
the bathroom is just next door and very nice 1 
i am glad i purchased it 1 
this is a simple little phone to use but the breakage is unacceptible 0 
the characters are interesting and you want to find out more about them the longer the movie goes on and i think people will be surprised by who does and doesnt make it 1 
the cast is always entertaining as usual 1 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
i am very impressed with the job that motorola did on the sturdiness of this phone 1 
you learn a lot about the real inside emotions of people in this movie and a lot about the movie business itself 1 
this convention never worked well in the past and certainly doesnt work here 0 
i love my 350 headset my jabra350 bluetooth headset is great the reception is very good and the ear piece is a comfortable fit 1 
but if you liked movies like the matrix and better yet their sequels i think youll appreciate the thought provoking mindblowing experience this film will give you 1 
although i very much liked the look and sound of this place the actual experience was a bit disappointing 0 
ambience is perfect 1 
a piece of junk that broke after being on my phone for 2 days 0 
when achille and philippa beautifully sing a duet from don giovanni that perfectly describes their situation in the movie you appreciate the subtle layers of this excellent film 1 
the opening sequence of this gem is a classic and the cat n mouse games that follow are a delight to watch 1 
both of the egg rolls were fantastic 1 
rating 010 grade z note the show is so bad that even mother of the cast pull her daughter out of the show 0 
ill even say it again  this is torture 0 
i guess it was supposed to be clever twist then shed some light on the situation but it was just stupid 0 
whatever the producer was going for he missed entirely 0 
great place to eat reminds me of the little mom and pop shops in the san francisco bay area 1 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
i love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it 1 
this place is horrible and way overpriced 0 
i recommend this for everyone who loves film movies anythinga work of art 1 
the meat was pretty dry i had the sliced brisket and pulled pork 0 
great brunch spot 1 
i love this cable it allows me to connect any miniusb device to my pc 1 
tried to go here for lunch and it was a madhouse 0 
works great 1 
everything was perfect the night we were in 1 
treo and tmobile refused to replace it again and forced me to buy another phone without any kind of upgrade discount 0 
one character is totally annoying with a voice that gives me the feeling of fingernails on a chalkboard 0 
we are so glad we found this place 1 
his performance as awarded was stunning 1 
sounds good reasonably priced and effective its that simple 1 
warning stay away 0 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
i dont have very many words to say about this place but it does everything pretty well 1 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
ps the only scene in the movie that was cool is when the central character finds her room blown up 1 
warning do not buy 0 
one thing i hate is the mode set button at the side 0 
it is worth the drive 1 
glad i didnt pay to see it 0 
the reception is excellent 1 
to summarize the food was incredible nay transcendant but nothing brings me joy quite like the memory of the pneumatic condiment dispenser 1 
conclusion very filling meals 1 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
the cg opening sequence in space looked like it could have been created on microsoft slideshow for gods sake 0 
it is perfect for a sitdown family meal or get together with a few friends 1 
my girlfriends veal was very bad 0 
what a big waste of time 0 
love it great armband 1 
punishment park is a brilliant piece of cinema 1 
for sushi on the strip this is the place to go 1 
not only did the software do a great job of this i could also make my own ringtones form my existing cds without an internet connection 1 
i would not recommend this place 0 
how can that bethe audio quality is poor 0 
each track commands sentiment actually contributing to the scenes and characters 1 
great pocket pc phone combination 1 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
i had the mac salad and it was pretty bland so i will not be getting that again 0 
at first glance it is a lovely bakery cafe nice ambiance clean friendly staff 1 
the restaurant atmosphere was exquisite 1 
i connected my wifes bluetoothmotorola hs850 to my phone and it worked like a charm whether the phone was in my pocket or the case 1 
the script is a big flawed mess 0 
the performances are real and gripping the crocdodile is extremely well done indeed if the black water website is to be believed thats because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous 1 
dont buy it 0 
does everything it should and more 1 
also difficult to put onid recommend avoiding this product 0 
the flat reenactments dont hold your attention because they are emotionally adrift and stagy 0 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
either way it sucks 0 
i definitly recommend 1 
its just painful 0 
after my phone got to be about a year old its been slowly breaking despite much care on my part 0 
wonderful lil tapas and the ambience made me feel all warm and fuzzy inside 1 
awesome device 1 
good product incredible value 1 
all in all im quite satisfied with this purchase 1 
nobody identifies with these characters because theyre all cardboard cutouts and stereotypes or predictably reversestereotypes 0 
i guess it was supposed to be clever twist then shed some light on the situation but it was just stupid 0 
if you do watch it however there are small consolations the actresses playing annes sisters each do a wonderful job with their roles 1 
the mic there is a joke and the volume is quite low 0 
by this time our side of the restaurant was almost empty so there was no excuse 0 
awesome device 1 
very much disappointed with this company 0 
i love the look and feel of samsung flipphones 1 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
the use of slowmotion needlessly repeats itself throughout the movie but is well backed up by bad acting and bad is a kind word here no continuity scenes that are thrown in for no reason whatsoever vehicles that looked like they were made from a corn flakes box and a directorial style that bordered on stupidity 0 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
this pair of headphones is the worst that i have ever had soundwise 0 
any grandmother can make a roasted chicken better than this one 0 
i love being able to use one headset for both by landline and cell 1 
about ten minutes into this film i started having second thoughts 0 
lucy bell is so much higher than this crap and for her to sink this low is quite depressing 0 
really pleased with this product so far 1 
works great when my cat attacked the phone he scratched the protective strip instead of destroying the screen 1 
you wont regret it 1 
it was a drive to get there 0 
i have to use the smallest earpieces provided but it stays on pretty well 1 
it did not work in my cell phone plug i am very up set with the charger 0 
the foreigner is not worth one second of your time 0 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
good food good service 1 
this results in the phone being either stuck at max volume or mute 0 
the manager was the worst 0 
it was clear that she had the range and ability to pull off this part 1 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
i ended up sliding it on the edge of my pants or back pockets instead 1 
avoid at all costs 0 
performed awful muffled tinny incoming sound and severe echo for those on the other end of the call 0 
however my girl was complain that some time the phone doesnt wake up like normal phone does 0 
i have yet to run this new battery below two bars and thats three days without charging 1 
aside from its terrible lead this film has loads of other debits 0 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
reaching for the bottom row is uncomfortable and the send and end keys are not where i expect them to be3 0 
i found this move beautiful enjoyable and uplifting 1 
i liked this movie way too much 1 
this was my first and only vegas buffet and it did not disappoint 1 
if you see it you should probably just leave it on the shelf 0 
this totally unfunny movie is so over the top and pathetic and unrealistic that throughout the whole 90 minutes of utter torture i probably looked at my watch about 70000 times 0 
its a shame to see good actors like thomerson and james make a living in a mess like this 0 
kids pizza is always a hit too with lots of great side dish options for the kiddos 1 
i like armand assante my cable companys summary sounded interesting so i watched it twice already and probably will again 1 
its a feelgood film and thats how i felt when i came out of the cinema 1 
the plug did not work very well 0 
as many people complained i found this headsets microphone was very weak 0 
an italian reviewer called this a small great film and thats right 1 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
join the club and get awesome offers via email 1 
good works fine 1 
i thoroughly enjoyed it when christopher eccleston took control of the tardis and the continuation of the series 1 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
and sometimes it was so embarrassing that i had to look away 0 
i dont know exactly what it is about this movie but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our familys memories 1 
chinese forgeries abound 0 
he is an amazing film artist one of the most important whoever lived 1 
the staff are also very friendly and efficient 1 
everything is appalling 0 
its a total package 1 
it was also the right balance of war and love 1 
it is a joy to use 1 
lovely little thriller from hitchcock with lots of nice shenanigans surrounding a murdered spy a kidnapped child a nasty church a foreign plot and some random taxidermists 1 
it really created a unique feeling though 1 
but now i was completely grossed out 0 
this is a great deal 1 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
if you are looking for a good quality motorola headset keep looking this isnt it 0 
my gyro was basically lettuce only 0 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
i could not stand to even watch it for very long for fear of losing iq 0 
being a 90s child i truly enjoyed this show and i can proudly say that i enjoyed it big time and even more than the classical wb cartoons 1 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
the camera on the phone may be used as a dustpan when indoors id rather be using a disposable then this 0 
my rating just 3 out of 10 0 
at first i thought i was grtting a good deal at 744 until i plugged it into my phone v3c razr 0 
anyways the food was definitely not filling at all and for the price you pay you should expect more 0 
after a year the battery went completely dead on my headset 0 
not my thing 0 
both rickman and stowe play their roles to the hilt in this tale of a childrens book writer who maybe has written a subversive tract 1 
the phone is sturdy and waterproof 1 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
its this pandering to the audience that sabotages most of his films 0 
this place is not worth your time let alone vegas 0 
jawbone era is awesome too 1 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
used and dirty 0 
light weight i hardly notice it is there 1 
as a sushi lover avoid this place by all means 0 
generous portions and great taste 1 
food quality has been horrible 0 
our server was super nice and checked on us many times 1 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
dont bother coming here 0 
try them in the airport to experience some tasty food and speedy friendly service 1 
the result is a powerhouse achievement made more timely now perhaps because of our cultures disturbing fascination with celebrity and its distorted interpretations of fame 1 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
the bartender was also nice 1 
rating 010 grade z note the show is so bad that even mother of the cast pull her daughter out of the show 0 
its not user friendly 0 
but if you liked movies like the matrix and better yet their sequels i think youll appreciate the thought provoking mindblowing experience this film will give you 1 
reception is terrible and full of static 0 
superb phone on a great network 1 
it has a very good plot it holds your complete attention the acting is superb tom wilkinson was fantastic and emily watson was also very good 1 
i thoroughly enjoyed it when christopher eccleston took control of the tardis and the continuation of the series 1 
it was pretty gross 0 
the best place to go for a tasty bowl of pho 1 
conclusion i loved it 1 
he was terrible 0 
great phone 1 
this case has passed the one year mark and while it shows signs of wear it is 100 functional 1 
this place deserves one star and 90 has to do with the food 0 
it has all the features i want 1 
total letdown i would much rather just go to the camelback flower shop and cartel coffee 0 
i love this place 1 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
utterly without merit on any level this is akin to torture 0 
battery has no life 0 
we loved the place 1 
the only good thing was that it fits comfortably on small ears 1 
easy to pair with my samsung cell 1 
please dont waste your money 0 
but the service was beyond bad 0 
they dropped more than the ball 0 
still its quite interesting and entertaining to follow 1 
piece of trash 0 
the poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying 0 
food was great and so was the serivce 1 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
we had so much to say about the place before we walked in that he expected it to be amazing but was quickly disappointed 0 
it was probably dirt 0 
lasted one day and then blew up 0 
does not fit 0 
i have eaten here multiple times and each time the food was delicious 1 
there is however some pretty good acting at least for this type of film 1 
the characters are interesting even if a bit predictable 1 
very nice and relaxing late night viewing 1 
a very very very slowmoving aimless movie about a distressed drifting young man 0 
i would recommend saving room for this 1 
it was a bit too sweet not really spicy enough and lacked flavor 0 
the story starts too fast with absolutely no suspense or buildup in the slightest 0 
total brunch fail 0 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
the plot has more holes than a pair of fishnet stockings and the direction and editing is astonishingly ham fisted 0 
awesome selection of beer 1 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
design flaw 0 
its very slow 0 
i believe that this place is a great stop for those with a huge belly and hankering for sushi 1 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
the acting by the whole cast could be put on a scale and balanced perfectly between overacting and underacting 0 
horrible horrible protector 0 
i got the aluminum case for my new palm vx and it worked really wellit has protected my handheld perfectly so far 1 
conclusion very filling meals 1 
big disappointment with calendar sync 0 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
we waited an hour for what was a breakfast i could have done 100 times better at home 0 
yeah the movie pretty much sucked 0 
this is high adventure at its best 1 
i dont think ill be running back to carlys anytime soon for food 0 
5 stars for the brick oven bread app 1 
it looses connection to the phone even when it is within a couple feet between the two 0 
he is an amazing film artist one of the most important whoever lived 1 
babie bop is very cute 1 
so bad 0 
dont buy this product it fails 0 
phone now holds charge like it did when it was new 1 
i had a seriously solid breakfast here 1 
price is good too 1 
editing the editing of this film was phenomenal in my opinion 1 
the steak and the shrimp are in my opinion the best entrees at gc 1 
as for the mains also uninspired 0 
i never walked out of a movie faster 0 
the restaurant is very clean and has a family restaurant feel to it 1 
the camera really likes her in this movie 1 
the plot well i said id let that one go 0 
pretty good beer selection too 1 
10 out of 10 stars 1 
the selection was probably the worst ive seen in vegasthere was none 0 
a film not easily forgotten 1 
im happy about this purchase good quality and low price 1 
i guess it was supposed to be clever twist then shed some light on the situation but it was just stupid 0 
howeverthe riingtones are not the best and neither are the games 0 
this isnt a small family restaurant this is a fine dining establishment 1 
made very sturdy 1 
who in their right mind is gonna buy this battery 0 
she ordered a toasted english muffin that came out untoasted 0 
the only thing that i think could improve is the sound leaks out from the headset 0 
he is an amazing film artist one of the most important whoever lived 1 
this is probably the most irritating show i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
it is super charged up for use as a small hybrid palmtopcameracellphone and excels in those roles 1 
i was mortified 0 
the budget was evidently very limited 0 
instead we got a bore fest about a whiny spoiled brat babysitting 0 
the phone crashed completely and now i have to get it replaced 0 
will never ever go back 0 
you learn a lot about the real inside emotions of people in this movie and a lot about the movie business itself 1 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
these are certainly very comfortable and functionality is decent 1 
i contacted the company and they told me that although the unit was still under warranty if i couldnt produce my receipt i was out of luck 0 
i have 23 bars on my cell phone when i am home but you cant not hear anything 0 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
not much dialogue not much music the whole film was shot as elaborately and aesthetically like a sculpture 1 
this product had a strong rubberpetroleum smell that was unbearable after a while and caused me to return it 0 
very good stuff for the price 1 
which are small and not worth the price 0 
just whatever you do avoid groove as its the antithesis of all that is good about human traffic 0 
o my gosh the best phone i have ever had 1 
this product had a strong rubberpetroleum smell that was unbearable after a while and caused me to return it 0 
the goat taco didnt skimp on the meat and wow what flavor 1 
the budget was evidently very limited 0 
there is however some pretty good acting at least for this type of film 1 
started watching this but didnt believe in any of the characters 0 
dont buy it 0 
tried to go here for lunch and it was a madhouse 0 
its pure brilliance 1 
it lasts less than 3o minutes if i actually try to use the phonemy wife has the same phone with the same problem 0 
that was nice 1 
hell no will i go back 0 
if it were possible to give them zero stars theyd have it 0 
bela lugosi was totally extraneous intoning odd lines 0 
the sides are delish mixed mushrooms yukon gold puree white corn beateous 1 
perfect for someone me who only likes beer ice cold or in this case even colder 1 
it finds my cell phone right away when i enter the car 1 
my girlfriends veal was very bad 0 
the sound quality is excellent as well 1 
i was bored throughout the whole damn thing 0 
waitress was a little slow in service 0 
thus far have only visited twice and the food was absolutely delicious each time 1 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
truly awful 0 
the structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema 1 
the directing and the cinematography arent quite as good 0 
magical help 1 
the design might be ergonomic in theory but i could not stand having these in my ear 0 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
it definitely was not as good as my s11 1 
overall i am psyched to have a phone which has all my appointments and contacts in and gets great reception 1 
i definitly recommend 1 
i asked multiple times for the wine list and after some time of being ignored i went to the hostess and got one myself 0 
attempting artiness with black white and clever camera angles the movie disappointed became even more ridiculous as the acting was poor and the plot and lines almost nonexistent 0 
dont buy this product 0 
best tacos in town by far 1 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
ill even say it again  this is torture 0 
i work in the hospitality industry in paradise valley and have refrained from recommending cibo any longer 0 
i received my headset in good time and was happy with it 1 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
damn good steak 1 
i even dropped this phone into a stream and it was submerged for 15 seconds and it still works great 1 
very disappointing 0 
the 12 mega pixel camera being a part of a phone is reasonably good7 1 
perfect for the ps3 1 
loved the casting of jimmy buffet as the science teacher 1 
i love this bluetooth 1 
we waited for thirty minutes to be seated although there were 8 vacant tables and we were the only folks waiting 0 
i thought errol flynn was brilliant as custer and has since become my favourite actor 1 
the meat was pretty dry i had the sliced brisket and pulled pork 0 
the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach 0 
the bathroom is just next door and very nice 1 
it was awesome 1 
needless to say i wont be going back anytime soon 0 
i would recommend this 1 
would not go back 0 
basically the service was very bad 0 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
its not user friendly 0 
very much disappointed with this company 0 
give this one a look 1 
these headphones were a great find and i think they are perhaps the best purchase ive made in the last several years seriously 1 
this is the first phone ive had that has been so cheaply made 0 
it is a very well acted and done tv movie 1 
unreliable im giving up 0 
i was sitting in my vehicle with the cradle on my belt and the headset lost signal 0 
service is also cute 1 
nice sound 1 
you can find better movies at youtube 0 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
level 5 spicy was perfect where spice didnt overwhelm the soup 1 
all i can do is whine on the internet so here it goesthe more i use the thing the less i like it 0 
this is one of peter watkins most accessible films 1 
bought mainly for the charger which broke soon after purchasing 0 
terrible phone holder 0 
now this dish was quite flavourful 1 
in addition to having one of the most lovely songs ever written french cancan also boasts one of the cutest leading ladies ever to grace the screen 1 
great headset very impressed h500 1 
very very fun chef 1 
very comfortable 1 
i have recommended it to friends 1 
while you dont yet hear mickey speak there are tons of sound effects and music throughout the filmsomething we take for granted now but which was a huge crowd pleaser in 1928 1 
this is cool because most cases are just open there allowing the screen to get all scratched up 1 
with great sound effects and impressive special effects i cant recommend this movie enough 1 
nonlinear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well 1 
it was probably dirt 0 
i mean really how do you get so famous for your fish and chips when its so terrible 0 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
horrible dont waste your time and money 0 
the characters are interesting and you want to find out more about them the longer the movie goes on and i think people will be surprised by who does and doesnt make it 1 
these are the nicest restaurant owners ive ever come across 1 
this item worked great but it broke after 6 months of use 0 
i wont spoil it but the ending in pretty amazing 1 
it does everything the description said it would 1 
returned 8 hours later 0 
bad fit way too big 0 
absolutel junk 0 
i started this review with two stars but im editing it to give it only one 0 
the yellowtail carpaccio was melt in your mouth fresh 1 
this is a good battery and it got here really fast 1 
i love this phone it is very handy and has a lot of features 1 
works great 1 
now the pizza itself was good the peanut sauce was very tasty 1 
the best phone in market 1 
however this didnt make up for the fact that overall this was a tremendously boring movie 0 
my gyro was basically lettuce only 0 
so absolutley fantastic 1 
there is nothing authentic about this place 0 
in fact its hard to remember that the part of ray charles is being acted and not played by the man himself 1 
it was so funny 1 
the phone is sturdy and waterproof 1 
perfect for someone me who only likes beer ice cold or in this case even colder 1 
i love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it 1 
all the other cases ive tried normally fall apart after a few months but this one seems to be in for the long haul 1 
lately they have been extremely nice and helpful on the phone 1 
waitress was good though 1 
it was way over fried 0 
the script is was there a script 0 
perhaps my phone is defective but people cannot hear me when i use this 0 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
the black eyed peas and sweet potatoes unreal 1 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
the burger is good beef cooked just right 1 
the soundtrack sucked 0 
i know this is not like the other restaurants at all something is very off here 0 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
im not impressed with the concept or the food 0 
then i exchanged for the same phone even that had the same problem 0 
the holster that arrived did not match the photo in the ad 0 
the kids are very cool too 1 
they made this case too small and is very difficult to install 0 
unreliable im giving up 0 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
its aggravating 0 
we watched our waiter pay a lot more attention to other tables and ignore us 0 
after all the rave reviews i couldnt wait to eat herewhat a disappointment 0 
it is an hour and half waste of time following a bunch of very pretty high schoolers whine and cry about life 0 
today the graphics are crap 0 
this is high adventure at its best 1 
here in the wind and the lion we see a wonderful rendering of americas own imperial age 1 
he is one of my favourite directors and one of the most talented directors in the history of cinema 1 
very very disappointed ordered the 35 big bay plater 0 
the only good thing was that it fits comfortably on small ears 1 
after all the rave reviews i couldnt wait to eat herewhat a disappointment 0 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
waited 2 hours never got either of our pizzas as many other around us who came in later did 0 
the stories were powerful explorations of the nature of man and of art 1 
pretty good beer selection too 1 
we enjoy their pizza and brunch 1 
duris has a wholesome appearance and gives a fine performance 1 
why are these sad little vegetables so overcooked 0 
i waited and waited 0 
the mic is great 1 
its reception is very very poor 0 
love this place hits the spot when i want something healthy but not lacking in quantity or flavor 1 
i never walked out of a movie faster 0 
this is the kind of money that is wasted properly 1 
maybe its just their vegetarian fare but ive been twice and i thought it was average at best 0 
im super pissd 0 
the sweet potato tots were good but the onion rings were perfection or as close as i have had 1 
their regular toasted bread was equally satisfying with the occasional pats of butter mmmm 1 
the story unfolds in 18th century jutland and the use of period music played on period instruments is just one more fine touch 1 
the puppets look really cheesy not in a good way like in the puppet master 80s flicks 0 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
everything from acting to cinematography was solid 1 
how awful she is 0 
the cashier was friendly and even brought the food out to me 1 
the fried rice was dry as well 0 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
also the phone doesnt seem to accept anything except cbr mp3s preferably ripped by windows media player 0 
this company charge me a restocking fee and still not given me my refund back 0 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
its pure brilliance 1 
its really easy 1 
but what really made it unwatchable was the direction 0 
i wasnt the least bit interested 0 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
horrible phone 0 
no actress has been worse used that june allison in this movie 0 
del taco is pretty nasty and should be avoided if possible 0 
dont bother coming here 0 
very true to shakespear and a must for all shakespear fans 1 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
well never go again 0 
its very slow 0 
buttons are too small 0 
nicest chinese restaurant ive been in a while 1 
we got the food and apparently they have never heard of salt and the batter on the fish was chewy 0 
customer service was terrible 0 
food was average at best 0 
if you are looking for a good quality motorola headset keep looking this isnt it 0 
i have to mention this and it is a huge spoiler i loved the ending how all the characters of the three films were the remaining survivors of the ferry disaster with valentine and the young judge together and the old man watching it on her tv solidifying his happiness over the suffering which he dealt with for those many years 1 
its welldesigned and very sharp the blue is a very nice color 1 
these are fabulous 1 
great place to eat reminds me of the little mom and pop shops in the san francisco bay area 1 
from here on the widmark character turns unintentionally comical 0 
trouble is the writing and directing make it impossible to establish those things that make a movie watchable like character story theme and so on 0 
so bad 0 
well never go again 0 
worked perfectly 1 
very funny 1 
food was really boring 0 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
graphics is far from the best part of the game 0 
i enjoyed reading this book to my children when they were little 1 
ps the only scene in the movie that was cool is when the central character finds her room blown up 1 
thank you for wasting my money 0 
it was equally awful 0 
my rating just 3 out of 10 0 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
by the time the film ended i not only disliked it i despised it 0 
the directing seems too pretentious 0 
special thanks to dylan t for the recommendation on what to order all yummy for my tummy 1 
the jalapeno bacon is soooo good 1 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
dont buy this product 0 
i use this product in a motor control center where there is a lot of high voltage humming from the equipment and it works great 1 
ordered burger rare came in well done 0 
that was done in the second movie 0 
this isnt a small family restaurant this is a fine dining establishment 1 
awesome selection of beer 1 
everything on the menu is terrific and we were also thrilled that they made amazing accommodations for our vegetarian daughter 1 
just whatever you do avoid groove as its the antithesis of all that is good about human traffic 0 
overall i was not impressed and would not go back 0 
this is the phone to get for 2005 i just bought my s710a and all i can say is wow 1 
i have had this phone for over a year now and i will tell you its not that great 0 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
best tater tots in the southwest 1 
horrible dont waste your time and money 0 
the incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film 1 
nothing at all to recommend 0 
all in all id expected a better consumer experience from motorola 0 
for that price i can think of a few place i would have much rather gone 0 
but this movie really got to me 1 
piece of junk 0 
all the pretty pictures in the world cannot make up for a piece of work that is flawed at the core 0 
plus its only 8 bucks 1 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
the service was a little slow considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace 0 
all in all a great disappointment 0 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
i vomited in the bathroom mid lunch 0 
the aerial scenes were welldone 1 
problem is that the ear loops are made of weak material and break easily 0 
the sweet potato tots were good but the onion rings were perfection or as close as i have had 1 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
dont buy this product 0 
i cannot believe that the actors agreed to do this film 0 
he also came back to check on us regularly excellent service 1 
i would have casted her in that role after ready the script 1 
the burger is good beef cooked just right 1 
logitech bluetooth headset is a 10 1 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
an extensive menu provides lots of options for breakfast 1 
i was very disappointed in the movie 0 
i had about two bites and refused to eat anymore 0 
its been my choice headset for yearsgreat sound good volume good noise cancellation 1 
highquality chicken on the chicken caesar salad 1 
just what i wanted 1 
i love the scream movies and all horror movies and this one ranks way up there 1 
but the service was beyond bad 0 
the worst phone from samsungcrap this crappy samsung e715 is the worst i have ever seeen 0 
the plastic breaks really easy on this clip 0 
generally it just lacked imagination 0 
battery has no life 0 
very nice and relaxing late night viewing 1 
it has a great camera thats 2mp and the pics are nice and clear with great picture quality 1 
sprint charges for this service 0 
same problem as others have mentioned 0 
great software for motorolas 1 
very good though 1 
nobody identifies with these characters because theyre all cardboard cutouts and stereotypes or predictably reversestereotypes 0 
the cast was great 1 
this movie is greatespecially if you enjoy visual arts 1 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
the cinematographyif it can be called thatsucked 0 
really bad 0 
end of days is one of the worst bigbudget action movies ive ever seen 0 
all of the main players are mesmerising 1 
the characters are interesting and you want to find out more about them the longer the movie goes on and i think people will be surprised by who does and doesnt make it 1 
i love the camera its really pretty good quality 1 
service sucks 0 
frozen pucks of disgust with some of the worst people behind the register 0 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
this movie is possibly one of the most creative works of horror ever 1 
worst thai ever 0 
overall i like this place a lot 1 
one nice thing was that they added gratuity on the bill since our party was larger than 6 or 8 and they didnt expect more tip than that 1 
battery life is real good 1 
verizon tech support walked my through a few procedures none of which worked and i ended up having to do a hard reset wiping out all my data 0 
conclusion i loved it 1 
now this is a movie i really dislike 0 
i didnt want the clip going over the top of my ear causing discomfort 0 
the staff was very attentive 1 
and if that isnt enough of a mess of a movie for you the picture is also marred with a constant use of studio sets and indoor exteriors 0 
saw the movie today and thought it was a good effort good messages for kids 1 
i dont think well be going back anytime soon 0 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
i really loved the story line and the poler bear was kinda cutebut if anyone has a question about fort steele just ask away 1 
everything about this product is wrongfirst 0 
the mic is great 1 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
im a bit disappointed 0 
raw and sublimely moving 1 
it was clear that she had the range and ability to pull off this part 1 
the real disappointment was our waiter 0 
sucked most of the stuff does not work with my phone 0 
food was delicious 1 
awful service 0 
i put the latest os on it v115g and it now likes to slow to a crawl and lock up every once in a while 0 
it is a joy to use 1 
the ngage is still lacking in earbuds 0 
audio quality is poor very poor 0 
i saw this movie and i thought this is a stupid movie 0 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
after 20 minutes wait i got a table 0 
the stories were as unbelievable as the actors 0 
the best electronics of the available fm transmitters 1 
plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job 1 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
tasted like dirt 0 
i have to jiggle the plug to get it to line up right to get decent volume 0 
appears to actually outperform the original battery from china that came with my v325i 1 
very good product well made 1 
so bad 0 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
its just adorable seeing mickey playing turkey in the straw in a highly imaginative if occasionally cruel way 1 
not recommended 0 
due to this happening on every call i was forced to stop using this headset 0 
it is super charged up for use as a small hybrid palmtopcameracellphone and excels in those roles 1 
i had to wait over 30 minutes to get my drink and longer to get 2 arepas 0 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
dont bother coming here 0 
this was my first time and i cant wait until the next 1 
i was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar not only because the quality is great but the service is fast and the food impeccable 1 
if you stay in vegas you must get breakfast here at least once 1 
very very disappointed ordered the 35 big bay plater 0 
highly recommended for all ages although the younger set will probably not appreciate some of the more subtle references they will certainly appreciate one galley scene in particular 1 
bad characters bad story and bad acting 0 
its kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly its embarrassing how childlike the company is 0 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
i know this is not like the other restaurants at all something is very off here 0 
cant get the software to work with my computer 0 
it finds my cell phone right away when i enter the car 1 
i recently tried caballeros and i have been back every week since 1 
the chips that came out were dripping with grease and mostly not edible 0 
a greasy unhealthy meal 0 
disapointing results 0 
this is definitely one of the better documentaries i have seen looking at family relationships and marriage 1 
total letdown i would much rather just go to the camelback flower shop and cartel coffee 0 
even if you love bad movies do not watch this movie 0 
great atmosphere friendly and fast service 1 
this place is like chipotle but better 1 
excellent product for the price 1 
sooooo good 1 
filmiing was less expansive 0 
good food good service 1 
the first thing that happened was that the tracking was off 0 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
the speaker is of low quality so as making the ring tones sound very cheap 0 
i love it 1 
the waitresses are very friendly 1 
initially the local sites in the film which was filmed here in buffalo intrigued me 1 
emily watsons character is very strong and she has only to give a quick glance and you understand everything 1 
probably never coming back and wouldnt recommend it 0 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
the speaker is of low quality so as making the ring tones sound very cheap 0 
i ended up sliding it on the edge of my pants or back pockets instead 1 
i would have given no star if i was able 0 
im really disappointed all i have now is a charger that doesnt work 0 
all things considered a job very well done 1 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
voice recognition is tremendous 1 
i kept looking at the time and it had soon become 35 minutes yet still no food 0 
thus far have only visited twice and the food was absolutely delicious each time 1 
you get extra minutes so that you can carry out the call and not get cut off 1 
the fried rice was dry as well 0 
camera color balance is awful 0 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
everything about this movie is stupid 0 
they were excellent 1 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
about 30 minutes of footage is wasted to show mediocre elderly actors awkwardly babbling overwrought pseudosatanic gibberish corny enough to make a teen goth blush almost always in olde english and sometimes in latin that may or may not be made up words 0 
it had some average acting from the main person and it was a low budget as you clearly can see 0 
it defeats the purpose of a bluetooth headset 0 
ps the only scene in the movie that was cool is when the central character finds her room blown up 1 
a standout scene 1 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
very good though 1 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
the steak and the shrimp are in my opinion the best entrees at gc 1 
who in their right mind is gonna buy this battery 0 
all the bread is made inhouse 1 
plantronics bluetooth excelent buy 1 
it finds my cell phone right away when i enter the car 1 
juano hernandez an exceptional actor who played supporting roles in many films of the era is a proud black man who is accused of murdering a white man in the south 1 
the acting sucked 0 
food was so gooodd 1 
waste of money 0 
the jalapeno bacon is soooo good 1 
my sanyo has survived dozens of drops on blacktop without ill effect 1 
there is no real plot 0 
people couldnt hear me talk and i had to pull out the earphone and talk on the phone 0 
truly awful 0 
great place fo take out or eat in 1 
no real improvement 0 
i especially love the long battery life 1 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
dont waste your on this one 0 
never going back 0 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
the meat was pretty dry i had the sliced brisket and pulled pork 0 
it really is impressive that the place hasnt closed down 0 
their research and development division obviously knows what theyre doing 1 
great product and price 1 
personally i think it shows that people should learn to find a compromise them self without involving other people into issue 1 
the new characters werent all that memorable and i found myself forgetting who was who 0 
both great 1 
graphics is far from the best part of the game 0 
i cant see how this movie can be an inspiration to anyone to come out or overcome fear and rejection 0 
instead we got a bore fest about a whiny spoiled brat babysitting 0 
the songs were the best and the muppets were so hilarious 1 
great price too 1 
for that its worth checking out 1 
it shouldnt take 30 min for pancakes and eggs 0 
good service very clean and inexpensive to boot 1 
some applause should be given to the prelude however 1 
awesome selection of beer 1 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
the food was terrible 0 
the food amazing 1 
the food came out at a good pace 1 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
i find wasting food to be despicable but this just wasnt food 0 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
you cant beat that 1 
i hate movies like that 0 
so badwellits just bad 0 
pretty awesome place 1 
doesnt do the job 0 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
the nachos are a must have 1 
the film is well paced understated and one of the best courtroom documentaries ive seen 1 
it is the best charger i have seen on the market yet 1 
i can think of no other film where something vitally important occurs every other minute 1 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
i was very disappointed in the movie 0 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
linked to my phone without effort 1 
still its quite interesting and entertaining to follow 1 
would not recommend to others 0 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
gets the job done 1 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
im translating movies for a living and this is the first movie in my 5year working experience that i found offensive to my intelligence 0 
bad reception 0 
this is an extraordinary film 1 
there is a lot of beautiful places 1 
when my mom and i got home she immediately got sick and she only had a few bites of salad 0 
in fact i liked it better than interview with a vampire and i liked this lestat stuart townsend better than cruises attempt 1 
best of luck to the rude and noncustomer service focused new management 0 
the dining space is tiny but elegantly decorated and comfortable 1 
you get extra minutes so that you can carry out the call and not get cut off 1 
all of the tapas dishes were delicious 1 
5 stars for the brick oven bread app 1 
its a case of so bad it is laughable 0 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
highly recommended for all ages although the younger set will probably not appreciate some of the more subtle references they will certainly appreciate one galley scene in particular 1 
very clear quality sound and you dont have to mess with the sound on your ipod since you have the sound buttons on the headset 1 
great bluetooth 1 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
the script is horrendously stupid 0 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
the soundtrack wasnt terrible either 1 
i great reception all the time 1 
delicious and i will absolutely be back 1 
hell no will i go back 0 
this was reflected not only in the cast but also in the belowpar script which borrowed much from the earlier classic 0 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
so bad 0 
dont miss it 1 
plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job 1 
i bought two of them and neither will charge 0 
wow loved this place 1 
all the bread is made inhouse 1 
they keep getting better and better this is my third one and ive had numerous palms too 1 
he really didnt seem to want to be hosting his voiceovers were monotonous didnt get involved with the guests 0 
the voice recognition thru the handset is excellent 1 
very windresistant 1 
all the pretty pictures in the world cannot make up for a piece of work that is flawed at the core 0 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
spend your money and time some place else 0 
we sat another ten minutes and finally gave up and left 0 
its a fresh subtle and rather sublime effect 1 
the nokia ca42 usb cable did not work with my phone 0 
the servers are not pleasant to deal with and they dont always honor pizza hut coupons 0 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
all i have to say is the food was amazing 1 
great place to eat reminds me of the little mom and pop shops in the san francisco bay area 1 
does not fit 0 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
steamboat willie is an amazingly important film to our cinema history 1 
a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it 1 
car charger as well as ac charger are included to make sure you never run out of juicehighy recommended 1 
big disappointment with calendar sync 0 
if you havent choked in your own vomit by the end by all the cheap drama and worthless dialogue youve must have bored yourself to death with this waste of time 0 
great phone 1 
it was a bit too sweet not really spicy enough and lacked flavor 0 
he also came back to check on us regularly excellent service 1 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
now imagine that every single one of those decisions was made wrong 0 
this place receives stars for their appetizers 1 
the only downside is the service 0 
problem is that the ear loops are made of weak material and break easily 0 
restored my phone to like new performance 1 
every element of this story was so over the top excessively phony and contrived that it was painful to sit through 0 
in fact i liked it better than interview with a vampire and i liked this lestat stuart townsend better than cruises attempt 1 
unreliable im giving up 0 
if the food isnt bad enough for you then enjoy dealing with the worlds worstannoying drunk people 0 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
the transfers are very good 1 
theres really nothing bad i can say about this headset 0 
light weight i hardly notice it is there 1 
the cinematographyif it can be called thatsucked 0 
as i said abovepretty useless 0 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
i swung in to give them a try but was deeply disappointed 0 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
the script is a big flawed mess 0 
if you have several dozen or several hundred contacts then imagine the fun of sending each of them one by one 0 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
macbeth jason connery moved me to tears with his final monolog out brief candle outhe gave the sphere of moral decay and dark forces a human face which makes it the more interesting 1 
i swung in to give them a try but was deeply disappointed 0 
but the service was beyond bad 0 
unless youre just out to visually collect all extant films of austens work you can skip this one 0 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
the staff are also very friendly and efficient 1 
i wasnt expecting oscar material but this 0 
i hate writing bad reviews about films especially those in which i really like the star but this film is so bad i dont believe for one second that anyone could have been proud of it 0 
so for our enjoyment we get to see them run around play games and be dangerous 1 
my wife had the lobster bisque soup which was lukewarm 0 
none of it works just dont buy it 0 
it was attached to a gas station and that is rarely a good sign 0 
i seriously cannot believe that the owner has so many unexperienced employees that all are running around like chickens with their heads cut off 0 
definitely not worth the 3 i paid 0 
an amazing finale to possibly the best trilogy of all time 1 
horrible horrible protector 0 
this is a great product sure beats using your fingers 1 
fast service 1 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
food was good service was good prices were good 1 
not good for the money 0 
so far so good 1 
both of the egg rolls were fantastic 1 
it is an hour and half waste of time following a bunch of very pretty high schoolers whine and cry about life 0 
would recommend this item 1 
the phone loads super 1 
the only consistent thread holding the series together were the amazing performances of leni parker and anita laselva as the two taelons in quiet idealogical conflict 0 
the pan cakes everyone are raving about taste like a sugary disaster tailored to the palate of a six year old 0 
in the summer you can dine in a charming outdoor patio so very delightful 1 
people couldnt hear me talk and i had to pull out the earphone and talk on the phone 0 
very funny 1 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
buttons are too small 0 
it is zillion times away from reality 0 
the sides are delish mixed mushrooms yukon gold puree white corn beateous 1 
piece of junk 0 
as many people complained i found this headsets microphone was very weak 0 
the shrimp tender and moist 1 
enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film 1 
pretty piece of junk 0 
really good product 1 
the ripped banana was not only ripped but petrified and tasteless 0 
id say that would be the hardest decision honestly all of ms dishes taste how they are supposed to taste amazing 1 
he also came back to check on us regularly excellent service 1 
excellent phone 1 
ive had no trouble accessing the internet downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions 1 
it is super charged up for use as a small hybrid palmtopcameracellphone and excels in those roles 1 
i guess it was supposed to be clever twist then shed some light on the situation but it was just stupid 0 
it was quite comfortable in the ear 1 
i didnt want the clip going over the top of my ear causing discomfort 0 
it feels poorly constructed the menus are difficult to navigate and the buttons are so recessed that it is difficult to push them 0 
service was exceptional and food was a good as all the reviews 1 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
camera color balance is awful 0 
some great music and terrific scenery 1 
will be back again 1 
it doesnt make you look cool 0 
it was just not a fun experience 1 
love the margaritas too 1 
i never walked out of a movie faster 0 
improper description i had to return it 0 
it defeats the purpose of a bluetooth headset 0 
poor quality 0 
the story unfolds in 18th century jutland and the use of period music played on period instruments is just one more fine touch 1 
lange had become a great actress 1 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
and if that isnt enough of a mess of a movie for you the picture is also marred with a constant use of studio sets and indoor exteriors 0 
not sure who was more lost the flat characters or the audience nearly half of whom walked out 0 
the movie was so boring that i sometimes found myself occupied peaking in the paper instead of watching never happened during a columbo movie before 0 
his costars dont fare much better with people like morgan freeman jonah hill and ed helms just wasted 0 
the cast of veteran actors are more than just a nostalgia trip 1 
the staff are also very friendly and efficient 1 
pricing is a bit of a concern at mellow mushroom 0 
this place is handsdown one of the best places to eat in the phoenix metro area 1 
this is truly an art movieit actually has a lot of art in it 1 
this early film from future goremeister lucio fulci is a very good addition to the giallo subgenre 1 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
the design is very good4 1 
the building itself seems pretty neat the bathroom is pretty trippy but i wouldnt eat here again 0 
dont waste your time here 0 
nicest chinese restaurant ive been in a while 1 
coming here is like experiencing an underwhelming relationship where both parties cant wait for the other person to ask to break up 0 
best ive found so far ive tried 2 other bluetooths and this one has the best quality for both me and the listener as well as ease of using 1 
very very sad 0 
this greedy corporation will never see another dime from me 0 
ill definitely be in soon again 1 
unreliable im giving up 0 
kind of flops around 0 
all the bread is made inhouse 1 
excellent service 1 
i also decided not to send it back because our waitress looked like she was on the verge of having a heart attack 0 
the visual effects were awful 0 
using all earpieces left or right this thing will not stay on my ear 0 
join the club and get awesome offers via email 1 
great place fo take out or eat in 1 
delete this film from your mind 0 
the cinematographyif it can be called thatsucked 0 
i got the car charger and not even after a week the charger was brokeni went to plug it in and it started smoking 0 
very nice and relaxing late night viewing 1 
great service and food 1 
then as if i hadnt wasted enough of my life there they poured salt in the wound by drawing out the time it took to bring the check 0 
i bought two of them and neither will charge 0 
im returning them 0 
good servicecheck 1 
i probably wont be coming back here 0 
however after seeing the short again after about 25 years i was amazed at how timeless the film actually is 1 
the dining space is tiny but elegantly decorated and comfortable 1 
great food and service huge portions and they give a military discount 1 
excellent 1 
an awesome new look for fall 2000 1 
same problem as others have mentioned 0 
i also didnt like the on button it felt like it would crack with use 0 
i would have given no star if i was able 0 
however the keypads are so tinny that i sometimes reach the wrong buttons 0 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
the nachos are a must have 1 
i really liked that 1 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
i was mortified 0 
the films sole bright spot was jonah hill who will look almost unrecognizable to fans of the recent superbad due to the amount of weight he lost in the interim 1 
one of the most disappointing aspects is the lack of notable gore 0 
the holster that arrived did not match the photo in the ad 0 
the acting by the whole cast could be put on a scale and balanced perfectly between overacting and underacting 0 
this item is fantastic and works perfectly 1 
what possesed me to get this junk i have no idea 0 
omg the food was delicioso 1 
overall a great experience 1 
i have to mention this and it is a huge spoiler i loved the ending how all the characters of the three films were the remaining survivors of the ferry disaster with valentine and the young judge together and the old man watching it on her tv solidifying his happiness over the suffering which he dealt with for those many years 1 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
the plug did not work very well 0 
you need at least 3 mins to get to your phone book from the time you first turn on the phonebattery life is short 0 
actually the graphics were good at the time 1 
great pizza and salads 1 
the only thing that i think could improve is the sound leaks out from the headset 0 
never got it 0 
left very frustrated 0 
the construction of the headsets is poor 0 
it was so cool 1 
there is a totally unnecessary trainroller coaster scene 0 
makes it easier to keep up with my bluetooth when im not wearing it 0 
heres where the movie really pied me off 0 
i found the product to be easy to set up and use 1 
so there is no way for me to plug it in here in the us unless i go by a converter 0 
a very very very slowmoving aimless movie about a distressed drifting young man 0 
in the summer you can dine in a charming outdoor patio so very delightful 1 
the bartender was also nice 1 
small sleek impressive looking practical setup with ample storage in place 1 
the battery works great 1 
i dont think ill be running back to carlys anytime soon for food 0 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
drinks took close to 30 minutes to come out at one point 0 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
we got sitting fairly fast but ended up waiting 40 minutes just to place our order another 30 minutes before the food arrived 0 
its not user friendly 0 
awful service 0 
our server was very nice and even though he looked a little overwhelmed with all of our needs he stayed professional and friendly until the end 1 
works great when my cat attacked the phone he scratched the protective strip instead of destroying the screen 1 
always a great time at dos gringos 1 
clear skype calls long battery life long range 1 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
i did not expect this to be so good 1 
the worst one of the series 0 
this gets a 1 out of 10 simply because theres nothing lower 0 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
and the rest of it just sits there being awful with soldiers singing songs about the masculinity they pledge themselves to hairsplitting about purity the admiration of swords etc 0 
portable and it works 1 
highly recommend for any one who has a blue tooth phone 1 
i can say that the desserts were yummy 1 
very good quality though 1 
you need two hands to operate the screenthis software interface is decade old and cannot compete with new software designs 0 
the owner used to work at nobu so this place is really similar for half the price 1 
how can you call yourself a steakhouse if you cant properly cook a steak i dont understand 0 
this is a good joint 1 
i hate to disagree with my fellow yelpers but my husband and i were so disappointed with this place 0 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
i probably would not go here again 0 
food was average at best 0 
this short film certainly pulls no punches 0 
at no point in the proceedings does it look remotely like america 0 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
but kevin spacey is an excellent verbal tsunami as buddy ackerman  and totally believable because he is a great actor 1 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
plus its only 8 bucks 1 
trouble is the writing and directing make it impossible to establish those things that make a movie watchable like character story theme and so on 0 
a good time 1 
went in for happy hour great list of wines 1 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
simple lightweight and great fit 1 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
we loved the place 1 
i know this is not like the other restaurants at all something is very off here 0 
as for the mains also uninspired 0 
o my gosh the best phone i have ever had 1 
the warm beer didnt help 0 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
i had high hopes for this place since the burgers are cooked over a charcoal grill but unfortunately the taste fell flat way flat 0 
battery lasts only a few hours 0 
comfortable fit you need your headset to be comfortable for at least an hour at a time if not for an entire day 1 
that just screams legit in my booksomethats also pretty rare here in vegas 1 
i purcashed this for the car charger and it does not work 0 
it doesnt make you look cool 0 
cant upload ringtones from a third party 0 
this is so embarassing and also my ears hurt if i try to push the ear plug into my ear 0 
i vomited in the bathroom mid lunch 0 
oh yeah and the storyline was pathetic too 0 
stopped by during the late may bank holiday off rick steve recommendation and loved it 1 
i sat riveted to the tv screen 1 
dont bother go to the store 0 
omg i felt like i had never eaten thai food until this dish 1 
the acting sucks the music sucks the script sucks the pacing sucks the special fx suck the directing sucks basically this movie sucks 0 
were jerks on the phone 0 
if you are reading this please dont go there 0 
seller shipped quickly and much cheaper than the competitors 1 
great food and great service in a clean and friendly setting 1 
i thought it was bad 0 
cheap but hey it works was pleasantly suprised given the low cost of this item 1 
yet plantronincs continues to use the same flawed charger design 0 
an absolute must visit 1 
this early film from future goremeister lucio fulci is a very good addition to the giallo subgenre 1 
this film tries to be a serious and sophisticated thrillerhorror flick and it fails miserably 0 
last night was my second time dining here and i was so happy i decided to go back 1 
bad reception 0 
it was clear that she had the range and ability to pull off this part 1 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
for that its worth checking out 1 
the food was barely lukewarm so it must have been sitting waiting for the server to bring it out to us 0 
i have had mine for about a year and this christmas i bought some for the rest of the family 1 
this is actually a very smart movie 1 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
i rate this movie 910 1 
a very good film indeed about great and unconditional love 1 
the owners are super friendly and the staff is courteous 1 
the acting helps the writing along very well maybe the idiotsavant sister could have been played better and it is a real joy to watch 1 
battery life is also great 1 
but in any case the best part is you can download these pictures to your laptop using ir or even send pictures from your laptop to the phone 1 
great for ipods too 1 
also if your phone is dropped this case is not going to save it specially when dropped face down 0 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
the directing and the cinematography arent quite as good 0 
it wasnt busy either also the building was freezing cold 0 
my first visit to hiro was a delight 1 
their research and development division obviously knows what theyre doing 1 
id say that would be the hardest decision honestly all of ms dishes taste how they are supposed to taste amazing 1 
there is no plot here to keep you going in the first place 0 
some great music and terrific scenery 1 
i was bored throughout the whole damn thing 0 
im still trying to get over how bad it was 0 
the calls drop the phone comes on and off at will the screen goes black and the worst of all it stops ringing intermittently 0 
my sanyo has survived dozens of drops on blacktop without ill effect 1 
director paul matthews who also wrotedirected the weak 1995 monster movie grim clearly doesnt know how to pace his films 0 
but then they came back cold 0 
110 and only because there is no setting for 010 0 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
otherwise easy to install and use clear sound 1 
the incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film 1 
utterly without merit on any level this is akin to torture 0 
it worked very well 1 
cant say enough good things about this place 1 
not a good item it worked for a while then started having problems in my auto reverse tape player 0 
i recommend igo to anyone with different brand cell phonesmp3 players in the family 1 
bad quality 0 
my first visit to hiro was a delight 1 
great food and service huge portions and they give a military discount 1 
it is a very well acted and done tv movie 1 
similarly the delivery man did not say a word of apology when our food was 45 minutes late 0 
there are so many problems i dont know where to start 0 
the movie was so boring that i sometimes found myself occupied peaking in the paper instead of watching never happened during a columbo movie before 0 
now this is a movie i really dislike 0 
this movie was kind of long in length but i enjoyed every minute of it 1 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
no additional ear gels provided and no instructions whatsoever 0 
dont make the same mistake that i did and please dont buy this phone 0 
heres where the movie really pied me off 0 
i asked multiple times for the wine list and after some time of being ignored i went to the hostess and got one myself 0 
great place fo take out or eat in 1 
i got the car charger and not even after a week the charger was brokeni went to plug it in and it started smoking 0 
the least said about the acting the better 0 
the chips that came out were dripping with grease and mostly not edible 0 
i hate writing bad reviews about films especially those in which i really like the star but this film is so bad i dont believe for one second that anyone could have been proud of it 0 
this is probably one of the least effective and utterly unoriginal films i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
i do love sushi but i found kabuki to be overpriced overhip and underservices 0 
excellent product for the price 1 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
my salad had a bland vinegrette on the baby greens and hearts of palm 0 
this place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver 0 
i am glad i purchased it 1 
omelets are to die for 1 
i love being able to use one headset for both by landline and cell 1 
a great way to finish a great 1 
this battery is an excellent bargain 1 
the potatoes were great and so was the biscuit 1 
this is an excellent tool especially when paired with your phones autoanswer 1 
i have eaten here multiple times and each time the food was delicious 1 
battery is terrible 0 
ryans bar is definitely one edinburgh establishment i wont be revisiting 0 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
my salad had a bland vinegrette on the baby greens and hearts of palm 0 
you wont regret it 1 
this would not even be good as a made for tv flick 0 
this place deserves one star and 90 has to do with the food 0 
really ugly 0 
you can watch them preparing the delicious food 1 
the owners are super friendly and the staff is courteous 1 
buyer beware you could flush money right down the toilet 0 
the atmosphere is modern and hip while maintaining a touch of coziness 1 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
the new characters werent all that memorable and i found myself forgetting who was who 0 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
i hate to disagree with my fellow yelpers but my husband and i were so disappointed with this place 0 
i keep watching it over and over 1 
was not happy 0 
the pleather case doesnt fit 0 
whatever prompted such a documentary is beyond me 0 
2 thumbs up to this seller 1 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
we watched our waiter pay a lot more attention to other tables and ignore us 0 
my friend did not like his bloody mary 0 
the service here is fair at best 0 
long whiny and pointless 0 
it lasts less than 3o minutes if i actually try to use the phonemy wife has the same phone with the same problem 0 
the acting sucked 0 
i dont think there are any redeeming qualities in this remake 0 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
another note about this phones appearance is that it really looks rather bland especially in the all black model 0 
i cant see how this movie can be an inspiration to anyone to come out or overcome fear and rejection 0 
its a feelgood film and thats how i felt when i came out of the cinema 1 
no ear loop needed its tiny and the sound is great 1 
the ending is so so perfect youll shed a tear 1 
low quality 0 
but it does get better reception and clarity than any phone ive had before 1 
my girlfriends veal was very bad 0 
by the time the film ended i not only disliked it i despised it 0 
this pda rocks 1 
item does not match picture 0 
does not work for listening to music with the cingular 8125 0 
we received a white colored battery that goes dead after a couple hoursthe original used to last a week but still lasts longer than thereplacement 0 
its pure brilliance 1 
and the rest of it just sits there being awful with soldiers singing songs about the masculinity they pledge themselves to hairsplitting about purity the admiration of swords etc 0 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
food was really good and i got full petty fast 1 
sam shepards portrayal of a gung ho marine was sobering 1 
of course the acting is blah 0 
it sure does beat the nachos at the movies but i would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant 0 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
if that bug never showed up i would have given a 4 for sure but on the other side of the wall where this bug was climbing was the kitchen 0 
but this movie is definitely a below average rent 0 
its extremely slow and takes forever to do anything with it 0 
its very slow 0 
the movie has almost no action scenes in it and very little comedy 0 
for sushi on the strip this is the place to go 1 
the staff is friendly and the joint is always clean 1 
i always order from the vegetarian menu during dinner which has a wide array of options to choose from 1 
service stinks here 0 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
no shifting no bubbling no peeling not even a scratch nothingi couldnt be more happier with my new one for the droid 1 
still its quite interesting and entertaining to follow 1 
this may be the only bad film he ever made 0 
the sound quality for the device is unacceptableunless you are in a really quiet area you almost hear nothing 0 
it looses connection to the phone even when it is within a couple feet between the two 0 
omelets are to die for 1 
it was probably dirt 0 
ive also had problems with the phone reading the memory card in which i always turn it on and then off again 0 
and service was super friendly 1 
this may be the only bad film he ever made 0 
the calls drop the phone comes on and off at will the screen goes black and the worst of all it stops ringing intermittently 0 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
aailiyah was pretty good as akasha in places compelling her first entrance and mini dance scene 1 
the battery is completely useless to me 0 
this product is clearly not ready for prime time i dont care how cool it looks if you cant tell a call is coming in its worthless 0 
reaching for the bottom row is uncomfortable and the send and end keys are not where i expect them to be3 0 
this is a great product sure beats using your fingers 1 
it was pretty gross 0 
this is was due to the fact that it took 20 minutes to be acknowledged then another 35 minutes to get our foodand they kept forgetting things 0 
the dining space is tiny but elegantly decorated and comfortable 1 
problem is that the ear loops are made of weak material and break easily 0 
none of them are engaging or exciting 0 
i received my headset in good time and was happy with it 1 
the waitresses are very friendly 1 
the text messaging feature is really tricky to use 0 
i even dropped this phone into a stream and it was submerged for 15 seconds and it still works great 1 
excellent product for the price 1 
he is an amazing film artist one of the most important whoever lived 1 
his use of the colours of the french flag in the three films was nothing short of incredible every shot every scene was like a work of art 1 
yes its shiny on front side and i love it 1 
not as good as i had hoped 0 
the awful dialogue and hopeless overacting by everyone who gets shot top off a real waste of space and time 0 
ive owned this phone for 7 months now and can say that its the best mobile phone ive had 1 
as i said abovepretty useless 0 
you share general loewenhielms exquisite joy in his partaking of the cailles en sarcophage even though you are just watching a movie but you do wish for just a small sample to savor 1 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
i do not know if this was emilio estevezs directorial debut but the pacing the interplay and development of the characters as well as some clever camera work surrounding the character estevez plays all suggest a natural eye 1 
how can anyone in their right mind ask for anything more from a movie than this 1 
its just adorable seeing mickey playing turkey in the straw in a highly imaginative if occasionally cruel way 1 
good product good seller 1 
it was so bad i had lost the heart to finish it 0 
of all the dishes the salmon was the best but all were great 1 
great food and service huge portions and they give a military discount 1 
very happy with this product 1 
nice leather 1 
item does not match picture 0 
a very good film indeed about great and unconditional love 1 
the acting from all involved and that includes those like shatner and nimoy is bad and washed out and making them seem as old as they look in real life the special effects are tacky like when spock has to rescue kirk on a jet pack when he falls down from a mountain 0 
the problem was the script 0 
the plot was the same as pretty much every other cheap horror 0 
food was great and so was the serivce 1 
i have seen many movies starring jaclyn smith but my god this was one of her best though it came out 12 years ago 1 
to summarize the food was incredible nay transcendant but nothing brings me joy quite like the memory of the pneumatic condiment dispenser 1 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
there was hardly any meat 0 
the servers went back and forth several times not even so much as an are you being helped 0 
their chow mein is so good 1 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
the best part about nurse betty is its unpredictability 1 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
at around 4 pm i bought it at around 8pm i started to watch at around 815pm i fast forwarded the remaining film to see if there was anything left watchable for a human being with a brain but there wasnt 0 
first off the reception sucks i have never had more than 2 bars ever 0 
sounds good reasonably priced and effective its that simple 1 
could not get strong enough signal 0 
totally different with loads of understatement and black comedy this is a film few get to see but those who do will remember it 1 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
these products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet 0 
its a feelgood film and thats how i felt when i came out of the cinema 1 
i will never go back to this place and will never ever recommended this place to anyone 0 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
this results in the phone being either stuck at max volume or mute 0 
maybe there would be a reasonable explanation for this atrocity 0 
weve tried to like this place but after 10 times i think were done with them 0 
i waited and waited 0 
great product fast shipping 1 
the acting is fantastic the stories are seamlessly woven together and the dogs are splendid a must rent view or see 1 
if it were possible to give them zero stars theyd have it 0 
wow loved this place 1 
it is indescribably the most annoying and idiotic show i have ever seen 0 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
this is a great deal 1 
its this pandering to the audience that sabotages most of his films 0 
i ordered albondigas soup which was just warm and tasted like tomato soup with frozen meatballs 0 
its practically perfect in all of them  a true masterpiece in a sea of faux masterpieces 1 
the movie had you on the edge of your seat and made you somewhat afraid to go to your car at the end of the night 1 
awesome selection of beer 1 
this was like the final blow 0 
that was done in the second movie 0 
the camera although rated at an impressive 13 megapixels renders images that fall well below expectations of such a relatively high resolution 0 
i ordered this for sony ericsson w810i but i think it only worked once thats when i first used it 0 
incredible 1 
frankly after cotton club and unfaithful it was kind of embarrassing to watch lane and gere in this film because it is bad 0 
i believe the screenwriter did a good job of tying up the loose ends 1 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
i ate there twice on my last visit and especially enjoyed the salmon salad 1 
im really disappointed all i have now is a charger that doesnt work 0 
also makes it easier to hold on to 1 
mediocre food 0 
started watching this but didnt believe in any of the characters 0 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
the story which was told so eloquently by francis ford coppola 25 years earlier really unfolds gradually and leaves room for the characters to develop 1 
the dining space is tiny but elegantly decorated and comfortable 1 
all in all its an insult to ones intelligence and a huge waste of money 0 
you need at least 3 mins to get to your phone book from the time you first turn on the phonebattery life is short 0 
crash is a depressing little nothing that provokes emotion but teaches you nothing if you already know racism and prejudice are bad things 0 
i could care less the interior is just beautiful 1 
restored my phone to like new performance 1 
just dont know why they were so slow 0 
first off the reception sucks i have never had more than 2 bars ever 0 
this is truly an art movieit actually has a lot of art in it 1 
the characters are interesting even if a bit predictable 1 
obviously they have a terrible customer service so you get what you pay for 0 
it feels poorly constructed the menus are difficult to navigate and the buttons are so recessed that it is difficult to push them 0 
add betty white and jean smart and you have a great cast everyone played their parts really well 1 
i seriously cannot believe that the owner has so many unexperienced employees that all are running around like chickens with their heads cut off 0 
i guess that nobody at the network that aired this dribble watched it before putting it on 0 
i really liked that 1 
this place receives stars for their appetizers 1 
it only recognizes the phone as its storage device 0 
but the actingeven that of such professionals as drago and debbie rochonwas terrible the directing worse perhaps contributory to the former the dialog chimplike and the camera work barely tolerable 0 
the cashier was friendly and even brought the food out to me 1 
i was disgusted because i was pretty sure that was human hair 0 
hitchcock is a great director 1 
i liked it 1 
not nearly as good looking as the amazon picture makes it look 0 
he is one of my favourite directors and one of the most talented directors in the history of cinema 1 
now imagine that every single one of those decisions was made wrong 0 
this one is simply a disappointment 0 
it isnt even an achievement as a sobaditsgood or sobaditsmemorable movie 0 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
the poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying 0 
i would recommend this 1 
this is a simple little phone to use but the breakage is unacceptible 0 
its also great to see that renowned silent screenwriter frances marion hasnt missed a step going from silent to sound 1 
the burrittos blah 0 
as always the evening was wonderful and the food delicious 1 
we got the food and apparently they have never heard of salt and the batter on the fish was chewy 0 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
best ive found so far ive tried 2 other bluetooths and this one has the best quality for both me and the listener as well as ease of using 1 
when my order arrived one of the gyros was missing 0 
this gets a 1 out of 10 simply because theres nothing lower 0 
maybe its just their vegetarian fare but ive been twice and i thought it was average at best 0 
my boyfriend and i sat at the bar and had a completely delightful experience 1 
i took back my money and got outta there 0 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
unfortunately inexperience of direction meant that scene after scene passed with little in the way of dramatic tension or conflict 0 
verizon tech support walked my through a few procedures none of which worked and i ended up having to do a hard reset wiping out all my data 0 
will not be back 0 
for that its worth checking out 1 
woa talk about awful 0 
it was a waste of my money 0 
it has a great camera thats 2mp and the pics are nice and clear with great picture quality 1 
waaaaaayyyyyyyyyy over rated is all i am saying 0 
i wont be back 0 
this is truly an art movieit actually has a lot of art in it 1 
it was clear that she had the range and ability to pull off this part 1 
i saw this film over christmas and what a great film it was 1 
this product had a strong rubberpetroleum smell that was unbearable after a while and caused me to return it 0 
would not recommend to others 0 
instead we got a bore fest about a whiny spoiled brat babysitting 0 
the camera really likes her in this movie 1 
with the originality and freshness of the first movie now spent this remake had little else to offer 0 
not enough volume 0 
everything stinks 0 
id advise anyone to go and see it 1 
i use this product in a motor control center where there is a lot of high voltage humming from the equipment and it works great 1 
they do not care about the consumer one bit 0 
worst hour and a half of my lifeoh my gosh 0 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
you truly take this journey through the eyes and soul of a child 1 
this is a masterful piece of filmmaking with many themes simmering and occasionally boiling over in this warts and all study of the poets bohemian selfindulgent wartime years that span the aerial bombardments of london and the outward tranquillity of a welsh coastal retreat the borderlines between friendship lust and love dedication to art and experience versus practical concerns jealousy rivalry cowardice and egotism versus heroism and selfsacrifice and more 1 
basically the service was very bad 0 
great place fo take out or eat in 1 
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 
i gave it 5 stars because of the sound quality 1 
everything on the menu is terrific and we were also thrilled that they made amazing accommodations for our vegetarian daughter 1 
nobody identifies with these characters because theyre all cardboard cutouts and stereotypes or predictably reversestereotypes 0 
headset works great was packaged nicely to avoid any damage 1 
highly entertaining at all angles 1 
a very good film indeed about great and unconditional love 1 
there is no plot or storyline 0 
customer service was terrible 0 
very disappointed and wondered how it could be in the oscar shortlist 0 
does not fit 0 
the battery is working well as a replacement for the original that came with the phone over 2 years ago 1 
this movie was kind of long in length but i enjoyed every minute of it 1 
good protection and does not make phone too bulky 1 
i was disgusted because i was pretty sure that was human hair 0 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
its been my choice headset for yearsgreat sound good volume good noise cancellation 1 
for the price this was a great deal 1 
the only thing i did like was the prime rib and dessert section 1 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
on three different occasions i asked for well done or medium well and all three times i got the bloodiest piece of meat on my plate 0 
not much dialogue not much music the whole film was shot as elaborately and aesthetically like a sculpture 1 
sam shepards portrayal of a gung ho marine was sobering 1 
i was shocked because no signs indicate cash only 0 
item arrived quickly and works great with my metro pcs samsung schr450 slider phone and sony premium sound in ear plugs 1 
its one of the movies i need to see whenever it comes on tvnever mind the fact that i already have it memorized 1 
the sergeant pepper beef sandwich with auju sauce is an excellent sandwich as well 1 
do not purchase this phone 0 
i would highly recommend this product 1 
finally after three or four times the spring of the latch broke and i could not use it any longer on the visor 0 
cant get the software to work with my computer 0 
it was pretty gross 0 
no actress has been worse used that june allison in this movie 0 
good quality 1 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
he also came back to check on us regularly excellent service 1 
plus it was wellpaced and suited its relatively short run time 1 
which has more depth and character than the man underneath it 0 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
do not buy do not buyit sucks 0 
would come back again if i had a sushi craving while in vegas 1 
for those that havent seen it dont waste your time 0 
food quality has been horrible 0 
best tacos in town by far 1 
unfortunately cover girl is an example of how hollywood used to exploit women for financial gain 0 
fantastic earphones 1 
save your money ive had this item for 11 months now 0 
all in all i think it was a good investment 1 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
but its just not funny 0 
this film and i use that word loosely is an insult to the moviegoing public 0 
the acting sucked 0 
why was this film made 0 
it also took her forever to bring us the check when we asked for it 0 
really ugly 0 
used and dirty 0 
i really wanted the plantronics 510 to be the right one but it has too many issues for methe good 0 
i checked everywhere and there is no feature for it which is really disappointing 0 
unless youre just out to visually collect all extant films of austens work you can skip this one 0 
a fly was in my apple juice a fly 0 
victor mclaglen was even bad and brian donlevy was almost unrecognizable 0 
there was a warm feeling with the service and i felt like their guest for a special treat 1 
none of the new ones have ever quite worked properly 0 
the best part about nurse betty is its unpredictability 1 
worst hour and a half of my lifeoh my gosh 0 
this is an excellent film 1 
it was a bit too sweet not really spicy enough and lacked flavor 0 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
if it was to turn my good day feeling into a night of disturbing memories than i guess he succeeded 0 
here in the wind and the lion we see a wonderful rendering of americas own imperial age 1 
this item is fantastic and works perfectly 1 
thus far have only visited twice and the food was absolutely delicious each time 1 
it fits so securely that the ear hook does not even need to be used and the sound is better directed through your ear canal 1 
my phone doesnt slide around my car now and the grip prevents my phone from slipping out of my hand 1 
i just saw this film and i recommend it 1 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
the croutons also taste homemade which is an extra plus 1 
i believe every one should see this movie as i think few people outside of south africa understand its past and what is being attempted in the truth and reconciliation process 1 
what a big waste of time 0 
the food sucked which we expected but it sucked more than we could have imagined 0 
the jerky camera movements were also annoying 0 
from what my dinner companions told meeverything was very fresh with nice texture and taste 1 
i had a pretty satifying experience 1 
there is no plot or storyline 0 
i really recommend this faceplates since it looks very nice elegant and cool 1 
started watching this but didnt believe in any of the characters 0 
im translating movies for a living and this is the first movie in my 5year working experience that i found offensive to my intelligence 0 
couldnt use the unit with sunglasses not good in texas 0 
love this product 1 
i love the look and feel of samsung flipphones 1 
the camera on the phone may be used as a dustpan when indoors id rather be using a disposable then this 0 
i was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar not only because the quality is great but the service is fast and the food impeccable 1 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
service was fantastic 1 
this is actually a very smart movie 1 
a very very very slowmoving aimless movie about a distressed drifting young man 0 
unfortunately it will not recharge my iphone 4s despite connecting it from multiple power sources imac external battery wall outlet etc 0 
there was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth but it didnt really work into the rest of the plot 0 
these are certainly very comfortable and functionality is decent 1 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
this place is horrible and way overpriced 0 
disappointed with battery 0 
her lines seem to have been written by a fifteen year old though they are trying oh so so hard to sound like how a fifteen year old would really um you know well talk 0 
nice headphones for the price and they work great 1 
this place is horrible and way overpriced 0 
ray charles is legendary 1 
be sure to order dessert even if you need to pack it togo the tiramisu and cannoli are both to die for 1 
the screen size is big key pad lit well enough and the camera quality is excellent for a camera phone 1 
the cg opening sequence in space looked like it could have been created on microsoft slideshow for gods sake 0 
as an earlier review noted plug in this charger and nothing happens 0 
the jabra eargels fit my ears very well 1 
i recently tried caballeros and i have been back every week since 1 
the plot simply rumbles on like a machine desperately depending on the addition of new scenes 0 
bacon is hella salty 1 
the screen does get smudged easily because it touches your ear and face 0 
krussel always good 1 
we loved the biscuits 1 
i bought this phone as a replacement for my startac and have regretted it since 0 
there is really nothing for me at postinos hope your experience is better 0 
the problem was the script 0 
i used bitpim a free program you can find on the internetto transfer data to the phonethe price of the cable was excellent 1 
their chow mein is so good 1 
i liked it 1 
highly unprofessional and rude to a loyal patron 0 
tied to charger for conversations lasting more than 45 minutesmajor problems 0 
the attractive set used throughout most of the film is an eyepleasing gem 1 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
we wont be returning 0 
the phone crashed completely and now i have to get it replaced 0 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
ill even say it again  this is torture 0 
needless to say i wont be going back anytime soon 0 
the plantains were the worst ive ever tasted 0 
the server was very negligent of our needs and made us feel very unwelcome i would not suggest this place 0 
each track commands sentiment actually contributing to the scenes and characters 1 
good food good service 1 
service is quick and even to go orders are just like we like it 1 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
couldnt use the unit with sunglasses not good in texas 0 
they have been around for years and carries the highest quality of antiglare screen protector that i have found to date 1 
it feels poorly constructed the menus are difficult to navigate and the buttons are so recessed that it is difficult to push them 0 
the salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop which was perfectly cooked 1 
love the margaritas too 1 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
this place deserves one star and 90 has to do with the food 0 
so anyone near you will hear part of your conversation 0 
it was just too horrible 0 
kris kristoffersen is good in this movie and really makes a difference 1 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
this is a great little item 1 
the results well are a shame 0 
everything about it is just bad 0 
the grilled chicken was so tender and yellow from the saffron seasoning 1 
great choice 1 
love it great armband 1 
i was sitting in my vehicle with the cradle on my belt and the headset lost signal 0 
the pizza tasted old super chewy in not a good way 0 
headset works great was packaged nicely to avoid any damage 1 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
they work about 2 weeks then break 0 
it kept getting worse and worse so now im officially done 0 
i cant believe theres even a sequel to this 0 
this is a good joint 1 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
i love my 350 headset my jabra350 bluetooth headset is great the reception is very good and the ear piece is a comfortable fit 1 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
i had to wait over 30 minutes to get my drink and longer to get 2 arepas 0 
it really created a unique feeling though 1 
it lasts less than 3o minutes if i actually try to use the phonemy wife has the same phone with the same problem 0 
one of the worst shows of all time 0 
exactly what i wanted 1 
beautiful styling though 1 
delicious nyc bagels good selections of cream cheese real lox with capers even 1 
if you have several dozen or several hundred contacts then imagine the fun of sending each of them one by one 0 
very funny 1 
despite how hard i rate businesses its actually rare for me to give a 1 star 0 
it didnt work people can not hear me when i talk 0 
overall a great experience 1 
im so happy to be here 1 
as always the evening was wonderful and the food delicious 1 
nice sound 1 
all it took was one drop from about 6 inches above the kitchen counter and it was crackedi am not impressed and i am not laughing 0 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
battery chargelife is quite long 1 
the jalapeno bacon is soooo good 1 
hackneyed writing certainly but made even worse by the bad directing 0 
this movie is excellentangel is beautiful and scamp is adorablehis little yelps when hes scaredand the funniest parts are whenscamp is caught under the curtain and when angel and scamp are singing ive never had this feeling beforei totally recommend this movieits coming out on special edition on june 20the cover has scamp on a garbage can and angel underneath the lid 1 
the lead man is charismafree 0 
this product is clearly not ready for prime time i dont care how cool it looks if you cant tell a call is coming in its worthless 0 
the use of slowmotion needlessly repeats itself throughout the movie but is well backed up by bad acting and bad is a kind word here no continuity scenes that are thrown in for no reason whatsoever vehicles that looked like they were made from a corn flakes box and a directorial style that bordered on stupidity 0 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
this convention never worked well in the past and certainly doesnt work here 0 
worst service to boot but that is the least of their worries 0 
my boyfriend and i came here for the first time on a recent trip to vegas and could not have been more pleased with the quality of food and service 1 
i love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it 1 
it was pretty gross 0 
fantastic earphones 1 
the most annoying thing about cover girl is the way in which rita hayworth is put up on a pedestal 0 
bt50 battery junk 0 
it definitely was not as good as my s11 1 
a very charming film with wonderful sentiment and heart 1 
does not fit 0 
great food and awesome service 1 
this fixes all the problems 1 
painful on the ear 0 
what makes this story different are the terrific production values faultless photography composition and editing the terrific casting the underappreciated brian keith playing a bully teddy and vivid history 1 
the camera although rated at an impressive 13 megapixels renders images that fall well below expectations of such a relatively high resolution 0 
this product is clearly not ready for prime time i dont care how cool it looks if you cant tell a call is coming in its worthless 0 
best breakfast buffet 1 
never got it 0 
great character actors telly savalas and peter boyle 1 
i was very excited to get this headset because i thought it was really cute 1 
to sum the film up breeders is a terrible cheaply made horror movie that should be avoided like the ebola virus 0 
i literally vomited while watching this film 0 
frankly after cotton club and unfaithful it was kind of embarrassing to watch lane and gere in this film because it is bad 0 
i have bought this nokia cell phone a few weeks ago and it was a nightmare 0 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
this place was such a nice surprise 1 
never going back 0 
i think the most wonderful parts literally full of wonder are the excerpts from his works 1 
great software for motorolas 1 
needless to say we will never be back here again 0 
you get what you pay for i guess 0 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
highly unprofessional and rude to a loyal patron 0 
camera color balance is awful 0 
not recommended 0 
i sat riveted to the tv screen 1 
when my order arrived one of the gyros was missing 0 
i would have casted her in that role after ready the script 1 
sound quality on both end is excellent i use headset to call my wife and ask my wife to use headset to call me 2 1 
we recently witnessed her poor quality of management towards other guests as well 0 
good works fine 1 
fans of the genre will be in heaven 1 
the phone was unusable and was not new 0 
this is high adventure at its best 1 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
the chips and salsa were really good the salsa was very fresh 1 
worst thai ever 0 
lots of holes in the script 0 
both rickman and stowe play their roles to the hilt in this tale of a childrens book writer who maybe has written a subversive tract 1 
the acting is terrible and the writing is worse 0 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
everything was gross 0 
saggy floppy piece of junk 0 
almost all of the songs in cover girl are oldfashioned and not very tuneful 0 
dont waste your time 0 
bela lugosi was totally extraneous intoning odd lines 0 
it was absolutely amazing 1 
the movie is not completely perfect but titta di girolamo will stay with you for a long time after the vision of the movie 1 
when i placed my treo into the case not only was it not snug but there was a lot of extra room on the sides 0 
this film tries to be a serious and sophisticated thrillerhorror flick and it fails miserably 0 
the movie had you on the edge of your seat and made you somewhat afraid to go to your car at the end of the night 1 
every time he opened his mouth you expect to hear you see kids pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show 0 
i cant believe theres even a sequel to this 0 
nice case feels good in your hands 1 
nothing new there 0 
the bathroom is just next door and very nice 1 
star trek v the final frontier is the worst in the series 0 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
mic doesnt work 0 
the only place good for this film is in the garbage 0 
good product incredible value 1 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
all things considered a job very well done 1 
i definitly recommend 1 
the cg opening sequence in space looked like it could have been created on microsoft slideshow for gods sake 0 
all i can do is whine on the internet so here it goesthe more i use the thing the less i like it 0 
i love this thing 1 
the bipolarity of the ruthless thug one minute a ruthless killer the next minute a luvs diaper commercial is completely unconvincing 0 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
the burger is good beef cooked just right 1 
yes its that bad 0 
definitely a bargain 1 
i would recommend this 1 
everything was perfect the night we were in 1 
on the up side their cafe serves really good food 1 
nice quality build unlike some cheap s out there 1 
everything is appalling 0 
it looks very nice 1 
it was so bad i had lost the heart to finish it 0 
this is hands down the best phone ive ever had 1 
for 40 bucks a head i really expect better food 0 
the 12 mega pixel camera being a part of a phone is reasonably good7 1 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
even if you love bad movies do not watch this movie 0 
my headset works just peachykeen 1 
awesome device 1 
the only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive 1 
that just screams legit in my booksomethats also pretty rare here in vegas 1 
why are these sad little vegetables so overcooked 0 
the black eyed peas and sweet potatoes unreal 1 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
i had absolutely no problem with this headset linking to my 8530 blackberry curve 1 
works fine 1 
i have yet to run this new battery below two bars and thats three days without charging 1 
as for the killer dont expect anything original or even remotely frightening 0 
one thing i hate is the mode set button at the side 0 
love this product 1 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
not good when wearing a hat or sunglasses 0 
i recommend igo to anyone with different brand cell phonesmp3 players in the family 1 
the structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema 1 
the charger arrived within the promised timeframe but it did not work 0 
bland and flavorless is a good way of describing the barely tepid meat 0 
the foreigner is not worth one second of your time 0 
best tacos in town by far 1 
i saw this movie and i thought this is a stupid movie 0 
the screen does get smudged easily because it touches your ear and face 0 
his costars dont fare much better with people like morgan freeman jonah hill and ed helms just wasted 0 
we ordered some old classics and some new dishes after going there a few times and were sorely disappointed with everything 0 
the cast is always entertaining as usual 1 
i really dont see how anyone could enjoy this movie 0 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
i can take a little bad service but the food sucks 0 
wow very spicy but delicious 1 
bela lugosi was totally extraneous intoning odd lines 0 
i would recommend this 1 
excellent phone 1 
big disappointment with calendar sync 0 
you get extra minutes so that you can carry out the call and not get cut off 1 
but when i check voice mail at night the keypad backlight turns off a few seconds into the first message and then im lost 0 
will not be back 0 
other than that the leather is nice and soft the fit is very tight the cut out for the face is a good shape 1 
sweetest phone 1 
i had the chicken pho and it tasted very bland 0 
the feel of the dining room was more college cooking course than high class dining and the service was slow at best 0 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
loved the casting of jimmy buffet as the science teacher 1 
watching washing machine twirling around wouldnt hurt your eyes as much as this show 0 
the plot simply rumbles on like a machine desperately depending on the addition of new scenes 0 
fans of the genre will be in heaven 1 
penne vodka excellent 1 
what possesed me to get this junk i have no idea 0 
excellent phone 1 
unfortunately it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees 0 
dont buy it 0 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
what possesed me to get this junk i have no idea 0 
there was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth but it didnt really work into the rest of the plot 0 
i believe that pitch black was done well 1 
fantastic service here 1 
everything stinks 0 
110 and only because there is no setting for 010 0 
again no plot at all 0 
your brain will attempt to shutdown as part of a primal impulse of selfpreservation 0 
dont waste your money 0 
makes it easier to keep up with my bluetooth when im not wearing it 0 
none of the three sizes they sent with the headset would stay in my ears 0 
the acting is terrible and the writing is worse 0 
the noise shield is incrediable 1 
this place was such a nice surprise 1 
the mic is great 1 
food was great and so was the serivce 1 
this fixes all the problems 1 
the film deserves strong kudos for taking this stand for having exceptional acting from its mostly lesserknown cast and for the superintelligent script that doesnt insult the audience or take the easy way out when it comes to white racism 1 
ive never been more insulted or felt disrespected 0 
her lines seem to have been written by a fifteen year old though they are trying oh so so hard to sound like how a fifteen year old would really um you know well talk 0 
the show would begin with smart ass ed comments to each other that would be totally off the wall and uncalled for 0 
juano hernandez an exceptional actor who played supporting roles in many films of the era is a proud black man who is accused of murdering a white man in the south 1 
this one works and was priced right 1 
over rated 0 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
i wear glasses and it fits fine with them 1 
this does not fit the palm tungsten e2 and it broke the first time i tried to plug it in 0 
ordered burger rare came in well done 0 
the inside is really quite nice and very clean 1 
on a positive note our server was very attentive and provided great service 1 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
also the fries are without a doubt the worst fries ive ever had 0 
lets start with all the problemsthe acting especially from the lead professor was very very bad 0 
the pizza selections are good 1 
but it is great i would really recommend it 1 
there still are good actors around 1 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
worst hour and a half of my lifeoh my gosh 0 
strike 2 who wants to be rushed 0 
its quite simply the highest most superlative form of cinema imaginable 1 
the menu is always changing food quality is going down service is extremely slow 0 
the menu is always changing food quality is going down service is extremely slow 0 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
you cant relate with them hell you barely can understand them 0 
this scene is very strong and unpleasant 0 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
top line dont waste your time and money on this one its as bad as it comes 0 
but when i check voice mail at night the keypad backlight turns off a few seconds into the first message and then im lost 0 
the story starts too fast with absolutely no suspense or buildup in the slightest 0 
lousy product 0 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
wed definitely go back here again 1 
i had heard good things about this place but it exceeding every hope i could have dreamed of 1 
very slow at seating even with reservation 0 
the soundtrack wasnt terrible either 1 
everything was good and tasty 1 
all in all its an insult to ones intelligence and a huge waste of money 0 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
it is worth the drive 1 
you cant beat that 1 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
i especially liked the noncliche choices with the parents in other movies i could predict the dialog verbatim but the writing in this movie made better selections 1 
service was good and the company was better 1 
the visual effects were awful 0 
plus it was wellpaced and suited its relatively short run time 1 
the only suspense i was feeling was the frustration at just how retarded the girls were 0 
you share general loewenhielms exquisite joy in his partaking of the cailles en sarcophage even though you are just watching a movie but you do wish for just a small sample to savor 1 
i did not bother contacting the company for few dollar product but i learned the lesson that i should not have bought this form online anyway 0 
i rate this movie 910 1 
for a self proclaimed coffee cafe i was wildly disappointed 0 
we made the drive all the way from north scottsdale and i was not one bit disappointed 1 
their daily specials are always a hit with my group 1 
it is super charged up for use as a small hybrid palmtopcameracellphone and excels in those roles 1 
how awesome is that 1 
hell no will i go back 0 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
the decor is nice and the piano music soundtrack is pleasant 1 
i would advise to not purchase this item it never worked very well 0 
the puppets look really cheesy not in a good way like in the puppet master 80s flicks 0 
the cashier was friendly and even brought the food out to me 1 
when i received my pita it was huge it did have a lot of meat in it so thumbs up there 1 
dont waste your time 0 
this is the first phone ive had that has been so cheaply made 0 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
after 3 months screen just went black all of a sudden 0 
damian is so talented and versatile in so many ways of writing and portraying different characters on screen 1 
the whole experience was underwhelming and i think well just go to ninja sushi next time 0 
these are the nicest restaurant owners ive ever come across 1 
its a great item 1 
i am sorry i made this purchase 0 
that being said for a phone the camera is very nice many cool effects to play with and video is decent as well 1 
it is worth the drive 1 
i wasnt expecting oscar material but this 0 
we wont be returning 0 
this would not even be good as a made for tv flick 0 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
they work about 2 weeks then break 0 
shes poised and amazing 1 
fast service 1 
the writer gorman bechard undoubtedly did his homework because all references are industry and characterage appropriate 1 
things happen characters personalities change plot twists occur for no real reason other than that script calls for it 0 
all it took was one drop from about 6 inches above the kitchen counter and it was crackedi am not impressed and i am not laughing 0 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
its so bad its actually worth seeing just for that reason 0 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
this movie is also revealing 1 
this movie is so awesome 1 
this is one of peter watkins most accessible films 1 
however i recently watched the whole thing again on dvd and i was completely struck by how extremely stupid the storyline was how it contained holes inconsistencies and frankly a whole lot of crap and how horrid the dancing was 0 
good value great food great service 1 
the story line is totally predictable 0 
this is the first phone ive had that has been so cheaply made 0 
emily watsons character is very strong and she has only to give a quick glance and you understand everything 1 
the staff is great the food is delish and they have an incredible beer selection 1 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
my experience was terrible this was my fourth bluetooth headset and while it was much more comfortable than my last jabra which i hated 0 
it feels poorly constructed the menus are difficult to navigate and the buttons are so recessed that it is difficult to push them 0 
it holds a charge for a long time is reasonably comfortable under longwearing conditions and the quality of sound is tremendous 1 
worst phone ever 0 
this device is great in several situations1 1 
see both films if you can 1 
this is a very average phone with bad battery life that operates on a weak network 0 
it was clear that she had the range and ability to pull off this part 1 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
we waited an hour for what was a breakfast i could have done 100 times better at home 0 
great place to eat reminds me of the little mom and pop shops in the san francisco bay area 1 
the turkey and roast beef were bland 0 
the story line is totally predictable 0 
the eargels channel the sound directly into your ear and seem to increase the sound volume and clarity 1 
waste of money 0 
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 
the ambiance was incredible 1 
great atmosphere friendly and fast service 1 
the cast was great 1 
his losing his marbles so early in the proceedings is totally implausible and unconvincing 0 
the transfers are very good 1 
a pretty good product 1 
clever and a real crowdpleaserthis film still ranks among mickeys best films even after 80 wonderful years 1 
this is high adventure at its best 1 
i like the fact that it rests lightly against your ear rather than inside 1 
you could only take 2 videos at a time and the quality was very poor 0 
on the negative its insipid enough to cause regret for another 2 hours of life wasted in front of the screen 0 
mediocre food 0 
i have had this phone for over a year now and i will tell you its not that great 0 
hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in 0 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
much better than the other ayce sushi place i went to in vegas 1 
will go back next trip out 1 
the results well are a shame 0 
then the film just dropped the ball 0 
loved itfriendly servers great food wonderful and imaginative menu 1 
always a great time at dos gringos 1 
very true to shakespear and a must for all shakespear fans 1 
my headset works just peachykeen 1 
nicest chinese restaurant ive been in a while 1 
piece of trash 0 
i saw this short film on hbo the other day and absolutely loved it 1 
the servers are not pleasant to deal with and they dont always honor pizza hut coupons 0 
putting the race card aside lets look at the major flaw in the film they destroy latifas character 0 
very easy to use 1 
yes its that bad 0 
i had absolutely no problem with this headset linking to my 8530 blackberry curve 1 
lasted one day and then blew up 0 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
the screen does get smudged easily because it touches your ear and face 0 
for 40 bucks a head i really expect better food 0 
but the service was beyond bad 0 
i have to mention this and it is a huge spoiler i loved the ending how all the characters of the three films were the remaining survivors of the ferry disaster with valentine and the young judge together and the old man watching it on her tv solidifying his happiness over the suffering which he dealt with for those many years 1 
very cheap plastic creaks like an old wooden floor 0 
if it was to turn my good day feeling into a night of disturbing memories than i guess he succeeded 0 
i am very impressed with this headset from plantronics 1 
i contacted the company and they told me that although the unit was still under warranty if i couldnt produce my receipt i was out of luck 0 
we loved the biscuits 1 
very friendly staff 1 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
returned 8 hours later 0 
his performance as awarded was stunning 1 
this results in the phone being either stuck at max volume or mute 0 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
conclusion i loved it 1 
when i placed my treo into the case not only was it not snug but there was a lot of extra room on the sides 0 
i understand that its supposed to be a cheap popcorn comedy but that doesnt mean that it has to completely insult our intelligence and have writing so incredibly hackneyed that it borders on offensive 0 
with the originality and freshness of the first movie now spent this remake had little else to offer 0 
very good lunch spot 1 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
i could care less the interior is just beautiful 1 
works great 1 
this was my first and only vegas buffet and it did not disappoint 1 
aside from its terrible lead this film has loads of other debits 0 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
the results well are a shame 0 
it holds a charge for a long time is reasonably comfortable under longwearing conditions and the quality of sound is tremendous 1 
great software for motorolas 1 
our server was super nice and checked on us many times 1 
why was this film made 0 
i have tried these cables with my computer and my ipod and it works just fine 1 
last time buying from you 0 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
it is so small and you dont even realize that it is there after a while of getting used to it 1 
very very sad 0 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
i had high hopes for this place since the burgers are cooked over a charcoal grill but unfortunately the taste fell flat way flat 0 
the movie is terribly boring in places 0 
weve tried to like this place but after 10 times i think were done with them 0 
later i found myself lost in the power of the film 1 
plantronics bluetooth excelent buy 1 
the screen does get smudged easily because it touches your ear and face 0 
i dont think it would hold it too securly on your belt 0 
i was able to do voice dialing in the car with no problem 1 
loved the casting of jimmy buffet as the science teacher 1 
one character is totally annoying with a voice that gives me the feeling of fingernails on a chalkboard 0 
poor voice clarity 0 
the script is bad very bad  it contains both cheesiness and unethical joke that you normally see in rated r or nc17 movie 0 
i was not happy with this item 0 
i literally vomited while watching this film 0 
the management is rude 0 
they really want to make your experience a good one 1 
he was terrible 0 
great character actors telly savalas and peter boyle 1 
unfortunately it will not recharge my iphone 4s despite connecting it from multiple power sources imac external battery wall outlet etc 0 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
i would not recommend this place 0 
the shipping time was also very quick 1 
ryans bar is definitely one edinburgh establishment i wont be revisiting 0 
i highly recommend this modest priced cellular phone 1 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
this movie was kind of long in length but i enjoyed every minute of it 1 
we watched our waiter pay a lot more attention to other tables and ignore us 0 
poor product 0 
all in all i think it was a good investment 1 
instead we got a bore fest about a whiny spoiled brat babysitting 0 
avoid at all costs 0 
but in any case the best part is you can download these pictures to your laptop using ir or even send pictures from your laptop to the phone 1 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
i rate this movie 910 1 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
this is a great deal 1 
a good film by a great director 1 
it did not work in my cell phone plug i am very up set with the charger 0 
even in my bmw 3 series which is fairly quiet i have trouble hearing what the other person is saying 0 
waste of 13 bucks 0 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
problem is that the ear loops are made of weak material and break easily 0 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
the attractive set used throughout most of the film is an eyepleasing gem 1 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
i started this review with two stars but im editing it to give it only one 0 
the lead man is charismafree 0 
i was able to do voice dialing in the car with no problem 1 
fast service 1 
nobody identifies with these characters because theyre all cardboard cutouts and stereotypes or predictably reversestereotypes 0 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
i love this thing 1 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
it has been a winner for us 1 
saggy floppy piece of junk 0 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
all the bread is made inhouse 1 
i dont think i will be back for a very long time 0 
my breakfast was perpared great with a beautiful presentation of 3 giant slices of toast lightly dusted with powdered sugar 1 
overall a great experience 1 
the last 15 minutes of movie are also not bad as well 1 
it wasnt busy either also the building was freezing cold 0 
this is a beautiful phone 1 
the cashew cream sauce was bland and the vegetables were undercooked 0 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
the voice recognition thru the handset is excellent 1 
not only did the software do a great job of this i could also make my own ringtones form my existing cds without an internet connection 1 
hes a national treasure 1 
im glad the film didnt go for the most obvious choice as a lesser film certainly would have 1 
i was so insulted 0 
that movie was bad 0 
i mean really how do you get so famous for your fish and chips when its so terrible 0 
my gyro was basically lettuce only 0 
it is indescribably the most annoying and idiotic show i have ever seen 0 
bluetooth range is good a few days ago i left my phone in the trunk got a call and carried the conversation without a hitch 1 
their chow mein is so good 1 
frozen pucks of disgust with some of the worst people behind the register 0 
im still trying to get over how bad it was 0 
i am very impressed with this headset from plantronics 1 
great phone 1 
this film tries to be a serious and sophisticated thrillerhorror flick and it fails miserably 0 
i dont have very many words to say about this place but it does everything pretty well 1 
bad purchase 0 
and the chef was generous with his time even came around twice so we can take pictures with him 1 
how can you call yourself a steakhouse if you cant properly cook a steak i dont understand 0 
the camera although rated at an impressive 13 megapixels renders images that fall well below expectations of such a relatively high resolution 0 
i saw this short film on hbo the other day and absolutely loved it 1 
jawbone era is awesome too 1 
the presentation of the food was awful 0 
but in any case the best part is you can download these pictures to your laptop using ir or even send pictures from your laptop to the phone 1 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
very funny 1 
but the convoluted plot just didnt convince me and much of the film was watched with a weird questioning glance 0 
this is definitely one of the better documentaries i have seen looking at family relationships and marriage 1 
the restaurant atmosphere was exquisite 1 
the chicken wings contained the driest chicken meat i have ever eaten 0 
ps the only scene in the movie that was cool is when the central character finds her room blown up 1 
ambience is perfect 1 
both rickman and stowe play their roles to the hilt in this tale of a childrens book writer who maybe has written a subversive tract 1 
the igo chargers and tips are really great 1 
maybe if they werent cold they would have been somewhat edible 0 
an italian reviewer called this a small great film and thats right 1 
this was a poor remake of my best friends wedding 0 
they were excellent 1 
this is one of the worst sandra bullock movie since speed 2 but not quite that bad 0 
i was totally fascinated by the music the dancing everything 1 
there are the usual hitchcock logic flaws 0 
and considering the two of us left there very full and happy for about 20 you just cant go wrong 1 
truly awful 0 
the films sole bright spot was jonah hill who will look almost unrecognizable to fans of the recent superbad due to the amount of weight he lost in the interim 1 
works great when my cat attacked the phone he scratched the protective strip instead of destroying the screen 1 
generally it just lacked imagination 0 
excellent phone 1 
how awful she is 0 
good value great food great service 1 
however after about a year the fliptop started to get loose and wobbly and eventually my screen went black and i couldnt receive and place calls 0 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
if you do go see this movie bring a pillow or a girlfriendboyfriend to keep you occupied through out 0 
dont waste your time here 0 
im super pissd 0 
the bathroom is just next door and very nice 1 
however the ear pads come off easily and after only one week i lost one 0 
the lighting is awful 0 
superb phone on a great network 1 
my 5year old nokia 2160 from tracfone holds the charge a lot better than this 0 
waste your money on this game 1 
the potatoes were great and so was the biscuit 1 
we have gotten a lot of compliments on it 1 
same evening him and i are both drastically sick 0 
graphics is far from the best part of the game 0 
this frog phone charm is adorable and very eye catching 1 
all in all a great disappointment 0 
the portion was huge 1 
the design is very good4 1 
the acting is beyond abysmal 0 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
whatever the producer was going for he missed entirely 0 
john garfield ann revere lilli plmer william conrad canada leeand filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screenjames wong howe 1 
design flaw 0 
the films dialogue is natural real to life 1 
it was delicious 1 
would not reccommend 0 
i would have given no star if i was able 0 
if you plan to use this in a car forget about it 0 
i swung in to give them a try but was deeply disappointed 0 
i was so insulted 0 
of course the acting is blah 0 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
i even dropped this phone into a stream and it was submerged for 15 seconds and it still works great 1 
you get what you pay for i guess 0 
it clicks into place in a way that makes you wonder how long that mechanism would last 0 
oh yeah and the storyline was pathetic too 0 
all of the main players are mesmerising 1 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
clever and a real crowdpleaserthis film still ranks among mickeys best films even after 80 wonderful years 1 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
the majority of the logitech earbud headsets failed 0 
a standout scene 1 
we waited an hour for what was a breakfast i could have done 100 times better at home 0 
works great when my cat attacked the phone he scratched the protective strip instead of destroying the screen 1 
the chains which im no fan of beat this place easily 0 
im still trying to get over how bad it was 0 
just as good as when i had it more than a year ago 1 
the design is very good4 1 
the microphone also works well but according to people i have called it applifies everything 1 
unless youre just out to visually collect all extant films of austens work you can skip this one 0 
lets start with all the problemsthe acting especially from the lead professor was very very bad 0 
i had heard good things about this place but it exceeding every hope i could have dreamed of 1 
some applause should be given to the prelude however 1 
2 thumbs up 1 
i was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar not only because the quality is great but the service is fast and the food impeccable 1 
the potato chip order was sad i could probably count how many chips were in that box and it was probably around 12 0 
i bought this phone as a replacement for my startac and have regretted it since 0 
the least said about the acting the better 0 
after a year the battery went completely dead on my headset 0 
i gave it 5 stars because of the sound quality 1 
both of them were truly unbelievably good and i am so glad we went back 1 
i was seated immediately 1 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
krussel always good 1 
so there is no way for me to plug it in here in the us unless i go by a converter 0 
there is nothing authentic about this place 0 
the warm beer didnt help 0 
worked great 1 
it feels poorly constructed the menus are difficult to navigate and the buttons are so recessed that it is difficult to push them 0 
what on earth is irons doing in this film 0 
what i really like there is the crepe station 1 
seems like a good quick place to grab a bite of some familiar pub food but do yourself a favor and look elsewhere 0 
the only thing i wasnt too crazy about was their guacamole as i dont like it puréed 0 
the acting by the whole cast could be put on a scale and balanced perfectly between overacting and underacting 0 
i dont think i will be back for a very long time 0 
really good product 1 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
probably never coming back and wouldnt recommend it 0 
if there were zero stars i would give it zero stars 0 
the good cinematography also makes her and monica bellucci look very beautiful 1 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
love this phone 1 
the battery is completely useless to me 0 
why was this film made 0 
everything captain howdy says is either laughable or just plain stupid 0 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
dessert panna cotta was amazing 1 
the cashier had no care what so ever on what i had to say it still ended up being wayyy overpriced 0 
its reception is very very poor 0 
im glad i found this product on amazon it is hard to find it wasnt high priced 1 
the cast of veteran actors are more than just a nostalgia trip 1 
what makes this story different are the terrific production values faultless photography composition and editing the terrific casting the underappreciated brian keith playing a bully teddy and vivid history 1 
i dont think well be going back anytime soon 0 
i particularly remember my senses being assaulted by strident cords of music that would blare out with very little warning and even less meaning 0 
great character actors telly savalas and peter boyle 1 
their frozen margaritas are way too sugary for my taste 0 
trying to make a call on these is an exercise in frustration 0 
however i needed some better instructions 0 
service sucks 0 
finally after three or four times the spring of the latch broke and i could not use it any longer on the visor 0 
also the phone doesnt seem to accept anything except cbr mp3s preferably ripped by windows media player 0 
brilliant 1 
again lame 0 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
its this pandering to the audience that sabotages most of his films 0 
this phone might well be the worst ive ever had in any brand 0 
lame would be the best way to describe it 0 
fantastic service here 1 
yes its shiny on front side and i love it 1 
no additional ear gels provided and no instructions whatsoever 0 
the phone takes forever to charge like 2 to 5 hours literally 0 
better than youd expect 1 
putting the race card aside lets look at the major flaw in the film they destroy latifas character 0 
the phone crashed completely and now i have to get it replaced 0 
frozen pucks of disgust with some of the worst people behind the register 0 
they do not care about the consumer one bit 0 
product was excellent and works better than the verizon one and boy was it cheaper 1 
there is really nothing for me at postinos hope your experience is better 0 
what possesed me to get this junk i have no idea 0 
not as good as i had hoped 0 
the film gives meaning to the phrase never in the history of human conflict has so much been owed by so many to so few 1 
if she had not rolled the eyes we may have stayed not sure if we will go back and try it again 0 
everything from acting to cinematography was solid 1 
voice quality signal strength dropped calls 0 
sooooo good 1 
comfort for our whole family 1 
it really created a unique feeling though 1 
is pretty funny 1 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
this place is amazing 1 
no additional ear gels provided and no instructions whatsoever 0 
hell no will i go back 0 
this is high adventure at its best 1 
i dont understand how this garbage got on the shelves of the movie store its not even a real movie 0 
save your money ive had this item for 11 months now 0 
the food came out at a good pace 1 
the restaurant is very clean and has a family restaurant feel to it 1 
talk about useless customer service 0 
would not reccommend 0 
cinematography noteworthy including fine views of barcelona and its famed gaudi towers 1 
anyways the food was definitely not filling at all and for the price you pay you should expect more 0 
i probably would not go here again 0 
is pretty funny 1 
great food 1 
i keep watching it over and over 1 
the only thing i wasnt too crazy about was their guacamole as i dont like it puréed 0 
poor product 0 
it looked like a wonderful story 1 
i keep watching it over and over 1 
its a great tool for entertainment communication and data managementoh be sure to use activesync 42 for optimal data synchronization results 1 
wonderful lil tapas and the ambience made me feel all warm and fuzzy inside 1 
he is one of my favourite directors and one of the most talented directors in the history of cinema 1 
what did bother me was the slow service 0 
cant upload ringtones from a third party 0 
jabra ear gels r the best 1 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
i recommend this for everyone who loves film movies anythinga work of art 1 
its a shame to see good actors like thomerson and james make a living in a mess like this 0 
the staff was very attentive 1 
youll love how thin it is 1 
the staff is friendly and the joint is always clean 1 
there is a brilliant twist ending 1 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
there is nothing privileged about workingeating there 0 
the selection on the menu was great and so were the prices 1 
i love this device 1 
there is however some pretty good acting at least for this type of film 1 
horrible 0 
nice docking station for home or work 1 
five star plus plus 1 
the plot has more holes than a pair of fishnet stockings and the direction and editing is astonishingly ham fisted 0 
excellent sound battery life and inconspicuous to boot 1 
at first i thought i was grtting a good deal at 744 until i plugged it into my phone v3c razr 0 
the story line is just awful 0 
the majority of the logitech earbud headsets failed 0 
ryans bar is definitely one edinburgh establishment i wont be revisiting 0 
judith light is one of my favorite actresses and i think she does a superb job in this film 1 
when achille and philippa beautifully sing a duet from don giovanni that perfectly describes their situation in the movie you appreciate the subtle layers of this excellent film 1 
my fiancé and i came in the middle of the day and we were greeted and seated right away 1 
that was done in the second movie 0 
stay away from this store be careful 0 
no ear loop needed its tiny and the sound is great 1 
great atmosphere friendly and fast service 1 
att is not clear sound is very distorted and you have to yell when you talk 0 
dont waste your time here 0 
never been to hard rock casino before will never ever step forward in it again 0 
the cashew cream sauce was bland and the vegetables were undercooked 0 
this is actually a very smart movie 1 
i have to jiggle the plug to get it to line up right to get decent volume 0 
this movie creates its own universe and is fascinating in every way 1 
great food and awesome service 1 
if you want a real scare rent this one 1 
greatno problems at all 1 
the buttons for on and off are bad 0 
the service was great even the manager came and helped with our table 1 
gotta love those closeups of slimy drooling teeth 1 
i cannot believe that the actors agreed to do this film 0 
its reception is very very poor 0 
disappointing 0 
best service and food ever maria our server was so good and friendly she made our day 1 
i had verizon 2 years ago and really liked their service 1 
i had the chicken pho and it tasted very bland 0 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
this film has no redeeming features 0 
they are so cool 1 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
the cable looks so thin and flimsy it is scary 0 
i liked this movie way too much 1 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
the shower area is outside so you can only rinse not take a full shower unless you dont mind being nude for everyone to see 0 
an awesome new look for fall 2000 1 
setup went very smoothly 1 
the croutons also taste homemade which is an extra plus 1

and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
dessert panna cotta was amazing 1 
his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic 1

call me a nut but i think this is one of the best movies ever 1 
the inside is really quite nice and very clean 1 
no plot whatsoever 0 
the food was terrible 0 
both films are terrible but to the credit of the 1986 version it was watchable 0 
disappointment i hate anything that goes in my ear 0 
yet i enjoy watching it 1 
great food and great service in a clean and friendly setting 1 
the design might be ergonomic in theory but i could not stand having these in my ear 0 
the file browser offers all the options that one needshandsfree is great 1 
fantastic food 1 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
later i found myself lost in the power of the film 1 
my phone doesnt slide around my car now and the grip prevents my phone from slipping out of my hand 1 
this is cool because most cases are just open there allowing the screen to get all scratched up 1 
juano hernandez an exceptional actor who played supporting roles in many films of the era is a proud black man who is accused of murdering a white man in the south 1 
every element of this story was so over the top excessively phony and contrived that it was painful to sit through 0 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
any grandmother can make a roasted chicken better than this one 0 
my sister has one also and she loves it 1 
the entire audience applauded at the conclusion of the film 1 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
recommend with confidence 1 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
food was good service was good prices were good 1 
i love the camera its really pretty good quality 1 
disapointing results 0 
this is a beautiful phone 1 
pricing is a bit of a concern at mellow mushroom 0 
hayao miyazakis latest and eighth film for studio ghibili gake no ue no ponyo ponyo on the cliff by the sea is a wonderfully fun and imaginative look at childhood 1 
i will never go back to this place and will never ever recommended this place to anyone 0 
the attention given to every character and complex psychological portrayals detailing loyalty treachery love and hope are tremendous 1 
all in all a great disappointment 0 
this is actually a very smart movie 1 
there is nothing authentic about this place 0 
by the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant i was bored and didnt care what happened next and so i switched off 0 
it defeats the purpose of a bluetooth headset 0 
battery is terrible 0 
they have horrible attitudes towards customers and talk down to each one when customers dont enjoy their food 0 
they will customize your order any way youd like my usual is eggplant with green bean stir fry love it 1 
this is a masterful piece of filmmaking with many themes simmering and occasionally boiling over in this warts and all study of the poets bohemian selfindulgent wartime years that span the aerial bombardments of london and the outward tranquillity of a welsh coastal retreat the borderlines between friendship lust and love dedication to art and experience versus practical concerns jealousy rivalry cowardice and egotism versus heroism and selfsacrifice and more 1 
this phone tries very hard to do everything but fails at its very ability to be a phone 0 
soyo technology sucks 0 
fantastic food 1 
the plantains were the worst ive ever tasted 0 
small sleek impressive looking practical setup with ample storage in place 1 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
now this dish was quite flavourful 1 
theres also enough hypocrisy in this film to make me vomit 0 
its so stupid to have to keep buying new chargers car chargers cradles headphones and car kits every time a new phone comes out 0 
but even the talented carrell cant save this 0 
the food amazing 1 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
the death row scenes were entirely unmoving 0 
ive tried several different earpieces for my cell phone and this jabra one is the first one ive found that fits my ear comfortably 1 
i am going to have to be the first to negatively review this product 0 
it was too predictable even for a chick flick 0 
it was equally awful 0 
on the good side the staff was genuinely pleasant and enthusiastic a real treat 1 
the most annoying thing about cover girl is the way in which rita hayworth is put up on a pedestal 0 
the vanilla ice cream was creamy and smooth while the profiterole choux pastry was fresh enough 1
