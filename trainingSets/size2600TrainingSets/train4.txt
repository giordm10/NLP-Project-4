worst ever 0 
i think that it is a must see older john wayne film 1 
portable and it works 1 
i am far from a sushi connoisseur but i can definitely tell the difference between good food and bad food and this was certainly bad food 0 
eew this location needs a complete overhaul 0 
very bad experience 0 
it is wonderful and inspiring to watch and i hope that it gets released again on to video or dvd 1 
i will not be eating there again 0 
the manager was the worst 0 
in a word it is embarrassing 0 
the selection on the menu was great and so were the prices 1 
this movie was kind of long in length but i enjoyed every minute of it 1 
nonlinear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well 1 
shes poised and amazing 1 
but now i was completely grossed out 0 
and the chef was generous with his time even came around twice so we can take pictures with him 1 
the phone takes forever to charge like 2 to 5 hours literally 0 
third the cheese on my friends burger was cold 0 
i hate to disagree with my fellow yelpers but my husband and i were so disappointed with this place 0 
i highly recommend this device to everyone 1 
the problem i have is that they charge 1199 for a sandwich that is no bigger than a subway sub which offers better and more amount of vegetables 0 
it doesnt make you look cool 0 
i wont spoil it but the ending in pretty amazing 1 
overall i rate this movie a 10 out of a 110 scale 1 
i hate to disagree with my fellow yelpers but my husband and i were so disappointed with this place 0 
then scene where they debated whether or not to sack the trumpeter who falsely was accused for the murder is pure horror really stupid 0 
it is very comfortable to wear as well which is probably the most important aspect about using a case 1 
this frog phone charm is adorable and very eye catching 1 
why was this film made 0 
but it is great i would really recommend it 1 
juano hernandez an exceptional actor who played supporting roles in many films of the era is a proud black man who is accused of murdering a white man in the south 1 
its also great to see that renowned silent screenwriter frances marion hasnt missed a step going from silent to sound 1 
dont buy this product 0 
it sure does beat the nachos at the movies but i would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant 0 
the entire audience applauded at the conclusion of the film 1 
the steaks are all well trimmed and also perfectly cooked 1 
the acting from all involved and that includes those like shatner and nimoy is bad and washed out and making them seem as old as they look in real life the special effects are tacky like when spock has to rescue kirk on a jet pack when he falls down from a mountain 0 
unfortunately this is a bad movie that is just plain bad 0 
everything captain howdy says is either laughable or just plain stupid 0 
nice design and quality 1 
item does not match picture 0 
very disappointed in accessoryone 0 
all the pretty pictures in the world cannot make up for a piece of work that is flawed at the core 0 
this was such an awesome movie that i bought it off of ebay 1 
the movie seemed a little slow at first 0 
everything about it is just bad 0 
very happy with this product 1 
not tasty and the texture was just nasty 0 
it worked very well 1 
the company shipped my product very promptly and it works well 1 
on the good side the staff was genuinely pleasant and enthusiastic a real treat 1 
i could not stand to even watch it for very long for fear of losing iq 0 
verizon tech support walked my through a few procedures none of which worked and i ended up having to do a hard reset wiping out all my data 0 
this is a good battery and it got here really fast 1 
it was just too horrible 0 
it deserves strong love 1 
sweetest phone 1 
first the bathrooms at this location were dirty seat covers were not replenished just plain yucky 0 
i dont know what the big deal is about this place but i wont be back yaall 0 
setup went very smoothly 1 
nice design and quality 1 
i think i was one of the people who found this another one of roths pearls 1 
the concert sequences just sucked 0 
you have to hold the phone at a particular angle for the other party to hear you clearly 0 
will never ever go back 0 
the show would begin with smart ass ed comments to each other that would be totally off the wall and uncalled for 0 
all in all i can assure you ill be back 1 
the block was amazing 1 
highly recommended a 1 
the plot has more holes than a pair of fishnet stockings and the direction and editing is astonishingly ham fisted 0 
the management is rude 0 
what possesed me to get this junk i have no idea 0 
at least think to refill my water before i struggle to wave you over for 10 minutes 0 
the greek dressing was very creamy and flavorful 1 
i ordered the voodoo pasta and it was the first time id had really excellent pasta since going gluten free several years ago 1 
mobile phone tools are a must have 1 
i hate movies like that 0 
these are the nicest restaurant owners ive ever come across 1 
really ugly 0 
if that bug never showed up i would have given a 4 for sure but on the other side of the wall where this bug was climbing was the kitchen 0 
the whole experience was underwhelming and i think well just go to ninja sushi next time 0 
once your food arrives its meh 0 
the cast is good 1 
the memories are murky but i can only say that i enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show 1 
there is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again 0 
waited 2 hours never got either of our pizzas as many other around us who came in later did 0 
i cant see how this movie can be an inspiration to anyone to come out or overcome fear and rejection 0 
the least said about the acting the better 0 
leopard print is wonderfully wild 1 
one of the most disappointing aspects is the lack of notable gore 0 
this is a chilly unremarkable movie about an author livingworking in a chilly abstruse culture 0 
your servers suck wait correction our server heimer sucked 0 
from what my dinner companions told meeverything was very fresh with nice texture and taste 1 
if you want healthy authentic or ethic food try this place 1 
i have had this phone for over a year now and i will tell you its not that great 0 
must have been an off night at this place 0 
one of the worst shows of all time 0 
the best electronics of the available fm transmitters 1 
it was a drive to get there 0 
the cast is good 1 
and i just love the colors 1 
best tater tots in the southwest 1 
now you know why i gave it a 10 1 
not good enough for the price 0 
itll be a regular stop on my trips to phoenix 1 
once your food arrives its meh 0 
finally after three or four times the spring of the latch broke and i could not use it any longer on the visor 0 
there arent death scenes like in previous movies and the fx are terrible 0 
friends pasta also bad he barely touched it 0 
great food 1 
both do good jobs and are quite amusing 1 
an extensive menu provides lots of options for breakfast 1 
total brunch fail 0 
this gets a 1 out of 10 simply because theres nothing lower 0 
now you know why i gave it a 10 1 
food quality has been horrible 0 
in addition to having one of the most lovely songs ever written french cancan also boasts one of the cutest leading ladies ever to grace the screen 1 
i dont like this nokia either 0 
if this premise sound stupid thats because it is 0 
the problem was the script 0 
did not like at all 0 
this is a masterful piece of filmmaking with many themes simmering and occasionally boiling over in this warts and all study of the poets bohemian selfindulgent wartime years that span the aerial bombardments of london and the outward tranquillity of a welsh coastal retreat the borderlines between friendship lust and love dedication to art and experience versus practical concerns jealousy rivalry cowardice and egotism versus heroism and selfsacrifice and more 1 
but now i was completely grossed out 0 
i cannot make calls at certain places 0 
all the actors give a wonderful performance especially jennifer rubin as jamie harris who changes from the nervous starlet in the beginning through the strange events she is part of to the cool star 1 
and his subtle connections between the three films are awesome 1 
i had about two bites and refused to eat anymore 0 
this really is how vegas fine dining used to be right down to the menus handed to the ladies that have no prices listed 1 
works well 1 
im a bit disappointed 0 
the majority of the logitech earbud headsets failed 0 
i would not recommend this place 0 
there are massive levels massive unlockable characters its just a massive game 1 
first of all it doesnt wear well 0 
very clear quality sound and you dont have to mess with the sound on your ipod since you have the sound buttons on the headset 1 
on the ground right next to our table was a large smeared beensteppedinandtrackedeverywhere pile of green bird poop 0 
the worst phone ive ever had only had it for a few months 0 
w810i is just superb 1 
i swung in to give them a try but was deeply disappointed 0 
if good intentions made a film great then this film might be one of the greatest films ever made 1 
ive missed numerous calls because of this reason 0 
there is no real plot 0 
i vomited in the bathroom mid lunch 0 
we loved the place 1 
the cinematography is simply stunning to say the least and the fx are nothing if not stateoftheart 1 
a very very very slowmoving aimless movie about a distressed drifting young man 0 
great brunch spot 1 
internet is excrutiatingly slow 0 
if youre not familiar check it out 1 
i got to enjoy the seafood salad with a fabulous vinegrette 1 
the service was not up to par either 0 
i wasnt the least bit interested 0 
they have a really nice atmosphere 1 
the soundtrack sucked 0 
at least think to refill my water before i struggle to wave you over for 10 minutes 0 
unfortunately it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees 0 
easy to use 1 
waste of 13 bucks 0 
good price 1 
the staff was very attentive 1 
spend your money and time some place else 0 
wow loved this place 1 
i did not expect this to be so good 1 
jawbone era is awesome too 1 
worst customer service 0 
painful on the ear 0 
feelings thoughtsgabriels discomfort during the danceall these intangibles leap to life and come within the viewers grasp in hustons portrayal 1 
i gave it 5 stars because of the sound quality 1 
this one is simply a disappointment 0 
the flat reenactments dont hold your attention because they are emotionally adrift and stagy 0 
the acting was bad the dialogs were extremely shallow and insincere 0 
a fantastic neighborhood gem 1 
overall i rate this movie a 10 out of a 110 scale 1 
nargile i think you are great 1 
this product is great it makes working a lot easier i can go to the copier while waiting on hold for something 1 
my sister has one also and she loves it 1 
its practically perfect in all of them  a true masterpiece in a sea of faux masterpieces 1 
what makes this story different are the terrific production values faultless photography composition and editing the terrific casting the underappreciated brian keith playing a bully teddy and vivid history 1 
works great 1 
first time there and might just be the last 0 
great for ipods too 1 
the only thing really worth watching was the scenery and the house because it is beautiful 1 
also difficult to put onid recommend avoiding this product 0 
the handsfree part works fine but then the car tries to download the address book and the treo rebootsoverall i still rate this device high 1 
the film is well paced understated and one of the best courtroom documentaries ive seen 1 
they keep getting better and better this is my third one and ive had numerous palms too 1 
highly entertaining at all angles 1 
barney is definitely super de duper 1 
not a weekly haunt but definitely a place to come back to every once in a while 1 
great for ipods too 1 
it wasnt busy at all and now we know why 0 
i guess i liked the details of his dysfunctionhe was believable 1 
the movie lacks visual interest drama expression of feeling and celebration of the very patriotism that underlines the narrative 0 
a piece of junk that broke after being on my phone for 2 days 0 
call me a nut but i think this is one of the best movies ever 1 
strike 2 who wants to be rushed 0 
interesting decor 1 
well never go again 0 
someone shouldve invented this sooner 1 
the script is a big flawed mess 0 
went in for happy hour great list of wines 1 
the nokia ca42 usb cable did not work with my phone 0 
im big fan of rpg games too but this movie its a disgrace to any selfrespecting rpger there is 0 
lately they have been extremely nice and helpful on the phone 1 
special mention should be made of the superb music score and sound effects which are an integral element in helping to make this such a memorable and enjoyable cartoon 1 
i enjoyed it 1 
not good by any stretch of the imagination 0 
after watching this film i wanted to learn more about the works of this artist 1 
im probably one of the few people to ever go to ians and not like it 0 
very good though 1 
i ordered albondigas soup which was just warm and tasted like tomato soup with frozen meatballs 0 
artless camerawork endlessly presents us with the ugliest setting imaginable ie 0 
dont make the same mistake that i did and please dont buy this phone 0 
nice headset priced right 1 
he cant act one of the least scary villains i have ever seen he cant write did he write this damn movie in his sleep 0 
the waitress was friendly and happy to accomodate for veganveggie options 1 
the volume switch rocketed out of the unit to a destination unknown 0 
wont work right or atleast for me 0 
of course the footage from the 70s was grainy but that only enhanced the film 1 
these headphones were a great find and i think they are perhaps the best purchase ive made in the last several years seriously 1 
the owner used to work at nobu so this place is really similar for half the price 1 
this movie is terrible 0 
this place receives stars for their appetizers 1 
regrettably the film fails 0 
i have two more years left in this contract and i hate this phone 0 
updatewent back for a second time and it was still just as amazing 1 
and if that isnt enough of a mess of a movie for you the picture is also marred with a constant use of studio sets and indoor exteriors 0 
it fits my ear well and is comfortable on 1 
what happened next was prettyoff putting 0 
for that its worth checking out 1 
i highly recommend this device to everyone 1 
im big fan of rpg games too but this movie its a disgrace to any selfrespecting rpger there is 0 
works good 1 
it showed exactly how the government and the scientist argued for humanity and the reasons of the gadget 1 
try them in the airport to experience some tasty food and speedy friendly service 1 
great for the jawbone 1 
in addition to having one of the most lovely songs ever written french cancan also boasts one of the cutest leading ladies ever to grace the screen 1 
hitchcock is a great director 1 
oh yeah and the storyline was pathetic too 0 
the jabra eargels fit my ears very well 1 
the manager was the worst 0 
we wont be going back anytime soon 0 
omelets are to die for 1 
ive seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie 0 
they have great dinners 1 
his losing his marbles so early in the proceedings is totally implausible and unconvincing 0 
even allowing for poor production values for the time 1971 and the format some kind of miniseries this is baaaaaad 0 
there were too many close ups 0 
fantastic food 1 
there is simply no excuse for something this poorly done 0 
this film tries to be a serious and sophisticated thrillerhorror flick and it fails miserably 0 
in the summer you can dine in a charming outdoor patio so very delightful 1 
four stars for the food the guy in the blue shirt for his great vibe still letting us in to eat 1 
if you look for authentic thai food go else where 0 
i hate to disagree with my fellow yelpers but my husband and i were so disappointed with this place 0 
i like design and look of jabra behing the ear headsets and 5020 is pretty comfortible to wear 24 hours a day without pain in the ear 1 
there is a lot of beautiful places 1 
summary the witticisms werent witty 0 
i just cant explain this movie more than romanticcharminghilariousand adorablethe junkyard scenes are funnyall the junkyard dogs have something specialtoo funny i laughedkids will love itbuy it when it comes outit has new features 1 
it always cuts out and makes a beep beep beep sound then says signal failed 0 
i had to wait over 30 minutes to get my drink and longer to get 2 arepas 0 
sam shepards portrayal of a gung ho marine was sobering 1 
the service was meh 0 
what should have been a hilarious yummy christmas eve dinner to remember was the biggest fail of the entire trip for us 0 
the cg opening sequence in space looked like it could have been created on microsoft slideshow for gods sake 0 
the awful dialogue and hopeless overacting by everyone who gets shot top off a real waste of space and time 0 
at around 4 pm i bought it at around 8pm i started to watch at around 815pm i fast forwarded the remaining film to see if there was anything left watchable for a human being with a brain but there wasnt 0 
who in their right mind is gonna buy this battery 0 
uncomfortable in the ear dont use with lg vx9900 env 0 
but whatever it was that cost them so much it didnt translate to quality thats for sure 0 
any ring toneoverall good phone to buy 1 
ample portions and good prices 1 
but she is still a bad actress repeating her robotic face moves in each of her pictures 0 
there is a totally unnecessary trainroller coaster scene 0 
same problem as others have mentioned 0 
i hope this place sticks around 1 
the igo chargers and tips are really great 1 
the instructions didnt explain that a microphone jack could be used 0 
the pancake was also really good and pretty large at that 1 
the restaurant atmosphere was exquisite 1 
wont work right or atleast for me 0 
back to good bbq lighter fare reasonable pricing and tell the public they are back to the old ways 1 
tasted like dirt 0 
this movie is also revealing 1 
doesnt do the job 0 
why was this film made 0 
the bottowm lineanother worthless cheap gimmick from sprint 0 
the only very disappointing thing was there was no speakerphone 0 
best of luck to the rude and noncustomer service focused new management 0 
but the premise of the film was so ridiculous that the president of the us 0 
god and i can never get that 90 minutes back 0 
before i go in to why i gave a 1 star rating please know that this was my third time eating at bachi burger before writing a review 0 
muddy low quality sound and the casing around the wires insert was poorly super glued and slid off 0 
i am far from a sushi connoisseur but i can definitely tell the difference between good food and bad food and this was certainly bad food 0 
disappointed 0 
long whiny and pointless 0 
they never brought a salad we asked for 0 
they could be used as exemplars for any set designer 1 
i ate there twice on my last visit and especially enjoyed the salmon salad 1 
ill even say it again  this is torture 0 
you share general loewenhielms exquisite joy in his partaking of the cailles en sarcophage even though you are just watching a movie but you do wish for just a small sample to savor 1 
same problem as others have mentioned 0 
how stupid is that 0 
by far the best cheesecurds we have ever had 1 
highly recommended 1 
im a bit disappointed 0 
mediocre food 0 
great case and price 1 
with the originality and freshness of the first movie now spent this remake had little else to offer 0 
i came back today since they relocated and still not impressed 0 
it was that year however that reminded us that huston was still at the top of his game as evinced by his faithful adaptation of james joyces acclaimed novella the dead 1 
if there was ever a movie that needed wordofmouth to promote this is it 1 
this is infuriating 0 
the movie seemed a little slow at first 0 
lets start with all the problemsthe acting especially from the lead professor was very very bad 0 
their daily specials are always a hit with my group 1 
fantastic earphones 1 
jamie foxx absolutely is ray charles 1 
the only downside is the service 0 
the microphone also works well but according to people i have called it applifies everything 1 
every time he opened his mouth you expect to hear you see kids pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show 0 
it deserves strong love 1 
the battery is working well as a replacement for the original that came with the phone over 2 years ago 1 
the cow tongue and cheek tacos are amazing 1 
i love this phone it is very handy and has a lot of features 1 
probably not in a hurry to go back 0 
really pleased with this product so far 1 
this place is overpriced not consistent with their boba and it really is overpriced 0 
it is very educational for children 1 to 8 years old 1 
i went on motorolas website and followed all directions but could not get it to pair again 0 
overall i was not impressed and would not go back 0 
it doesnt make you look cool 0 
the first time i ever came here i had an amazing experience i still tell people how awesome the duck was 1 
i would recommend saving room for this 1 
the food sucked which we expected but it sucked more than we could have imagined 0 
case was more or less an extra that i originally put on but later discarded because it scratched my ear 0 
the restaurant atmosphere was exquisite 1 
the ri style calamari was a joke 0 
too bad cause i know its family owned i really wanted to like this place 0 
i am a fan of his this movie sucked really bad 0 
the food was very good 1 
totally different with loads of understatement and black comedy this is a film few get to see but those who do will remember it 1 
this phone is very fast with sending any kind of messages and web browsing is significantly faster than previous phones i have used 1 
putting the race card aside lets look at the major flaw in the film they destroy latifas character 0 
i could care less the interior is just beautiful 1 
no actress has been worse used that june allison in this movie 0 
gotta love those closeups of slimy drooling teeth 1 
when i placed my treo into the case not only was it not snug but there was a lot of extra room on the sides 0 
we literally sat there for 20 minutes with no one asking to take our order 0 
the worst one of the series 0 
also its a real treat to see anthony quinn playing crazy horse 1 
initially the local sites in the film which was filmed here in buffalo intrigued me 1 
this really is how vegas fine dining used to be right down to the menus handed to the ladies that have no prices listed 1 
the food sucked which we expected but it sucked more than we could have imagined 0 
the bartender was also nice 1 
20th century foxs road house 1948 is not only quite a silly noir but is an implausible unmitigated bore of a movie 0 
the sergeant pepper beef sandwich with auju sauce is an excellent sandwich as well 1 
hayao miyazakis latest and eighth film for studio ghibili gake no ue no ponyo ponyo on the cliff by the sea is a wonderfully fun and imaginative look at childhood 1 
honeslty it didnt taste that fresh 0 
their regular toasted bread was equally satisfying with the occasional pats of butter mmmm 1 
it was just not a fun experience 1 
i go to far too many places and ive never seen any restaurant that serves a 1 egg breakfast especially for 400 0 
dont buy this product it fails 0 
it was that year however that reminded us that huston was still at the top of his game as evinced by his faithful adaptation of james joyces acclaimed novella the dead 1 
it was either too cold not enough flavor or just bad 0 
price is good too 1 
best tacos in town by far 1 
great place to eat reminds me of the little mom and pop shops in the san francisco bay area 1 
ryans bar is definitely one edinburgh establishment i wont be revisiting 0 
worthless product 0 
however this didnt make up for the fact that overall this was a tremendously boring movie 0 
a film not easily forgotten 1 
we have tried 2 units and they both failed within 2 months pros 0 
its a little geeky but i think thats its sex on toast and it rocks and oozes sex right down to its battery embedded sleek stylish leather case 1 
of course the footage from the 70s was grainy but that only enhanced the film 1 
cant store anything but phone numbers to sim 0 
horrible phone 0 
this is the place where i first had pho and it was amazing 1 
the acting was bad the dialogs were extremely shallow and insincere 0 
in the span of an hour i had two people exclaim whoa is that the new phone on tv 1 
there is a lot of beautiful places 1 
the kids are annoying 0 
in fact i liked it better than interview with a vampire and i liked this lestat stuart townsend better than cruises attempt 1 
a piece of junk that broke after being on my phone for 2 days 0 
motorola finally got the voice quality of a bluetooth headset right 1 
unfortunately this is a bad movie that is just plain bad 0 
2 times very bad customer service 0 
the cinematography is simply stunning to say the least and the fx are nothing if not stateoftheart 1 
they do not care about the consumer one bit 0 
first of all it doesnt wear well 0 
waste of 13 bucks 0 
brilliance indeed 1 
this is definitely one of the better documentaries i have seen looking at family relationships and marriage 1 
i especially liked the noncliche choices with the parents in other movies i could predict the dialog verbatim but the writing in this movie made better selections 1 
it is simple to use and i like it 1 
i wont spoil it but the ending in pretty amazing 1 
the han nan chicken was also very tasty 1 
in an interesting part of town this place is amazing 1 
this movie is excellentangel is beautiful and scamp is adorablehis little yelps when hes scaredand the funniest parts are whenscamp is caught under the curtain and when angel and scamp are singing ive never had this feeling beforei totally recommend this movieits coming out on special edition on june 20the cover has scamp on a garbage can and angel underneath the lid 1 
this is one of the worst sandra bullock movie since speed 2 but not quite that bad 0 
at first i thought i was grtting a good deal at 744 until i plugged it into my phone v3c razr 0 
if you simply want a small flip phone look elsewhere as the extra bells whistles are mediocre 0 
the shower area is outside so you can only rinse not take a full shower unless you dont mind being nude for everyone to see 0 
by the time the film ended i not only disliked it i despised it 0 
the performances are real and gripping the crocdodile is extremely well done indeed if the black water website is to be believed thats because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous 1 
greatno problems at all 1 
great case and price 1 
when achille and philippa beautifully sing a duet from don giovanni that perfectly describes their situation in the movie you appreciate the subtle layers of this excellent film 1 
frankly after cotton club and unfaithful it was kind of embarrassing to watch lane and gere in this film because it is bad 0 
bland not a liking this place for a number of reasons and i dont want to waste time on bad reviewing ill leave it at that 0 
favorite place in town for shawarrrrrrma 1 
this film highlights the fundamental flaws of the legal process that its not about discovering guilt or innocence but rather is about who presents better in court 1 
unfortunately cover girl is an example of how hollywood used to exploit women for financial gain 0 
the service was terrible food was mediocre 0 
seriously its not worth wasting your or your kids time on 0 
excellent starter wireless headset 0 
secondly hitchcock pretty much perfected the thriller and chase movie 1 
even in my bmw 3 series which is fairly quiet i have trouble hearing what the other person is saying 0 
i would avoid this place if you are staying in the mirage 0 
i paid the bill but did not tip because i felt the server did a terrible job 0 
customer service was terrible 0 
the acting is terrible and the writing is worse 0 
never been to hard rock casino before will never ever step forward in it again 0 
i saw this film over christmas and what a great film it was 1 
the loudspeaker option is great the bumpers with the lights is very appealing 0 
the waitress and manager are so friendly 1 
it has all the features i want 1 
the place was fairly clean but the food simply wasnt worth it 0 
the steak and the shrimp are in my opinion the best entrees at gc 1 
rip off over charge shipping 0 
best of all is the rotating feature very helpful 1 
this is the place where i first had pho and it was amazing 1 
great product and price 1 
the design is very odd as the ear clip is not very comfortable at all 0 
anyway the plot flowed smoothly and the malebonding scenes were a hoot 1 
great food and service huge portions and they give a military discount 1 
the plug did not work very well 0 
wed definitely go back here again 1 
the whole experience was underwhelming and i think well just go to ninja sushi next time 0 
bela lugosi was totally extraneous intoning odd lines 0 
my headset works just peachykeen 1 
weve have gotten a much better service from the pizza place next door than the services we received from this restaurant 0 
think it over when you plan to own this onethis sure is the last moto phone for me 0 
great it was new packaged nice works good no problems and it came in less time then i expected 1 
do not buy for d807wrongly advertised for d807 0 
in my house i was getting dropped coverage upstairs and no coverage in my basement 0 
i advise everyone do not be fooled 0 
weve tried to like this place but after 10 times i think were done with them 0 
it was delicious 1 
cumbersome design 0 
the service was not up to par either 0 
they could serve it with just the vinaigrette and it may make for a better overall dish but it was still very good 1 
other than that the leather is nice and soft the fit is very tight the cut out for the face is a good shape 1 
unfortunately it will not recharge my iphone 4s despite connecting it from multiple power sources imac external battery wall outlet etc 0 
it sure does beat the nachos at the movies but i would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant 0 
i let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this bad idea we both hated it 0 
classywarm atmosphere fun and fresh appetizers succulent steaks baseball steak 1 
this is a great phone 1 
really good product 1 
it was a great phone 1 
the jabra eargels fit my ears very well 1 
to those who find this movie intelligent or even masterful i can only say its your intelligence and your imagination you obviously used to try and make some sense of this pitiful attempt its in our human nature to try and make sense of things 0 
dont waste your money 0 
the bt headset was such a disapoinment 0 
i recently tried caballeros and i have been back every week since 1 
spend your money elsewhere 0 
the only very disappointing thing was there was no speakerphone 0 
nice quality build unlike some cheap s out there 1 
it is light easy to use and has very clear reception and transmission 1 
avoid this establishment 0 
comfort for our whole family 1 
last night was my second time dining here and i was so happy i decided to go back 1 
my sister has one also and she loves it 1 
service is quick and friendly 1 
i believe that this place is a great stop for those with a huge belly and hankering for sushi 1 
i was sitting in my vehicle with the cradle on my belt and the headset lost signal 0 
great earpiece 1 
this is a masterful piece of filmmaking with many themes simmering and occasionally boiling over in this warts and all study of the poets bohemian selfindulgent wartime years that span the aerial bombardments of london and the outward tranquillity of a welsh coastal retreat the borderlines between friendship lust and love dedication to art and experience versus practical concerns jealousy rivalry cowardice and egotism versus heroism and selfsacrifice and more 1 
the menu had so much good stuff on it i could not decide 1 
the warm beer didnt help 0 
i wish i could return the unit and get back my money 0 
i wish i could return the unit and get back my money 0 
the dialogue sucked 0 
these are the central themes of the film and they are handled ineptly stereotypically and with no depth of imagination 0 
the music in the film is really nice too 1 
a good commentary of todays love and undoubtedly a film worth seeing 1 
i am so tired of clichés that is just lazy writing and here they come in thick and fast 0 
amazon sucks 0 
it was so bad i had lost the heart to finish it 0 
i tried the cape cod ravoli chickenwith cranberrymmmm 1 
phone falls out easily 0 
im not eating here 0 
i ordered the voodoo pasta and it was the first time id had really excellent pasta since going gluten free several years ago 1 
this item is great installed it let it charged up overnite and it has been working good every since with no problems 1 
after two i felt disgusting 0 
first of all there are enough racial stereotypes and racial jokes to offend everyone 0 
yes this film does require a rather significant amount of puzzlesolving but the pieces fit together to create a beautiful picture 1 
so there is no way for me to plug it in here in the us unless i go by a converter 0 
worthless product 0 
yet i enjoy watching it 1 
poor quality 0 
just what i wanted 1 
i love this phone it is very handy and has a lot of features 1 
excellent dualpurpose headset 1 
20th century foxs road house 1948 is not only quite a silly noir but is an implausible unmitigated bore of a movie 0 
ive never been treated so bad 0 
i love the pho and the spring rolls oh so yummy you have to try 1 
waited and waited and waited 0 
honeslty it didnt taste that fresh 0 
this is cool because most cases are just open there allowing the screen to get all scratched up 1 
excellent sound quality 1 
this movie totally grates on my nerves 0 
wasted two hours 0 
you cant relate with them hell you barely can understand them 0 
but when someone strives for greatness and poetry but delivers a muddled and often ridiculous story a bunch of disparate scenes pretentious dialogue then you get the worst kind of a movie that some other reviewer very accurately defined as pretentious crap 0 
the construction of the headsets is poor 0 
we are sending it back 0 
this was my first and only vegas buffet and it did not disappoint 1 
i think this restaurant suffers from not trying hard enough 0 
the characters are interesting and you really care for them 1 
i was bored throughout the whole damn thing 0 
and i really did find them funny 1 
do not waste your time 0 
i am very happy 1 
same evening him and i are both drastically sick 0 
its a campy sort of film thats a joy to watch 1 
it feels poorly constructed the menus are difficult to navigate and the buttons are so recessed that it is difficult to push them 0 
updatewent back for a second time and it was still just as amazing 1 
best breakfast buffet 1 
none of the three sizes they sent with the headset would stay in my ears 0 
also makes it easier to hold on to 1 
and if that isnt enough of a mess of a movie for you the picture is also marred with a constant use of studio sets and indoor exteriors 0 
very disappointing 0 
kind of hard to mess up a steak but they did 0 
long whiny and pointless 0 
third the cheese on my friends burger was cold 0 
even when the women finally show up there is no sign of improvement the most expected things happen and by the time the film is over you might be far asleep 0 
i hate writing bad reviews about films especially those in which i really like the star but this film is so bad i dont believe for one second that anyone could have been proud of it 0 
a lot of websites have been rating this a very good phone and so do i 1 
fits comfortably came with three sizes of earbud tips 1 
kris kristoffersen is good in this movie and really makes a difference 1 
think of the film being like a dream 1 
the potato chip order was sad i could probably count how many chips were in that box and it was probably around 12 0 
a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it 1 
the plug did not work very well 0 
almost everyone involved must be return to school acting is utterly predictable and bad script is pile of garbage all round 0 
i waited and waited 0 
i highly recommend these and encourage people to give them a try 1 
emily watsons character is very strong and she has only to give a quick glance and you understand everything 1 
my friend loved the salmon tartar 1 
audio quality is poor very poor 0 
a happy wonderful feel good ending 1 
the sound is clear and the people i talk to on it are amazed at the quality too 1 
owners are really great people 1 
very disappointing 0 
i would recommend it 1 
it was quite comfortable in the ear 1 
the sweet potato fries were very good and seasoned well 1 
using all earpieces left or right this thing will not stay on my ear 0 
it felt too light and tinny 0 
which has more depth and character than the man underneath it 0 
the greek dressing was very creamy and flavorful 1 
it is indescribably the most annoying and idiotic show i have ever seen 0 
not much seafood and like 5 strings of pasta at the bottom 0 
it felt too light and tinny 0 
so there is no way for me to plug it in here in the us unless i go by a converter 0 
pricing is a bit of a concern at mellow mushroom 0 
i still maintain that monkeys shouldnt make headphones we just obviously dont share enough dna to copy the design over to humans 0 
my fella got the huevos rancheros and they didnt look too appealing 0 
youll love it 1 
food was really boring 0 
they do not last forever but is not overly expensive to replaceeasy to operate and the sound is much better than others i have tried 1 
great price too 1 
price is good too 1 
the best place in vegas for breakfast just check out a sat or sun 1 
the ngage is still lacking in earbuds 0 
the roast beef sandwich tasted really good 1 
good item low price 1 
i could barely stomach the meal but didnt complain because it was a business lunch 0 
my order was not correct 0 
the directing seems too pretentious 0 
the acting is terrible and the writing is worse 0 
phone is sturdy as all nokia bar phones are 1 
i struggle to find anything bad to say about it 1 
the camera on the phone may be used as a dustpan when indoors id rather be using a disposable then this 0 
crust is not good 0 
it isnt even an achievement as a sobaditsgood or sobaditsmemorable movie 0 
very bad performance plays angela bennett a computer expert who is at home all the time 0 
really pleased with this product so far 1 
but now i was completely grossed out 0 
then i had to continue pairing it periodically since it somehow kept dropping 0 
this convention never worked well in the past and certainly doesnt work here 0 
id like to return it 0 
despite the pans of reviewers i liked this movie 1 
it is worth the drive 1 
seriously killer hot chai latte 1 
poor talk time performance 0 
overall a great experience 1 
pretty good beer selection too 1 
i love that they put their food in nice plastic containers as opposed to cramming it in little paper takeout boxes 1 
an absolute must visit 1 
oh yeah and the storyline was pathetic too 0 
i never come again 0 
comfortable fit you need your headset to be comfortable for at least an hour at a time if not for an entire day 1 
bad fit way too big 0 
regardless the film fails on most levels 0 
lange had become a great actress 1 
this is definitely one of the better documentaries i have seen looking at family relationships and marriage 1 
i love this cable it allows me to connect any miniusb device to my pc 1 
is pretty funny 1 
you wont regret it 1 
good value great food great service 1 
thanks good a movie like this was done and released 1 
my experience was terrible this was my fourth bluetooth headset and while it was much more comfortable than my last jabra which i hated 0 
it is light has plenty of battery capacity and is very confortable to wear for somewhat extended periods of time 1 
it was a good thing that the tickets only cost five dollars because i would be mad if id have paid 750 to see this crap 0 
i received my orders well within the shipping timeframe everything was in good working order and overall i am very excited to have this source 1 
i just saw this film and i recommend it 1 
lightweight and works well 1 
the service was outshining i definitely recommend the halibut 1 
the movie is terribly boring in places 0 
the portion was huge 1 
the volume for the ringer is real good you have choices how loud 1 
i totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is 1 
the food was excellent and service was very good 1 
sweetest phone 1 
weve have gotten a much better service from the pizza place next door than the services we received from this restaurant 0 
i believe the screenwriter did a good job of tying up the loose ends 1 
in fact this stinker smells like a directtovideo release 0 
this phone is pretty sturdy and ive never had any large problems with it 1 
car charger as well as ac charger are included to make sure you never run out of juicehighy recommended 1 
the acting from all involved and that includes those like shatner and nimoy is bad and washed out and making them seem as old as they look in real life the special effects are tacky like when spock has to rescue kirk on a jet pack when he falls down from a mountain 0 
we got the food and apparently they have never heard of salt and the batter on the fish was chewy 0 
ive had this for nearly 2 years and it has worked great for me 1 
yet plantronincs continues to use the same flawed charger design 0 
it didnt work people can not hear me when i talk 0 
i do love sushi but i found kabuki to be overpriced overhip and underservices 0 
food arrived quickly 1 
comfortable fit you need your headset to be comfortable for at least an hour at a time if not for an entire day 1 
good food good service 1 
the eargels channel the sound directly into your ear and seem to increase the sound volume and clarity 1 
the budget was evidently very limited 0 
this is a witty and delightful adaptation of the dr seuss book brilliantly animated by upas finest and thoroughly deserving of its academy award 1 
dessert panna cotta was amazing 1 
the stories were as unbelievable as the actors 0 
steve martin delivers a really funny performance of a middleaged upper class uptight white guy 1 
this film tries to be a serious and sophisticated thrillerhorror flick and it fails miserably 0 
the movie was very interesting from beginning to the end 1 
lastly the mozzarella sticks they were the best thing we ordered 1 
horrible 0 
i am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this 1 
full of unconvincing cardboard characters it is blandly written by edward chodorov who also produced and is surprisingly directed by jean negulesco from whom one would expect a great deal more 0 
i would avoid this place if you are staying in the mirage 0 
also if your phone is dropped this case is not going to save it specially when dropped face down 0 
they are so cool 1 
its a campy sort of film thats a joy to watch 1 
great atmosphere friendly and fast service 1 
what a mistake that was 0 
o my gosh the best phone i have ever had 1 
the food was outstanding and the prices were very reasonable 1 
i think that it is a must see older john wayne film 1 
this is a great phone 1 
its just lame 0 
the cast is always entertaining as usual 1 
would not recommend to others 0 
it works 1 
the pizza tasted old super chewy in not a good way 0 
i am very happy 1 
if you havent choked in your own vomit by the end by all the cheap drama and worthless dialogue youve must have bored yourself to death with this waste of time 0 
last night was my second time dining here and i was so happy i decided to go back 1 
the worst piece of crap ever along with the verizon customer service 0 
dont bother go to the store 0 
actually the graphics were good at the time 1 
nothing short of magnificent photographycinematography in this film 1 
the cinematographyif it can be called thatsucked 0 
the chicken wings contained the driest chicken meat i have ever eaten 0 
an hour seriously 0 
i know he was a contract player with little control over his scripts but the acting was as bad as the script 0 
battery lasts only a few hours 0 
my breakfast was perpared great with a beautiful presentation of 3 giant slices of toast lightly dusted with powdered sugar 1 
linked to my phone without effort 1 
poor talk time performance 0 
this place should honestly be blown up 0 
it wasnt busy either also the building was freezing cold 0 
the yellowtail carpaccio was melt in your mouth fresh 1 
everything about this product is wrongfirst 0 
i go to far too many places and ive never seen any restaurant that serves a 1 egg breakfast especially for 400 0 
the concert sequences just sucked 0 
so badwellits just bad 0 
macbeth jason connery moved me to tears with his final monolog out brief candle outhe gave the sphere of moral decay and dark forces a human face which makes it the more interesting 1 
its too bad that everyone else involved didnt share crowes level of dedication to quality for if they did wed have a far better film on our hands than this subpar mess 0 
also difficult to put onid recommend avoiding this product 0 
this company charge me a restocking fee and still not given me my refund back 0 
if you havent choked in your own vomit by the end by all the cheap drama and worthless dialogue youve must have bored yourself to death with this waste of time 0 
great place fo take out or eat in 1 
babie bop is very cute 1 
the wind and the lion is well written and superbly acted 1 
i had high hopes for this place since the burgers are cooked over a charcoal grill but unfortunately the taste fell flat way flat 0 
i could care less the interior is just beautiful 1 
it is super charged up for use as a small hybrid palmtopcameracellphone and excels in those roles 1 
the chains which im no fan of beat this place easily 0 
left very frustrated 0 
when my mom and i got home she immediately got sick and she only had a few bites of salad 0 
first of all it doesnt wear well 0 
obviously they have a terrible customer service so you get what you pay for 0 
i give it 2 thumbs down 0 
i was disgusted because i was pretty sure that was human hair 0 
better than youd expect 1 
dont waste your money 0 
in conclusion i will not bother with this movie because a volcano in los angeles is nothing but nonsense 0 
what should have been a hilarious yummy christmas eve dinner to remember was the biggest fail of the entire trip for us 0 
the shrimp tender and moist 1 
the greek dressing was very creamy and flavorful 1 
but it is great i would really recommend it 1 
disappointed 0 
it worked very well 1 
it is so small and you dont even realize that it is there after a while of getting used to it 1 
every thing on phone work perfectly she like it 1 
my girlfriends veal was very bad 0 
very comfortable 1 
i enjoyed it 1 
never been to hard rock casino before will never ever step forward in it again 0 
really pleased with this product so far 1 
i checked everywhere and there is no feature for it which is really disappointing 0 
unfortunately inexperience of direction meant that scene after scene passed with little in the way of dramatic tension or conflict 0 
i love the scream movies and all horror movies and this one ranks way up there 1 
i got it because it was so small and adorable 1 
four stars for the food the guy in the blue shirt for his great vibe still letting us in to eat 1 
i have had mine for about a year and this christmas i bought some for the rest of the family 1 
after watching this film i wanted to learn more about the works of this artist 1 
this is hands down the best phone ive ever had 1 
you need two hands to operate the screenthis software interface is decade old and cannot compete with new software designs 0 
what a waste of money and time 0 
the bathrooms are clean and the place itself is well decorated 1 
this is truly an art movieit actually has a lot of art in it 1 
for 40 bucks a head i really expect better food 0 
the first thing that happened was that the tracking was off 0 
for the price this was a great deal 1 
there still are good actors around 1 
this is a chilly unremarkable movie about an author livingworking in a chilly abstruse culture 0 
its an empty hollow shell of a movie 0 
the veggitarian platter is out of this world 1 
ive bought 5 wired headphones that sound better than these 0 
krussel always good 1 
the han nan chicken was also very tasty 1 
lightweight and works well 1 
the cocktails are all handmade and delicious 1 
this pair of headphones is the worst that i have ever had soundwise 0 
when a song could explain the emotions of the subjects better such as when jay adams unfortunate life was a subject of talk the song old man by neil young was played which evokes many emotions 1 
it really is impressive that the place hasnt closed down 0 
its really easy 1 
i dont think i will be back for a very long time 0 
those phones are working just fine now 1 
ive had this for nearly 2 years and it has worked great for me 1 
this is a great phone 1 
it was probably dirt 0 
the plantains were the worst ive ever tasted 0 
a world better than 95 of the garbage in the theatres today 1 
the plug did not work very well 0 
overall i was not impressed and would not go back 0 
youll love it 1 
the sides are delish mixed mushrooms yukon gold puree white corn beateous 1 
oh yeah and the storyline was pathetic too 0 
doesnt last long 0 
iam very pleased with my purchase 1 
delicious and i will absolutely be back 1 
crostini that came with the salad was stale 0 
went in for happy hour great list of wines 1 
it was packed 0 
tom wilkinson broke my heart at the end and everyone elses judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike 1 
took an hour to get our food only 4 tables in restaurant my food was luke warm our sever was running around like he was totally overwhelmed 0 
good food good service 1 
yet i enjoy watching it 1 
my side greek salad with the greek dressing was so tasty and the pita and hummus was very refreshing 1 
the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach 0 
the service here is fair at best 0 
easy to use 1 
also were served hot bread and butter and home made potato chips with bacon bits on topvery original and very good 1 
i was sitting in my vehicle with the cradle on my belt and the headset lost signal 0 
and the sound quality is great 1 
great headset very impressed h500 1 
they brought a fresh batch of fries and i was thinking yay something warm but no 0 
great place to relax and have an awesome burger and beer 1 
do not waste your time 0 
a happy wonderful feel good ending 1 
probably never coming back and wouldnt recommend it 0 
hell no will i go back 0 
plus its only 8 bucks 1 
i agree with jessica this movie is pretty bad 0 
very disappointing 0 
the story is also both funny and poignant at times 1 
very very fun chef 1 
the acting as youd expect from this cast is top notch 1 
its a great tool for entertainment communication and data managementoh be sure to use activesync 42 for optimal data synchronization results 1 
they have a really nice atmosphere 1 
i would recommend it 1 
i loved it it was really scary 1 
the cast is always entertaining as usual 1 
the malta settings are as dry and as barren as the dialogue 0 
the only suspense i was feeling was the frustration at just how retarded the girls were 0 
loved itfriendly servers great food wonderful and imaginative menu 1 
frozen pucks of disgust with some of the worst people behind the register 0 
there were too many close ups 0 
this is such a fun and funny movie 1 
the two main characters may be two of the most believable children i ever saw put on screen 1 
we had a group of 70 when we claimed we would only have 40 and they handled us beautifully 1 
all of the main players are mesmerising 1 
what a mistake that was 0 
i couldnt think of a better way to end the film but a smile on my face great way to wrap up an amazing film and trilogy 1 
the only thing that i think could improve is the sound leaks out from the headset 0 
as for the service i thought it was good 1 
piece of junk 0 
the building itself seems pretty neat the bathroom is pretty trippy but i wouldnt eat here again 0 
highly entertaining at all angles 1 
the acting sucked 0 
the worst was the salmon sashimi 0 
i had a seriously solid breakfast here 1 
ive had better not only from dedicated boba tea spots but even from jenni pho 0 
the grilled chicken was so tender and yellow from the saffron seasoning 1 
worst ever 0 
yes i am simplifying things here for the sake of brevity for this really is at the core of the problems with this film it has too much going on without any real fulfilling explanation 0 
this is a great restaurant at the mandalay bay 1 
the headsets are easy to use and everyone loves them 1 
the chains which im no fan of beat this place easily 0 
the folks at otto always make us feel so welcome and special 1 
i wont say any more i dont like spoilers so i dont want to be one but i believe this film is worth your time 1 
the servers are not pleasant to deal with and they dont always honor pizza hut coupons 0 
it was so bad i had lost the heart to finish it 0 
the guys all had steaks and our steak loving son who has had steak at the best and worst places said it was the best steak hes ever eaten 1 
im very disappointed with my decision 0 
my friend did not like his bloody mary 0 
its the best headset i have used 1 
everyone is very attentive providing excellent customer service 1 
and i really did find them funny 1 
i own a jabra earset and was very happy with it but the sound quality especially outgoing on this is better 1 
comfortable nice range good battery life 1 
worst customer service ever 0 
cumbersome design 0 
its quite simply the highest most superlative form of cinema imaginable 1 
its pretty easy 1 
if you do go see this movie bring a pillow or a girlfriendboyfriend to keep you occupied through out 0 
go to place for gyros 1 
the worst was the salmon sashimi 0 
went for lunch service was slow 0 
as for the killer dont expect anything original or even remotely frightening 0 
the chains which im no fan of beat this place easily 0 
if you simply want a small flip phone look elsewhere as the extra bells whistles are mediocre 0 
really good product 1 
you learn a lot about the real inside emotions of people in this movie and a lot about the movie business itself 1 
this is one of peter watkins most accessible films 1 
its still wild stuff though and is highly recommended to fans of giallo cinema 1 
very unreliable service from tmobile 0 
battery has no life 0 
i still maintain that monkeys shouldnt make headphones we just obviously dont share enough dna to copy the design over to humans 0 
rip off over charge shipping 0 
try them in the airport to experience some tasty food and speedy friendly service 1 
i probably wont be coming back here 0 
what a mistake 0 
good price 1 
the screen size is big key pad lit well enough and the camera quality is excellent for a camera phone 1 
everything stinks 0 
i was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar not only because the quality is great but the service is fast and the food impeccable 1 
the majority of the logitech earbud headsets failed 0 
avoid at all costs 0 
highly entertaining at all angles 1 
i was seated immediately 1 
this was reflected not only in the cast but also in the belowpar script which borrowed much from the earlier classic 0 
great earpiece 1 
using all earpieces left or right this thing will not stay on my ear 0 
while i managed to bend the leaf spring back in place the metal now has enough stress that it will break on the next drop 0 
the cashew cream sauce was bland and the vegetables were undercooked 0 
there are massive levels massive unlockable characters its just a massive game 1 
i would give this television series a 10 plus if i could 1 
verizon tech support walked my through a few procedures none of which worked and i ended up having to do a hard reset wiping out all my data 0 
setup couldnt have been simpler 1 
i would highly recommend this 1 
i will continue to come here on ladies night andddd date night highly recommend this place to anyone who is in the area 1 
extremely tasty 1 
it was so funny 1 
how can anyone in their right mind ask for anything more from a movie than this 1 
this movie is possibly one of the most creative works of horror ever 1 
actually the graphics were good at the time 1 
i cant tell you how disappointed i was 0 
i only hear garbage for audio 0 
it quit working after id used it for about 18 months so i just purchased another one because this is the best headset ive ever owned 1 
but it picked up speed and got right to the point 1 
we had 7 at our table and the service was pretty fast 1 
favorite place in town for shawarrrrrrma 1 
he came running after us when he realized my husband had left his sunglasses on the table 1 
dont waste your time here 0 
the fact is this film is a wonderful heartwarming tale about two people chasing their dreams 1 
its one of the most boring horror movies from the 90s mainly because it starts slow and centers in a boring atmosphere 0 
this totally unfunny movie is so over the top and pathetic and unrealistic that throughout the whole 90 minutes of utter torture i probably looked at my watch about 70000 times 0 
we waited an hour for what was a breakfast i could have done 100 times better at home 0 
as for the service i thought it was good 1 
i really like this product over the motorola because it is allot clearer on the ear piece and the mic 1 
overall the film is interesting and thoughtprovoking 1 
i dont know what the big deal is about this place but i wont be back yaall 0 
the only possible way this movie could be redeemed would be as mst3k fodder 0 
i wasnt expecting oscar material but this 0 
voice recognition is tremendous 1 
id love to go back 1 
great phone 1 
im glad the film didnt go for the most obvious choice as a lesser film certainly would have 1 
the phone loads super 1 
the jerky camera movements were also annoying 0 
w810i is just superb 1 
couldnt figure it out 0 
the memories are murky but i can only say that i enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show 1 
frozen pucks of disgust with some of the worst people behind the register 0 
yes its that bad 0 
great price too 1 
bela lugosi was totally extraneous intoning odd lines 0 
they really want to make your experience a good one 1 
i thought it was bad 0 
characters are onedimensional even the good guys and especially the bad guys 0 
i love this phone 1 
im not impressed with the concept or the food 0 
ive had this for nearly 2 years and it has worked great for me 1 
the story starts too fast with absolutely no suspense or buildup in the slightest 0 
appetite instantly gone 0 
hayao miyazakis latest and eighth film for studio ghibili gake no ue no ponyo ponyo on the cliff by the sea is a wonderfully fun and imaginative look at childhood 1 
it has been a winner for us 1 
still its quite interesting and entertaining to follow 1 
i really hope the team behind this movie makes more movies and that they will continue to do so in their own some kinda weird style 1 
food was really good and i got full petty fast 1 
regardless the film fails on most levels 0 
she ordered a toasted english muffin that came out untoasted 0 
i wasnt the least bit interested 0 
there still are good actors around 1 
lordy the khao soi is a dish that is not to be missed for curry lovers 1 
this scene is very strong and unpleasant 0 
the veggitarian platter is out of this world 1 
i have recommended it to friends 1 
i dont each much pasta but i love the homemade hand made pastas and thin pizzas here 1 
it has kept up very well 1 
car charger as well as ac charger are included to make sure you never run out of juicehighy recommended 1 
the basic premise is wasted since it is sidelined by the inexplicable focus on the documentary crew 0 
worst hour and a half of my lifeoh my gosh 0 
took an hour to get our food only 4 tables in restaurant my food was luke warm our sever was running around like he was totally overwhelmed 0 
only like 3 or 4 buildings used a couple of locations maybe poor hummh 0 
the live music on fridays totally blows 0 
highly recommend for any one who has a blue tooth phone 1 
bad fit way too big 0 
saw the movie today and thought it was a good effort good messages for kids 1 
you can find better movies at youtube 0 
omg the food was delicioso 1 
it was either too cold not enough flavor or just bad 0 
service is quick and even to go orders are just like we like it 1 
people who like european films and art movies will like this movie 1 
im not really sure how joeys was voted best hot dog in the valley by readers of phoenix magazine 0 
however bt headsets are currently not good for real time games like firstperson shooters since the audio delay messes me up 0 
dont waste your time here 0 
not only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic but it also managed to give away the entire movie and im not exaggerating every moment every plot point every joke is told in the trailer 0 
the steaks are all well trimmed and also perfectly cooked 1 
i found this move beautiful enjoyable and uplifting 1 
greatno problems at all 1 
so far so good 1 
a good film by a great director 1 
unfortunately inexperience of direction meant that scene after scene passed with little in the way of dramatic tension or conflict 0 
dont waste your time watching this rubbish nonresearched film 0 
omg i felt like i had never eaten thai food until this dish 1 
does not fit 0 
this movie has a cutting edge to it 1 
theres barely a boring moment in the film and there are plenty of humorous parts 1 
great atmosphere friendly and fast service 1 
my girlfriends veal was very bad 0 
my fiancé and i came in the middle of the day and we were greeted and seated right away 1 
during several different 2 minute calls i experienced 5 drops and it was in an area that had 5 bars 0 
the best place in vegas for breakfast just check out a sat or sun 1 
good value great food great service 1 
the results well are a shame 0 
defective crap 0 
the microphone also works well but according to people i have called it applifies everything 1 
if you have not seen this movie i definitely recommend it 1 
the acting sucks the music sucks the script sucks the pacing sucks the special fx suck the directing sucks basically this movie sucks 0 
this totally unfunny movie is so over the top and pathetic and unrealistic that throughout the whole 90 minutes of utter torture i probably looked at my watch about 70000 times 0 
not good when wearing a hat or sunglasses 0 
the screen does get smudged easily because it touches your ear and face 0 
it was pretty gross 0 
on the negative its insipid enough to cause regret for another 2 hours of life wasted in front of the screen 0 
id advise anyone to go and see it 1 
after a year the battery went completely dead on my headset 0 
the cow tongue and cheek tacos are amazing 1 
the accompanied software is almost brilliant 1 
terrible management 0 
we loved the place 1 
much less than the jawbone i was going to replace it with 1 
the worst phone ive ever had only had it for a few months 0 
the block was amazing 1 
yet plantronincs continues to use the same flawed charger design 0 
this greedy corporation will never see another dime from me 0 
if you love death and decay and shakespears lyrics this is the one 1 
putting the race card aside lets look at the major flaw in the film they destroy latifas character 0 
he was terrible 0 
big disappointment with calendar sync 0 
well never go again 0 
very good though 1 
i wasnt the least bit interested 0 
i kept looking at the time and it had soon become 35 minutes yet still no food 0 
totally different with loads of understatement and black comedy this is a film few get to see but those who do will remember it 1 
5 stars for the brick oven bread app 1 
i wont spoil it but the ending in pretty amazing 1 
nice design and quality 1 
it is very educational for children 1 to 8 years old 1 
spend your money elsewhere 0 
for the price this was a great deal 1 
but kevin spacey is an excellent verbal tsunami as buddy ackerman  and totally believable because he is a great actor 1 
horrible 0 
but when someone strives for greatness and poetry but delivers a muddled and often ridiculous story a bunch of disparate scenes pretentious dialogue then you get the worst kind of a movie that some other reviewer very accurately defined as pretentious crap 0 
garbo who showed right off the bat that her talents could carry over from the silent era i wanted to see some of her silent work but netflix doesnt seem to be stocking them 1 
now i know that i made a wise decision 1 
the food was terrible 0 
cinematography the film was shot in an interesting way 1 
as i said abovepretty useless 0 
however after finally watching this film i realized that not only had i had a closed mind to the brilliance it depicts i also found myself watching it over and over again 1 
i found the product to be easy to set up and use 1 
not a pleasant voyage of selfdiscovery 0 
lately they have been extremely nice and helpful on the phone 1 
i dont think i will be back for a very long time 0 
maybe there would be a reasonable explanation for this atrocity 0 
best ive found so far ive tried 2 other bluetooths and this one has the best quality for both me and the listener as well as ease of using 1 
the design is very odd as the ear clip is not very comfortable at all 0 
a piece of junk that broke after being on my phone for 2 days 0 
i felt as though her going to ireland did absolutely nothing whatsoever 0 
i enjoyed reading this book to my children when they were little 1 
camerawork again bad 0 
the bartender was also nice 1 
the worst piece of crap ever along with the verizon customer service 0 
waste of money 0 
ive bought 5 wired headphones that sound better than these 0 
this is a beautiful phone 1 
i kept catching the cable on the seat and i had to pull the phone out to turn it on an off 0 
cinematography noteworthy including fine views of barcelona and its famed gaudi towers 1 
this film highlights the fundamental flaws of the legal process that its not about discovering guilt or innocence but rather is about who presents better in court 1 
overall the film is interesting and thoughtprovoking 1 
theres really nothing bad i can say about this headset 0 
i got it because it was so small and adorable 1 
say bye bye to your tip lady 0 
yes this film does require a rather significant amount of puzzlesolving but the pieces fit together to create a beautiful picture 1 
the keyboard is a nice compromise between a full qwerty and the basic cell phone number keypad 1 
the staff was very attentive 1 
i had the chicken pho and it tasted very bland 0 
the things that the four kids get themselves into is absolutely hilarious to watch 1 
really awful 0 
paolo sorrentino has written a wonderful story about loneliness and tony has built one of the most unforgettable characters seen in movies in recent years 1 
2 times very bad customer service 0 
not a pleasant voyage of selfdiscovery 0 
i wasted my little money with this earpiece 0 
i will never go back to this place and will never ever recommended this place to anyone 0 
there is however some pretty good acting at least for this type of film 1 
not much dialogue not much music the whole film was shot as elaborately and aesthetically like a sculpture 1 
lordy the khao soi is a dish that is not to be missed for curry lovers 1 
really ugly 0 
im super pissd 0 
what on earth is irons doing in this film 0 
i received it quickly and it works great 1 
it was forced like everything in this movie 0 
the price is reasonable and the service is great 1 
editing the editing of this film was phenomenal in my opinion 1 
this is a good joint 1 
the acting is beyond abysmal 0 
this movie is also revealing 1 
there was hardly any meat 0 
of course the acting is blah 0 
i can think of no other film where something vitally important occurs every other minute 1 
the cast is good 1 
overall i would recommend this phone over the new walkman 1 
the phone was unusable and was not new 0 
the food amazing 1 
i am so pleased to know such a modern day genius is out there letting is passion for art drive him and taking us as an audience with him 1 
think it over when you plan to own this onethis sure is the last moto phone for me 0 
wonderful lil tapas and the ambience made me feel all warm and fuzzy inside 1 
the construction of the headsets is poor 0 
not good when wearing a hat or sunglasses 0 
im surprised this is a good quality car charger and theres not much reviews about it 1 
bluetooth does not work phone locks up screens just flash up and now it just makes calls randomly while in my pocket locked 0 
disappointing accessory from a good manufacturer 0 
both the hot sour the egg flower soups were absolutely 5 stars 1 
i highly recommend this modest priced cellular phone 1 
i am not a filmmaker nor am i a director but i would hide my head in the sand if id spent whatever amount of money and time on this movie 0 
great earpiece 1 
this is a great restaurant at the mandalay bay 1 
waitress was a little slow in service 0 
a fantastic neighborhood gem 1 
great pocket pc phone combination 1 
definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly will return next time im in vegas 1 
it was absolutely amazing 1 
i would have casted her in that role after ready the script 1 
the budget was evidently very limited 0 
worst customer service 0 
very pleased with this headset 1 
the lines the cuts the audio everything is wrong 0 
a drive thru means you do not want to wait around for half an hour for your food but somehow when we end up going here they make us wait and wait 0 
the food is rich so order accordingly 1 
it felt too light and tinny 0 
great steak great sides great wine amazing desserts 1 
i tried the cape cod ravoli chickenwith cranberrymmmm 1 
exactly what i wanted 1 
another thing i didnt really like is when a character got punched in the face a gallon of blood would spew forth soon after 0 
the pizza tasted old super chewy in not a good way 0 
the food is rich so order accordingly 1 
i had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get some relief 0 
i have had this phone for over a year now and i will tell you its not that great 0 
this was a poor remake of my best friends wedding 0 
their onscreen chemistry critical to the entire film is genuine 1 
i own a jabra earset and was very happy with it but the sound quality especially outgoing on this is better 1 
fast service 1 
in the summer you can dine in a charming outdoor patio so very delightful 1 
what a disappointment 0 
even when the women finally show up there is no sign of improvement the most expected things happen and by the time the film is over you might be far asleep 0 
it was that year however that reminded us that huston was still at the top of his game as evinced by his faithful adaptation of james joyces acclaimed novella the dead 1 
bt50 battery junk 0 
logitech bluetooth headset is a 10 1 
all i have to say is the food was amazing 1 
great phone 1 
very very fun chef 1 
it fits my ear well and is comfortable on 1 
however the keypads are so tinny that i sometimes reach the wrong buttons 0 
the jamaican mojitos are delicious 1 
today the graphics are crap 0 
this is high adventure at its best 1 
my drink was never empty and he made some really great menu suggestions 1 
john wayne did an incredible job for being so young in the movie industry 1 
disappointing accessory from a good manufacturer 0 
the story line is just awful 0 
i bought this to use with my kindle fire and absolutely loved it 1 
the warmth it generates is in contrast to its austere backdrop 1 
the meat was pretty dry i had the sliced brisket and pulled pork 0 
the food was barely lukewarm so it must have been sitting waiting for the server to bring it out to us 0 
avoid at all costs 0 
i wish i could return the unit and get back my money 0 
i love this device 1 
i hate those things as much as cheap quality black olives 0 
the acting sucked 0 
not even good for camp value 0 
excellent starter wireless headset 0 
very true to shakespear and a must for all shakespear fans 1 
so anyone near you will hear part of your conversation 0 
looks great and is strong 1 
see it 1 
went for lunch service was slow 0 
really good product 1 
the film gives meaning to the phrase never in the history of human conflict has so much been owed by so many to so few 1 
perfect for the ps3 1 
one of my favorite purchases ever 1 
it was a great phone 1 
audio quality is poor very poor 0 
nice solid keyboard 1 
its a mediocre miserable hollow laughable and predictable piece of garbage 0 
unfortunately cover girl is an example of how hollywood used to exploit women for financial gain 0 
everything from acting to cinematography was solid 1 
favorite place in town for shawarrrrrrma 1 
also makes it easier to hold on to 1 
works for me 1 
this is so embarassing and also my ears hurt if i try to push the ear plug into my ear 0 
think of the film being like a dream 1 
stopped by during the late may bank holiday off rick steve recommendation and loved it 1 
a fantastic neighborhood gem 1 
due to this happening on every call i was forced to stop using this headset 0 
the staff is always super friendly and helpful which is especially cool when you bring two small boys and a baby 1 
a good time 1 
maybe there would be a reasonable explanation for this atrocity 0 
ive missed numerous calls because of this reason 0 
the cast is good 1 
i purchased this and within 2 days it was no longer working 0 
the 12 mega pixel camera being a part of a phone is reasonably good7 1 
terrible management 0 
the charger worked for about a week and then completely stopped charging my phone 0 
this if the first movie ive given a 10 to in years 1 
i have yet to run this new battery below two bars and thats three days without charging 1 
ive owned this phone for 7 months now and can say that its the best mobile phone ive had 1 
the croutons also taste homemade which is an extra plus 1 
it was horrendous 0 
up there with the best of melville 1 
its a little geeky but i think thats its sex on toast and it rocks and oozes sex right down to its battery embedded sleek stylish leather case 1 
i was disgusted because i was pretty sure that was human hair 0 
which is precisely why i am giving it such a bad review 0 
it is not good 0 
avoid this establishment 0 
very disappointing 0 
i still maintain that monkeys shouldnt make headphones we just obviously dont share enough dna to copy the design over to humans 0 
this phone is slim and light and the display is beautiful 1 
ordered an appetizer and took 40 minutes and then the pizza another 10 minutes 0 
pricing is a bit of a concern at mellow mushroom 0 
probably not in a hurry to go back 0 
when i opened the sandwich i was impressed but not in a good way 0 
eew this location needs a complete overhaul 0 
it also took her forever to bring us the check when we asked for it 0 
spend your money elsewhere 0 
small sleek impressive looking practical setup with ample storage in place 1 
this is the phone to get for 2005 i just bought my s710a and all i can say is wow 1 
the range is very decent ive been able to roam around my house with the phone in the living room with no receptionsound quality issues 1 
gotta love those closeups of slimy drooling teeth 1 
bad choice 0 
linksys should have some way to exchange a bad phone for a refurb unit or something 0 
fits comfortably came with three sizes of earbud tips 1 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
i let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this bad idea we both hated it 0 
its like a bad two hour tv movie 0 
10 out of 10 for both the movie and trilogy 1 
con spotty service 0 
the pancake was also really good and pretty large at that 1 
i did not have any problem with this item and would order it again if needed 1 
the acting was bad the dialogs were extremely shallow and insincere 0 
my sanyo has survived dozens of drops on blacktop without ill effect 1 
this is just a great movie 1 
food was below average 0 
i was very pleased to see that i could replace my well travled swivel holster for my blackberry flip 1 
the movie lacks visual interest drama expression of feeling and celebration of the very patriotism that underlines the narrative 0 
the range is very decent ive been able to roam around my house with the phone in the living room with no receptionsound quality issues 1 
jamie foxx absolutely is ray charles 1 
any grandmother can make a roasted chicken better than this one 0 
we have tried 2 units and they both failed within 2 months pros 0 
people couldnt hear me talk and i had to pull out the earphone and talk on the phone 0 
it is well made easy to access the phone and has a handy detachable belt clip 1 
delicious nyc bagels good selections of cream cheese real lox with capers even 1 
the service was terrible though 0 
then i exchanged for the same phone even that had the same problem 0 
i love this thing 1 
i give it 2 thumbs down 0 
never been to hard rock casino before will never ever step forward in it again 0 
it is easy to turn on and off when you are in the car and the volume controls are quite accessable 1 
up there with the best of melville 1 
the lighting is just dark enough to set the mood 1 
the food was excellent and service was very good 1 
chinese forgeries abound 0 
this was like the final blow 0 
the best phone in market 1 
first off the reception sucks i have never had more than 2 bars ever 0 
things that went wrong they burned the saganaki 0 
all in all a great disappointment 0 
the characters were all funny and had the peculiarity of not having a true lead character 1 
damn good steak 1 
it works 1 
restaurant is always full but never a wait 1 
i would give this television series a 10 plus if i could 1 
pretty cool i would say 1 
its practically perfect in all of them  a true masterpiece in a sea of faux masterpieces 1 
ill even say it again  this is torture 0 
some highlights great quality nigiri here 1 
the price is reasonable and the service is great 1 
the shrimp tender and moist 1 
no additional ear gels provided and no instructions whatsoever 0 
phenomenal food service and ambiance 1 
the only downside is the service 0 
the camera on the phone may be used as a dustpan when indoors id rather be using a disposable then this 0 
some may say this buffet is pricey but i think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot 1 
phone now holds charge like it did when it was new 1 
an excellent new restaurant by an experienced frenchman 1 
a standout scene 1 
i have to jiggle the plug to get it to line up right to get decent volume 0 
it wasnt busy at all and now we know why 0 
if this premise sound stupid thats because it is 0 
it dit not work most of the time with my nokia 5320 0 
i hate writing bad reviews about films especially those in which i really like the star but this film is so bad i dont believe for one second that anyone could have been proud of it 0 
bad characters bad story and bad acting 0 
great steak great sides great wine amazing desserts 1 
i was amazed at the quick arrival of the two original lg cell phone batteries and and at a fraction of the price 1 
in short dont bother with this movie 0 
i came back today since they relocated and still not impressed 0 
dessert panna cotta was amazing 1 
my husband and i ate lunch here and were very disappointed with the food and service 0 
these products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet 0 
im so happy to be here 1 
i love this device 1 
an instant classic with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits 1 
its not hard to make a decent hamburger 0 
it is a very well acted and done tv movie 1 
but above all the exquisite visual composition of each moment with inventive and elegant use of closeup camera angle and lighting including pointillistic faux home movie footage is a wonder and joy to behold 1 
it is simple to use and i like it 1 
restored my phone to like new performance 1 
about half way through this film i started to dislike it 0 
the only very disappointing thing was there was no speakerphone 0 
couldnt figure it out 0 
i know he was a contract player with little control over his scripts but the acting was as bad as the script 0 
its fits like a glove and is strong secure and durable 1 
defective crap 0 
when a song could explain the emotions of the subjects better such as when jay adams unfortunate life was a subject of talk the song old man by neil young was played which evokes many emotions 1 
its fits like a glove and is strong secure and durable 1 
helen baxendale is a very credible lady macbeth who can be very cheerfull at times and sometimes she just looks like a naughty girl but deadly in her taste for blood and evil 1 
everything from acting to cinematography was solid 1 
i couldnt think of a better way to end the film but a smile on my face great way to wrap up an amazing film and trilogy 1 
just reading on the specs alone makes you say wow 1 
this case has passed the one year mark and while it shows signs of wear it is 100 functional 1 
definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly will return next time im in vegas 1 
it definitely was not as good as my s11 1 
the food is good 1 
id rather eat airline food seriously 0 
great product 1 
its the one movie that never ceases to interest me simply because it keeps me alert as i try to attempt to decipher its meanings 1 
food was delicious 1 
after watching this film i wanted to learn more about the works of this artist 1 
if only someone involved with it knew how to string together narrative 0 
which is precisely why i am giving it such a bad review 0 
we started with the tuna sashimi which was brownish in color and obviously wasnt fresh 0 
to my disbelief each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods i have ever tasted 0 
our server was very nice and even though he looked a little overwhelmed with all of our needs he stayed professional and friendly until the end 1 
the story is lame not interesting and never really explains the sinister origins of the puppets 0 
omelets are to die for 1 
the only place good for this film is in the garbage 0 
jawbone era is awesome too 1 
the film is well paced understated and one of the best courtroom documentaries ive seen 1 
and the beans and rice were mediocre at best 0 
clear skype calls long battery life long range 1 
overall i was not impressed and would not go back 0 
classywarm atmosphere fun and fresh appetizers succulent steaks baseball steak 1 
it was absolutely amazing 1 
the movie in movie situations in the beginning and through the game that is played with her by the acting coach are fascinating 1 
perabo has a nice energy level and is obviously very comfortable in front of a camera 1 
now we were chosen to be tortured with this disgusting piece of blatant american propaganda 0 
it was a long time that i didnt see a so charismatic actor on screen 1 
10 out of 10 stars 1 
you need two hands to operate the screenthis software interface is decade old and cannot compete with new software designs 0 
the buffet at bellagio was far from what i anticipated 0 
i really enjoyed eating here 1 
there are many continuity errors one other user commented on different cars in the garage joes glassesthe one that got to me the most was the fact joes facial hair configuration seemed to change from scene to scene 0 
see both films if you can 1 
i just wanted to leave 0 
the buffet at bellagio was far from what i anticipated 0 
bad quality 0 
lot of holes in the plot theres nothing about how he became the emperor nothing about where he spend 20 years between his childhood and mature age 0 
also were served hot bread and butter and home made potato chips with bacon bits on topvery original and very good 1 
a lot of websites have been rating this a very good phone and so do i 1 
the food was great as always compliments to the chef 1 
very convenient since we were staying at the mgm 1 
wasted two hours 0 
much less than the jawbone i was going to replace it with 1 
very very disappointed ordered the 35 big bay plater 0 
do not purchase this phone 0 
none of the new ones have ever quite worked properly 0 
poor quality 0 
the opening sequence of this gem is a classic and the cat n mouse games that follow are a delight to watch 1 
excellent service 1 
the best part about nurse betty is its unpredictability 1 
small sleek impressive looking practical setup with ample storage in place 1 
so badwellits just bad 0 
terrible service 0 
disappointment i hate anything that goes in my ear 0 
lordy the khao soi is a dish that is not to be missed for curry lovers 1 
the results well are a shame 0 
it doesnt work in europe or asia 0 
this place is not quality sushi it is not a quality restaurant 0 
this was my first time and i cant wait until the next 1 
the price is reasonable and the service is great 1 
my boyfriend and i sat at the bar and had a completely delightful experience 1 
avoid this establishment 0 
some great music and terrific scenery 1 
theres really nothing bad i can say about this headset 0 
this is one of the best movies out there that shows such strong sibling bond for each other 1 
pretty piece of junk 0 
classywarm atmosphere fun and fresh appetizers succulent steaks baseball steak 1 
excellent starter wireless headset 0 
disappointed 0 
almost everyone involved must be return to school acting is utterly predictable and bad script is pile of garbage all round 0 
all the actors give a wonderful performance especially jennifer rubin as jamie harris who changes from the nervous starlet in the beginning through the strange events she is part of to the cool star 1 
be sure to order dessert even if you need to pack it togo the tiramisu and cannoli are both to die for 1 
hes a national treasure 1 
it was clear that she had the range and ability to pull off this part 1 
this blueant supertooth handsfree phone speaker is awesome 1 
the story which was told so eloquently by francis ford coppola 25 years earlier really unfolds gradually and leaves room for the characters to develop 1 
the soundtrack wasnt terrible either 1 
do not buy for d807wrongly advertised for d807 0 
the scenery that the two daughters paint and photograph are beautiful 1 
the food was very good 1 
its welldesigned and very sharp the blue is a very nice color 1 
in a word it is embarrassing 0 
im big fan of rpg games too but this movie its a disgrace to any selfrespecting rpger there is 0 
kids pizza is always a hit too with lots of great side dish options for the kiddos 1 
not much dialogue not much music the whole film was shot as elaborately and aesthetically like a sculpture 1 
my ribeye steak was cooked perfectly and had great mesquite flavor 1 
i dont think well be going back anytime soon 0 
think it over when you plan to own this onethis sure is the last moto phone for me 0 
in my house i was getting dropped coverage upstairs and no coverage in my basement 0 
on three different occasions i asked for well done or medium well and all three times i got the bloodiest piece of meat on my plate 0 
everyone is treated equally special 1 
im using it with an iriver spinn with case and it fits fine 1 
i purchased this and within 2 days it was no longer working 0 
prosgood camera very nice pictures also has cool styles like black and white and more 1 
overall i am psyched to have a phone which has all my appointments and contacts in and gets great reception 1 
they could be used as exemplars for any set designer 1 
i would advise to not purchase this item it never worked very well 0 
unfortunately any virtue in this films production work was lost on a regrettable script 0 
i left the theater with a lilt in my step joy in my heart and hope for the human race 1 
you wont regret it 1 
better than youd expect 1 
bela lugosi was totally extraneous intoning odd lines 0 
i recently tried caballeros and i have been back every week since 1 
service is friendly and inviting 1 
it features an outlandish array of memorable psychotic but lovable nuts 1 
at first glance it is a lovely bakery cafe nice ambiance clean friendly staff 1 
they are so easy to love but even more easy to identify with 1 
1010 1 
not tasty and the texture was just nasty 0 
this place is handsdown one of the best places to eat in the phoenix metro area 1 
everything was gross 0 
i really do recommend this place you can go wrong with this donut place 1 
i was very excited to get this headset because i thought it was really cute 1 
disappointed with battery 0 
after 20 minutes wait i got a table 0 
food is way overpriced and portions are fucking small 0 
this product is great it makes working a lot easier i can go to the copier while waiting on hold for something 1 
blue ant is easy to use 1 
works as described 1 
the movie is terribly boring in places 0 
i even fully charged it before i went to bed and turned off blue tooth and wifi and noticed that it only had 20 left in the morning 0 
all in all id expected a better consumer experience from motorola 0 
its a case of so bad it is laughable 0 
i was sitting in my vehicle with the cradle on my belt and the headset lost signal 0 
level 5 spicy was perfect where spice didnt overwhelm the soup 1 
at around 4 pm i bought it at around 8pm i started to watch at around 815pm i fast forwarded the remaining film to see if there was anything left watchable for a human being with a brain but there wasnt 0 
it is zillion times away from reality 0 
it holds a charge for a long time is reasonably comfortable under longwearing conditions and the quality of sound is tremendous 1 
only like 3 or 4 buildings used a couple of locations maybe poor hummh 0 
it crackles with an unpredictable youthful energy but honestly i found it hard to follow and concentrate on it meanders so badly 0 
my only problem is i thought the actor playing the villain was a low rent michael ironside 0 
everything about it is fine and reasonable for the price ie 1 
great food and great service in a clean and friendly setting 1 
the problem i have is that they charge 1199 for a sandwich that is no bigger than a subway sub which offers better and more amount of vegetables 0 
i thought it was bad 0 
soyo technology sucks 0 
the bose noise cancelling is amazing which is very important for a nyc commuter 1 
the acting from all involved and that includes those like shatner and nimoy is bad and washed out and making them seem as old as they look in real life the special effects are tacky like when spock has to rescue kirk on a jet pack when he falls down from a mountain 0 
i hate those things as much as cheap quality black olives 0 
do not buy if you want to use the holster 0 
enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film 1 
the lead man is charismafree 0 
a fantastic neighborhood gem 1 
the phone crashed completely and now i have to get it replaced 0 
great headset very impressed h500 1 
also the story and acting were weak 0 
great food 1 
prosgood camera very nice pictures also has cool styles like black and white and more 1 
warning stay away 0 
this scene is very strong and unpleasant 0 
sending it back 0 
logitech bluetooth headset is a 10 1 
his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic 1 
so dont go there if you are looking for good food 0 
best headset ever 1 
incredible 1 
so flavorful and has just the perfect amount of heat 1 
the fries were not hot and neither was my burger 0 
im so sorry but i really cant recommend it to anyone 0 
i really enjoyed eating here 1 
how stupid is that 0 
the characters are interesting and you want to find out more about them the longer the movie goes on and i think people will be surprised by who does and doesnt make it 1 
the phone gets extremely hot 0 
the incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film 1 
this movie creates its own universe and is fascinating in every way 1 
awsome device works great 1 
its so stupid to have to keep buying new chargers car chargers cradles headphones and car kits every time a new phone comes out 0 
i promise they wont disappoint 1 
i like the fact that it rests lightly against your ear rather than inside 1 
it quit working after id used it for about 18 months so i just purchased another one because this is the best headset ive ever owned 1 
love this headset 1 
i dont know what the big deal is about this place but i wont be back yaall 0 
the acting is like watching wooden puppets moving around and reading from a book thats how bad it is 0 
you also cannot take pictures with it in the case because the lense is covered 0 
not recommended 0 
definitely not worth the 3 i paid 0 
the igo chargers and tips are really great 1 
i wont say any more i dont like spoilers so i dont want to be one but i believe this film is worth your time 1 
the songs were the best and the muppets were so hilarious 1 
it was either too cold not enough flavor or just bad 0 
very disappointing 0 
my fiancé and i came in the middle of the day and we were greeted and seated right away 1 
utter crap sound quality is terrible 0 
muddy low quality sound and the casing around the wires insert was poorly super glued and slid off 0 
what i really like there is the crepe station 1 
is it possible for a movie to get any worse than this 0 
tonight i had the elk filet specialand it sucked 0 
today the graphics are crap 0 
very pleased with this headset 1 
tonight i had the elk filet specialand it sucked 0 
poor product 0 
an amazing finale to possibly the best trilogy of all time 1 
the igo chargers and tips are really great 1 
the acting as youd expect from this cast is top notch 1 
gets a signal when other verizon phones wont 1 
their rotating beers on tap is also a highlight of this place 1 
if good intentions made a film great then this film might be one of the greatest films ever made 1 
the directing and the cinematography arent quite as good 0 
speaking of the music it is unbearably predictably and kitchy 0 
the ear buds only play music in one ear 0 
con spotty service 0 
schrader has made a resume full of lousy amateurish films 0 
phone now holds charge like it did when it was new 1 
the presentation of the food was awful 0 
reasonably priced also 1 
unfortunately any virtue in this films production work was lost on a regrettable script 0 
this scene is very strong and unpleasant 0 
loved itfriendly servers great food wonderful and imaginative menu 1 
good prices 1 
the film deserves strong kudos for taking this stand for having exceptional acting from its mostly lesserknown cast and for the superintelligent script that doesnt insult the audience or take the easy way out when it comes to white racism 1 
bt50 battery junk 0 
cute quaint simple honest 1 
omelets are to die for 1 
it is so small and you dont even realize that it is there after a while of getting used to it 1 
this place is way too overpriced for mediocre food 0 
howeverthe riingtones are not the best and neither are the games 0 
none of them are engaging or exciting 0 
is it possible for a movie to get any worse than this 0 
but it wasnt until i watched this film that i realised how great he actually was 1 
one more thing i can tolerate political incorrectness very well im all for artistic freedom and suspension of disbelief but the slavic female character was just too much 0 
im not sure what he was trying to do with this film 0 
buttons are too small 0 
best of luck to the rude and noncustomer service focused new management 0 
the selection of food was not the best 0 
the problem i have is that they charge 1199 for a sandwich that is no bigger than a subway sub which offers better and more amount of vegetables 0 
food was good service was good prices were good 1 
i probably wont be coming back here 0 
all the actors give a wonderful performance especially jennifer rubin as jamie harris who changes from the nervous starlet in the beginning through the strange events she is part of to the cool star 1 
great place to eat reminds me of the little mom and pop shops in the san francisco bay area 1 
my 810 score is mostly for the plot 1 
my husband said she was very rude did not even apologize for the bad food or anything 0 
this short film certainly pulls no punches 0 
i cannot believe that the actors agreed to do this film 0 
saggy floppy piece of junk 0 
im trying to return it for a refund 0 
very prompt service 1 
but when i check voice mail at night the keypad backlight turns off a few seconds into the first message and then im lost 0 
thanks again to amazon for having the things i need for a good price 1 
one of my favorite purchases ever 1 
star trek v the final frontier is the worst in the series 0 
i especially love the long battery life 1 
after the first charge kept going dead after 12 minutes 0 
an excellent new restaurant by an experienced frenchman 1 
do not purchase this phone 0 
its uncomfortable and the sound quality is quite poor compared with the phone razr or with my previous wired headset that plugged into an lg 0 
the service was extremely slow 0 
service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is vegas and located inside the crystals shopping mall by aria 1 
hence the whole story lacks a certain energy 0 
i recently had problems where i could not stay connected for more than 10 minutes before being disconnected 0 
in short dont bother with this movie 0 
it was delicious 1 
low quality 0 
works great 1 
if you havent choked in your own vomit by the end by all the cheap drama and worthless dialogue youve must have bored yourself to death with this waste of time 0 
id rather eat airline food seriously 0 
think it over when you plan to own this onethis sure is the last moto phone for me 0 
its like a bad two hour tv movie 0 
these products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet 0 
he is almost unbearable to watch on screen he has little to no charisma and terrible comedic timing 0 
i wont say any more i dont like spoilers so i dont want to be one but i believe this film is worth your time 1 
its really easy 1 
oh this is such a thing of beauty this restaurant 1 
all it took was one drop from about 6 inches above the kitchen counter and it was crackedi am not impressed and i am not laughing 0 
the stories were as unbelievable as the actors 0 
excellent sound quality 1 
my gyro was basically lettuce only 0 
eclectic selection 1 
the warm beer didnt help 0 
by the time the film ended i not only disliked it i despised it 0 
keep up the good work amazon 1 
oh the charger seems to work fine 1 
seriously its not worth wasting your or your kids time on 0 
good food good service 1 
food was good service was good prices were good 1 
there is no plot or storyline 0 
i mean really how do you get so famous for your fish and chips when its so terrible 0 
id advise anyone to go and see it 1 
it just blew 0 
the ngage is still lacking in earbuds 0 
is pretty funny 1 
very windresistant 1 
but the actingeven that of such professionals as drago and debbie rochonwas terrible the directing worse perhaps contributory to the former the dialog chimplike and the camera work barely tolerable 0 
i saw this short film on hbo the other day and absolutely loved it 1 
its so bad its actually worth seeing just for that reason 0 
the buffet at bellagio was far from what i anticipated 0 
great food and awesome service 1 
they have a really nice atmosphere 1 
this was such an awesome movie that i bought it off of ebay 1 
all of the tapas dishes were delicious 1 
after trying many many handsfree gadgets this is the one that finally works well 1 
makes it easier to keep up with my bluetooth when im not wearing it 0 
but other than that the movie seemed to drag and the heroes didnt really work for their freedom 0 
the presentation of the food was awful 0 
the result is a powerhouse achievement made more timely now perhaps because of our cultures disturbing fascination with celebrity and its distorted interpretations of fame 1 
dont waste your money 0 
this movie was kind of long in length but i enjoyed every minute of it 1 
on a positive note our server was very attentive and provided great service 1 
our server was very nice and even though he looked a little overwhelmed with all of our needs he stayed professional and friendly until the end 1 
i love this phone it is very handy and has a lot of features 1 
a good time 1 
steve martin delivers a really funny performance of a middleaged upper class uptight white guy 1 
this place should honestly be blown up 0 
i kept looking at the time and it had soon become 35 minutes yet still no food 0 
i used bitpim a free program you can find on the internetto transfer data to the phonethe price of the cable was excellent 1 
not what i wanted 0 
today the graphics are crap 0 
the best example of how dumb the writing is when its established that you can turn the zombiestudents back into humans by removing a necklace containing a piece of the meteorite 0 
its like a really sexy party in your mouth where youre outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party 1 
i felt insulted and disrespected how could you talk and judge another human being like that 0 
what a mistake that was 0 
also were served hot bread and butter and home made potato chips with bacon bits on topvery original and very good 1 
i felt as though her going to ireland did absolutely nothing whatsoever 0 
ray charles life provided excellent biographical material for the film which goes well beyond being just another movie about a musician 1 
for those that havent seen it dont waste your time 0 
i believe every one should see this movie as i think few people outside of south africa understand its past and what is being attempted in the truth and reconciliation process 1 
if you are razr owneryou must have this 1 
and those baby owls were adorable 1 
kind of hard to mess up a steak but they did 0 
i got this phone on reccomendation from a relative and im glad i did 1 
the food was outstanding and the prices were very reasonable 1 
however this didnt make up for the fact that overall this was a tremendously boring movie 0 
even when the women finally show up there is no sign of improvement the most expected things happen and by the time the film is over you might be far asleep 0 
the script is horrendously stupid 0 
overall a great experience 1 
which are small and not worth the price 0 
it plays louder than any other speaker of this size the price is so low that most would think the quality is lacking however its not 1 
all this movie does is make you sick watching all these slackers make excuses for their stupid actions for 90 minutes 0 
i cant wait to go back 1 
this movie is also revealing 1 
the bathrooms are clean and the place itself is well decorated 1 
service was exceptional and food was a good as all the reviews 1 
you truly take this journey through the eyes and soul of a child 1 
the restaurant atmosphere was exquisite 1 
the puppets look really cheesy not in a good way like in the puppet master 80s flicks 0 
the movie lacks visual interest drama expression of feeling and celebration of the very patriotism that underlines the narrative 0 
i would advise to not purchase this item it never worked very well 0 
but the actingeven that of such professionals as drago and debbie rochonwas terrible the directing worse perhaps contributory to the former the dialog chimplike and the camera work barely tolerable 0 
better than expected 1 
this pda rocks 1 
good product good seller 1 
like the other reviewer said you couldnt pay me to eat at this place again 0 
the story is lame not interesting and never really explains the sinister origins of the puppets 0 
his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic 1 
plantronics bluetooth excelent buy 1 
10 out of 10 for both the movie and trilogy 1 
the seller is very understanding and patient i would definitely buy from them again 1 
im glad i found this product on amazon it is hard to find it wasnt high priced 1 
why was this film made 0 
the transfers are very good 1 
yes its that bad 0 
dessert panna cotta was amazing 1 
then a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use 0 
it was absolutely amazing 1 
both rickman and stowe play their roles to the hilt in this tale of a childrens book writer who maybe has written a subversive tract 1 
does everything it should and more 1 
i came back today since they relocated and still not impressed 0 
is it possible for a movie to get any worse than this 0 
stopped by during the late may bank holiday off rick steve recommendation and loved it 1 
you wont forget this movie 1 
the battery is completely useless to me 0 
meredith m was better than all right 1 
my drink was never empty and he made some really great menu suggestions 1 
just as good as when i had it more than a year ago 1 
the food wasnt good 0 
totally believable 1 
camerawork again bad 0 
everything about this film is simply incredible 1 
by far the best cheesecurds we have ever had 1 
this is a chilly unremarkable movie about an author livingworking in a chilly abstruse culture 0 
best service and food ever maria our server was so good and friendly she made our day 1 
we ordered the duck rare and it was pink and tender on the inside with a nice char on the outside 1 
very unreliable service from tmobile 0 
well im satisfied 1 
they are so easy to love but even more easy to identify with 1 
nonlinear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well 1 
helen baxendale is a very credible lady macbeth who can be very cheerfull at times and sometimes she just looks like a naughty girl but deadly in her taste for blood and evil 1 
i dont have very many words to say about this place but it does everything pretty well 1 
it feels poorly constructed the menus are difficult to navigate and the buttons are so recessed that it is difficult to push them 0 
all i have to say is the food was amazing 1 
total letdown i would much rather just go to the camelback flower shop and cartel coffee 0 
they dropped more than the ball 0 
not worth it 0 
great for ipods too 1 
absolutel junk 0 
i have read others reviews here but i havent had any problem with it 1 
i let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this bad idea we both hated it 0 
after arguing with verizon regarding the dropped calls we returned the phones after two days 0 
i dont recommend unless your car breaks down in front of it and you are starving 0 
after 3 months screen just went black all of a sudden 0 
the death row scenes were entirely unmoving 0 
try them in the airport to experience some tasty food and speedy friendly service 1 
this was such an awesome movie that i bought it off of ebay 1 
the two main characters may be two of the most believable children i ever saw put on screen 1 
and the chef was generous with his time even came around twice so we can take pictures with him 1 
not much flavor to them and very poorly constructed 0 
i contacted the company and they told me that although the unit was still under warranty if i couldnt produce my receipt i was out of luck 0 
this results in the phone being either stuck at max volume or mute 0 
great audio 1 
seriously its not worth wasting your or your kids time on 0 
i would highly recommend this 1 
on the good side the staff was genuinely pleasant and enthusiastic a real treat 1 
very good lunch spot 1 
actually the graphics were good at the time 1 
i love the pho and the spring rolls oh so yummy you have to try 1 
i was mortified 0 
great headset very impressed h500 1 
the movie is full of wonderful dancing hence the title 1 
its pure brilliance 1 
not a good item it worked for a while then started having problems in my auto reverse tape player 0 
but its just not funny 0 
i have been in more than a few bars in vegas and do not ever recall being charged for tap water 0 
delete this film from your mind 0 
the worst sappiest dialogue i could go on and on 0 
great product fast shipping 1 
would not reccommend 0 
camera color balance is awful 0 
the food wasnt good 0 
dont go here 0 
really ugly 0 
great audio 1 
we waited an hour for what was a breakfast i could have done 100 times better at home 0 
i guess i liked the details of his dysfunctionhe was believable 1 
these are fabulous 1 
waitress was good though 1 
some applause should be given to the prelude however 1 
ive only had my bluetooth for a few weeks but i really like it 1 
waste of 13 bucks 0 
the construction of the headsets is poor 0 
which is precisely why i am giving it such a bad review 0 
this would not even be good as a made for tv flick 0 
also notable is john baileys fine crisp beautifully colored cinematography and the great production design costumes by eiko ishioka who went on to do the memorable costumes for coppolas dracula for which she received a well deserved oscar 1 
works as described 1 
i have recommended it to friends 1 
they have great dinners 1 
the point is the journey a journey that touches every member of the family 1 
110 and only because there is no setting for 010 0 
the result is a powerhouse achievement made more timely now perhaps because of our cultures disturbing fascination with celebrity and its distorted interpretations of fame 1 
setup couldnt have been simpler 1 
i got it because it was so small and adorable 1 
the fried rice was dry as well 0 
wont work right or atleast for me 0 
it is an hour and half waste of time following a bunch of very pretty high schoolers whine and cry about life 0 
this is an unbelievable bargain 1 
that just screams legit in my booksomethats also pretty rare here in vegas 1 
totally different with loads of understatement and black comedy this is a film few get to see but those who do will remember it 1 
this is a chilly unremarkable movie about an author livingworking in a chilly abstruse culture 0 
lousy product 0 
the majority of the logitech earbud headsets failed 0 
their steaks are 100 recommended 1 
i have 23 bars on my cell phone when i am home but you cant not hear anything 0 
the lead man is charismafree 0 
obviously they have a terrible customer service so you get what you pay for 0 
well im satisfied 1 
reasonably priced also 1 
the vegetables are so fresh and the sauce feels like authentic thai 1 
yes this film does require a rather significant amount of puzzlesolving but the pieces fit together to create a beautiful picture 1 
you cant relate with them hell you barely can understand them 0 
then scene where they debated whether or not to sack the trumpeter who falsely was accused for the murder is pure horror really stupid 0 
the cashew cream sauce was bland and the vegetables were undercooked 0 
i do think tom hanks is a good actor 1 
if it were possible to give them zero stars theyd have it 0 
bluetooth range is good a few days ago i left my phone in the trunk got a call and carried the conversation without a hitch 1 
wow what a bad film 0 
very windresistant 1 
the chips and sals a here is amazing 1 
it presents a idyllic yet serious portrayal of the ups and downs of the characters lives 1 
buyer beware you could flush money right down the toilet 0 
portable and it works 1 
cooked to perfection and the service was impeccable 1 
putting the race card aside lets look at the major flaw in the film they destroy latifas character 0 
the battery runs down quickly 0 
he is an amazing film artist one of the most important whoever lived 1 
treo and tmobile refused to replace it again and forced me to buy another phone without any kind of upgrade discount 0 
you need at least 3 mins to get to your phone book from the time you first turn on the phonebattery life is short 0 
we loved the place 1 
horrible 0 
i particularly remember my senses being assaulted by strident cords of music that would blare out with very little warning and even less meaning 0 
good protection and does not make phone too bulky 1 
for people who are first timers in film making i think they did an excellent job 1 
overall a delight 1 
its worth driving up from tucson 1 
no im going to eat the potato that i found some strangers hair in it 0 
everything stinks 0 
not much flavor to them and very poorly constructed 0 
raw and sublimely moving 1 
im trying to return it for a refund 0 
saw the movie today and thought it was a good effort good messages for kids 1 
regardless the film fails on most levels 0 
as a sushi lover avoid this place by all means 0 
light weight i hardly notice it is there 1 
ive tried several different earpieces for my cell phone and this jabra one is the first one ive found that fits my ear comfortably 1 
probably never coming back and wouldnt recommend it 0 
their chow mein is so good 1 
rating 1 out of 10 0 
the price was very good and with the free shipping and all it was a good purchase 1 
delete this film from your mind 0 
i just saw this film and i recommend it 1 
i would recommend purchasing the jabra jx10 series 2 which works flawlessly with my moto q go figure 1 
all in all ha long bay was a bit of a flop 0 
he is almost unbearable to watch on screen he has little to no charisma and terrible comedic timing 0 
the first time i ever came here i had an amazing experience i still tell people how awesome the duck was 1 
wonderful lil tapas and the ambience made me feel all warm and fuzzy inside 1 
interesting decor 1 
it is cheap and it feel and look just as cheap 0 
the mic is great 1 
a cheap and cheerless heist movie with poor characterisation lots of underbite style stoic emoting think chow yun fat in a better tomorrow and some cheesy clichés thrown into an abandoned factory ready for a few poorly executed flying judo rolls a la john woo 0 
things happen characters personalities change plot twists occur for no real reason other than that script calls for it 0 
glad i didnt pay to see it 0 
i saw it as a child on tv back in 1973 when it was the stranger and i loved it 1 
ambience is perfect 1 
it seems completely secure both holding on to my belt and keeping the iphone inside 1 
the chips and salsa were really good the salsa was very fresh 1 
then as if i hadnt wasted enough of my life there they poured salt in the wound by drawing out the time it took to bring the check 0 
reception is terrible and full of static 0 
it works fine on my motorola 325 cellphone and a lot better than the wornout battery did 1 
first off the reception sucks i have never had more than 2 bars ever 0 
i believe that pitch black was done well 1 
the sound quality for the device is unacceptableunless you are in a really quiet area you almost hear nothing 0 
the food was delicious our bartender was attentive and personable and we got a great deal 1 
as for the killer dont expect anything original or even remotely frightening 0 
the plot such as it is is so derivative and predictable that the ending is like a mercy killing 0 
the steak and the shrimp are in my opinion the best entrees at gc 1 
cute quaint simple honest 1 
you get what you pay for i guess 0 
but in any case the best part is you can download these pictures to your laptop using ir or even send pictures from your laptop to the phone 1 
if you want healthy authentic or ethic food try this place 1 
i am very happy 1 
the very idea of it was lame take a minor character from a mediocre pg13 film and make a complete nonsequel while changing its tone to a pgrated family movie 0 
this would not even be good as a made for tv flick 0 
needless to say we will never be back here again 0 
the chains which im no fan of beat this place easily 0 
tied to charger for conversations lasting more than 45 minutesmajor problems 0 
weve tried to like this place but after 10 times i think were done with them 0 
also the fries are without a doubt the worst fries ive ever had 0 
it was that year however that reminded us that huston was still at the top of his game as evinced by his faithful adaptation of james joyces acclaimed novella the dead 1 
i exchanged the sony ericson z500a for this and im pretty happy with that decision 1 
i love this bluetooth 1 
i thought errol flynn was brilliant as custer and has since become my favourite actor 1 
it is an insane game 1 
ive missed numerous calls because of this reason 0 
it wasnt busy at all and now we know why 0 
fits comfortably came with three sizes of earbud tips 1 
beware this is not a trashy cult movie this is trash period 0 
must have been an off night at this place 0 
in fact im going to round up to 4 stars just because she was so awesome 1 
nice case feels good in your hands 1 
i had to wait over 30 minutes to get my drink and longer to get 2 arepas 0 
this movie is excellentangel is beautiful and scamp is adorablehis little yelps when hes scaredand the funniest parts are whenscamp is caught under the curtain and when angel and scamp are singing ive never had this feeling beforei totally recommend this movieits coming out on special edition on june 20the cover has scamp on a garbage can and angel underneath the lid 1 
this was a poor remake of my best friends wedding 0 
the bipolarity of the ruthless thug one minute a ruthless killer the next minute a luvs diaper commercial is completely unconvincing 0 
my drink was never empty and he made some really great menu suggestions 1 
we asked for the bill to leave without eating and they didnt bring that either 0 
the cast is always entertaining as usual 1 
i have two more years left in this contract and i hate this phone 0 
the attention given to every character and complex psychological portrayals detailing loyalty treachery love and hope are tremendous 1 
i immediately said i wanted to talk to the manager but i did not want to talk to the guy who was doing shots of fireball behind the bar 0 
the characters are fleshed out surprisingly well particularly grimes and blake and all the actors deliver their sharply scripted lines with just the right amount of deadpan tongue in cheek to make the dialogue both hilarious and realistic 1 
the movie lacks visual interest drama expression of feeling and celebration of the very patriotism that underlines the narrative 0 
plus it was wellpaced and suited its relatively short run time 1 
i loved their mussels cooked in this wine reduction the duck was tender and their potato dishes were delicious 1 
a piece of junk that broke after being on my phone for 2 days 0 
he really didnt seem to want to be hosting his voiceovers were monotonous didnt get involved with the guests 0 
please dont waste your money 0 
horrible 0 
how this piece of trash was ever released is beyond me the acting the story the characters the supposedly special effects etcits all wrong 0 
every element of this story was so over the top excessively phony and contrived that it was painful to sit through 0 
poorly contstruct hinge 0 
this movie now joins revenge of the boogeyman and zombiez as part of the hellish trinity of horror films 0 
i ordered this for sony ericsson w810i but i think it only worked once thats when i first used it 0 
there is a totally unnecessary trainroller coaster scene 0 
chinese forgeries abound 0 
this is was due to the fact that it took 20 minutes to be acknowledged then another 35 minutes to get our foodand they kept forgetting things 0 
my headset works just peachykeen 1 
this film highlights the fundamental flaws of the legal process that its not about discovering guilt or innocence but rather is about who presents better in court 1 
this is a chilly unremarkable movie about an author livingworking in a chilly abstruse culture 0 
a great touch 1 
the sangria was about half of a glass wine full and was 12 ridiculous 0 
its pure brilliance 1 
they brought a fresh batch of fries and i was thinking yay something warm but no 0 
five star plus plus 1 
he is one of my favourite directors and one of the most talented directors in the history of cinema 1 
the manager was the worst 0 
phone falls out easily 0 
they are so cool 1 
about half way through this film i started to dislike it 0 
putting the race card aside lets look at the major flaw in the film they destroy latifas character 0 
for service i give them no stars 0 
not good when wearing a hat or sunglasses 0 
pretty awesome place 1 
i dont think ive ever gone to a movie and disliked it as much 0 
useless phone simply deaf 0 
the awful dialogue and hopeless overacting by everyone who gets shot top off a real waste of space and time 0 
not to mention the combination of pears almonds and bacon is a big winner 1 
this item is fantastic and works perfectly 1 
this product is clearly not ready for prime time i dont care how cool it looks if you cant tell a call is coming in its worthless 0 
magical help 1 
the success of the film depends on the casting of sydney greenstreet as the alexander yardley character 1 
not only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic but it also managed to give away the entire movie and im not exaggerating every moment every plot point every joke is told in the trailer 0 
a lot of websites have been rating this a very good phone and so do i 1 
star trek v the final frontier is the worst in the series 0 
the bose noise cancelling is amazing which is very important for a nyc commuter 1 
this item worked great but it broke after 6 months of use 0 
this is one of the better buffets that i have been to 1 
if you simply want a small flip phone look elsewhere as the extra bells whistles are mediocre 0 
great product 1 
it was attached to a gas station and that is rarely a good sign 0 
go to place for gyros 1 
the fried rice was dry as well 0 
tonight i had the elk filet specialand it sucked 0 
i had ordered a motorola data cable got a very well finished and working product 1 
when i received my pita it was huge it did have a lot of meat in it so thumbs up there 1 
restored my phone to like new performance 1 
ive also had problems with the phone reading the memory card in which i always turn it on and then off again 0 
the concert sequences just sucked 0 
i give it 2 thumbs down 0 
thanks good a movie like this was done and released 1 
great value 1 
the file browser offers all the options that one needshandsfree is great 1 
it was too predictable even for a chick flick 0 
this particular model would not work with my motorola q smartphone 0 
the characters are interesting and you really care for them 1 
but despite these few flaws this case is of exceptional quality and well worth the additional costs of owning an official oem product 1 
if you do watch it however there are small consolations the actresses playing annes sisters each do a wonderful job with their roles 1 
we walked away stuffed and happy about our first vegas buffet experience 1 
we thought youd have to venture further away to get good sushi but this place really hit the spot that night 1 
tied to charger for conversations lasting more than 45 minutesmajor problems 0 
frozen pucks of disgust with some of the worst people behind the register 0 
and his subtle connections between the three films are awesome 1 
this is a chilly unremarkable movie about an author livingworking in a chilly abstruse culture 0 
both the hot sour the egg flower soups were absolutely 5 stars 1 
this movie totally grates on my nerves 0 
he was very impressed when going from the original battery to the extended battery 1 
the food came out at a good pace 1 
after charging overnight these batteries work great 1 
absolutely great 1 
the cashier was friendly and even brought the food out to me 1 
the spaghetti is nothing special whatsoever 0 
feelings thoughtsgabriels discomfort during the danceall these intangibles leap to life and come within the viewers grasp in hustons portrayal 1 
honeslty it didnt taste that fresh 0 
i promise they wont disappoint 1 
the cinematography is simply stunning to say the least and the fx are nothing if not stateoftheart 1 
thats how id describe this painfully dreary timewaster of a film 0 
this place deserves no stars 0 
down the drain because of a weak snap 0 
the building itself seems pretty neat the bathroom is pretty trippy but i wouldnt eat here again 0 
bad quality 0 
this is such a fun and funny movie 1 
it is so small and you dont even realize that it is there after a while of getting used to it 1 
i have two more years left in this contract and i hate this phone 0 
i went to bachi burger on a friends recommendation and was not disappointed 1 
the buttons for on and off are bad 0 
how stupid is that 0 
it has everything i need and i couldnt ask for more 1 
constantine gives everything the right intensity and seems to have a good understanding of the underlying psychological motivations 1 
its the best headset i have used 1 
in conclusion i will not bother with this movie because a volcano in los angeles is nothing but nonsense 0 
some highlights great quality nigiri here 1 
good works fine 1 
avoid avoid avoid 0 
this case seems well made 1 
the bartender was also nice 1 
i recently tried caballeros and i have been back every week since 1 
damn good steak 1 
its a gloriously fun fast paced and fairly accurate portrayal of the night of a raver 1 
excellent sound quality 1 
does not work for listening to music with the cingular 8125 0 
spend your money and time some place else 0 
i bought two of them and neither will charge 0 
it has a very good plot it holds your complete attention the acting is superb tom wilkinson was fantastic and emily watson was also very good 1 
from what my dinner companions told meeverything was very fresh with nice texture and taste 1 
the plot simply rumbles on like a machine desperately depending on the addition of new scenes 0 
this movie is terrible 0 
im not eating here 0 
the cast was great 1 
the ambiance was incredible 1 
the scripting of the subtle comedy is unmatched by any movie in recent years 1 
its practically perfect in all of them  a true masterpiece in a sea of faux masterpieces 1 
i thoroughly enjoyed it when christopher eccleston took control of the tardis and the continuation of the series 1 
i had heard good things about this place but it exceeding every hope i could have dreamed of 1 
awesome service and food 1 
the waiter wasnt helpful or friendly and rarely checked on us 0 
we would recommend these to others 1 
the pancake was also really good and pretty large at that 1 
verizons bills however are difficult to understand even though their pricing plans are simple 0 
you get extra minutes so that you can carry out the call and not get cut off 1 
the food was delicious our bartender was attentive and personable and we got a great deal 1 
nice blanket of moz over top but i feel like this was done to cover up the subpar food 1 
their chow mein is so good 1 
some applause should be given to the prelude however 1 
the plug did not work very well 0 
the bus boy on the other hand was so rude 0 
which has more depth and character than the man underneath it 0 
all the characters in this film are tremendously well played 1 
the aerial scenes were welldone 1 
great case and price 1 
very good food great atmosphere1 1 
how this piece of trash was ever released is beyond me the acting the story the characters the supposedly special effects etcits all wrong 0 
he was extremely rude and really there are so many other restaurants i would love to dine at during a weekend in vegas 0 
our server was super nice and checked on us many times 1 
not only did the software do a great job of this i could also make my own ringtones form my existing cds without an internet connection 1 
big disappointment with calendar sync 0 
cumbersome design 0 
this greedy corporation will never see another dime from me 0 
elias koteasjack palance play good roles angelina is hot and gets nakedbilly drago appears in this and is cool as usual a cameo by sven ole thorsen helps make this a very enjoyable movie with good acting and a decent budget 1 
im surprised this is a good quality car charger and theres not much reviews about it 1 
the battery is completely useless to me 0 
that was funny 1 
tom wilkinson broke my heart at the end and everyone elses judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike 1 
these products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet 0 
if good intentions made a film great then this film might be one of the greatest films ever made 1 
i love all the features and form factor 1 
disapointing results 0 
one of the best mexican movies ever and one of the less understood even by mexican themselves no matter how identified the should have felt with it 1 
unfortunately inexperience of direction meant that scene after scene passed with little in the way of dramatic tension or conflict 0 
not even good for camp value 0 
the battery runs down quickly 0 
we thought youd have to venture further away to get good sushi but this place really hit the spot that night 1 
i love this place 1 
good service very clean and inexpensive to boot 1 
after all the rave reviews i couldnt wait to eat herewhat a disappointment 0 
i paid the bill but did not tip because i felt the server did a terrible job 0 
def coming back to bowl next time 1 
the structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema 1 
good product incredible value 1 
what should have been a hilarious yummy christmas eve dinner to remember was the biggest fail of the entire trip for us 0 
the holster that arrived did not match the photo in the ad 0 
this gets a 1 out of 10 simply because theres nothing lower 0 
i had high hopes for this place since the burgers are cooked over a charcoal grill but unfortunately the taste fell flat way flat 0 
i would not recommend this place 0 
this is one of the best movies out there that shows such strong sibling bond for each other 1 
crust is not good 0 
everything was gross 0 
worse theres an incredibly weak subplot thrown in that follows a little band of latterday mansonites as they go after a reporter whos working on a story on the anniversary of the killings 0 
this is truly an art movieit actually has a lot of art in it 1 
however i recently watched the whole thing again on dvd and i was completely struck by how extremely stupid the storyline was how it contained holes inconsistencies and frankly a whole lot of crap and how horrid the dancing was 0 
couldnt use the unit with sunglasses not good in texas 0 
i agree with jessica this movie is pretty bad 0 
awesome device 1 
my first visit to hiro was a delight 1 
waste of 13 bucks 0 
i was sitting in my vehicle with the cradle on my belt and the headset lost signal 0 
ive had this bluetoooth headset for some time now and still not comfortable with the way it fits on the ear 0 
this one wants to surf on the small wave of space movies in 1998 deep impact and armageddon and this one fails everywhere 0 
despite the pans of reviewers i liked this movie 1 
the cashier had no care what so ever on what i had to say it still ended up being wayyy overpriced 0 
its worth driving up from tucson 1 
but it wasnt anything at all just one big yawn 0 
this greedy corporation will never see another dime from me 0 
your staff spends more time talking to themselves than me 0 
low quality 0 
save your money ive had this item for 11 months now 0 
voice quality signal strength dropped calls 0 
not good enough for the price 0 
the owners are super friendly and the staff is courteous 1 
i wont say any more i dont like spoilers so i dont want to be one but i believe this film is worth your time 1 
however bt headsets are currently not good for real time games like firstperson shooters since the audio delay messes me up 0 
glad i didnt pay to see it 0 
excellent product for the price 1 
it deserves strong love 1 
the ngage is still lacking in earbuds 0 
this is one of the worst sandra bullock movie since speed 2 but not quite that bad 0 
i left with a stomach ache and felt sick the rest of the day 0 
really awful 0 
but the movie makes a lot of serious mistakes 0 
this isnt a small family restaurant this is a fine dining establishment 1 
the worst one of the series 0 
babie bop is very cute 1 
after the first charge kept going dead after 12 minutes 0 
owners are really great people 1 
they never brought a salad we asked for 0 
the only possible way this movie could be redeemed would be as mst3k fodder 0 
despite how hard i rate businesses its actually rare for me to give a 1 star 0 
it sure does beat the nachos at the movies but i would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant 0 
the chips and salsa were really good the salsa was very fresh 1 
bad quality 0 
the point is the journey a journey that touches every member of the family 1 
why are these sad little vegetables so overcooked 0 
for a self proclaimed coffee cafe i was wildly disappointed 0 
the cast is always entertaining as usual 1 
the flat reenactments dont hold your attention because they are emotionally adrift and stagy 0 
saggy floppy piece of junk 0 
service was fantastic 1 
it is unusable in a moving car at freeway speed 0 
the plot has more holes than a pair of fishnet stockings and the direction and editing is astonishingly ham fisted 0 
but whatever it was that cost them so much it didnt translate to quality thats for sure 0 
i used bitpim a free program you can find on the internetto transfer data to the phonethe price of the cable was excellent 1 
the staff is great the food is delish and they have an incredible beer selection 1 
very very sad 0 
this is hands down the best phone ive ever had 1 
motorola finally got the voice quality of a bluetooth headset right 1 
their rotating beers on tap is also a highlight of this place 1 
but storm trooper is not even bad enough to make it to the list of wonderfully terrible movies 0 
service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is vegas and located inside the crystals shopping mall by aria 1 
but if you liked movies like the matrix and better yet their sequels i think youll appreciate the thought provoking mindblowing experience this film will give you 1 
for a product that costs as much as this one does i expect it to work far better and with greater ease than this thing does 0 
waaaaaayyyyyyyyyy over rated is all i am saying 0 
the movie had you on the edge of your seat and made you somewhat afraid to go to your car at the end of the night 1 
kids pizza is always a hit too with lots of great side dish options for the kiddos 1 
i highly recommend these and encourage people to give them a try 1 
waited 2 hours never got either of our pizzas as many other around us who came in later did 0 
the plot simply rumbles on like a machine desperately depending on the addition of new scenes 0 
come hungry leave happy and stuffed 1 
great place to eat reminds me of the little mom and pop shops in the san francisco bay area 1 
due to this happening on every call i was forced to stop using this headset 0 
the reception has been generally good 1 
great for ipods too 1 
nice sound 1 
its the one movie that never ceases to interest me simply because it keeps me alert as i try to attempt to decipher its meanings 1 
not much seafood and like 5 strings of pasta at the bottom 0 
everything from acting to cinematography was solid 1 
and it was boring 0 
battery chargelife is quite long 1 
i got home to see the driest damn wings ever 0 
now this dish was quite flavourful 1 
for the price this was a great deal 1 
restored my phone to like new performance 1 
the refried beans that came with my meal were dried out and crusty and the food was bland 0 
and it was boring 0 
the worst sappiest dialogue i could go on and on 0 
coming here is like experiencing an underwhelming relationship where both parties cant wait for the other person to ask to break up 0 
a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it 1 
doesnt do the job 0 
the management is rude 0 
it crackles with an unpredictable youthful energy but honestly i found it hard to follow and concentrate on it meanders so badly 0 
it crackles with an unpredictable youthful energy but honestly i found it hard to follow and concentrate on it meanders so badly 0 
comfortable fit you need your headset to be comfortable for at least an hour at a time if not for an entire day 1 
special mention should be made of the superb music score and sound effects which are an integral element in helping to make this such a memorable and enjoyable cartoon 1 
its kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly its embarrassing how childlike the company is 0 
the phone is sturdy and waterproof 1 
waste of money 0 
so badwellits just bad 0 
i dont each much pasta but i love the homemade hand made pastas and thin pizzas here 1 
this isnt a small family restaurant this is a fine dining establishment 1 
they do not care about the consumer one bit 0 
to those who find this movie intelligent or even masterful i can only say its your intelligence and your imagination you obviously used to try and make some sense of this pitiful attempt its in our human nature to try and make sense of things 0 
we had so much to say about the place before we walked in that he expected it to be amazing but was quickly disappointed 0 
have been going since 2007 and every meal has been awesome 1 
reversible plug works great 1 
it defeats the purpose of a bluetooth headset 0 
unfortunately it was not good 0 
i recently had problems where i could not stay connected for more than 10 minutes before being disconnected 0 
buttons are too small 0 
i got home to see the driest damn wings ever 0 
i contacted the company and they told me that although the unit was still under warranty if i couldnt produce my receipt i was out of luck 0 
very windresistant 1 
these are the nicest restaurant owners ive ever come across 1 
always a great time at dos gringos 1 
we wont be returning 0 
i had high hopes for this place since the burgers are cooked over a charcoal grill but unfortunately the taste fell flat way flat 0 
this place receives stars for their appetizers 1 
it defeats the purpose of a bluetooth headset 0 
his performance as awarded was stunning 1 
yet i enjoy watching it 1 
the only suspense i was feeling was the frustration at just how retarded the girls were 0 
the cinematography is simply stunning to say the least and the fx are nothing if not stateoftheart 1 
i do not know if this was emilio estevezs directorial debut but the pacing the interplay and development of the characters as well as some clever camera work surrounding the character estevez plays all suggest a natural eye 1 
made very sturdy 1 
the success of the film depends on the casting of sydney greenstreet as the alexander yardley character 1 
that company is a joke 0 
a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it 1 
it didnt work people can not hear me when i talk 0 
it sure does beat the nachos at the movies but i would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant 0 
the plot simply rumbles on like a machine desperately depending on the addition of new scenes 0 
i wont spoil it but the ending in pretty amazing 1 
worked great 1 
very disappointed 0 
probably never coming back and wouldnt recommend it 0 
she carries the movie well 1 
all in all id expected a better consumer experience from motorola 0 
buyer beware you could flush money right down the toilet 0 
i must say i have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again 1 
cinematography the film was shot in an interesting way 1 
the show would begin with smart ass ed comments to each other that would be totally off the wall and uncalled for 0 
not as good as i had hoped 0 
it is a really good show to watch 1 
the story is lame not interesting and never really explains the sinister origins of the puppets 0 
punishment park is a brilliant piece of cinema 1 
the directing and the cinematography arent quite as good 0 
it finds my cell phone right away when i enter the car 1 
i have purchased these for both family and friends and all enjoy their clarity and ease of use 1 
the tracfonewebsite is user friendly and makes it easy toactivate etc 1 
good product incredible value 1 
for that its worth checking out 1 
not as good as i had hoped 0 
i hate to disagree with my fellow yelpers but my husband and i were so disappointed with this place 0 
this short film certainly pulls no punches 0 
nice case feels good in your hands 1 
that was done in the second movie 0 
this if the first movie ive given a 10 to in years 1 
it also took her forever to bring us the check when we asked for it 0 
they refuse to refund or replace 0 
extremely tasty 1 
i liked this movie way too much 1 
the film has great actors a master director a significant themeat least a wouldbe significant theme undertone of fifties existential worldweariness aerial scenes that ought to have thrilled both senses and imagination and characters about which one might deeply care 1 
poor sound quality 0 
the story line is totally predictable 0 
there were several moments in the movie that just didnt need to be there and were excruciatingly slow moving 0 
bad reception 0 
highly recommended 1 
it was awesome 1 
this is one of the best italian thrillers of the early 70s 1 
really good product 1 
all in all id expected a better consumer experience from motorola 0 
the scenes are often funny and occasionally touching as the characters evaluate their lives and where they are going 1 
good quality 1 
food is way overpriced and portions are fucking small 0 
this place is not quality sushi it is not a quality restaurant 0 
this is a chilly unremarkable movie about an author livingworking in a chilly abstruse culture 0 
i dont think it would hold it too securly on your belt 0 
fans of the genre will be in heaven 1 
this was my first and only vegas buffet and it did not disappoint 1 
ive bought 5 wired headphones that sound better than these 0 
the black eyed peas and sweet potatoes unreal 1 
i love this cable it allows me to connect any miniusb device to my pc 1 
its practically perfect in all of them  a true masterpiece in a sea of faux masterpieces 1 
if you are reading this please dont go there 0 
after two i felt disgusting 0 
it is super charged up for use as a small hybrid palmtopcameracellphone and excels in those roles 1 
this is just a great movie 1 
none of the new ones have ever quite worked properly 0 
and finally after all that we get to an ending that wouldve been great had it been handled by competent people and not jerry falwell 0 
food was so gooodd 1 
improper description i had to return it 0 
after the disappointing dinner we went elsewhere for dessert 0 
furthermore you cant even find hours of operation on the website 0 
the puppets look really cheesy not in a good way like in the puppet master 80s flicks 0 
not good when wearing a hat or sunglasses 0 
as for the service im a fan because its quick and youre being served by some nice folks 1 
i found a six inch long piece of wire in my salsa 0 
woa talk about awful 0 
works great when my cat attacked the phone he scratched the protective strip instead of destroying the screen 1 
i found this move beautiful enjoyable and uplifting 1 
interesting decor 1 
both of them were truly unbelievably good and i am so glad we went back 1 
this movie is terrible 0 
i probably wont be coming back here 0 
what did bother me was the slow service 0 
it is the best charger i have seen on the market yet 1 
it rocked my world and is certainly a must see for anyone with no social or physical outlets 1 
overall i like there food and the service 1 
the crêpe was delicate and thin and moist 1 
this place is not quality sushi it is not a quality restaurant 0 
the only thing really worth watching was the scenery and the house because it is beautiful 1 
it didnt work people can not hear me when i talk 0 
i literally vomited while watching this film 0 
which has more depth and character than the man underneath it 0 
i left with a stomach ache and felt sick the rest of the day 0 
ordered an appetizer and took 40 minutes and then the pizza another 10 minutes 0 
the attention given to every character and complex psychological portrayals detailing loyalty treachery love and hope are tremendous 1 
at first i thought i was grtting a good deal at 744 until i plugged it into my phone v3c razr 0 
really bad 0 
a cheap and cheerless heist movie with poor characterisation lots of underbite style stoic emoting think chow yun fat in a better tomorrow and some cheesy clichés thrown into an abandoned factory ready for a few poorly executed flying judo rolls a la john woo 0 
first time there and might just be the last 0 
we got the food and apparently they have never heard of salt and the batter on the fish was chewy 0 
service was good and the company was better 1 
however this didnt make up for the fact that overall this was a tremendously boring movie 0 
lets start with all the problemsthe acting especially from the lead professor was very very bad 0 
we have gotten a lot of compliments on it 1 
he surely doesnt know how to make a coherent action movie from the screenwriter of air force one who was only obliged to write the script just for a big sum of money 0 
works fine 1 
that being said for a phone the camera is very nice many cool effects to play with and video is decent as well 1 
they will customize your order any way youd like my usual is eggplant with green bean stir fry love it 1 
this is one of the worst sandra bullock movie since speed 2 but not quite that bad 0 
predictable but not a bad watch 1 
it was pretty gross 0 
my husband and i ate lunch here and were very disappointed with the food and service 0 
performed awful muffled tinny incoming sound and severe echo for those on the other end of the call 0 
you learn a lot about the real inside emotions of people in this movie and a lot about the movie business itself 1 
great earpiece 1 
the entire audience applauded at the conclusion of the film 1 
always a great time at dos gringos 1 
a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it 1 
it plays louder than any other speaker of this size the price is so low that most would think the quality is lacking however its not 1 
its aggravating 0 
phone falls out easily 0 
an extensive menu provides lots of options for breakfast 1 
walked in and the place smelled like an old grease trap and only 2 others there eating 0 
the cinematography is simply stunning to say the least and the fx are nothing if not stateoftheart 1 
exceptionally bad 0 
the cast is always entertaining as usual 1 
battery life is real good 1 
also makes it easier to hold on to 1 
happy so far 1 
judith light is one of my favorite actresses and i think she does a superb job in this film 1 
verizon tech support walked my through a few procedures none of which worked and i ended up having to do a hard reset wiping out all my data 0 
if you stay in vegas you must get breakfast here at least once 1 
no actress has been worse used that june allison in this movie 0 
with great sound effects and impressive special effects i cant recommend this movie enough 1 
battery chargelife is quite long 1 
as for the mains also uninspired 0 
great value 1 
i kept looking at the time and it had soon become 35 minutes yet still no food 0 
everything about this film is simply incredible 1 
all in all ha long bay was a bit of a flop 0 
the acting by the whole cast could be put on a scale and balanced perfectly between overacting and underacting 0 
love this headset 1 
the film is well paced understated and one of the best courtroom documentaries ive seen 1 
we got sitting fairly fast but ended up waiting 40 minutes just to place our order another 30 minutes before the food arrived 0 
unfortunately cover girl is an example of how hollywood used to exploit women for financial gain 0 
classywarm atmosphere fun and fresh appetizers succulent steaks baseball steak 1 
good quality 1 
the battery life is highly unacceptable 0 
my sanyo has survived dozens of drops on blacktop without ill effect 1 
this film offers many delights and surprises 1 
very dissapointing performance 0 
i believe that pitch black was done well 1 
a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it 1 
i will come back here every time im in vegas 1 
okay i like to consider myself a fair critic so ill give credit where credits duethe creature effects were actually pretty cool 1 
the ngage is still lacking in earbuds 0 
very disappointed and wondered how it could be in the oscar shortlist 0 
the poor actors 0 
very good food great atmosphere1 1 
im glad i found this product on amazon it is hard to find it wasnt high priced 1 
the sound quality is excellent as well 1 
i dont each much pasta but i love the homemade hand made pastas and thin pizzas here 1 
its a little geeky but i think thats its sex on toast and it rocks and oozes sex right down to its battery embedded sleek stylish leather case 1 
its like a really sexy party in your mouth where youre outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party 1 
a good film by a great director 1 
duris has a wholesome appearance and gives a fine performance 1 
i would not recommend this place 0 
the chips that came out were dripping with grease and mostly not edible 0 
the burger is good beef cooked just right 1 
great steak great sides great wine amazing desserts 1 
those phones are working just fine now 1 
nothing at all to recommend 0 
summary the witticisms werent witty 0 
the bathroom is just next door and very nice 1 
the update procedure is difficult and cumbersome 0 
it was a drive to get there 0 
some great music and terrific scenery 1 
even allowing for poor production values for the time 1971 and the format some kind of miniseries this is baaaaaad 0 
in the span of an hour i had two people exclaim whoa is that the new phone on tv 1 
i purcashed this for the car charger and it does not work 0 
phone now holds charge like it did when it was new 1 
theres barely a boring moment in the film and there are plenty of humorous parts 1 
what a mistake 0 
lame would be the best way to describe it 0 
cooked to perfection and the service was impeccable 1 
emily watsons character is very strong and she has only to give a quick glance and you understand everything 1 
and those baby owls were adorable 1 
im not eating here 0 
glad i didnt pay to see it 0 
it was so cool 1 
overall i was not impressed and would not go back 0 
service is friendly and inviting 1 
and finally after all that we get to an ending that wouldve been great had it been handled by competent people and not jerry falwell 0 
i tried the cape cod ravoli chickenwith cranberrymmmm 1 
cant get the software to work with my computer 0 
i had to go to a store and bought a new nokia phone which is working great 1 
good quality 1 
as a sushi lover avoid this place by all means 0 
soyo technology sucks 0 
omg the food was delicioso 1 
i had to go to a store and bought a new nokia phone which is working great 1 
it is easy to turn on and off when you are in the car and the volume controls are quite accessable 1 
works great 1 
great place fo take out or eat in 1 
were jerks on the phone 0 
it deserves strong love 1 
excellent performance 1 
and i just love the colors 1 
everyone is treated equally special 1 
i think the most wonderful parts literally full of wonder are the excerpts from his works 1 
its a total package 1 
disappointed 0 
battery has no life 0 
avoid at all costs 0 
problem is that the ear loops are made of weak material and break easily 0 
excellent sound quality 1 
gave up trying to eat any of the crust teeth still sore 0 
nice design and quality 1 
for those that havent seen it dont waste your time 0 
i find this inexcusable and so will probably be returning this phone and perhaps changing carriers 0 
while you dont yet hear mickey speak there are tons of sound effects and music throughout the filmsomething we take for granted now but which was a huge crowd pleaser in 1928 1 
the success of the film depends on the casting of sydney greenstreet as the alexander yardley character 1 
big disappointment with calendar sync 0 
im so sorry but i really cant recommend it to anyone 0 
phone falls out easily 0 
the worst sappiest dialogue i could go on and on 0 
makes it easier to keep up with my bluetooth when im not wearing it 0 
overall the film is interesting and thoughtprovoking 1 
it felt too light and tinny 0 
the attempts at humor were pitiful and story is so awful it dosent bear thinking about which basically involves a vulcan stealing the enterprise to find god seriously i just didnt care about any of this film and oh not to mention uhura does a belly dance to distract male guards 0 
this one is simply a disappointment 0 
aside from its terrible lead this film has loads of other debits 0 
there are massive levels massive unlockable characters its just a massive game 1 
returned 8 hours later 0 
the service was meh 0 
i saw this movie and i thought this is a stupid movie 0 
the interplay between martin and emilio contains the same wonderful chemistry we saw in wall street with martin and charlie 1 
a truly truly bad film 0 
the sound quality for the device is unacceptableunless you are in a really quiet area you almost hear nothing 0 
so i bought about 10 of these and saved alot of money 1 
2 times very bad customer service 0 
the restaurant is very clean and has a family restaurant feel to it 1 
bought mainly for the charger which broke soon after purchasing 0 
the puppets look really cheesy not in a good way like in the puppet master 80s flicks 0 
so anyone near you will hear part of your conversation 0 
also the fries are without a doubt the worst fries ive ever had 0 
i was left shattered from the experience of watching this film and i took a good two hours to fully recover 0 
i received my orders well within the shipping timeframe everything was in good working order and overall i am very excited to have this source 1 
helen baxendale is a very credible lady macbeth who can be very cheerfull at times and sometimes she just looks like a naughty girl but deadly in her taste for blood and evil 1 
the grilled chicken was so tender and yellow from the saffron seasoning 1 
i swung in to give them a try but was deeply disappointed 0 
insults profound deuchebaggery and had to go outside for a smoke break while serving just to solidify it 0 
great price also 1 
my first visit to hiro was a delight 1 
the sweet potato tots were good but the onion rings were perfection or as close as i have had 1 
i was seated immediately 1 
there is a brilliant twist ending 1 
this is a good joint 1 
service is perfect and the family atmosphere is nice to see 1 
otherwise easy to install and use clear sound 1 
but when someone strives for greatness and poetry but delivers a muddled and often ridiculous story a bunch of disparate scenes pretentious dialogue then you get the worst kind of a movie that some other reviewer very accurately defined as pretentious crap 0 
bland not a liking this place for a number of reasons and i dont want to waste time on bad reviewing ill leave it at that 0 
linksys should have some way to exchange a bad phone for a refurb unit or something 0 
will never ever go back 0 
motorola finally got the voice quality of a bluetooth headset right 1 
worked perfectly 1 
this movie contained an allstar cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i havent seen before 1 
the sweet potato fries were very good and seasoned well 1 
the chips and sals a here is amazing 1 
no im going to eat the potato that i found some strangers hair in it 0 
the jabra eargels fit my ears very well 1 
my sister has one also and she loves it 1 
for 40 bucks a head i really expect better food 0 
youll love it 1 
its pretty easy 1 
service is also cute 1 
food was average at best 0 
im not impressed with the concept or the food 0 
on the negative its insipid enough to cause regret for another 2 hours of life wasted in front of the screen 0 
total brunch fail 0 
great product fast shipping 1 
we made the drive all the way from north scottsdale and i was not one bit disappointed 1 
the screen does get smudged easily because it touches your ear and face 0 
its just lame 0 
not a weekly haunt but definitely a place to come back to every once in a while 1 
i seriously cannot believe that the owner has so many unexperienced employees that all are running around like chickens with their heads cut off 0 
we would recommend these to others 1 
however after finally watching this film i realized that not only had i had a closed mind to the brilliance it depicts i also found myself watching it over and over again 1 
this is the place where i first had pho and it was amazing 1 
im not eating here 0 
ive also had problems with the phone reading the memory card in which i always turn it on and then off again 0 
its very slow 0 
excellent sound battery life and inconspicuous to boot 1 
maybe its just their vegetarian fare but ive been twice and i thought it was average at best 0 
im translating movies for a living and this is the first movie in my 5year working experience that i found offensive to my intelligence 0 
a cheap and cheerless heist movie with poor characterisation lots of underbite style stoic emoting think chow yun fat in a better tomorrow and some cheesy clichés thrown into an abandoned factory ready for a few poorly executed flying judo rolls a la john woo 0 
this early film from future goremeister lucio fulci is a very good addition to the giallo subgenre 1 
i love this phone it is very handy and has a lot of features 1 
but it picked up speed and got right to the point 1 
its just painful 0 
this particular model would not work with my motorola q smartphone 0 
there is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again 0 
i go to far too many places and ive never seen any restaurant that serves a 1 egg breakfast especially for 400 0 
the mic there is a joke and the volume is quite low 0 
now this dish was quite flavourful 1 
i really recommend this faceplates since it looks very nice elegant and cool 1 
i would recommend saving room for this 1 
much better than the other ayce sushi place i went to in vegas 1 
however after about a year the fliptop started to get loose and wobbly and eventually my screen went black and i couldnt receive and place calls 0 
what should have been a hilarious yummy christmas eve dinner to remember was the biggest fail of the entire trip for us 0 
pretty piece of junk 0 
special thanks to dylan t for the recommendation on what to order all yummy for my tummy 1 
although i very much liked the look and sound of this place the actual experience was a bit disappointing 0 
best ive found so far ive tried 2 other bluetooths and this one has the best quality for both me and the listener as well as ease of using 1 
everything about this film is simply incredible 1 
they have a plethora of salads and sandwiches and everything ive tried gets my seal of approval 1 
service stinks here 0 
i recommend igo to anyone with different brand cell phonesmp3 players in the family 1 
it was way over fried 0 
the chefs were friendly and did a good job 1 
ive never been more insulted or felt disrespected 0 
not recommended 0 
wonderful lil tapas and the ambience made me feel all warm and fuzzy inside 1 
worst service to boot but that is the least of their worries 0 
but it is great i would really recommend it 1 
this item is great installed it let it charged up overnite and it has been working good every since with no problems 1 
the aerial scenes were welldone 1 
by this time our side of the restaurant was almost empty so there was no excuse 0 
chinese forgeries abound 0 
worst ever 0 
gotta love those closeups of slimy drooling teeth 1 
this is the kind of money that is wasted properly 1 
this is a great phone 1 
excellent phone 1 
the grilled chicken was so tender and yellow from the saffron seasoning 1 
its a sad movie but very good 1 
the best phone in market 1 
total letdown i would much rather just go to the camelback flower shop and cartel coffee 0 
total waste of time 0 
this is simply the best bluetooth headset for sound quality 1 
i got home to see the driest damn wings ever 0 
my rating just 3 out of 10 0 
great place fo take out or eat in 1 
it also had a new problem 0 
the feel of the dining room was more college cooking course than high class dining and the service was slow at best 0 
these are fabulous 1 
which has more depth and character than the man underneath it 0 
good food good service 1 
everyone is very attentive providing excellent customer service 1 
be sure to order dessert even if you need to pack it togo the tiramisu and cannoli are both to die for 1 
a truly truly bad film 0 
in a word it is embarrassing 0 
the staff is always super friendly and helpful which is especially cool when you bring two small boys and a baby 1 
the only thing really worth watching was the scenery and the house because it is beautiful 1 
great product for the price 1 
well just if you keep thinking how bad it is 0 
it was clear that she had the range and ability to pull off this part 1 
we literally sat there for 20 minutes with no one asking to take our order 0 
the igo chargers and tips are really great 1 
i took back my money and got outta there 0 
my 5year old nokia 2160 from tracfone holds the charge a lot better than this 0 
simply beautiful 1 
star trek v the final frontier is the worst in the series 0 
the acting was decidely wooden though no worse than a period universal b movie 0 
no actress has been worse used that june allison in this movie 0 
i do not know if this was emilio estevezs directorial debut but the pacing the interplay and development of the characters as well as some clever camera work surrounding the character estevez plays all suggest a natural eye 1 
i liked this movie way too much 1 
you get extra minutes so that you can carry out the call and not get cut off 1 
the fried rice was dry as well 0 
tried to go here for lunch and it was a madhouse 0 
weve have gotten a much better service from the pizza place next door than the services we received from this restaurant 0 
terrible phone holder 0 
the film gives meaning to the phrase never in the history of human conflict has so much been owed by so many to so few 1 
we wont be going back anytime soon 0 
when i opened the sandwich i was impressed but not in a good way 0 
john garfield ann revere lilli plmer william conrad canada leeand filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screenjames wong howe 1 
i have to use the smallest earpieces provided but it stays on pretty well 1 
awesome service and food 1 
the fries were not hot and neither was my burger 0 
anyway the plot flowed smoothly and the malebonding scenes were a hoot 1 
the food came out at a good pace 1 
the cow tongue and cheek tacos are amazing 1 
love this headset 1 
the cocktails are all handmade and delicious 1 
im in az all the time and now have my new spot 1 
their daily specials are always a hit with my group 1 
battery has no life 0 
sounds good reasonably priced and effective its that simple 1 
star trek v the final frontier is the worst in the series 0 
the selection on the menu was great and so were the prices 1 
the fish is badly made and some of its underwater shots are repeated a thousand times in the film 0 
highly recommended 1 
waste of money 0 
its like a bad two hour tv movie 0 
its aggravating 0 
we loved the place 1 
i highly recommend this device to everyone 1 
it is simple to use and i like it 1 
very much disappointed with this company 0 
my friend loved the salmon tartar 1 
poor reliability 0 
the food is about on par with dennys which is to say not good at all 0 
there is no real plot 0 
often the dialogue doesnt really follow from one line to another or fit the surroundings 0 
its worth driving up from tucson 1 
great food and awesome service 1 
very windresistant 1 
in fact im going to round up to 4 stars just because she was so awesome 1 
the potatoes were great and so was the biscuit 1 
it doesnt work in europe or asia 0 
great food and service huge portions and they give a military discount 1 
this is a very average phone with bad battery life that operates on a weak network 0 
works like a charm it work the same as the one i got with the phone 1 
we waited an hour for what was a breakfast i could have done 100 times better at home 0 
none of the three sizes they sent with the headset would stay in my ears 0 
arrived quickly and much less expensive than others being sold 1 
camera color balance is awful 0 
first off the reception sucks i have never had more than 2 bars ever 0 
they have horrible attitudes towards customers and talk down to each one when customers dont enjoy their food 0 
i consider this theft 0 
ive also had problems with the phone reading the memory card in which i always turn it on and then off again 0 
worst service to boot but that is the least of their worries 0 
so bad 0 
i wouldnt return 0 
i can barely ever hear on it and am constantly saying what 0 
the selection on the menu was great and so were the prices 1 
for those that havent seen it dont waste your time 0 
lightweight and works well 1 
the service was poor and thats being nice 0 
this phone tries very hard to do everything but fails at its very ability to be a phone 0 
even in my bmw 3 series which is fairly quiet i have trouble hearing what the other person is saying 0 
gets a signal when other verizon phones wont 1 
during several different 2 minute calls i experienced 5 drops and it was in an area that had 5 bars 0 
by far the best cheesecurds we have ever had 1 
would not recommend to others 0 
great food and service huge portions and they give a military discount 1 
but other than that the movie seemed to drag and the heroes didnt really work for their freedom 0 
nice case feels good in your hands 1 
the visual effects were awful 0 
the story itself is just predictable and lazy 0 
i really loved the story line and the poler bear was kinda cutebut if anyone has a question about fort steele just ask away 1 
i even dropped this phone into a stream and it was submerged for 15 seconds and it still works great 1 
i use this product in a motor control center where there is a lot of high voltage humming from the equipment and it works great 1 
their frozen margaritas are way too sugary for my taste 0 
the camera on the phone may be used as a dustpan when indoors id rather be using a disposable then this 0 
this is one of the worst sandra bullock movie since speed 2 but not quite that bad 0 
simply beautiful 1 
i recommend this for everyone who loves film movies anythinga work of art 1 
there is nothing privileged about workingeating there 0 
what possesed me to get this junk i have no idea 0 
but this movie is definitely a below average rent 0 
its a shame to see good actors like thomerson and james make a living in a mess like this 0 
i love this place 1 
there was no chemistry between ben affleck and sandra bullock in this film and i couldnt understand why he would consider even leaving his wifetobe for this chick that he supposedly was knocked out by 0 
plantronics bluetooth excelent buy 1 
you never know if you pushed it hard enough or the right number of times for the function you want or not 0 
very disappointed 0 
it worked very well 1 
omelets are to die for 1 
i am sorry i made this purchase 0 
what makes this story different are the terrific production values faultless photography composition and editing the terrific casting the underappreciated brian keith playing a bully teddy and vivid history 1
