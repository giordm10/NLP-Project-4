the commercials are the most misleading 0 
to be honest with you this is unbelievable nonsense and very foolish 0 
best headset ever 1 
mobile phone tools are a must have 1 
highly recommended a 1 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
it lasts less than 3o minutes if i actually try to use the phonemy wife has the same phone with the same problem 0 
dont buy this product 0 
the tracfonewebsite is user friendly and makes it easy toactivate etc 1 
the characters were all funny and had the peculiarity of not having a true lead character 1 
do not buy do not buyit sucks 0 
works good 1 
its worth driving up from tucson 1 
really good product 1 
while you dont yet hear mickey speak there are tons of sound effects and music throughout the filmsomething we take for granted now but which was a huge crowd pleaser in 1928 1 
for 40 bucks a head i really expect better food 0 
if there were zero stars i would give it zero stars 0 
overall i rate this movie a 10 out of a 110 scale 1 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
nice ambiance 1 
full of unconvincing cardboard characters it is blandly written by edward chodorov who also produced and is surprisingly directed by jean negulesco from whom one would expect a great deal more 0 
we got sitting fairly fast but ended up waiting 40 minutes just to place our order another 30 minutes before the food arrived 0 
of all the dishes the salmon was the best but all were great 1 
it is very comfortable to wear as well which is probably the most important aspect about using a case 1 
this really is how vegas fine dining used to be right down to the menus handed to the ladies that have no prices listed 1 
the only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port irda 0 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
basically the service was very bad 0 
this place lacked style 0 
i had high hopes for this place since the burgers are cooked over a charcoal grill but unfortunately the taste fell flat way flat 0 
not good when wearing a hat or sunglasses 0 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
i believe that pitch black was done well 1 
the descriptions said yum yum sauce and another said eel sauce yet another said spicy mayowell none of the rolls had sauces on them 0 
needless to say we will never be back here again 0 
product is useless since it does not have enough charging current to charge the 2 cellphones i was planning to use it with 0 
this item is great installed it let it charged up overnite and it has been working good every since with no problems 1 
no im going to eat the potato that i found some strangers hair in it 0 
this product is clearly not ready for prime time i dont care how cool it looks if you cant tell a call is coming in its worthless 0 
the poor actors 0 
i was very disappointed in the movie 0 
whatever the producer was going for he missed entirely 0 
this fixes all the problems 1 
the service was terrible though 0 
it dit not work most of the time with my nokia 5320 0 
terrible phone holder 0 
i was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar not only because the quality is great but the service is fast and the food impeccable 1 
why was this film made 0 
its a shame to see good actors like thomerson and james make a living in a mess like this 0 
still i do like this movie for its empowerment of women theres not enough movies out there like this one 1 
the service was great even the manager came and helped with our table 1 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
really good product 1 
how can you call yourself a steakhouse if you cant properly cook a steak i dont understand 0 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
good protection and does not make phone too bulky 1 
all in all id expected a better consumer experience from motorola 0 
so anyone near you will hear part of your conversation 0 
the characters were all funny and had the peculiarity of not having a true lead character 1 
i know he was a contract player with little control over his scripts but the acting was as bad as the script 0 
updatewent back for a second time and it was still just as amazing 1 
definitely worth seeing its the sort of thought provoking film that forces you to question your own threshold of loneliness 1 
even when the women finally show up there is no sign of improvement the most expected things happen and by the time the film is over you might be far asleep 0 
i have seen many movies starring jaclyn smith but my god this was one of her best though it came out 12 years ago 1 
we waited an hour for what was a breakfast i could have done 100 times better at home 0 
the problem was the script 0 
wed definitely go back here again 1 
i was very disappointed in the movie 0 
the films dialogue is natural real to life 1 
there was no chemistry between ben affleck and sandra bullock in this film and i couldnt understand why he would consider even leaving his wifetobe for this chick that he supposedly was knocked out by 0 
we asked for the bill to leave without eating and they didnt bring that either 0 
it has a great camera thats 2mp and the pics are nice and clear with great picture quality 1 
i thought it was bad 0 
the fries were great too 1 
the price was very good and with the free shipping and all it was a good purchase 1 
despite the pans of reviewers i liked this movie 1 
perhaps i caught them on an off night judging by the other reviews but im not inspired to go back 0 
save your money ive had this item for 11 months now 0 
the use of slowmotion needlessly repeats itself throughout the movie but is well backed up by bad acting and bad is a kind word here no continuity scenes that are thrown in for no reason whatsoever vehicles that looked like they were made from a corn flakes box and a directorial style that bordered on stupidity 0 
unfortunately the ability to actually know you are receiving a call is a rather important feature and this phone is pitiful in that respect 0 
the two main characters may be two of the most believable children i ever saw put on screen 1 
works great 1 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
i highly recommend this device to everyone 1 
as an earlier review noted plug in this charger and nothing happens 0 
i have had mine for about a year and this christmas i bought some for the rest of the family 1 
overall i would recommend this phone over the new walkman 1 
one of the best mexican movies ever and one of the less understood even by mexican themselves no matter how identified the should have felt with it 1 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
rip off over charge shipping 0 
go watch it 1 
i sat riveted to the tv screen 1 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
we arent ones to make a scene at restaurants but i just dont get itdefinitely lost the love after this one 0 
there is a brilliant twist ending 1 
i ordered albondigas soup which was just warm and tasted like tomato soup with frozen meatballs 0 
his performance as awarded was stunning 1 
this one is simply a disappointment 0 
the service was poor and thats being nice 0 
freezes frequently4 0 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
the fried rice was dry as well 0 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
see it with your kids if you have a chanceit will open up some amazing dialog about how far race relations have come in the last 50 years 1 
it was probably dirt 0 
and the beans and rice were mediocre at best 0 
i dont know exactly what it is about this movie but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our familys memories 1 
and there wasnt a single sour note struck actingwise either some surprisingly solid casting here 1 
painful on the ear 0 
horrible dont waste your time and money 0 
i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
if you hate earbugs avoid this phone by all means 0 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
just whatever you do avoid groove as its the antithesis of all that is good about human traffic 0 
victor mclaglen was even bad and brian donlevy was almost unrecognizable 0 
the stories were as unbelievable as the actors 0 
the directing and the cinematography arent quite as good 0 
seriously killer hot chai latte 1 
very displeased 0 
never been to hard rock casino before will never ever step forward in it again 0 
this is one of the worst sandra bullock movie since speed 2 but not quite that bad 0 
and considering the two of us left there very full and happy for about 20 you just cant go wrong 1 
never again will i be dining at this place 0 
very slow at seating even with reservation 0 
i might have gotten a defect but i would not risk buying it again because of the built quality alone 0 
its one of the movies i need to see whenever it comes on tvnever mind the fact that i already have it memorized 1 
what is even more stupid is that who had thought an idea that there should be a volcano in los angeles 0 
customer service was terrible 0 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
very dissapointing performance 0 
this is a simple little phone to use but the breakage is unacceptible 0 
nice docking station for home or work 1 
it also took her forever to bring us the check when we asked for it 0 
he was terrible 0 
good servicecheck 1 
to my disbelief each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods i have ever tasted 0 
i love being able to use one headset for both by landline and cell 1 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
could not get strong enough signal 0 
lots of holes in the script 0 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic 1 
how can anyone in their right mind ask for anything more from a movie than this 1 
the volume switch rocketed out of the unit to a destination unknown 0 
good service very clean and inexpensive to boot 1 
linksys should have some way to exchange a bad phone for a refurb unit or something 0 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
all in all i think it was a good investment 1 
terrible phone holder 0 
the only very disappointing thing was there was no speakerphone 0 
also were served hot bread and butter and home made potato chips with bacon bits on topvery original and very good 1 
lifetime does not air it enough so if anyone knows what store sells it let me know because this is a musthave 1 
it is wonderful and inspiring to watch and i hope that it gets released again on to video or dvd 1 
phone now holds charge like it did when it was new 1 
i love my 350 headset my jabra350 bluetooth headset is great the reception is very good and the ear piece is a comfortable fit 1 
you wont forget this movie 1 
im happy about this purchase good quality and low price 1 
however after about a year the fliptop started to get loose and wobbly and eventually my screen went black and i couldnt receive and place calls 0 
while i managed to bend the leaf spring back in place the metal now has enough stress that it will break on the next drop 0 
and the accents are absolutely abysmal 0 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
love this place hits the spot when i want something healthy but not lacking in quantity or flavor 1 
yes i am simplifying things here for the sake of brevity for this really is at the core of the problems with this film it has too much going on without any real fulfilling explanation 0 
they never brought a salad we asked for 0 
superb phone on a great network 1 
this movie now joins revenge of the boogeyman and zombiez as part of the hellish trinity of horror films 0 
emily watsons character is very strong and she has only to give a quick glance and you understand everything 1 
camerawork again bad 0 
worth every penny 1 
i am so tired of clichés that is just lazy writing and here they come in thick and fast 0 
the worst experience ever 0 
overall i wasnt very impressed with noca 0 
great phone 1 
this movie is bad 0 
the films dialogue is natural real to life 1 
we wont be returning 0 
i dont think you will be disappointed 1 
would come back again if i had a sushi craving while in vegas 1 
some may say this buffet is pricey but i think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot 1 
food was so gooodd 1 
buyer beware you could flush money right down the toilet 0 
im super pissd 0 
i dont know what kind it is but they have the best iced tea 1 
this place is way too overpriced for mediocre food 0 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
im in az all the time and now have my new spot 1 
great case and price 1 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
the performances are real and gripping the crocdodile is extremely well done indeed if the black water website is to be believed thats because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous 1 
im very disappointed with my decision 0 
i liked this movie way too much 1 
good price 1 
and those baby owls were adorable 1 
the food was delicious our bartender was attentive and personable and we got a great deal 1 
filmiing was less expansive 0 
it also took her forever to bring us the check when we asked for it 0 
the feel of the dining room was more college cooking course than high class dining and the service was slow at best 0 
dessert panna cotta was amazing 1 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
my headset works just peachykeen 1 
last time buying from you 0 
i checked everywhere and there is no feature for it which is really disappointing 0 
the accompanied software is almost brilliant 1 
i tried talking real loud but shouting on the telephone gets old and i was still told it wasnt great 0 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
fantastic buy and will get again for whatever my next phone is 1 
excellent sound battery life and inconspicuous to boot 1 
one more thing i can tolerate political incorrectness very well im all for artistic freedom and suspension of disbelief but the slavic female character was just too much 0 
punishment park is a brilliant piece of cinema 1 
camera color balance is awful 0 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
check it out 1 
unfortunately any virtue in this films production work was lost on a regrettable script 0 
i really wanted the plantronics 510 to be the right one but it has too many issues for methe good 0 
the acting was bad 0 
i got it because it was so small and adorable 1 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
do not waste your money here 0 
sucked most of the stuff does not work with my phone 0 
how awful she is 0 
so good i am going to have to review this place twice once hereas a tribute to the place and once as a tribute to an event held here last night 1 
insults profound deuchebaggery and had to go outside for a smoke break while serving just to solidify it 0 
110 and only because there is no setting for 010 0 
it was a pale color instead of nice and char and has no flavor 0 
but in terms of the writing its very fresh and bold 1 
but now i was completely grossed out 0 
however i needed some better instructions 0 
the service here is fair at best 0 
it is the best charger i have seen on the market yet 1 
the pizza selections are good 1 
it really created a unique feeling though 1 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
great product 1 
very nice and relaxing late night viewing 1 
the chips and sals a here is amazing 1 
i love my 350 headset my jabra350 bluetooth headset is great the reception is very good and the ear piece is a comfortable fit 1 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
the basic premise is wasted since it is sidelined by the inexplicable focus on the documentary crew 0 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
often the dialogue doesnt really follow from one line to another or fit the surroundings 0 
thats how id describe this painfully dreary timewaster of a film 0 
the decor is nice and the piano music soundtrack is pleasant 1 
very tough and very short on flavor 0 
there were several moments in the movie that just didnt need to be there and were excruciatingly slow moving 0 
a good time 1 
poor sound quality 0 
the seasonal fruit was fresh white peach puree 1 
jabra ear gels r the best 1 
the selection was probably the worst ive seen in vegasthere was none 0 
a fantastic neighborhood gem 1 
we loved the biscuits 1 
i have bought this nokia cell phone a few weeks ago and it was a nightmare 0 
very good stuff for the price 1 
a cheap and cheerless heist movie with poor characterisation lots of underbite style stoic emoting think chow yun fat in a better tomorrow and some cheesy clichés thrown into an abandoned factory ready for a few poorly executed flying judo rolls a la john woo 0 
for that its worth checking out 1 
this really is how vegas fine dining used to be right down to the menus handed to the ladies that have no prices listed 1 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
the server was very negligent of our needs and made us feel very unwelcome i would not suggest this place 0 
once you get inside youll be impressed with the place 1 
i have yet to run this new battery below two bars and thats three days without charging 1 
great character actors telly savalas and peter boyle 1 
it was horrendous 0 
an excellent new restaurant by an experienced frenchman 1 
it is zillion times away from reality 0 
this is a beautiful phone 1 
then i watched it again two sundays ago march 20th 2005 and i began to really enjoy it and this time i taped the entire thing 1 
i ordered albondigas soup which was just warm and tasted like tomato soup with frozen meatballs 0 
i would avoid this place if you are staying in the mirage 0 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
the food was very good 1 
waste of money 0 
were jerks on the phone 0 
i especially liked the noncliche choices with the parents in other movies i could predict the dialog verbatim but the writing in this movie made better selections 1 
ive bought 5 wired headphones that sound better than these 0 
what did bother me was the slow service 0 
i highly recommend these and encourage people to give them a try 1 
only had this a month but its worked flawlessly so far 1 
you get what you pay for i guess 0 
this was utterly confusing at first which caused me to lose a couple of very very important contacts 0 
i hate movies like that 0 
the headsets are easy to use and everyone loves them 1 
what a piece of junk i lose more calls on this phone 0 
i purchased this and within 2 days it was no longer working 0 
the films sole bright spot was jonah hill who will look almost unrecognizable to fans of the recent superbad due to the amount of weight he lost in the interim 1 
the service was not up to par either 0 
not recommended 0 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
once you get inside youll be impressed with the place 1 
phone now holds charge like it did when it was new 1 
the phone was unusable and was not new 0 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
i ate there twice on my last visit and especially enjoyed the salmon salad 1 
comes with a strong light that you can use to light up your camera shots and even flash sos signals seriously 1 
works great when my cat attacked the phone he scratched the protective strip instead of destroying the screen 1 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
the food is not tasty at all not to say its real traditional hunan style 0 
they are so easy to love but even more easy to identify with 1 
one of my favorite purchases ever 1 
this is by far the worst purchase ive made on amazon 0 
the stories were powerful explorations of the nature of man and of art 1 
on the good side the staff was genuinely pleasant and enthusiastic a real treat 1 
although i very much liked the look and sound of this place the actual experience was a bit disappointing 0 
bad script bad direction and horrible acting make this one plain bad 0 
overall i rate this movie a 10 out of a 110 scale 1 
i would have given no star if i was able 0 
dont waste your time here 0 
also the area where my unit broke im not too fond of the magnetic strap 0 
camerawork again bad 0 
excellent sound battery life and inconspicuous to boot 1 
this movie totally grates on my nerves 0 
the battery is completely useless to me 0 
do not waste your time 0 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
the puppets look really cheesy not in a good way like in the puppet master 80s flicks 0 
disappointed 0 
its reception is very very poor 0 
for people who are first timers in film making i think they did an excellent job 1 
our server was super nice and checked on us many times 1 
their research and development division obviously knows what theyre doing 1 
eew this location needs a complete overhaul 0 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
horrible 0 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
in particular the relationship between the bakery assistant and the waitress just didnt work for me at all 0 
summary the witticisms werent witty 0 
internet is excrutiatingly slow 0 
that being said for a phone the camera is very nice many cool effects to play with and video is decent as well 1 
top line dont waste your time and money on this one its as bad as it comes 0 
at any rate this film stinks its not funny and fulci should have stayed with giallo and supernatural zombie movies 0 
feelings thoughtsgabriels discomfort during the danceall these intangibles leap to life and come within the viewers grasp in hustons portrayal 1 
i really hope the team behind this movie makes more movies and that they will continue to do so in their own some kinda weird style 1 
it is so small and you dont even realize that it is there after a while of getting used to it 1 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
food was so gooodd 1 
the classic maine lobster roll was fantastic 1 
if that bug never showed up i would have given a 4 for sure but on the other side of the wall where this bug was climbing was the kitchen 0 
we waited for thirty minutes to be seated although there were 8 vacant tables and we were the only folks waiting 0 
today the graphics are crap 0 
nicest chinese restaurant ive been in a while 1 
judith light is one of my favorite actresses and i think she does a superb job in this film 1 
its extremely slow and takes forever to do anything with it 0 
voice recognition is tremendous 1 
i can barely ever hear on it and am constantly saying what 0 
for people who are first timers in film making i think they did an excellent job 1 
what a disappointment 0 
food was great and so was the serivce 1 
the volume for the ringer is real good you have choices how loud 1 
i find wasting food to be despicable but this just wasnt food 0 
w810i is just superb 1 
very easy to use 1 
i immediately said i wanted to talk to the manager but i did not want to talk to the guy who was doing shots of fireball behind the bar 0 
i asked multiple times for the wine list and after some time of being ignored i went to the hostess and got one myself 0 
in other words the content level of this film is enough to easily fill a dozen other films 1 
ive seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie 0 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
it was not good 0 
i work in the hospitality industry in paradise valley and have refrained from recommending cibo any longer 0 
the music in the film is really nice too 1 
trouble is the writing and directing make it impossible to establish those things that make a movie watchable like character story theme and so on 0 
i want to first say our server was great and we had perfect service 1 
in fact im going to round up to 4 stars just because she was so awesome 1 
i am glad i purchased it 1 
despite the pans of reviewers i liked this movie 1 
highly entertaining at all angles 1 
battery chargelife is quite long 1 
the earpiece on this is too large or too heavyit keeps falling out of my ear 0 
the delivery was on time 1 
one more thing i can tolerate political incorrectness very well im all for artistic freedom and suspension of disbelief but the slavic female character was just too much 0 
i was seated immediately 1 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
the sangria was about half of a glass wine full and was 12 ridiculous 0 
it felt too light and tinny 0 
for a product that costs as much as this one does i expect it to work far better and with greater ease than this thing does 0 
its welldesigned and very sharp the blue is a very nice color 1 
i would recommend purchasing the jabra jx10 series 2 which works flawlessly with my moto q go figure 1 
so far so good 1 
for that its worth checking out 1 
great phone 1 
nice headphones for the price and they work great 1 
one thing i hate is the mode set button at the side 0 
very bad performance plays angela bennett a computer expert who is at home all the time 0 
i got the aluminum case for my new palm vx and it worked really wellit has protected my handheld perfectly so far 1 
good quality 1 
this early film from future goremeister lucio fulci is a very good addition to the giallo subgenre 1 
the films dialogue is natural real to life 1 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
i sat riveted to the tv screen 1 
john wayne did an incredible job for being so young in the movie industry 1 
so flavorful and has just the perfect amount of heat 1 
great hands free device 1 
only had this a month but its worked flawlessly so far 1 
if you look for authentic thai food go else where 0 
the fact is this film is a wonderful heartwarming tale about two people chasing their dreams 1 
overall i wasnt very impressed with noca 0 
the soundtrack sucked 0 
ryans bar is definitely one edinburgh establishment i wont be revisiting 0 
the food was great as always compliments to the chef 1 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
but despite these few flaws this case is of exceptional quality and well worth the additional costs of owning an official oem product 1 
every thing on phone work perfectly she like it 1 
for a self proclaimed coffee cafe i was wildly disappointed 0 
for the price this was a great deal 1 
im translating movies for a living and this is the first movie in my 5year working experience that i found offensive to my intelligence 0 
on three different occasions i asked for well done or medium well and all three times i got the bloodiest piece of meat on my plate 0 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
its like a really sexy party in your mouth where youre outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party 1 
my ribeye steak was cooked perfectly and had great mesquite flavor 1 
prosgood camera very nice pictures also has cool styles like black and white and more 1 
this scene is very strong and unpleasant 0 
they were goldencrispy and delicious 1 
for a self proclaimed coffee cafe i was wildly disappointed 0 
im terribly disappointed that this film would receive so many awards and accolades especially when there are far more deserving works of film out there 0 
the folks at otto always make us feel so welcome and special 1 
would recommend this item 1 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
which are small and not worth the price 0 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
during several different 2 minute calls i experienced 5 drops and it was in an area that had 5 bars 0 
this is some seriously good pizza and im an expertconnisseur on the topic 1 
even the squibs look awful 0 
much more interesting more action more suspense and less of the unneeded controversy 1 
this phone is very fast with sending any kind of messages and web browsing is significantly faster than previous phones i have used 1 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
tied to charger for conversations lasting more than 45 minutesmajor problems 0 
aside from its terrible lead this film has loads of other debits 0 
i especially love the long battery life 1 
this second appearance of mickey mouse following the silent plane crazy earlier that year is probably his most famous filmmostly because it was so groundbreaking 1 
we enjoy their pizza and brunch 1 
fantastic food 1 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
their chow mein is so good 1 
cant upload ringtones from a third party 0 
it is wonderful and inspiring to watch and i hope that it gets released again on to video or dvd 1 
the film deserves strong kudos for taking this stand for having exceptional acting from its mostly lesserknown cast and for the superintelligent script that doesnt insult the audience or take the easy way out when it comes to white racism 1 
highly recommended 1 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
i purcashed this for the car charger and it does not work 0 
food quality has been horrible 0 
the lead man is charismafree 0 
its this pandering to the audience that sabotages most of his films 0 
the service here is fair at best 0 
the characters are interesting and you really care for them 1 
an extensive menu provides lots of options for breakfast 1 
i bought this battery with a coupon from amazon and im very happy with my purchase 1 
i left with a stomach ache and felt sick the rest of the day 0 
i got the car charger and not even after a week the charger was brokeni went to plug it in and it started smoking 0 
not easy to watch 0 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
the plot well i said id let that one go 0 
plantronics bluetooth excelent buy 1 
there is no plot here to keep you going in the first place 0 
this phone works great 1 
great headset very impressed h500 1 
not a pleasant voyage of selfdiscovery 0 
if it were possible to give them zero stars theyd have it 0 
this place is handsdown one of the best places to eat in the phoenix metro area 1 
the service here is fair at best 0 
if there was ever an indication of a writer and a directors ability to meld two highly volatile temperaments into a seamless union of creativity then this is it 1 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
that company is a joke 0 
def coming back to bowl next time 1 
the acting is beyond abysmal 0 
id rather eat airline food seriously 0 
very prompt service 1 
as an earlier review noted plug in this charger and nothing happens 0 
no ear loop needed its tiny and the sound is great 1 
i promise they wont disappoint 1 
having to humour him just to get by and get through the day was so apt 1 
bluetooth range is good a few days ago i left my phone in the trunk got a call and carried the conversation without a hitch 1 
for 40 bucks a head i really expect better food 0 
just does not work 0 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
the movie is littered with overt racial slurs towards the black cast members and in return the whites are depicted as morons and boobs 0 
this movie is greatespecially if you enjoy visual arts 1 
i would give this television series a 10 plus if i could 1 
i advise you to look out for it 1 
eew this location needs a complete overhaul 0 
overall the film is interesting and thoughtprovoking 1 
the battery is working well as a replacement for the original that came with the phone over 2 years ago 1 
this is my new fav vegas buffet spot 1 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
it was a drive to get there 0 
the plot simply rumbles on like a machine desperately depending on the addition of new scenes 0 
spoilers whatever else can or cant be said about it surface is superbly crafted 1 
how can you call yourself a steakhouse if you cant properly cook a steak i dont understand 0 
the best place in vegas for breakfast just check out a sat or sun 1 
excellent cast story line performances 1 
we sat another ten minutes and finally gave up and left 0 
it is wonderful and inspiring to watch and i hope that it gets released again on to video or dvd 1 
the service was a little slow considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace 0 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
artless camerawork endlessly presents us with the ugliest setting imaginable ie 0 
not loud enough and doesnt turn on like it should 0 
probably not in a hurry to go back 0 
it was horrible 0 
all in all an excellent restaurant highlighted by great service a unique menu and a beautiful setting 1 
bad choice 0 
great pizza and salads 1 
his losing his marbles so early in the proceedings is totally implausible and unconvincing 0 
paolo sorrentino has written a wonderful story about loneliness and tony has built one of the most unforgettable characters seen in movies in recent years 1 
these headphones were a great find and i think they are perhaps the best purchase ive made in the last several years seriously 1 
just reading on the specs alone makes you say wow 1 
the scallop dish is quite appalling for value as well 0 
must have been an off night at this place 0 
aside from its terrible lead this film has loads of other debits 0 
you wont forget this movie 1 
and service was super friendly 1 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
and considering the two of us left there very full and happy for about 20 you just cant go wrong 1 
this movie is excellentangel is beautiful and scamp is adorablehis little yelps when hes scaredand the funniest parts are whenscamp is caught under the curtain and when angel and scamp are singing ive never had this feeling beforei totally recommend this movieits coming out on special edition on june 20the cover has scamp on a garbage can and angel underneath the lid 1 
a fly was in my apple juice a fly 0 
at least think to refill my water before i struggle to wave you over for 10 minutes 0 
this is a great deal 1 
im in az all the time and now have my new spot 1 
i am pairing this with my iphone and i could not be happier with it so far 1 
good transmit audio 1 
that company is a joke 0 
it is zillion times away from reality 0 
but despite these few flaws this case is of exceptional quality and well worth the additional costs of owning an official oem product 1 
the awful dialogue and hopeless overacting by everyone who gets shot top off a real waste of space and time 0 
i own 2 of these cases and would order another 1 
during several different 2 minute calls i experienced 5 drops and it was in an area that had 5 bars 0 
to those who find this movie intelligent or even masterful i can only say its your intelligence and your imagination you obviously used to try and make some sense of this pitiful attempt its in our human nature to try and make sense of things 0 
sounds good reasonably priced and effective its that simple 1 
all in all id expected a better consumer experience from motorola 0 
i had the mac salad and it was pretty bland so i will not be getting that again 0 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
if it was to turn my good day feeling into a night of disturbing memories than i guess he succeeded 0 
oh the charger seems to work fine 1 
this is a good joint 1 
i felt as though her going to ireland did absolutely nothing whatsoever 0 
it is easy to turn on and off when you are in the car and the volume controls are quite accessable 1 
the basic premise is wasted since it is sidelined by the inexplicable focus on the documentary crew 0 
come hungry leave happy and stuffed 1 
it was forced like everything in this movie 0 
i sat riveted to the tv screen 1 
i think not again 0 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
my side greek salad with the greek dressing was so tasty and the pita and hummus was very refreshing 1 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
very easy to use 1 
one of the best mexican movies ever and one of the less understood even by mexican themselves no matter how identified the should have felt with it 1 
the descriptions said yum yum sauce and another said eel sauce yet another said spicy mayowell none of the rolls had sauces on them 0 
this was one of the worst films i have ever seen 0 
overall a delight 1 
conclusion very filling meals 1 
jamie foxx absolutely is ray charles 1 
when my mom and i got home she immediately got sick and she only had a few bites of salad 0 
utterly without merit on any level this is akin to torture 0 
do not buy if you want to use the holster 0 
unfortunately this is a bad movie that is just plain bad 0 
the food is not tasty at all not to say its real traditional hunan style 0 
he surely doesnt know how to make a coherent action movie from the screenwriter of air force one who was only obliged to write the script just for a big sum of money 0 
its a case of so bad it is laughable 0 
this is so embarassing and also my ears hurt if i try to push the ear plug into my ear 0 
our server was super nice and checked on us many times 1 
then a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use 0 
looks great and is strong 1 
at any rate this film stinks its not funny and fulci should have stayed with giallo and supernatural zombie movies 0 
you truly take this journey through the eyes and soul of a child 1 
his use of the colours of the french flag in the three films was nothing short of incredible every shot every scene was like a work of art 1 
on a positive note our server was very attentive and provided great service 1 
seller shipped quickly and much cheaper than the competitors 1 
i thought it was bad 0 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
great it was new packaged nice works good no problems and it came in less time then i expected 1 
i will not return 0 
i did not bother contacting the company for few dollar product but i learned the lesson that i should not have bought this form online anyway 0 
as for the killer dont expect anything original or even remotely frightening 0 
i find this inexcusable and so will probably be returning this phone and perhaps changing carriers 0 
i think that it is a must see older john wayne film 1 
schrader has made a resume full of lousy amateurish films 0 
definitely will come back here again 1 
its too bad the food is so damn generic 0 
im in az all the time and now have my new spot 1 
the ending is so so perfect youll shed a tear 1 
the charger arrived within the promised timeframe but it did not work 0 
i cannot believe that the actors agreed to do this film 0 
the volume for the ringer is real good you have choices how loud 1 
editing the editing of this film was phenomenal in my opinion 1 
the writer gorman bechard undoubtedly did his homework because all references are industry and characterage appropriate 1 
this phone is very fast with sending any kind of messages and web browsing is significantly faster than previous phones i have used 1 
damian is so talented and versatile in so many ways of writing and portraying different characters on screen 1 
everything from acting to cinematography was solid 1 
not a good item it worked for a while then started having problems in my auto reverse tape player 0 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
this place should honestly be blown up 0 
i love this phone 1 
it looks very nice 1 
the mic there is a joke and the volume is quite low 0 
then our food came out disappointment ensued 0 
both of the egg rolls were fantastic 1 
good product good seller 1 
worthwhile 1 
poor construction 0 
i have had this phone for over a year now and i will tell you its not that great 0 
i got to enjoy the seafood salad with a fabulous vinegrette 1 
very disappointing 0 
maybe there would be a reasonable explanation for this atrocity 0 
every element of this story was so over the top excessively phony and contrived that it was painful to sit through 0 
good value works fine power via usb car or wall outlet 1 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
i would highly recommend this product 1 
very good product well made 1 
do not purchase this phone 0 
good food good service 1 
waitress was sweet and funny 1 
great headset very impressed h500 1 
it was absolutely amazing 1 
i find this inexcusable and so will probably be returning this phone and perhaps changing carriers 0 
because both ears are occupied background is not distracting at all 1 
cumbersome design 0 
the staff is always super friendly and helpful which is especially cool when you bring two small boys and a baby 1 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
he was very impressed when going from the original battery to the extended battery 1 
good product good seller 1 
the price is reasonable and the service is great 1 
in fact im going to round up to 4 stars just because she was so awesome 1 
i had to wait over 30 minutes to get my drink and longer to get 2 arepas 0 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
an italian reviewer called this a small great film and thats right 1 
a happy wonderful feel good ending 1 
there was a warm feeling with the service and i felt like their guest for a special treat 1 
best tater tots in the southwest 1 
what a mistake that was 0 
and it was way to expensive 0 
it never condescends all the characters have good genuine hearts and believable problems 1 
i ordered the voodoo pasta and it was the first time id had really excellent pasta since going gluten free several years ago 1 
its too bad that everyone else involved didnt share crowes level of dedication to quality for if they did wed have a far better film on our hands than this subpar mess 0 
great food 1 
im trying to return it for a refund 0 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
clever and a real crowdpleaserthis film still ranks among mickeys best films even after 80 wonderful years 1 
its worth driving up from tucson 1 
the script is bad very bad  it contains both cheesiness and unethical joke that you normally see in rated r or nc17 movie 0 
wasted two hours 0 
a piece of cinematic garbage captured on celluloid 0 
one more thing i can tolerate political incorrectness very well im all for artistic freedom and suspension of disbelief but the slavic female character was just too much 0 
once you get inside youll be impressed with the place 1 
clever and a real crowdpleaserthis film still ranks among mickeys best films even after 80 wonderful years 1 
the battery works great 1 
schrader has made a resume full of lousy amateurish films 0 
good quality 1 
the story starts too fast with absolutely no suspense or buildup in the slightest 0 
they have a really nice atmosphere 1 
the problem i have is that they charge 1199 for a sandwich that is no bigger than a subway sub which offers better and more amount of vegetables 0 
i will come back here every time im in vegas 1 
their daily specials are always a hit with my group 1 
internet is excrutiatingly slow 0 
im super pissd 0 
otherwise easy to install and use clear sound 1 
i was mortified 0 
buyer beware you could flush money right down the toilet 0 
ive tried several different earpieces for my cell phone and this jabra one is the first one ive found that fits my ear comfortably 1 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
i guess i liked the details of his dysfunctionhe was believable 1 
after all the rave reviews i couldnt wait to eat herewhat a disappointment 0 
i wish i could return the unit and get back my money 0 
awesome service and food 1 
great place fo take out or eat in 1 
cumbersome design 0 
both actors truly understand and become their particular character delivering a convincing sincere performance 1 
this is infuriating 0 
not loud enough and doesnt turn on like it should 0 
we wont be going back anytime soon 0 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
our server was very nice and even though he looked a little overwhelmed with all of our needs he stayed professional and friendly until the end 1 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
i left with a stomach ache and felt sick the rest of the day 0 
this item is fantastic and works perfectly 1 
the film is well paced understated and one of the best courtroom documentaries ive seen 1 
im surprised this is a good quality car charger and theres not much reviews about it 1 
i exchanged the sony ericson z500a for this and im pretty happy with that decision 1 
i highly recommend these and encourage people to give them a try 1 
i had high hopes for this place since the burgers are cooked over a charcoal grill but unfortunately the taste fell flat way flat 0 
i exchanged the sony ericson z500a for this and im pretty happy with that decision 1 
i had the chicken pho and it tasted very bland 0 
its worth driving up from tucson 1 
then i had to continue pairing it periodically since it somehow kept dropping 0 
the bottowm lineanother worthless cheap gimmick from sprint 0 
first time there and might just be the last 0 
i ate there twice on my last visit and especially enjoyed the salmon salad 1 
i am very happy 1 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
she ordered a toasted english muffin that came out untoasted 0 
the phone loads super 1 
the casting is also horrible cause all you see is a really really bad actors period 0 
does not fit 0 
car charger as well as ac charger are included to make sure you never run out of juicehighy recommended 1 
nice design and quality 1 
would not recommend to others 0 
ryans bar is definitely one edinburgh establishment i wont be revisiting 0 
the mic there is a joke and the volume is quite low 0 
you truly take this journey through the eyes and soul of a child 1 
it was quite comfortable in the ear 1 
good show samsung 1 
there were several moments in the movie that just didnt need to be there and were excruciatingly slow moving 0 
useless phone simply deaf 0 
the battery is completely useless to me 0 
enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film 1 
painful on the ear 0 
the volume switch rocketed out of the unit to a destination unknown 0 
the servers are not pleasant to deal with and they dont always honor pizza hut coupons 0 
lovely little thriller from hitchcock with lots of nice shenanigans surrounding a murdered spy a kidnapped child a nasty church a foreign plot and some random taxidermists 1 
item arrived quickly and works great with my metro pcs samsung schr450 slider phone and sony premium sound in ear plugs 1 
spoilers whatever else can or cant be said about it surface is superbly crafted 1 
this isnt a small family restaurant this is a fine dining establishment 1 
so far so good 1 
kris kristoffersen is good in this movie and really makes a difference 1 
it was that loudglad to say that the plantronics 510 maintains a flawless connection to my cell and with no static during normal use 1 
the eargels channel the sound directly into your ear and seem to increase the sound volume and clarity 1 
battery chargelife is quite long 1 
i am so tired of clichés that is just lazy writing and here they come in thick and fast 0 
if there were zero stars i would give it zero stars 0 
its pretty easy 1 
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
its too bad the food is so damn generic 0 
you could drive a semi truck into these holes 0 
i went on motorolas website and followed all directions but could not get it to pair again 0 
great food 1 
awful 0 
gotta love those closeups of slimy drooling teeth 1 
the sangria was about half of a glass wine full and was 12 ridiculous 0 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
yet plantronincs continues to use the same flawed charger design 0 
the biggest complaint i have is the battery drains superfast 0 
not loud enough and doesnt turn on like it should 0 
poor product 0 
i can assure you that you wont be disappointed 1 
these products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet 0 
see both films if you can 1 
the plug did not work very well 0 
o my gosh the best phone i have ever had 1 
it did not work in my cell phone plug i am very up set with the charger 0 
call me a nut but i think this is one of the best movies ever 1 
how can anyone in their right mind ask for anything more from a movie than this 1 
damian is so talented and versatile in so many ways of writing and portraying different characters on screen 1 
then i had to continue pairing it periodically since it somehow kept dropping 0 
very funny 1 
it makes very strange ticking noises before it ends the call 0 
this was a poor remake of my best friends wedding 0 
for a product that costs as much as this one does i expect it to work far better and with greater ease than this thing does 0 
imdb ratings only go as low 1 for awful its time to get some negative numbers in there for cases such as these 0 
also great directing and photography 1 
feelings thoughtsgabriels discomfort during the danceall these intangibles leap to life and come within the viewers grasp in hustons portrayal 1 
waited 2 hours never got either of our pizzas as many other around us who came in later did 0 
reasonably priced also 1 
eclectic selection 1 
but whatever it was that cost them so much it didnt translate to quality thats for sure 0 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
i dont have very many words to say about this place but it does everything pretty well 1 
its worth driving up from tucson 1 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
never again will i be dining at this place 0 
i really liked that 1 
this is actually a very smart movie 1 
you can find better movies at youtube 0 
if it was to turn my good day feeling into a night of disturbing memories than i guess he succeeded 0 
i love the look and feel of samsung flipphones 1 
well just if you keep thinking how bad it is 0 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
characters are onedimensional even the good guys and especially the bad guys 0 
the acting is fantastic the stories are seamlessly woven together and the dogs are splendid a must rent view or see 1 
this short film certainly pulls no punches 0 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
on the good side the staff was genuinely pleasant and enthusiastic a real treat 1 
excellent phone 1 
the selection was probably the worst ive seen in vegasthere was none 0 
internet is excrutiatingly slow 0 
the service was a little slow considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace 0 
i swung in to give them a try but was deeply disappointed 0 
makes it easier to keep up with my bluetooth when im not wearing it 0 
they keep getting better and better this is my third one and ive had numerous palms too 1 
the art style has the appearance of crayonpencil drawings and is wonderfully colorful and fanciful 1 
doesnt hold charge 0 
it is rare when a filmmaker takes the time to tell a worthy moral tale with care and love that doesnt fall into the trap of being overly syrupy or over indulgent 1 
i love this phone it is very handy and has a lot of features 1 
i agree with jessica this movie is pretty bad 0 
will not be back 0 
plug was the wrong size 0 
there arent death scenes like in previous movies and the fx are terrible 0 
i loved it 1 
you cant go wrong with any of the food here 1 
before i go in to why i gave a 1 star rating please know that this was my third time eating at bachi burger before writing a review 0 
i go to far too many places and ive never seen any restaurant that serves a 1 egg breakfast especially for 400 0 
but it is great i would really recommend it 1 
on the negative its insipid enough to cause regret for another 2 hours of life wasted in front of the screen 0 
i searched the internet and found this one to be the best value 1 
i definitly recommend 1 
owners are really great people 1 
i could care less the interior is just beautiful 1 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
everything about this movie is stupid 0 
awesome device 1 
strike 2 who wants to be rushed 0 
the concert sequences just sucked 0 
cool phone 1 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
customer service was terrible 0 
great food and service huge portions and they give a military discount 1 
nice design and quality 1 
the owners are super friendly and the staff is courteous 1 
no one at the table thought the food was above average or worth the wait that we had for it 0 
doesnt work 0 
steer clear of this product and go with the genuine palm replacementr pens which come in a threepack 0 
the telephone repair man was really funny and his reactions to the nuts and bitchy boss were truly genuine 1 
i love this place 1 
it has all the features i want 1 
the food was excellent and service was very good 1 
phenomenal food service and ambiance 1 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
it is rare when a filmmaker takes the time to tell a worthy moral tale with care and love that doesnt fall into the trap of being overly syrupy or over indulgent 1 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
it was too predictable even for a chick flick 0 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
but it does get better reception and clarity than any phone ive had before 1 
this product is clearly not ready for prime time i dont care how cool it looks if you cant tell a call is coming in its worthless 0 
definitely worth seeing its the sort of thought provoking film that forces you to question your own threshold of loneliness 1 
worst thai ever 0 
excellent bluetooth headset 1 
awful 0 
the veggitarian platter is out of this world 1 
that one didnt work either 0 
one of my favorite purchases ever 1 
wasted two hours 0 
the nokia ca42 usb cable did not work with my phone 0 
the story line is just awful 0 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
an instant classic with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits 1 
an absolute must visit 1 
not recommended 0 
the kids are very cool too 1 
ive tried several different earpieces for my cell phone and this jabra one is the first one ive found that fits my ear comfortably 1 
it worked very well 1 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
treo and tmobile refused to replace it again and forced me to buy another phone without any kind of upgrade discount 0 
it was horrible 0 
itll be a regular stop on my trips to phoenix 1 
items stated as included from the description are not included 0 
great product 1 
hayao miyazakis latest and eighth film for studio ghibili gake no ue no ponyo ponyo on the cliff by the sea is a wonderfully fun and imaginative look at childhood 1 
i bought this to use with my kindle fire and absolutely loved it 1 
the turkey and roast beef were bland 0 
the worst phone ive ever had only had it for a few months 0 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
mark my words this is one of those cult films like evil dead 2 or phantasm that people will still be discovering and falling in love with 20 30 40 years down the line 1 
it came free with a dvd player i bought but i still turned the thing off halfway through because i was embarrassed for howell 0 
it rocked my world and is certainly a must see for anyone with no social or physical outlets 1 
do not buy for d807wrongly advertised for d807 0 
the ear buds only play music in one ear 0 
the flat reenactments dont hold your attention because they are emotionally adrift and stagy 0 
i loved it it was really scary 1 
the handsfree part works fine but then the car tries to download the address book and the treo rebootsoverall i still rate this device high 1 
not loud enough and doesnt turn on like it should 0 
well im satisfied 1 
there is really nothing for me at postinos hope your experience is better 0 
this phone is slim and light and the display is beautiful 1 
omg i felt like i had never eaten thai food until this dish 1 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
must have been an off night at this place 0 
it works fine on my motorola 325 cellphone and a lot better than the wornout battery did 1 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
excellent sound battery life and inconspicuous to boot 1 
i got this phone on reccomendation from a relative and im glad i did 1 
then the film just dropped the ball 0 
my mother and brother had to do thiswhen i saw robert ryan portraying this type of man it was a very good imitation of this type of individual and i was impressed 1 
the selection was probably the worst ive seen in vegasthere was none 0 
this is the place where i first had pho and it was amazing 1 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
she carries the movie well 1 
but in any case the best part is you can download these pictures to your laptop using ir or even send pictures from your laptop to the phone 1 
i was sitting in my vehicle with the cradle on my belt and the headset lost signal 0 
the selection of food was not the best 0 
i always order from the vegetarian menu during dinner which has a wide array of options to choose from 1 
20th century foxs road house 1948 is not only quite a silly noir but is an implausible unmitigated bore of a movie 0 
to my disbelief each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods i have ever tasted 0 
this mostly routine factbased tv drama gets a boost from the fine performance by cole 1 
horrible had to switch 3 times 0 
absolutely great 1 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
i think that it is a must see older john wayne film 1 
wow loved this place 1 
clever and a real crowdpleaserthis film still ranks among mickeys best films even after 80 wonderful years 1 
stay away from this store be careful 0 
everything about it is just bad 0 
worst ever 0 
this really is how vegas fine dining used to be right down to the menus handed to the ladies that have no prices listed 1 
im surprised this is a good quality car charger and theres not much reviews about it 1 
i will never go back to this place and will never ever recommended this place to anyone 0 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
there was so much hype over this phone that i assumed it was the best my mistake 0 
ive owned this phone for 7 months now and can say that its the best mobile phone ive had 1 
highly recommended 1 
appears to actually outperform the original battery from china that came with my v325i 1 
very pleased with this headset 1 
battery chargelife is quite long 1 
my drink was never empty and he made some really great menu suggestions 1 
the vegetables are so fresh and the sauce feels like authentic thai 1 
i dont know exactly what it is about this movie but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our familys memories 1 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
this one wants to surf on the small wave of space movies in 1998 deep impact and armageddon and this one fails everywhere 0 
it really created a unique feeling though 1 
its not what it says it is 0 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
this results in the phone being either stuck at max volume or mute 0 
the restaurant atmosphere was exquisite 1 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
at a time when it seems that film animation has been dominated by disneypixars cgi masterpieces it is both refreshing and comforting to know that miyazaki is still relying on traditional handdrawn animation to tell his charming and enchanting stories 1 
the folks at otto always make us feel so welcome and special 1 
the script is a big flawed mess 0 
the phone loads super 1 
everything about it is just bad 0 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
the acting was bad the dialogs were extremely shallow and insincere 0 
i found this move beautiful enjoyable and uplifting 1 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
good product good seller 1 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
if there was ever an indication of a writer and a directors ability to meld two highly volatile temperaments into a seamless union of creativity then this is it 1 
avoid this one if you can 0 
horrible phone 0 
these headphones were a great find and i think they are perhaps the best purchase ive made in the last several years seriously 1 
the stories were as unbelievable as the actors 0 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
this movie is a good and humorous comment on life in 2006 1 
i literally vomited while watching this film 0 
it has all the features i want 1 
this is a really fantastic thai restaurant which is definitely worth a visit 1 
the food was great as always compliments to the chef 1 
on the ground right next to our table was a large smeared beensteppedinandtrackedeverywhere pile of green bird poop 0 
the awful dialogue and hopeless overacting by everyone who gets shot top off a real waste of space and time 0 
echo problemvery unsatisfactory 0 
some may say this buffet is pricey but i think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot 1 
wow what a bad film 0 
just what i wanted 1 
during several different 2 minute calls i experienced 5 drops and it was in an area that had 5 bars 0 
i mean really how do you get so famous for your fish and chips when its so terrible 0 
useless phone simply deaf 0 
eew this location needs a complete overhaul 0 
i have had mine for about a year and this christmas i bought some for the rest of the family 1 
full of unconvincing cardboard characters it is blandly written by edward chodorov who also produced and is surprisingly directed by jean negulesco from whom one would expect a great deal more 0 
i own 2 of these cases and would order another 1 
great headset very impressed h500 1 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
service was exceptional and food was a good as all the reviews 1 
similarly the delivery man did not say a word of apology when our food was 45 minutes late 0 
i bought this phone as a replacement for my startac and have regretted it since 0 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
it was a long time that i didnt see a so charismatic actor on screen 1 
dont waste your money 0 
the shower area is outside so you can only rinse not take a full shower unless you dont mind being nude for everyone to see 0 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
nice leather 1 
is it possible for a movie to get any worse than this 0 
the success of the film depends on the casting of sydney greenstreet as the alexander yardley character 1 
not as good as i had hoped 0 
motorola finally got the voice quality of a bluetooth headset right 1 
everything about it is just bad 0 
he was very impressed when going from the original battery to the extended battery 1 
talk about useless customer service 0 
at around 4 pm i bought it at around 8pm i started to watch at around 815pm i fast forwarded the remaining film to see if there was anything left watchable for a human being with a brain but there wasnt 0 
walked in and the place smelled like an old grease trap and only 2 others there eating 0 
this totally unfunny movie is so over the top and pathetic and unrealistic that throughout the whole 90 minutes of utter torture i probably looked at my watch about 70000 times 0 
worst martini ever 0 
at around 4 pm i bought it at around 8pm i started to watch at around 815pm i fast forwarded the remaining film to see if there was anything left watchable for a human being with a brain but there wasnt 0 
it was so bad i had lost the heart to finish it 0 
i cannot make calls at certain places 0 
you never know if you pushed it hard enough or the right number of times for the function you want or not 0 
the ending is so so perfect youll shed a tear 1 
just reading on the specs alone makes you say wow 1 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
i purchased this and within 2 days it was no longer working 0 
how this piece of trash was ever released is beyond me the acting the story the characters the supposedly special effects etcits all wrong 0 
they know how to make them here 1 
very good stuff for the price 1 
excellent hands free tool 1 
this second appearance of mickey mouse following the silent plane crazy earlier that year is probably his most famous filmmostly because it was so groundbreaking 1 
you wont be disappointed 1 
as a sushi lover avoid this place by all means 0 
i love my 350 headset my jabra350 bluetooth headset is great the reception is very good and the ear piece is a comfortable fit 1 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
okay i like to consider myself a fair critic so ill give credit where credits duethe creature effects were actually pretty cool 1 
a pretty good product 1 
so in a nutshell 1 the restaraunt smells like a combination of a dirty fish market and a sewer 0 
highly unprofessional and rude to a loyal patron 0 
the food was terrible 0 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
bad choice 0 
this product is clearly not ready for prime time i dont care how cool it looks if you cant tell a call is coming in its worthless 0 
very prompt service 1 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
the battery is working well as a replacement for the original that came with the phone over 2 years ago 1 
the film has great actors a master director a significant themeat least a wouldbe significant theme undertone of fifties existential worldweariness aerial scenes that ought to have thrilled both senses and imagination and characters about which one might deeply care 1 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
will not be back 0 
soggy and not good 0 
its one of the movies i need to see whenever it comes on tvnever mind the fact that i already have it memorized 1 
what i really like there is the crepe station 1 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
so i am here to warn youdo not rent this movie it is the dumbest thing you have never seen 0 
only like 3 or 4 buildings used a couple of locations maybe poor hummh 0 
the interplay between martin and emilio contains the same wonderful chemistry we saw in wall street with martin and charlie 1 
give this one a look 1 
it crackles with an unpredictable youthful energy but honestly i found it hard to follow and concentrate on it meanders so badly 0 
it has northern humour and positive about the community it represents 1 
fantastic food 1 
from what my dinner companions told meeverything was very fresh with nice texture and taste 1 
i give it 2 thumbs down 0 
the earpiece on this is too large or too heavyit keeps falling out of my ear 0 
fantastic service here 1 
great product 1 
this is definitely a cult classic well worth viewing and sharing with others 1 
hard to judge whether these sides were good because we were grossed out by the melted styrofoam and didnt want to eat it for fear of getting sick 0 
it was horrible 0 
totally believable 1 
just what i wanted 1 
worked perfectly 1 
go watch it 1 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
its been my choice headset for yearsgreat sound good volume good noise cancellation 1 
i guess maybe we went on an off night but it was disgraceful 0 
very very sad 0 
this is the place where i first had pho and it was amazing 1 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
ive never been treated so bad 0 
tasted like dirt 0 
not my thing 0 
special thanks to dylan t for the recommendation on what to order all yummy for my tummy 1 
we literally sat there for 20 minutes with no one asking to take our order 0 
it does everything the description said it would 1 
worse theres an incredibly weak subplot thrown in that follows a little band of latterday mansonites as they go after a reporter whos working on a story on the anniversary of the killings 0 
if there is a wind it is completely useless 0 
i rate this movie 910 1 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
if i take a picture the battery drops a bar and starts beeping letting me know its dieing 0 
i mean really how do you get so famous for your fish and chips when its so terrible 0 
today the graphics are crap 0 
warning stay away 0 
a cheap and cheerless heist movie with poor characterisation lots of underbite style stoic emoting think chow yun fat in a better tomorrow and some cheesy clichés thrown into an abandoned factory ready for a few poorly executed flying judo rolls a la john woo 0 
i was mortified 0 
very very sad 0 
but when i check voice mail at night the keypad backlight turns off a few seconds into the first message and then im lost 0 
go to place for gyros 1 
i love their fries and their beans 1 
better than new 1 
i probably wont be coming back here 0 
buyerbe very careful 0 
at any rate this film stinks its not funny and fulci should have stayed with giallo and supernatural zombie movies 0 
as for the mains also uninspired 0 
he is almost unbearable to watch on screen he has little to no charisma and terrible comedic timing 0 
in addition it feels amp looks as if the phone is all lightweight cheap plastic 0 
the management is rude 0 
excellent product for the price 1 
i left with a stomach ache and felt sick the rest of the day 0 
and the sound quality is great 1 
my sashimi was poor quality being soggy and tasteless 0 
for the price this was a great deal 1 
stay away from the q 0 
the acting is like watching wooden puppets moving around and reading from a book thats how bad it is 0 
to be honest with you this is unbelievable nonsense and very foolish 0 
i exchanged the sony ericson z500a for this and im pretty happy with that decision 1 
the stories were powerful explorations of the nature of man and of art 1 
favorite place in town for shawarrrrrrma 1 
sam shepards portrayal of a gung ho marine was sobering 1 
design flaw 0 
this is such a fun and funny movie 1 
i have yet to run this new battery below two bars and thats three days without charging 1 
i love the camera its really pretty good quality 1 
the explosion of the gas tanks at the end was just as awful 0 
i have eaten here multiple times and each time the food was delicious 1 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
i dont have very many words to say about this place but it does everything pretty well 1 
worst customer service 0 
dont waste your time watching this rubbish nonresearched film 0 
i had strawberry tea which was good 1 
i was deeply impressed with the character he played 1 
pretty piece of junk 0 
he surely doesnt know how to make a coherent action movie from the screenwriter of air force one who was only obliged to write the script just for a big sum of money 0 
kind of flops around 0 
both of the egg rolls were fantastic 1 
but the movie makes a lot of serious mistakes 0 
i literally vomited while watching this film 0 
cant get the software to work with my computer 0 
beware this is not a trashy cult movie this is trash period 0 
performed awful muffled tinny incoming sound and severe echo for those on the other end of the call 0 
saw the movie today and thought it was a good effort good messages for kids 1 
this product is great it makes working a lot easier i can go to the copier while waiting on hold for something 1 
nevertheless yet another wonderful film from the great masters stable 1 
for sushi on the strip this is the place to go 1 
dont do it 0 
well never go again 0 
i really loved the story line and the poler bear was kinda cutebut if anyone has a question about fort steele just ask away 1 
piece of junk 0 
here in the wind and the lion we see a wonderful rendering of americas own imperial age 1 
for a self proclaimed coffee cafe i was wildly disappointed 0 
horrible had to switch 3 times 0 
the majority of the logitech earbud headsets failed 0 
the lines the cuts the audio everything is wrong 0 
kris kristoffersen is good in this movie and really makes a difference 1 
well just if you keep thinking how bad it is 0 
very pleased with this headset 1 
my breakfast was perpared great with a beautiful presentation of 3 giant slices of toast lightly dusted with powdered sugar 1 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
this product is clearly not ready for prime time i dont care how cool it looks if you cant tell a call is coming in its worthless 0 
the sound quality for the device is unacceptableunless you are in a really quiet area you almost hear nothing 0 
my order was not correct 0 
her lines seem to have been written by a fifteen year old though they are trying oh so so hard to sound like how a fifteen year old would really um you know well talk 0 
im not really sure how joeys was voted best hot dog in the valley by readers of phoenix magazine 0 
i have to jiggle the plug to get it to line up right to get decent volume 0 
sound quality on both end is excellent i use headset to call my wife and ask my wife to use headset to call me 2 1 
wed definitely go back here again 1 
everything stinks 0 
good case 1 
wont go back 0 
all the other cases ive tried normally fall apart after a few months but this one seems to be in for the long haul 1 
im pleased 1 
waitress was good though 1 
gotta love those closeups of slimy drooling teeth 1 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
the ngage is still lacking in earbuds 0 
what a waste of time 0 
im not impressed with the concept or the food 0 
it clicks into place in a way that makes you wonder how long that mechanism would last 0 
a cheap and cheerless heist movie with poor characterisation lots of underbite style stoic emoting think chow yun fat in a better tomorrow and some cheesy clichés thrown into an abandoned factory ready for a few poorly executed flying judo rolls a la john woo 0 
shrimp when i unwrapped it i live only 12 a mile from brushfire it was literally ice cold 0 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
waiter was a jerk 0 
really really good rice all the time 1 
ray charles is legendary 1 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
how can you call yourself a steakhouse if you cant properly cook a steak i dont understand 0 
everything on the menu is terrific and we were also thrilled that they made amazing accommodations for our vegetarian daughter 1 
the plot such as it is is so derivative and predictable that the ending is like a mercy killing 0 
steamboat willie is an amazingly important film to our cinema history 1 
i cant believe theres even a sequel to this 0 
ill be looking for a new earpiece 0 
the price is reasonable and the service is great 1 
defective crap 0 
sprint charges for this service 0 
disappointed 0 
the movie is not completely perfect but titta di girolamo will stay with you for a long time after the vision of the movie 1 
ive never been treated so bad 0 
the poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying 0 
the chips and sals a here is amazing 1 
you have to hold the phone at a particular angle for the other party to hear you clearly 0 
we literally sat there for 20 minutes with no one asking to take our order 0 
the only very disappointing thing was there was no speakerphone 0 
its a feelgood film and thats how i felt when i came out of the cinema 1 
definitely worth checking out 1 
brilliance indeed 1 
nevertheless yet another wonderful film from the great masters stable 1 
i guess that nobody at the network that aired this dribble watched it before putting it on 0 
excellent bluetooth headset 1 
it was either too cold not enough flavor or just bad 0 
which are small and not worth the price 0 
this phone is very fast with sending any kind of messages and web browsing is significantly faster than previous phones i have used 1 
plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job 1 
to call this movie a drama is ridiculous 0 
an italian reviewer called this a small great film and thats right 1 
its a fresh subtle and rather sublime effect 1 
it was probably dirt 0 
this is hands down the best phone ive ever had 1 
the sound quality is good and functionality is awesome 1 
sooooo good 1 
not recommended 0 
this is a very average phone with bad battery life that operates on a weak network 0 
the owners really really need to quit being soooooo cheap let them wrap my freaking sandwich in two papers not one 0 
however this didnt make up for the fact that overall this was a tremendously boring movie 0 
i can barely ever hear on it and am constantly saying what 0 
the worst phone ive ever had only had it for a few months 0 
just does not work 0 
lame would be the best way to describe it 0 
theres also enough hypocrisy in this film to make me vomit 0 
classywarm atmosphere fun and fresh appetizers succulent steaks baseball steak 1 
will order from them again 1 
eclectic selection 1 
i left with a stomach ache and felt sick the rest of the day 0 
not a weekly haunt but definitely a place to come back to every once in a while 1 
the reception has been generally good 1 
dont waste your money 0 
mic doesnt work 0 
ill definitely be in soon again 1 
always a great time at dos gringos 1 
it crackles with an unpredictable youthful energy but honestly i found it hard to follow and concentrate on it meanders so badly 0 
we had a group of 70 when we claimed we would only have 40 and they handled us beautifully 1 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
im super pissd 0 
i would give this television series a 10 plus if i could 1 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
so just beware 0 
the selection on the menu was great and so were the prices 1 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
an awesome new look for fall 2000 1 
a usable keyboard actually turns a pda into a realworld useful machine instead of just a neat gadget 1 
the only thing really worth watching was the scenery and the house because it is beautiful 1 
it was packed 0 
if you are looking for a good quality motorola headset keep looking this isnt it 0 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
this particular model would not work with my motorola q smartphone 0 
and his subtle connections between the three films are awesome 1 
will never ever go back 0 
seriously its not worth wasting your or your kids time on 0 
kris kristoffersen is good in this movie and really makes a difference 1 
excellent 1 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
dont waste your money 0 
its a great item 1 
seafood was limited to boiled shrimp and crab legs but the crab legs definitely did not taste fresh 0 
the cashier was friendly and even brought the food out to me 1 
also makes it easier to hold on to 1 
its very slow 0 
i was disgusted because i was pretty sure that was human hair 0 
we loved the biscuits 1 
great choice 1 
this is an excellent film 1 
absolutel junk 0 
i can think of no other film where something vitally important occurs every other minute 1 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
often the dialogue doesnt really follow from one line to another or fit the surroundings 0 
ive dropped my phone more times than i can say even on concrete and my phone is still great knock on wood 1 
constantine gives everything the right intensity and seems to have a good understanding of the underlying psychological motivations 1 
its been my choice headset for yearsgreat sound good volume good noise cancellation 1 
as a sushi lover avoid this place by all means 0 
pretty cool i would say 1 
unfortunately this is a bad movie that is just plain bad 0 
this movie totally grates on my nerves 0 
earbud piece breaks easily 0 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
good value great food great service 1 
you can watch them preparing the delicious food 1 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
after all the rave reviews i couldnt wait to eat herewhat a disappointment 0 
bad reception 0 
having to humour him just to get by and get through the day was so apt 1 
phone now holds charge like it did when it was new 1 
the plot was the same as pretty much every other cheap horror 0 
we got sitting fairly fast but ended up waiting 40 minutes just to place our order another 30 minutes before the food arrived 0 
the plot has more holes than a pair of fishnet stockings and the direction and editing is astonishingly ham fisted 0 
i cant wait to go back 1 
omg the food was delicioso 1 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
my rating just 3 out of 10 0 
we enjoy their pizza and brunch 1 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
dont buy this product it fails 0 
works fine 1 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
none of the three sizes they sent with the headset would stay in my ears 0 
i liked it 1 
this does not fit the palm tungsten e2 and it broke the first time i tried to plug it in 0 
we wont be going back anytime soon 0 
i dont know exactly what it is about this movie but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our familys memories 1 
for the price this was a great deal 1 
definitely worth checking out 1 
would not go back 0 
not enough volume 0 
a cheap and cheerless heist movie with poor characterisation lots of underbite style stoic emoting think chow yun fat in a better tomorrow and some cheesy clichés thrown into an abandoned factory ready for a few poorly executed flying judo rolls a la john woo 0 
works great 1 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
heres where the movie really pied me off 0 
this is an unbelievable bargain 1 
not enough volume 0 
on three different occasions i asked for well done or medium well and all three times i got the bloodiest piece of meat on my plate 0 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
i was very disappointed in the movie 0 
wow very spicy but delicious 1 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
this phone works great 1 
only had this a month but its worked flawlessly so far 1 
simple lightweight and great fit 1 
at first i thought i was grtting a good deal at 744 until i plugged it into my phone v3c razr 0 
saw the movie today and thought it was a good effort good messages for kids 1 
excellent short film 1 
rating 010 grade z note the show is so bad that even mother of the cast pull her daughter out of the show 0 
the chips that came out were dripping with grease and mostly not edible 0 
this is a simple little phone to use but the breakage is unacceptible 0 
this is an outstanding little restaurant with some of the best food i have ever tasted 1 
they are so easy to love but even more easy to identify with 1 
excellent cast story line performances 1 
cheap but hey it works was pleasantly suprised given the low cost of this item 1 
if you want a sandwich just go to any firehouse 1 
worst thai ever 0 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
not as good as i had hoped 0 
i would highly recommend this 1 
the plantains were the worst ive ever tasted 0 
ps the only scene in the movie that was cool is when the central character finds her room blown up 1 
i love my 350 headset my jabra350 bluetooth headset is great the reception is very good and the ear piece is a comfortable fit 1 
the food was delicious our bartender was attentive and personable and we got a great deal 1 
at no point in the proceedings does it look remotely like america 0 
i was sitting in my vehicle with the cradle on my belt and the headset lost signal 0 
as a courtroom drama its compelling as an indictment on the american justice system its frightening 1 
the steak was amazingrge fillet relleno was the best seafood plate i have ever had 1 
what a waste of money and time 0 
i was seated immediately 1 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
with great sound effects and impressive special effects i cant recommend this movie enough 1 
i have seen many movies starring jaclyn smith but my god this was one of her best though it came out 12 years ago 1 
took an hour to get our food only 4 tables in restaurant my food was luke warm our sever was running around like he was totally overwhelmed 0 
its a gloriously fun fast paced and fairly accurate portrayal of the night of a raver 1 
i have read others reviews here but i havent had any problem with it 1 
i dont know what the big deal is about this place but i wont be back yaall 0 
the design is very good4 1 
i dont have to be an accountant to know im getting screwed 0 
the film is well paced understated and one of the best courtroom documentaries ive seen 1 
im not sure what he was trying to do with this film 0 
the price is reasonable and the service is great 1 
the food was excellent and service was very good 1 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
i have two more years left in this contract and i hate this phone 0 
friends pasta also bad he barely touched it 0 
it is easy to turn on and off when you are in the car and the volume controls are quite accessable 1 
it has all the features i want 1 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
the stories were powerful explorations of the nature of man and of art 1 
after watching this film i wanted to learn more about the works of this artist 1 
it came free with a dvd player i bought but i still turned the thing off halfway through because i was embarrassed for howell 0 
the desserts were a bit strange 0 
the only possible way this movie could be redeemed would be as mst3k fodder 0 
it was a long time that i didnt see a so charismatic actor on screen 1 
using all earpieces left or right this thing will not stay on my ear 0 
nice ambiance 1 
the acting by the whole cast could be put on a scale and balanced perfectly between overacting and underacting 0 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
i had to wait over 30 minutes to get my drink and longer to get 2 arepas 0 
would come back again if i had a sushi craving while in vegas 1 
the tracfonewebsite is user friendly and makes it easy toactivate etc 1 
the instructions didnt explain that a microphone jack could be used 0 
kris kristoffersen is good in this movie and really makes a difference 1 
it worked very well 1 
very very fun chef 1 
the cable looks so thin and flimsy it is scary 0 
we wont be returning 0 
it fits so securely that the ear hook does not even need to be used and the sound is better directed through your ear canal 1 
great phone 1 
i really hope the team behind this movie makes more movies and that they will continue to do so in their own some kinda weird style 1 
the sets especially designed to work with the camera are amazingstylized beautiful and effective 1 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
in fact this stinker smells like a directtovideo release 0 
waiter was a jerk 0 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
my brother in law who works at the mall ate here same day and guess what he was sick all night too 0 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
tied to charger for conversations lasting more than 45 minutesmajor problems 0 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
the cast is always entertaining as usual 1 
i am sorry i made this purchase 0 
but whatever it was that cost them so much it didnt translate to quality thats for sure 0 
better than youd expect 1 
design flaw 0 
tasted like dirt 0 
sooooo good 1 
i get absolutely horrible reception in my apartment where with other phones i have not had this problem 0 
this film tries to be a serious and sophisticated thrillerhorror flick and it fails miserably 0 
there is no real plot 0 
this place is overpriced not consistent with their boba and it really is overpriced 0 
they keep getting better and better this is my third one and ive had numerous palms too 1 
i must say i have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again 1 
great food and service huge portions and they give a military discount 1 
wasted two hours 0 
i purchased this and within 2 days it was no longer working 0 
seafood was limited to boiled shrimp and crab legs but the crab legs definitely did not taste fresh 0 
fantastic food 1 
this is infuriating 0 
very easy to use 1 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
im in az all the time and now have my new spot 1 
the script is a big flawed mess 0 
we also ordered the spinach and avocado salad the ingredients were sad and the dressing literally had zero taste 0 
its fits like a glove and is strong secure and durable 1 
but the movie makes a lot of serious mistakes 0 
wow what a bad film 0 
this phone tries very hard to do everything but fails at its very ability to be a phone 0 
food was good service was good prices were good 1 
it is super charged up for use as a small hybrid palmtopcameracellphone and excels in those roles 1 
trouble is the writing and directing make it impossible to establish those things that make a movie watchable like character story theme and so on 0 
my side greek salad with the greek dressing was so tasty and the pita and hummus was very refreshing 1 
this short film certainly pulls no punches 0 
this place lacked style 0 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
prosgood camera very nice pictures also has cool styles like black and white and more 1 
for that its worth checking out 1 
good prices 1 
the least said about the acting the better 0 
horrible 0 
and there wasnt a single sour note struck actingwise either some surprisingly solid casting here 1 
to those who find this movie intelligent or even masterful i can only say its your intelligence and your imagination you obviously used to try and make some sense of this pitiful attempt its in our human nature to try and make sense of things 0 
but the duet between the astronaut and his doctor at the beginning of the movie is a perfect exchange if one considers that this movie was made well into the cold war and the astronauts biggest fear is that he has crashed in the ussr 1 
they were goldencrispy and delicious 1 
excellent short film 1 
couldnt use the unit with sunglasses not good in texas 0 
their frozen margaritas are way too sugary for my taste 0 
food was good service was good prices were good 1 
i will not be eating there again 0 
yet i enjoy watching it 1 
if there were zero stars i would give it zero stars 0 
excellent starter wireless headset 0 
of course the footage from the 70s was grainy but that only enhanced the film 1 
the problem was the script 0 
i advise everyone do not be fooled 0 
on the good side the staff was genuinely pleasant and enthusiastic a real treat 1 
we waited for forty five minutes in vain 0 
if you hate earbugs avoid this phone by all means 0 
terrible my car will not accept this cassette 0 
the servers went back and forth several times not even so much as an are you being helped 0 
my breakfast was perpared great with a beautiful presentation of 3 giant slices of toast lightly dusted with powdered sugar 1 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
now we were chosen to be tortured with this disgusting piece of blatant american propaganda 0 
feelings thoughtsgabriels discomfort during the danceall these intangibles leap to life and come within the viewers grasp in hustons portrayal 1 
the worst experience ever 0 
the battery is working well as a replacement for the original that came with the phone over 2 years ago 1 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
tried to go here for lunch and it was a madhouse 0 
this item is great installed it let it charged up overnite and it has been working good every since with no problems 1 
his use of the colours of the french flag in the three films was nothing short of incredible every shot every scene was like a work of art 1 
but the service was beyond bad 0 
the bottowm lineanother worthless cheap gimmick from sprint 0 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
what is even more stupid is that who had thought an idea that there should be a volcano in los angeles 0 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
if you do go see this movie bring a pillow or a girlfriendboyfriend to keep you occupied through out 0 
disappointed 0 
this phone is slim and light and the display is beautiful 1 
the stories were as unbelievable as the actors 0 
this place is awesome if you want something light and healthy during the summer 1 
this movie is bad 0 
my friend loved the salmon tartar 1 
this particular model would not work with my motorola q smartphone 0 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
the movie is not completely perfect but titta di girolamo will stay with you for a long time after the vision of the movie 1 
everyone is treated equally special 1 
thank you for such great service 1 
check it out 1 
thank you for such great service 1 
this is the first phone ive had that has been so cheaply made 0 
simply beautiful 1 
by the time the film ended i not only disliked it i despised it 0 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
couldnt use the unit with sunglasses not good in texas 0 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
ive missed numerous calls because of this reason 0 
mark my words this is one of those cult films like evil dead 2 or phantasm that people will still be discovering and falling in love with 20 30 40 years down the line 1 
the service was extremely slow 0 
the camera although rated at an impressive 13 megapixels renders images that fall well below expectations of such a relatively high resolution 0 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
the acting sucks the music sucks the script sucks the pacing sucks the special fx suck the directing sucks basically this movie sucks 0 
it crackles with an unpredictable youthful energy but honestly i found it hard to follow and concentrate on it meanders so badly 0 
well just if you keep thinking how bad it is 0 
very dissapointing performance 0 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
all i can do is whine on the internet so here it goesthe more i use the thing the less i like it 0 
the show would begin with smart ass ed comments to each other that would be totally off the wall and uncalled for 0 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
i ordered the lemon raspberry ice cocktail which was also incredible 1 
total letdown i would much rather just go to the camelback flower shop and cartel coffee 0 
the seller is very understanding and patient i would definitely buy from them again 1 
id love to go back 1 
it didnt make me scared horrified or make me sympathetic towards the characters it was simply annoying 0 
hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in 0 
my fiancé and i came in the middle of the day and we were greeted and seated right away 1 
there was no chemistry between ben affleck and sandra bullock in this film and i couldnt understand why he would consider even leaving his wifetobe for this chick that he supposedly was knocked out by 0 
the concert sequences just sucked 0 
works well 1 
i dont like this nokia either 0 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
the pleather case doesnt fit 0 
waste your money on this game 1 
i was amazed at the quick arrival of the two original lg cell phone batteries and and at a fraction of the price 1 
the dialogue is composed of things that make little sense 0 
bt50 battery junk 0 
i cant see how this movie can be an inspiration to anyone to come out or overcome fear and rejection 0 
and there wasnt a single sour note struck actingwise either some surprisingly solid casting here 1 
really good product 1 
i want my money back 0 
the story itself is just predictable and lazy 0 
it was absolutely amazing 1 
nice design and quality 1 
one of the most disappointing aspects is the lack of notable gore 0 
about ten minutes into this film i started having second thoughts 0 
however this didnt make up for the fact that overall this was a tremendously boring movie 0 
its pure brilliance 1 
yet plantronincs continues to use the same flawed charger design 0 
i had the chicken pho and it tasted very bland 0 
your servers suck wait correction our server heimer sucked 0 
at a time when it seems that film animation has been dominated by disneypixars cgi masterpieces it is both refreshing and comforting to know that miyazaki is still relying on traditional handdrawn animation to tell his charming and enchanting stories 1 
kind of hard to mess up a steak but they did 0 
it is light has plenty of battery capacity and is very confortable to wear for somewhat extended periods of time 1 
tom wilkinson broke my heart at the end and everyone elses judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike 1 
not what i wanted 0 
very slow at seating even with reservation 0 
the tracfonewebsite is user friendly and makes it easy toactivate etc 1 
the scenes are often funny and occasionally touching as the characters evaluate their lives and where they are going 1 
clever and a real crowdpleaserthis film still ranks among mickeys best films even after 80 wonderful years 1 
nice ambiance 1 
by far the best cheesecurds we have ever had 1 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
point your finger at any item on the menu order it and you wont be disappointed 1 
my boyfriend and i sat at the bar and had a completely delightful experience 1 
none of the three sizes they sent with the headset would stay in my ears 0 
lovely little thriller from hitchcock with lots of nice shenanigans surrounding a murdered spy a kidnapped child a nasty church a foreign plot and some random taxidermists 1 
you wont regret it 1 
highly recommend for any one who has a blue tooth phone 1 
i hope this place sticks around 1 
but this movie really got to me 1 
their daily specials are always a hit with my group 1 
crisp and clear 1 
these were so good we ordered them twice 1 
every element of this story was so over the top excessively phony and contrived that it was painful to sit through 0 
elias koteasjack palance play good roles angelina is hot and gets nakedbilly drago appears in this and is cool as usual a cameo by sven ole thorsen helps make this a very enjoyable movie with good acting and a decent budget 1 
poor construction 0 
i asked multiple times for the wine list and after some time of being ignored i went to the hostess and got one myself 0 
recommend with confidence 1 
check it out 1 
our server was super nice and checked on us many times 1 
very disappointing 0 
just whatever you do avoid groove as its the antithesis of all that is good about human traffic 0 
incredible 1 
i promise they wont disappoint 1 
this place is great 1 
very good quality though 1 
food was below average 0 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
even the squibs look awful 0 
also notable is john baileys fine crisp beautifully colored cinematography and the great production design costumes by eiko ishioka who went on to do the memorable costumes for coppolas dracula for which she received a well deserved oscar 1 
its a fresh subtle and rather sublime effect 1 
if that bug never showed up i would have given a 4 for sure but on the other side of the wall where this bug was climbing was the kitchen 0 
trumbull on i love lucy 1 
the casting is also horrible cause all you see is a really really bad actors period 0 
shrimp when i unwrapped it i live only 12 a mile from brushfire it was literally ice cold 0 
i love it 1 
yes its shiny on front side and i love it 1 
we also ordered the spinach and avocado salad the ingredients were sad and the dressing literally had zero taste 0 
phone now holds charge like it did when it was new 1 
the management is rude 0 
def coming back to bowl next time 1 
you cant go wrong with any of the food here 1 
it is indescribably the most annoying and idiotic show i have ever seen 0 
this is my new fav vegas buffet spot 1 
i would definitely recommend the jabra bt250v for those who are looking for comfort clarity and a great price 1 
i agree with jessica this movie is pretty bad 0 
ive dropped my phone more times than i can say even on concrete and my phone is still great knock on wood 1 
this product is clearly not ready for prime time i dont care how cool it looks if you cant tell a call is coming in its worthless 0 
i love lane but ive never seen her in a movie this lousy 0 
lots of holes in the script 0 
i think not again 0 
as i said abovepretty useless 0 
they know how to make them here 1 
would come back again if i had a sushi craving while in vegas 1 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
i must say i have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again 1 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
what makes this story different are the terrific production values faultless photography composition and editing the terrific casting the underappreciated brian keith playing a bully teddy and vivid history 1 
the grilled chicken was so tender and yellow from the saffron seasoning 1 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
lastly the mozzarella sticks they were the best thing we ordered 1 
great food and great service in a clean and friendly setting 1 
i dont have to be an accountant to know im getting screwed 0 
it was a huge awkward 15lb piece of cow that was 34ths gristle and fat 0 
very funny 1 
this movie was kind of long in length but i enjoyed every minute of it 1 
very good product well made 1 
save your money ive had this item for 11 months now 0 
this is so embarassing and also my ears hurt if i try to push the ear plug into my ear 0 
on the negative its insipid enough to cause regret for another 2 hours of life wasted in front of the screen 0 
your servers suck wait correction our server heimer sucked 0 
this hole in the wall has great mexican street tacos and friendly staff 1 
it is very comfortable to wear as well which is probably the most important aspect about using a case 1 
doesnt hold charge 0 
tried to go here for lunch and it was a madhouse 0 
will order from them again 1 
i thought it was bad 0 
whatever the producer was going for he missed entirely 0 
this is a really fantastic thai restaurant which is definitely worth a visit 1 
very good quality though 1 
his losing his marbles so early in the proceedings is totally implausible and unconvincing 0 
im big fan of rpg games too but this movie its a disgrace to any selfrespecting rpger there is 0 
the reception is excellent 1 
the only thing i did like was the prime rib and dessert section 1 
i would advise to not purchase this item it never worked very well 0 
great product 1 
the basic premise is wasted since it is sidelined by the inexplicable focus on the documentary crew 0 
great product and price 1 
i like steiners because its dark and it feels like a bar 1 
if you have several dozen or several hundred contacts then imagine the fun of sending each of them one by one 0 
50 down the drain 0 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
to those who find this movie intelligent or even masterful i can only say its your intelligence and your imagination you obviously used to try and make some sense of this pitiful attempt its in our human nature to try and make sense of things 0 
this is so embarassing and also my ears hurt if i try to push the ear plug into my ear 0 
weve have gotten a much better service from the pizza place next door than the services we received from this restaurant 0 
an amazing finale to possibly the best trilogy of all time 1 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
i love this phone 1 
i dont think well be going back anytime soon 0 
these are certainly very comfortable and functionality is decent 1 
this film and i use that word loosely is an insult to the moviegoing public 0 
overall i rate this movie a 10 out of a 110 scale 1 
not a good bargain 0 
i particularly remember my senses being assaulted by strident cords of music that would blare out with very little warning and even less meaning 0 
i really dont see how anyone could enjoy this movie 0 
there is really nothing for me at postinos hope your experience is better 0 
the phone is sturdy and waterproof 1 
spend your money and time some place else 0 
if only someone involved with it knew how to string together narrative 0 
i would recommend purchasing the jabra jx10 series 2 which works flawlessly with my moto q go figure 1 
good value great food great service 1 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
it is zillion times away from reality 0 
the veggitarian platter is out of this world 1 
i agree with jessica this movie is pretty bad 0 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
i have been in more than a few bars in vegas and do not ever recall being charged for tap water 0 
the films sole bright spot was jonah hill who will look almost unrecognizable to fans of the recent superbad due to the amount of weight he lost in the interim 1 
it also had a new problem 0 
as for the service im a fan because its quick and youre being served by some nice folks 1 
its a fresh subtle and rather sublime effect 1 
after a year the battery went completely dead on my headset 0 
i ordered albondigas soup which was just warm and tasted like tomato soup with frozen meatballs 0 
i have always used corded headsets and the freedom from the wireless is very helpful 1 
we started with the tuna sashimi which was brownish in color and obviously wasnt fresh 0 
worked perfectly 1 
you could drive a semi truck into these holes 0 
if you havent choked in your own vomit by the end by all the cheap drama and worthless dialogue youve must have bored yourself to death with this waste of time 0 
i had ordered a motorola data cable got a very well finished and working product 1 
im glad i found this product on amazon it is hard to find it wasnt high priced 1 
i went on motorolas website and followed all directions but could not get it to pair again 0 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
it is unusable in a moving car at freeway speed 0 
he cant act one of the least scary villains i have ever seen he cant write did he write this damn movie in his sleep 0 
not even good for camp value 0 
my friend loved the salmon tartar 1 
the sides are delish mixed mushrooms yukon gold puree white corn beateous 1 
i totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is 1 
this is high adventure at its best 1 
he surely doesnt know how to make a coherent action movie from the screenwriter of air force one who was only obliged to write the script just for a big sum of money 0 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
overpriced for what you are getting 0 
you learn a lot about the real inside emotions of people in this movie and a lot about the movie business itself 1 
i wish i could return the unit and get back my money 0 
his costars dont fare much better with people like morgan freeman jonah hill and ed helms just wasted 0 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
my mother and brother had to do thiswhen i saw robert ryan portraying this type of man it was a very good imitation of this type of individual and i was impressed 1 
warning do not buy 0 
try them in the airport to experience some tasty food and speedy friendly service 1 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
steamboat willie is an amazingly important film to our cinema history 1 
nonlinear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well 1 
20th century foxs road house 1948 is not only quite a silly noir but is an implausible unmitigated bore of a movie 0 
everything was fresh and delicious 1 
we also ordered the spinach and avocado salad the ingredients were sad and the dressing literally had zero taste 0 
best fish ive ever had in my life 1 
the cashier was friendly and even brought the food out to me 1 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
blue ant is easy to use 1 
imdb ratings only go as low 1 for awful its time to get some negative numbers in there for cases such as these 0 
and considering the two of us left there very full and happy for about 20 you just cant go wrong 1 
i have purchased these for both family and friends and all enjoy their clarity and ease of use 1 
poor product 0 
best fish ive ever had in my life 1 
my fiancé and i came in the middle of the day and we were greeted and seated right away 1 
best of luck to the rude and noncustomer service focused new management 0 
it dit not work most of the time with my nokia 5320 0 
this was a poor remake of my best friends wedding 0 
reception is terrible and full of static 0 
i recommend igo to anyone with different brand cell phonesmp3 players in the family 1 
meredith m was better than all right 1 
and service was super friendly 1 
youd have to have the iq of particularly stupid mollusk not to see that one coming 0 
i was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar not only because the quality is great but the service is fast and the food impeccable 1 
for the price on amazon it is an excellent product which i would highly recommend 1 
please dont waste your money 0 
ive had better not only from dedicated boba tea spots but even from jenni pho 0 
however this didnt make up for the fact that overall this was a tremendously boring movie 0 
this movie creates its own universe and is fascinating in every way 1 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
nothing special 0 
i ordered the lemon raspberry ice cocktail which was also incredible 1 
john wayne did an incredible job for being so young in the movie industry 1 
so in a nutshell 1 the restaraunt smells like a combination of a dirty fish market and a sewer 0 
cool phone 1 
so badwellits just bad 0 
i have been in more than a few bars in vegas and do not ever recall being charged for tap water 0 
terrible phone holder 0 
omg the food was delicioso 1 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
works great 1 
this movie is greatespecially if you enjoy visual arts 1 
what a piece of junk i lose more calls on this phone 0 
we walked away stuffed and happy about our first vegas buffet experience 1 
this is a great product sure beats using your fingers 1 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
i love being able to use one headset for both by landline and cell 1 
easily none other cartoon made me laugh in a tender way before getting into dark sitcoms oriented for teenagers 1 
it is very comfortable to wear as well which is probably the most important aspect about using a case 1 
this place was such a nice surprise 1 
the burrittos blah 0 
a good time 1 
a greasy unhealthy meal 0 
worthwhile 1 
it features an outlandish array of memorable psychotic but lovable nuts 1 
cant get the software to work with my computer 0 
not what i wanted 0 
works great 1 
waste your money on this game 1 
service is quick and even to go orders are just like we like it 1 
low quality 0 
food was really good and i got full petty fast 1 
if she had not rolled the eyes we may have stayed not sure if we will go back and try it again 0 
the majority of the logitech earbud headsets failed 0 
no actress has been worse used that june allison in this movie 0 
but it is great i would really recommend it 1 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
very tough and very short on flavor 0 
i highly recommend these and encourage people to give them a try 1 
there is simply no excuse for something this poorly done 0 
theres barely a boring moment in the film and there are plenty of humorous parts 1 
the lines the cuts the audio everything is wrong 0 
fits comfortably came with three sizes of earbud tips 1 
clear skype calls long battery life long range 1 
the phone is sturdy and waterproof 1 
internet is excrutiatingly slow 0 
i know this is not like the other restaurants at all something is very off here 0 
the fried rice was dry as well 0 
if you look for authentic thai food go else where 0 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
bacon is hella salty 1 
i believe that pitch black was done well 1 
wonderful lil tapas and the ambience made me feel all warm and fuzzy inside 1 
mobile phone tools are a must have 1 
i recently tried caballeros and i have been back every week since 1 
blue ant is easy to use 1 
if you are razr owneryou must have this 1 
that one didnt work either 0 
great pizza and salads 1 
the film has great actors a master director a significant themeat least a wouldbe significant theme undertone of fifties existential worldweariness aerial scenes that ought to have thrilled both senses and imagination and characters about which one might deeply care 1 
the service was terrible food was mediocre 0 
both of them were truly unbelievably good and i am so glad we went back 1 
spend your money and time some place else 0 
bad fit way too big 0 
easily none other cartoon made me laugh in a tender way before getting into dark sitcoms oriented for teenagers 1 
total waste of time 0 
i found this move beautiful enjoyable and uplifting 1 
the management is rude 0 
so absolutley fantastic 1 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
so badwellits just bad 0 
however after about a year the fliptop started to get loose and wobbly and eventually my screen went black and i couldnt receive and place calls 0 
i love my 350 headset my jabra350 bluetooth headset is great the reception is very good and the ear piece is a comfortable fit 1 
dont waste your money 0 
dont make the same mistake i did 0 
great brunch spot 1 
but the movie makes a lot of serious mistakes 0 
in the span of an hour i had two people exclaim whoa is that the new phone on tv 1 
service was good and the company was better 1 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
every thing on phone work perfectly she like it 1 
try them in the airport to experience some tasty food and speedy friendly service 1 
my first visit to hiro was a delight 1 
nice spicy and tender 1 
yes its that bad 0 
the food was delicious our bartender was attentive and personable and we got a great deal 1 
if you see it you should probably just leave it on the shelf 0 
i dont think i will be back for a very long time 0 
bad script bad direction and horrible acting make this one plain bad 0 
the majority of the logitech earbud headsets failed 0 
i would advise to not purchase this item it never worked very well 0 
worst thai ever 0 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
love the margaritas too 1 
an hour seriously 0 
overall i like there food and the service 1 
your staff spends more time talking to themselves than me 0 
crisp and clear 1 
dessert panna cotta was amazing 1 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
stay away from the q 0 
however the keypads are so tinny that i sometimes reach the wrong buttons 0 
i love the look and feel of samsung flipphones 1 
no shifting no bubbling no peeling not even a scratch nothingi couldnt be more happier with my new one for the droid 1 
mic doesnt work 0 
great phone 1 
the salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop which was perfectly cooked 1 
worst ever 0 
the service here is fair at best 0 
great pizza and salads 1 
the service was poor and thats being nice 0 
what i really like there is the crepe station 1 
i found a six inch long piece of wire in my salsa 0 
setup went very smoothly 1 
the plot well i said id let that one go 0 
i highly recommend this device to everyone 1 
the films dialogue is natural real to life 1 
the dialogue sucked 0 
the least said about the acting the better 0 
we walked away stuffed and happy about our first vegas buffet experience 1 
the movie is not completely perfect but titta di girolamo will stay with you for a long time after the vision of the movie 1 
not only did the software do a great job of this i could also make my own ringtones form my existing cds without an internet connection 1 
i highly recommend this device to everyone 1 
they do not care about the consumer one bit 0 
the camera although rated at an impressive 13 megapixels renders images that fall well below expectations of such a relatively high resolution 0 
definitely a turn off for me i doubt ill be back unless someone else is buying 0 
my sanyo has survived dozens of drops on blacktop without ill effect 1 
i had the chicken pho and it tasted very bland 0 
2 times very bad customer service 0 
the phone gets extremely hot 0 
the staff is always super friendly and helpful which is especially cool when you bring two small boys and a baby 1 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
by this time our side of the restaurant was almost empty so there was no excuse 0 
wasted two hours 0 
loved the casting of jimmy buffet as the science teacher 1 
the staff are also very friendly and efficient 1 
terrible my car will not accept this cassette 0 
they are so easy to love but even more easy to identify with 1 
great phone 1 
the food is about on par with dennys which is to say not good at all 0 
the pairing of the two devices was so easy it barely took a couple minutes before i started making calls with the voice dialing feature 1 
disappointing experience 0 
ive seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie 0 
this greedy corporation will never see another dime from me 0 
buyer beware you could flush money right down the toilet 0 
now this is a movie i really dislike 0 
crisp and clear 1 
i also decided not to send it back because our waitress looked like she was on the verge of having a heart attack 0 
there is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again 0 
and the accents are absolutely abysmal 0 
we would recommend these to others 1 
and i just love the colors 1 
very slow at seating even with reservation 0 
never heard of any of them except cole who was totally unbelievable in the part 0 
the sound quality is excellent as well 1 
unfortunately any virtue in this films production work was lost on a regrettable script 0 
this short film certainly pulls no punches 0 
and the rest of it just sits there being awful with soldiers singing songs about the masculinity they pledge themselves to hairsplitting about purity the admiration of swords etc 0 
the puppets look really cheesy not in a good way like in the puppet master 80s flicks 0 
the dialogue sucked 0 
here in the wind and the lion we see a wonderful rendering of americas own imperial age 1 
pretty good beer selection too 1 
a usable keyboard actually turns a pda into a realworld useful machine instead of just a neat gadget 1 
why are these sad little vegetables so overcooked 0 
i never walked out of a movie faster 0 
restored my phone to like new performance 1 
the movie was very interesting from beginning to the end 1 
unfortunately cover girl is an example of how hollywood used to exploit women for financial gain 0 
the acting is like watching wooden puppets moving around and reading from a book thats how bad it is 0 
design flaw 0 
this was a poor remake of my best friends wedding 0 
this is my new fav vegas buffet spot 1 
stay away from the q 0 
works fine 1 
do not buy for d807wrongly advertised for d807 0 
the acting was decidely wooden though no worse than a period universal b movie 0 
i highly recommend this movie for anyone interested in art poetry theater politics or japanese history 1 
but in any case the best part is you can download these pictures to your laptop using ir or even send pictures from your laptop to the phone 1 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
the han nan chicken was also very tasty 1 
the cashier had no care what so ever on what i had to say it still ended up being wayyy overpriced 0 
i love the camera its really pretty good quality 1 
the acting was bad 0 
delete this film from your mind 0 
this short film certainly pulls no punches 0 
the mic is great 1 
everything about it is fine and reasonable for the price ie 1 
it kept getting worse and worse so now im officially done 0 
the cashier had no care what so ever on what i had to say it still ended up being wayyy overpriced 0 
the only suspense i was feeling was the frustration at just how retarded the girls were 0 
in the span of an hour i had two people exclaim whoa is that the new phone on tv 1 
but it does get better reception and clarity than any phone ive had before 1 
the building itself seems pretty neat the bathroom is pretty trippy but i wouldnt eat here again 0 
makes it easier to keep up with my bluetooth when im not wearing it 0 
internet is excrutiatingly slow 0 
this is one of the best movies out there that shows such strong sibling bond for each other 1 
you cant beat that 1 
if there was ever a movie that needed wordofmouth to promote this is it 1 
id like to return it 0 
the only very disappointing thing was there was no speakerphone 0 
i was very excited to get this headset because i thought it was really cute 1 
what a waste 0 
what is even more stupid is that who had thought an idea that there should be a volcano in los angeles 0 
its a case of so bad it is laughable 0 
ive tried several different earpieces for my cell phone and this jabra one is the first one ive found that fits my ear comfortably 1 
if you simply want a small flip phone look elsewhere as the extra bells whistles are mediocre 0 
we wont be going back anytime soon 0 
the scenery that the two daughters paint and photograph are beautiful 1 
well just if you keep thinking how bad it is 0 
there is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again 0 
their daily specials are always a hit with my group 1 
great for ipods too 1 
i was particularly pleased with the acting ability of dwight schultz 1 
comfortable nice range good battery life 1 
only like 3 or 4 buildings used a couple of locations maybe poor hummh 0 
good servicecheck 1 
reversible plug works great 1 
avoid at all costs 0 
the guys all had steaks and our steak loving son who has had steak at the best and worst places said it was the best steak hes ever eaten 1 
meredith m was better than all right 1 
the warm beer didnt help 0 
that being said for a phone the camera is very nice many cool effects to play with and video is decent as well 1 
dont make the same mistake i did 0 
great for the jawbone 1 
i have yet to run this new battery below two bars and thats three days without charging 1 
its just painful 0 
it is simple to use and i like it 1 
excellent product for the price 1 
its a long time since i was so entertained by a movie 1 
never going back 0 
the selection of food was not the best 0 
what did bother me was the slow service 0 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
does everything it should and more 1 
i have had mine for about a year and this christmas i bought some for the rest of the family 1 
just does not work 0 
if you want a real scare rent this one 1 
the film gives meaning to the phrase never in the history of human conflict has so much been owed by so many to so few 1 
the kids are annoying 0 
setup went very smoothly 1 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
i dont know exactly what it is about this movie but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our familys memories 1 
att is not clear sound is very distorted and you have to yell when you talk 0 
im not sure what he was trying to do with this film 0 
the owners really really need to quit being soooooo cheap let them wrap my freaking sandwich in two papers not one 0 
as a courtroom drama its compelling as an indictment on the american justice system its frightening 1 
they are so easy to love but even more easy to identify with 1 
cinematography noteworthy including fine views of barcelona and its famed gaudi towers 1 
this place is horrible and way overpriced 0 
the steaks are all well trimmed and also perfectly cooked 1 
the hockey scenes are terrible defensemen playing like theyre 5 years old goalies diving at shots that are 10 feet wide of the net etc 0 
i love the ownerchef his one authentic japanese cool dude 1 
i exchanged the sony ericson z500a for this and im pretty happy with that decision 1 
a cheap and cheerless heist movie with poor characterisation lots of underbite style stoic emoting think chow yun fat in a better tomorrow and some cheesy clichés thrown into an abandoned factory ready for a few poorly executed flying judo rolls a la john woo 0 
overall i like this place a lot 1 
kris kristoffersen is good in this movie and really makes a difference 1 
this phone tries very hard to do everything but fails at its very ability to be a phone 0 
great for the jawbone 1 
i have to jiggle the plug to get it to line up right to get decent volume 0 
battery life is also great 1 
go and see it 1 
my sister has one also and she loves it 1 
constantine gives everything the right intensity and seems to have a good understanding of the underlying psychological motivations 1 
all in all i think it was a good investment 1 
but other than that the movie seemed to drag and the heroes didnt really work for their freedom 0 
the sound quality is good and functionality is awesome 1 
5 stars for the brick oven bread app 1 
theres barely a boring moment in the film and there are plenty of humorous parts 1 
ive never been more insulted or felt disrespected 0 
the cashew cream sauce was bland and the vegetables were undercooked 0 
feelings thoughtsgabriels discomfort during the danceall these intangibles leap to life and come within the viewers grasp in hustons portrayal 1 
it sure does beat the nachos at the movies but i would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant 0 
would come back again if i had a sushi craving while in vegas 1 
the service was extremely slow 0 
comes with a strong light that you can use to light up your camera shots and even flash sos signals seriously 1 
actually the graphics were good at the time 1 
this film tries to be a serious and sophisticated thrillerhorror flick and it fails miserably 0 
you have to hold the phone at a particular angle for the other party to hear you clearly 0 
you have to hold the phone at a particular angle for the other party to hear you clearly 0 
finally after three or four times the spring of the latch broke and i could not use it any longer on the visor 0 
special thanks to dylan t for the recommendation on what to order all yummy for my tummy 1 
overall i rate this movie a 10 out of a 110 scale 1 
this is a very average phone with bad battery life that operates on a weak network 0 
the staff are great the ambiance is great 1 
i found a six inch long piece of wire in my salsa 0 
i was disgusted because i was pretty sure that was human hair 0 
the lead man is charismafree 0 
great place to relax and have an awesome burger and beer 1 
we waited for forty five minutes in vain 0 
poor construction 0 
i dont have to be an accountant to know im getting screwed 0 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
the movie lacks visual interest drama expression of feeling and celebration of the very patriotism that underlines the narrative 0 
buyer beware you could flush money right down the toilet 0 
the nokia ca42 usb cable did not work with my phone 0 
if you hate earbugs avoid this phone by all means 0 
lasted one day and then blew up 0 
battery life is also great 1 
as a sushi lover avoid this place by all means 0 
the text messaging feature is really tricky to use 0 
i let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this bad idea we both hated it 0 
this movie is so awesome 1 
my friend did not like his bloody mary 0 
this is a bad film with bad writing and good actorsan ugly cartoon crafted by paul haggis for people who cant handle anything but the bold strokes in storytellinga picture painted with crayons 0 
i vomited in the bathroom mid lunch 0 
this place has it 1 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
if you have several dozen or several hundred contacts then imagine the fun of sending each of them one by one 0 
his performance as awarded was stunning 1 
i had high hopes for this place since the burgers are cooked over a charcoal grill but unfortunately the taste fell flat way flat 0 
im surprised this is a good quality car charger and theres not much reviews about it 1 
good product incredible value 1 
there were several moments in the movie that just didnt need to be there and were excruciatingly slow moving 0 
it is just the sort of pap that is screened in the afternoon to punish the unemployed for not having jobs 0 
hot dishes are not hot cold dishes are close to room tempi watched staff prepare food with bare hands no gloveseverything is deep fried in oil 0 
you wont regret it 1 
gave up trying to eat any of the crust teeth still sore 0 
steer clear of this product and go with the genuine palm replacementr pens which come in a threepack 0 
all in all im quite satisfied with this purchase 1 
similarly the delivery man did not say a word of apology when our food was 45 minutes late 0 
there is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again 0 
whatever the producer was going for he missed entirely 0 
i had the mac salad and it was pretty bland so i will not be getting that again 0 
gets a signal when other verizon phones wont 1 
not as good as i had hoped 0 
it was attached to a gas station and that is rarely a good sign 0 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
too bad cause i know its family owned i really wanted to like this place 0 
definitely worth seeing its the sort of thought provoking film that forces you to question your own threshold of loneliness 1 
elias koteasjack palance play good roles angelina is hot and gets nakedbilly drago appears in this and is cool as usual a cameo by sven ole thorsen helps make this a very enjoyable movie with good acting and a decent budget 1 
i have yet to run this new battery below two bars and thats three days without charging 1 
cant store anything but phone numbers to sim 0 
its fits like a glove and is strong secure and durable 1 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
the steak was amazingrge fillet relleno was the best seafood plate i have ever had 1 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
i am pairing this with my iphone and i could not be happier with it so far 1 
if you do watch it however there are small consolations the actresses playing annes sisters each do a wonderful job with their roles 1 
if you love death and decay and shakespears lyrics this is the one 1 
the warmth it generates is in contrast to its austere backdrop 1 
magical help 1 
the most annoying thing about cover girl is the way in which rita hayworth is put up on a pedestal 0 
totally different with loads of understatement and black comedy this is a film few get to see but those who do will remember it 1 
this is truly an art movieit actually has a lot of art in it 1 
the result is a powerhouse achievement made more timely now perhaps because of our cultures disturbing fascination with celebrity and its distorted interpretations of fame 1 
not even good for camp value 0 
who in their right mind is gonna buy this battery 0 
this is definitely one of the better documentaries i have seen looking at family relationships and marriage 1 
it was attached to a gas station and that is rarely a good sign 0 
for people who are first timers in film making i think they did an excellent job 1 
the pizza selections are good 1 
highly recommended 1 
plug was the wrong size 0 
juano hernandez an exceptional actor who played supporting roles in many films of the era is a proud black man who is accused of murdering a white man in the south 1 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
everything is appalling 0 
item does not match picture 0 
all the characters in this film are tremendously well played 1 
these headphones were a great find and i think they are perhaps the best purchase ive made in the last several years seriously 1 
if that bug never showed up i would have given a 4 for sure but on the other side of the wall where this bug was climbing was the kitchen 0 
however the ear pads come off easily and after only one week i lost one 0 
it was horrible 0 
the inside is really quite nice and very clean 1 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
dont waste your money and time 0 
but she is still a bad actress repeating her robotic face moves in each of her pictures 0 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
all in all an excellent restaurant highlighted by great service a unique menu and a beautiful setting 1 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
i probably would not go here again 0 
plug was the wrong size 0 
its a sad movie but very good 1 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
made very sturdy 1 
i have been in more than a few bars in vegas and do not ever recall being charged for tap water 0 
superb phone on a great network 1 
my phone doesnt slide around my car now and the grip prevents my phone from slipping out of my hand 1 
the songs were the best and the muppets were so hilarious 1 
the point is the journey a journey that touches every member of the family 1 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
i agree with jessica this movie is pretty bad 0 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
this review is long overdue since i consider a tale of two sisters to be the single greatest film ever made 1 
so badwellits just bad 0 
i wasnt expecting oscar material but this 0 
i must say i have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again 1 
dont do it 0 
there is nothing privileged about workingeating there 0 
i ordered the voodoo pasta and it was the first time id had really excellent pasta since going gluten free several years ago 1 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
avoid at all costs 0 
my phone doesnt slide around my car now and the grip prevents my phone from slipping out of my hand 1 
best tater tots in the southwest 1 
good product incredible value 1 
pretty piece of junk 0 
meredith m was better than all right 1 
i wasnt expecting oscar material but this 0 
i found this move beautiful enjoyable and uplifting 1 
the least said about the acting the better 0 
probably never coming back and wouldnt recommend it 0 
this is definitely one of the better documentaries i have seen looking at family relationships and marriage 1 
dont waste your money and time 0 
so far so good 1 
as an earlier review noted plug in this charger and nothing happens 0 
this is the place where i first had pho and it was amazing 1 
after all the rave reviews i couldnt wait to eat herewhat a disappointment 0 
do not buy do not buyit sucks 0 
his losing his marbles so early in the proceedings is totally implausible and unconvincing 0 
the cast of veteran actors are more than just a nostalgia trip 1 
i dont think i will be back for a very long time 0 
well packaged arrived on time and works as intended 1 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
in a word it is embarrassing 0 
none of it works just dont buy it 0 
after 3 months screen just went black all of a sudden 0 
fast service 1 
this phone might well be the worst ive ever had in any brand 0 
excellent service 1 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
i will never go back to this place and will never ever recommended this place to anyone 0 
so i basically threw my money out the window for nothing 0 
the only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive 1 
very disappointing 0 
the basic premise is wasted since it is sidelined by the inexplicable focus on the documentary crew 0 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
the volume for the ringer is real good you have choices how loud 1 
if you plan to use this in a car forget about it 0 
youll love it 1 
what should have been a hilarious yummy christmas eve dinner to remember was the biggest fail of the entire trip for us 0 
50 down the drain 0 
trying to make a call on these is an exercise in frustration 0 
love this place hits the spot when i want something healthy but not lacking in quantity or flavor 1 
i checked everywhere and there is no feature for it which is really disappointing 0 
on the ground right next to our table was a large smeared beensteppedinandtrackedeverywhere pile of green bird poop 0 
come hungry leave happy and stuffed 1 
poor reliability 0 
i believe that this place is a great stop for those with a huge belly and hankering for sushi 1 
beautiful styling though 1 
the writer gorman bechard undoubtedly did his homework because all references are industry and characterage appropriate 1 
kris kristoffersen is good in this movie and really makes a difference 1 
too bad you have to pay up to a month for the service 0 
black water is a thriller that manages to completely transcend its limitations its an indie flick by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience 1 
and there wasnt a single sour note struck actingwise either some surprisingly solid casting here 1 
the servers are not pleasant to deal with and they dont always honor pizza hut coupons 0 
the atmosphere was great with a lovely duo of violinists playing songs we requested 1 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
great pizza and salads 1 
obviously they have a terrible customer service so you get what you pay for 0 
oh the charger seems to work fine 1 
i came over from verizon because cingulair has nicer cell phones the first thing i noticed was the really bad service 0 
the best part about nurse betty is its unpredictability 1 
the film gives meaning to the phrase never in the history of human conflict has so much been owed by so many to so few 1 
everything about it is just bad 0 
summary the witticisms werent witty 0 
service was very prompt 1 
this totally unfunny movie is so over the top and pathetic and unrealistic that throughout the whole 90 minutes of utter torture i probably looked at my watch about 70000 times 0 
i received my orders well within the shipping timeframe everything was in good working order and overall i am very excited to have this source 1 
the pairing of the two devices was so easy it barely took a couple minutes before i started making calls with the voice dialing feature 1 
aailiyah was pretty good as akasha in places compelling her first entrance and mini dance scene 1 
pretty cool i would say 1 
it only recognizes the phone as its storage device 0 
paolo sorrentino has written a wonderful story about loneliness and tony has built one of the most unforgettable characters seen in movies in recent years 1 
i wear glasses and it fits fine with them 1 
the cashew cream sauce was bland and the vegetables were undercooked 0 
this phone tries very hard to do everything but fails at its very ability to be a phone 0 
this movie is terrible 0 
the 12 mega pixel camera being a part of a phone is reasonably good7 1 
he also came back to check on us regularly excellent service 1 
however after about a year the fliptop started to get loose and wobbly and eventually my screen went black and i couldnt receive and place calls 0 
his costars dont fare much better with people like morgan freeman jonah hill and ed helms just wasted 0 
full of unconvincing cardboard characters it is blandly written by edward chodorov who also produced and is surprisingly directed by jean negulesco from whom one would expect a great deal more 0 
for readers who have already seen one of miyazakis films he is still in top form and made another worthwhile experience 1 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
this is my new fav vegas buffet spot 1 
both the hot sour the egg flower soups were absolutely 5 stars 1 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
characters are onedimensional even the good guys and especially the bad guys 0 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
in short dont bother with this movie 0 
you share general loewenhielms exquisite joy in his partaking of the cailles en sarcophage even though you are just watching a movie but you do wish for just a small sample to savor 1 
great product fast shipping 1 
obviously they have a terrible customer service so you get what you pay for 0 
for service i give them no stars 0 
the movie in movie situations in the beginning and through the game that is played with her by the acting coach are fascinating 1 
duris has a wholesome appearance and gives a fine performance 1 
gets a signal when other verizon phones wont 1 
blue ant is easy to use 1 
some great music and terrific scenery 1 
some may say this buffet is pricey but i think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot 1 
this is the first phone ive had that has been so cheaply made 0 
this was such an awesome movie that i bought it off of ebay 1 
give this one a look 1 
they do not last forever but is not overly expensive to replaceeasy to operate and the sound is much better than others i have tried 1 
this is an outstanding little restaurant with some of the best food i have ever tasted 1 
i didnt realize how wonderful the short really is until the last two scenes 1 
this company charge me a restocking fee and still not given me my refund back 0 
however my girl was complain that some time the phone doesnt wake up like normal phone does 0 
this was reflected not only in the cast but also in the belowpar script which borrowed much from the earlier classic 0 
however after seeing the short again after about 25 years i was amazed at how timeless the film actually is 1 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
i know this is not like the other restaurants at all something is very off here 0 
but it wasnt anything at all just one big yawn 0 
the acting sucked 0 
attempting artiness with black white and clever camera angles the movie disappointed became even more ridiculous as the acting was poor and the plot and lines almost nonexistent 0 
the movie was very interesting from beginning to the end 1 
never got it 0 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
your servers suck wait correction our server heimer sucked 0 
we asked for the bill to leave without eating and they didnt bring that either 0 
to be honest with you this is unbelievable nonsense and very foolish 0 
awesome service and food 1 
so flavorful and has just the perfect amount of heat 1 
i have purchased these for both family and friends and all enjoy their clarity and ease of use 1 
absolutely great 1 
an excellent new restaurant by an experienced frenchman 1 
if you see it you should probably just leave it on the shelf 0 
the camera really likes her in this movie 1 
case was more or less an extra that i originally put on but later discarded because it scratched my ear 0 
it sure does beat the nachos at the movies but i would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant 0 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
sending it back 0 
the folks at otto always make us feel so welcome and special 1 
but when i check voice mail at night the keypad backlight turns off a few seconds into the first message and then im lost 0 
the nachos are a must have 1 
your staff spends more time talking to themselves than me 0 
the design is very odd as the ear clip is not very comfortable at all 0 
not recommended 0 
it fits my ear well and is comfortable on 1 
prosgood camera very nice pictures also has cool styles like black and white and more 1 
fantastic food 1 
there is a lot of beautiful places 1 
if you plan to use this in a car forget about it 0 
i only hear garbage for audio 0 
worked perfectly 1 
i really dont see how anyone could enjoy this movie 0 
jamie foxx absolutely is ray charles 1 
even in my bmw 3 series which is fairly quiet i have trouble hearing what the other person is saying 0 
the acting helps the writing along very well maybe the idiotsavant sister could have been played better and it is a real joy to watch 1 
the fact is this film is a wonderful heartwarming tale about two people chasing their dreams 1 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
i will be back many times soon 1 
the buffet at bellagio was far from what i anticipated 0 
wow very spicy but delicious 1 
really ugly 0 
this is a witty and delightful adaptation of the dr seuss book brilliantly animated by upas finest and thoroughly deserving of its academy award 1 
from what my dinner companions told meeverything was very fresh with nice texture and taste 1 
meredith m was better than all right 1 
i paid too much 0 
not good for the money 0 
service was fantastic 1 
hands down my favorite italian restaurant 1 
seller shipped quickly and much cheaper than the competitors 1 
they dropped more than the ball 0 
if there is a wind it is completely useless 0 
fantastic food 1 
poor construction 0 
this allows the possibility of double booking for the same date and time after the first 0 
i love the ownerchef his one authentic japanese cool dude 1 
main thing i didnt enjoy is that the crowd is of older crowd around mid 30s and up 0 
if there were zero stars i would give it zero stars 0 
its one of the movies i need to see whenever it comes on tvnever mind the fact that i already have it memorized 1 
no additional ear gels provided and no instructions whatsoever 0 
it is a really good show to watch 1 
disappointing accessory from a good manufacturer 0 
you cant beat that 1 
raw and sublimely moving 1 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
after the first charge kept going dead after 12 minutes 0 
this is essentially a communications tool that does not communicate 0 
i think not again 0 
down the drain because of a weak snap 0 
the eargels channel the sound directly into your ear and seem to increase the sound volume and clarity 1 
will not be back 0 
i think this restaurant suffers from not trying hard enough 0 
for that price i can think of a few place i would have much rather gone 0 
just whatever you do avoid groove as its the antithesis of all that is good about human traffic 0 
of course the footage from the 70s was grainy but that only enhanced the film 1 
this is one of the best movies out there that shows such strong sibling bond for each other 1 
problem is that the ear loops are made of weak material and break easily 0 
things that went wrong they burned the saganaki 0 
i took back my money and got outta there 0 
i had high hopes for this place since the burgers are cooked over a charcoal grill but unfortunately the taste fell flat way flat 0 
the problem was the script 0 
a good time 1 
not only did the software do a great job of this i could also make my own ringtones form my existing cds without an internet connection 1 
yes this film does require a rather significant amount of puzzlesolving but the pieces fit together to create a beautiful picture 1 
the story line is totally predictable 0 
so i am here to warn youdo not rent this movie it is the dumbest thing you have never seen 0 
this is definitely one of the better documentaries i have seen looking at family relationships and marriage 1 
these products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet 0 
doesnt hold charge 0 
the plantains were the worst ive ever tasted 0 
the phone loads super 1 
the food was great as always compliments to the chef 1 
ive had no trouble accessing the internet downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions 1 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
the battery life is highly unacceptable 0 
food is way overpriced and portions are fucking small 0 
this is my new fav vegas buffet spot 1 
i would highly recommend this 1 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
the descriptions said yum yum sauce and another said eel sauce yet another said spicy mayowell none of the rolls had sauces on them 0 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
that was done in the second movie 0 
often the dialogue doesnt really follow from one line to another or fit the surroundings 0 
this movie is terrible 0 
but storm trooper is not even bad enough to make it to the list of wonderfully terrible movies 0 
i particularly remember my senses being assaulted by strident cords of music that would blare out with very little warning and even less meaning 0 
its quite simply the highest most superlative form of cinema imaginable 1 
this movie contained an allstar cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i havent seen before 1 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
nargile i think you are great 1 
the headset fulfills my requirements so i am happy with my purchase 1 
trumbull on i love lucy 1 
the worst was the salmon sashimi 0 
simple lightweight and great fit 1 
i am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this 1 
it looked like a wonderful story 1 
star trek v the final frontier is the worst in the series 0 
i want to first say our server was great and we had perfect service 1 
i found this move beautiful enjoyable and uplifting 1 
just spicy enough perfect actually 1 
the story is beyond stupid 0 
overall the film is interesting and thoughtprovoking 1 
mishima is extremely uninteresting 0 
excellent hands free tool 1 
people who like european films and art movies will like this movie 1 
i was mortified 0 
i was able to do voice dialing in the car with no problem 1 
it is worth the drive 1 
i was particularly pleased with the acting ability of dwight schultz 1 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
it is an insane game 1 
in the summer you can dine in a charming outdoor patio so very delightful 1 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
i guess maybe we went on an off night but it was disgraceful 0 
drinks took close to 30 minutes to come out at one point 0 
overall i would recommend this phone over the new walkman 1 
lame would be the best way to describe it 0 
good service very clean and inexpensive to boot 1 
it is shameful 0 
the success of the film depends on the casting of sydney greenstreet as the alexander yardley character 1 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
but storm trooper is not even bad enough to make it to the list of wonderfully terrible movies 0 
we had 7 at our table and the service was pretty fast 1 
what a waste of money and time 0 
i love this bluetooth 1 
the bathroom is just next door and very nice 1 
this is the kind of money that is wasted properly 1 
today was my first taste of a buldogis gourmet hot dog and i have to tell you it was more than i ever thought possible 1 
well never go again 0 
this is the place where i first had pho and it was amazing 1 
spend your money and time some place else 0 
excellent hands free tool 1 
the volume for the ringer is real good you have choices how loud 1 
what should have been a hilarious yummy christmas eve dinner to remember was the biggest fail of the entire trip for us 0 
the selection was probably the worst ive seen in vegasthere was none 0 
on three different occasions i asked for well done or medium well and all three times i got the bloodiest piece of meat on my plate 0 
the staff are also very friendly and efficient 1 
it was either too cold not enough flavor or just bad 0 
rating 010 grade z note the show is so bad that even mother of the cast pull her daughter out of the show 0 
avoid at all costs 0 
his performance is simply genius 1 
it is just the sort of pap that is screened in the afternoon to punish the unemployed for not having jobs 0 
the battery works great 1 
the atmosphere was great with a lovely duo of violinists playing songs we requested 1 
none of them are engaging or exciting 0 
also the fries are without a doubt the worst fries ive ever had 0 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
yet i enjoy watching it 1 
nothing at all to recommend 0 
plug was the wrong size 0 
and generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode 0 
this film offers many delights and surprises 1 
i will be back many times soon 1 
it has been a winner for us 1 
if you havent choked in your own vomit by the end by all the cheap drama and worthless dialogue youve must have bored yourself to death with this waste of time 0 
but now that it is out of warranty the same problems reoccurebottom line put your money somewhere else cingular will not support it 0 
it is so small and you dont even realize that it is there after a while of getting used to it 1 
works great 1 
we are so glad we found this place 1 
this movie contained an allstar cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i havent seen before 1 
id love to go back 1 
there is however some pretty good acting at least for this type of film 1 
the owners really really need to quit being soooooo cheap let them wrap my freaking sandwich in two papers not one 0 
i saw this film over christmas and what a great film it was 1 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
as i said abovepretty useless 0 
very disappointing 0 
the veggitarian platter is out of this world 1 
im probably one of the few people to ever go to ians and not like it 0 
very good product well made 1 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
excellent product for the price 1 
cant say enough good things about this place 1 
hes a national treasure 1 
went for lunch service was slow 0 
i mean really how do you get so famous for your fish and chips when its so terrible 0 
its a little geeky but i think thats its sex on toast and it rocks and oozes sex right down to its battery embedded sleek stylish leather case 1 
this is infuriating 0 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
i ate there twice on my last visit and especially enjoyed the salmon salad 1 
this is one of the better buffets that i have been to 1 
punishment park is a brilliant piece of cinema 1 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
ps the only scene in the movie that was cool is when the central character finds her room blown up 1 
i dont think you will be disappointed 1 
the movie was so boring that i sometimes found myself occupied peaking in the paper instead of watching never happened during a columbo movie before 0 
this is probably the most irritating show i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
some may say this buffet is pricey but i think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot 1 
this is a disgrace 0 
love this headset 1 
im not eating here 0 
reasonably priced also 1 
then i exchanged for the same phone even that had the same problem 0 
it feels poorly constructed the menus are difficult to navigate and the buttons are so recessed that it is difficult to push them 0 
we waited for thirty minutes to be seated although there were 8 vacant tables and we were the only folks waiting 0 
i dont know what the big deal is about this place but i wont be back yaall 0 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
my order was not correct 0 
but now that it is out of warranty the same problems reoccurebottom line put your money somewhere else cingular will not support it 0 
this is the place where i first had pho and it was amazing 1 
dont waste your on this one 0 
i find this inexcusable and so will probably be returning this phone and perhaps changing carriers 0 
very dissapointing performance 0 
the servers are not pleasant to deal with and they dont always honor pizza hut coupons 0 
i have had this phone for over a year now and i will tell you its not that great 0 
i dont think well be going back anytime soon 0 
on the negative its insipid enough to cause regret for another 2 hours of life wasted in front of the screen 0 
excellent bluetooth headset 1 
very convenient since we were staying at the mgm 1 
the macarons here are insanely good 1 
its pretty surprising that this wonderful film was made in 1949 as hollywood generally had its collective heads in the sand concerning black and white issues at that time 1 
after two i felt disgusting 0 
i have to mention this and it is a huge spoiler i loved the ending how all the characters of the three films were the remaining survivors of the ferry disaster with valentine and the young judge together and the old man watching it on her tv solidifying his happiness over the suffering which he dealt with for those many years 1 
the cast is good 1 
excellent product for the price 1 
he surely doesnt know how to make a coherent action movie from the screenwriter of air force one who was only obliged to write the script just for a big sum of money 0 
highly recommended a 1 
have been going since 2007 and every meal has been awesome 1 
that was nice 1 
i have bought this nokia cell phone a few weeks ago and it was a nightmare 0 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
the company shipped my product very promptly and it works well 1 
bad characters bad story and bad acting 0 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
talk about useless customer service 0 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
which has more depth and character than the man underneath it 0 
i cant wait to go back 1 
his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic 1 
the service here leaves a lot to be desired 0 
the movie has almost no action scenes in it and very little comedy 0 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
it didnt charge for me 0 
after my phone got to be about a year old its been slowly breaking despite much care on my part 0 
main thing i didnt enjoy is that the crowd is of older crowd around mid 30s and up 0 
they do not care about the consumer one bit 0 
so badwellits just bad 0 
nice design and quality 1 
it is super charged up for use as a small hybrid palmtopcameracellphone and excels in those roles 1 
loved itfriendly servers great food wonderful and imaginative menu 1 
i wont be back 0 
very good stuff for the price 1 
this is a great restaurant at the mandalay bay 1 
great hands free device 1 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
the awful dialogue and hopeless overacting by everyone who gets shot top off a real waste of space and time 0 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
there was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters 0 
the battery is completely useless to me 0 
i wont be back 0 
seriously its not worth wasting your or your kids time on 0 
one of the best mexican movies ever and one of the less understood even by mexican themselves no matter how identified the should have felt with it 1 
coming here is like experiencing an underwhelming relationship where both parties cant wait for the other person to ask to break up 0 
the refried beans that came with my meal were dried out and crusty and the food was bland 0 
im big fan of rpg games too but this movie its a disgrace to any selfrespecting rpger there is 0 
heres where the movie really pied me off 0 
i have to jiggle the plug to get it to line up right to get decent volume 0 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
this place is amazing 1 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
the lines the cuts the audio everything is wrong 0 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
a great film by a great director 1 
everything was fresh and delicious 1 
loved itfriendly servers great food wonderful and imaginative menu 1 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
good audio quality 1 
still its quite interesting and entertaining to follow 1 
the charger arrived within the promised timeframe but it did not work 0 
there are so many problems i dont know where to start 0 
car charger as well as ac charger are included to make sure you never run out of juicehighy recommended 1 
there is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again 0 
my friend loved the salmon tartar 1 
bad day or not i have a very low tolerance for rude customer service people it is your job to be nice and polite wash dishes otherwise 0 
hackneyed writing certainly but made even worse by the bad directing 0 
the buttons for on and off are bad 0 
the staff are great the ambiance is great 1 
also difficult to put onid recommend avoiding this product 0 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
dont go here 0 
this film and i use that word loosely is an insult to the moviegoing public 0 
will never ever go back and have told many people what had happened 0 
your brain will attempt to shutdown as part of a primal impulse of selfpreservation 0 
dont waste your time watching this rubbish nonresearched film 0 
the scenery that the two daughters paint and photograph are beautiful 1 
i wasted my little money with this earpiece 0 
what a piece of junk i lose more calls on this phone 0 
the ending is so so perfect youll shed a tear 1 
much better than the other ayce sushi place i went to in vegas 1 
very good stuff for the price 1 
i was bored throughout the whole damn thing 0 
this movie now joins revenge of the boogeyman and zombiez as part of the hellish trinity of horror films 0 
if i take a picture the battery drops a bar and starts beeping letting me know its dieing 0 
the only possible way this movie could be redeemed would be as mst3k fodder 0 
his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic 1 
and generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode 0 
the acting by the whole cast could be put on a scale and balanced perfectly between overacting and underacting 0 
i probably wont be coming back here 0 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
pretty cool i would say 1 
their regular toasted bread was equally satisfying with the occasional pats of butter mmmm 1 
setup went very smoothly 1 
not to mention the combination of pears almonds and bacon is a big winner 1 
works great when my cat attacked the phone he scratched the protective strip instead of destroying the screen 1 
awful service 0 
you learn a lot about the real inside emotions of people in this movie and a lot about the movie business itself 1 
in fact im going to round up to 4 stars just because she was so awesome 1 
the atmosphere was great with a lovely duo of violinists playing songs we requested 1 
very good lunch spot 1 
portable and it works 1 
graphics is far from the best part of the game 0 
no actress has been worse used that june allison in this movie 0 
incredible 1 
the staff was very attentive 1 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
the ripped banana was not only ripped but petrified and tasteless 0 
the live music on fridays totally blows 0 
i bought this to use with my kindle fire and absolutely loved it 1 
it deserves strong love 1 
the fact is this film is a wonderful heartwarming tale about two people chasing their dreams 1 
easily none other cartoon made me laugh in a tender way before getting into dark sitcoms oriented for teenagers 1 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
so they performed 1 
its a shame to see good actors like thomerson and james make a living in a mess like this 0 
the phone is sturdy and waterproof 1 
all i have to say is the food was amazing 1 
all in all a great disappointment 0 
i guess maybe we went on an off night but it was disgraceful 0 
walked in and the place smelled like an old grease trap and only 2 others there eating 0 
the owners are super friendly and the staff is courteous 1 
otherwise easy to install and use clear sound 1 
it really created a unique feeling though 1 
see both films if you can 1 
dont waste your money and time 0 
overpriced for what you are getting 0 
muddy low quality sound and the casing around the wires insert was poorly super glued and slid off 0 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
if you love death and decay and shakespears lyrics this is the one 1 
the service was a little slow considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace 0 
the steak was amazingrge fillet relleno was the best seafood plate i have ever had 1 
the selection was probably the worst ive seen in vegasthere was none 0 
really good product 1 
my 810 score is mostly for the plot 1 
i have had mine for about a year and this christmas i bought some for the rest of the family 1 
however my girl was complain that some time the phone doesnt wake up like normal phone does 0 
i had the chicken pho and it tasted very bland 0 
the plug did not work very well 0 
battery has no life 0 
and finally after all that we get to an ending that wouldve been great had it been handled by competent people and not jerry falwell 0 
the story line is just awful 0 
the only downside is the service 0 
if you havent choked in your own vomit by the end by all the cheap drama and worthless dialogue youve must have bored yourself to death with this waste of time 0 
dont buy this product it fails 0 
the best phone in market 1 
punishment park is a brilliant piece of cinema 1 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
the entire audience applauded at the conclusion of the film 1 
it was so bad i had lost the heart to finish it 0 
perhaps my phone is defective but people cannot hear me when i use this 0 
i mean this in a terrible way 0 
just what i wanted 1 
the ear buds only play music in one ear 0 
treo and tmobile refused to replace it again and forced me to buy another phone without any kind of upgrade discount 0 
attempting artiness with black white and clever camera angles the movie disappointed became even more ridiculous as the acting was poor and the plot and lines almost nonexistent 0 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
a good time 1 
when achille and philippa beautifully sing a duet from don giovanni that perfectly describes their situation in the movie you appreciate the subtle layers of this excellent film 1 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
his losing his marbles so early in the proceedings is totally implausible and unconvincing 0 
i had to wait over 30 minutes to get my drink and longer to get 2 arepas 0 
unfortunately cover girl is an example of how hollywood used to exploit women for financial gain 0 
the lines the cuts the audio everything is wrong 0 
the shower area is outside so you can only rinse not take a full shower unless you dont mind being nude for everyone to see 0 
overall i am psyched to have a phone which has all my appointments and contacts in and gets great reception 1 
a fly was in my apple juice a fly 0 
i tried talking real loud but shouting on the telephone gets old and i was still told it wasnt great 0
