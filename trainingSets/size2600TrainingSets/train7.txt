the film is way too long 0 
they were goldencrispy and delicious 1 
1 hour 54 minutes of sheer tedium melodrama and horrible acting a mess of a script and a sinking feeling of good lord what were they thinking 0 
a good film by a great director 1 
never got it 0 
simple lightweight and great fit 1 
now the pizza itself was good the peanut sauce was very tasty 1 
after i pulled up my car i waited for another 15 minutes before being acknowledged 0 
the performances are not improved by improvisation because the actors now have twice as much to worry about not only whether theyre delivering the line well but whether the line itself is any good 0 
so in a nutshell 1 the restaraunt smells like a combination of a dirty fish market and a sewer 0 
it is very comfortable to wear as well which is probably the most important aspect about using a case 1 
the warm beer didnt help 0 
the phone is sturdy and waterproof 1 
this is a great deal 1 
magical help 1 
for that its worth checking out 1 
great pocket pc phone combination 1 
it was horrible 0 
it is a really good show to watch 1 
the vanilla ice cream was creamy and smooth while the profiterole choux pastry was fresh enough 1 
i live in the neighborhood so i am disappointed i wont be back here because it is a convenient location 0 
not much dialogue not much music the whole film was shot as elaborately and aesthetically like a sculpture 1 
no im going to eat the potato that i found some strangers hair in it 0 
and those baby owls were adorable 1 
i was disgusted because i was pretty sure that was human hair 0 
a bit predictable 0 
love this product 1 
i guess that nobody at the network that aired this dribble watched it before putting it on 0 
works great 1 
garbo who showed right off the bat that her talents could carry over from the silent era i wanted to see some of her silent work but netflix doesnt seem to be stocking them 1 
very disappointing 0 
if that bug never showed up i would have given a 4 for sure but on the other side of the wall where this bug was climbing was the kitchen 0 
it is just the sort of pap that is screened in the afternoon to punish the unemployed for not having jobs 0 
its a total package 1 
what a great double cheeseburger 1 
same evening him and i are both drastically sick 0 
it even has its sweet moments 1 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
having trouble with volume 0 
car charger as well as ac charger are included to make sure you never run out of juicehighy recommended 1 
excellent 1 
anyway the plot flowed smoothly and the malebonding scenes were a hoot 1 
conclusion very filling meals 1 
you have to hold the phone at a particular angle for the other party to hear you clearly 0 
unfortunately it did not work 0 
the pairing of the two devices was so easy it barely took a couple minutes before i started making calls with the voice dialing feature 1 
to those who find this movie intelligent or even masterful i can only say its your intelligence and your imagination you obviously used to try and make some sense of this pitiful attempt its in our human nature to try and make sense of things 0 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
it is well made easy to access the phone and has a handy detachable belt clip 1 
also the area where my unit broke im not too fond of the magnetic strap 0 
it didnt charge for me 0 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
the service was poor and thats being nice 0 
in an interesting part of town this place is amazing 1 
i didnt want the clip going over the top of my ear causing discomfort 0 
im happy about this purchase good quality and low price 1 
is pretty funny 1 
its reception is very very poor 0 
this place is great 1 
often the dialogue doesnt really follow from one line to another or fit the surroundings 0 
piece of junk 0 
after 20 minutes wait i got a table 0 
despite how hard i rate businesses its actually rare for me to give a 1 star 0 
i did not have any problem with this item and would order it again if needed 1 
they are so easy to love but even more easy to identify with 1 
the only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port irda 0 
the flair bartenders are absolutely amazing 1 
i recommend igo to anyone with different brand cell phonesmp3 players in the family 1 
ive dropped my phone more times than i can say even on concrete and my phone is still great knock on wood 1 
at around 4 pm i bought it at around 8pm i started to watch at around 815pm i fast forwarded the remaining film to see if there was anything left watchable for a human being with a brain but there wasnt 0 
it is well made easy to access the phone and has a handy detachable belt clip 1 
kind of flops around 0 
i had strawberry tea which was good 1 
phone now holds charge like it did when it was new 1 
poor sound quality 0 
not impressed 0 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
it seems completely secure both holding on to my belt and keeping the iphone inside 1 
it was a pale color instead of nice and char and has no flavor 0 
as a sushi lover avoid this place by all means 0 
great character actors telly savalas and peter boyle 1 
i am so tired of clich√©s that is just lazy writing and here they come in thick and fast 0 
the potatoes were great and so was the biscuit 1 
in the span of an hour i had two people exclaim whoa is that the new phone on tv 1 
his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic 1 
this is an excellent tool especially when paired with your phones autoanswer 1 
best tater tots in the southwest 1 
hell no will i go back 0 
the nachos are a must have 1 
the headsets are easy to use and everyone loves them 1 
feelings thoughtsgabriels discomfort during the danceall these intangibles leap to life and come within the viewers grasp in hustons portrayal 1 
nice design and quality 1 
i connected my wifes bluetoothmotorola hs850 to my phone and it worked like a charm whether the phone was in my pocket or the case 1 
nice design and quality 1 
restaurant is always full but never a wait 1 
not a good bargain 0 
oh the charger seems to work fine 1 
this phone tries very hard to do everything but fails at its very ability to be a phone 0 
the reception is excellent 1 
what did bother me was the slow service 0 
the soundtrack sucked 0 
even the squibs look awful 0 
the food is not tasty at all not to say its real traditional hunan style 0 
this is a witty and delightful adaptation of the dr seuss book brilliantly animated by upas finest and thoroughly deserving of its academy award 1 
hands down my favorite italian restaurant 1 
the sangria was about half of a glass wine full and was 12 ridiculous 0 
but the movie makes a lot of serious mistakes 0 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
from here on the widmark character turns unintentionally comical 0 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
i cant tell you how disappointed i was 0 
seriously its not worth wasting your or your kids time on 0 
the block was amazing 1 
feelings thoughtsgabriels discomfort during the danceall these intangibles leap to life and come within the viewers grasp in hustons portrayal 1 
battery chargelife is quite long 1 
the earpiece on this is too large or too heavyit keeps falling out of my ear 0 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
everything captain howdy says is either laughable or just plain stupid 0 
i checked everywhere and there is no feature for it which is really disappointing 0 
i was amazed at the quick arrival of the two original lg cell phone batteries and and at a fraction of the price 1 
i really enjoyed eating here 1 
as an earlier review noted plug in this charger and nothing happens 0 
the sound quality for the device is unacceptableunless you are in a really quiet area you almost hear nothing 0 
but in any case the best part is you can download these pictures to your laptop using ir or even send pictures from your laptop to the phone 1 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
horrible 0 
doesnt last long 0 
id advise anyone to go and see it 1 
any grandmother can make a roasted chicken better than this one 0 
this place is awesome if you want something light and healthy during the summer 1 
it has a very good plot it holds your complete attention the acting is superb tom wilkinson was fantastic and emily watson was also very good 1 
my order was not correct 0 
but the premise of the film was so ridiculous that the president of the us 0 
jabra ear gels r the best 1 
i was very pleased to see that i could replace my well travled swivel holster for my blackberry flip 1 
being a 90s child i truly enjoyed this show and i can proudly say that i enjoyed it big time and even more than the classical wb cartoons 1 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
it is just the sort of pap that is screened in the afternoon to punish the unemployed for not having jobs 0 
poor quality 0 
basically the service was very bad 0 
1 hour 54 minutes of sheer tedium melodrama and horrible acting a mess of a script and a sinking feeling of good lord what were they thinking 0 
fits comfortably came with three sizes of earbud tips 1 
nice docking station for home or work 1 
not a good bargain 0 
every time he opened his mouth you expect to hear you see kids pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show 0 
otherwise easy to install and use clear sound 1 
by far the best cheesecurds we have ever had 1 
poor reliability 0 
i wear it everyday and it holds up very well 1 
unless youre just out to visually collect all extant films of austens work you can skip this one 0 
his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic 1 
there is nothing privileged about workingeating there 0 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
the only suspense i was feeling was the frustration at just how retarded the girls were 0 
the servers went back and forth several times not even so much as an are you being helped 0 
but in terms of the writing its very fresh and bold 1 
this film tries to be a serious and sophisticated thrillerhorror flick and it fails miserably 0 
the building itself seems pretty neat the bathroom is pretty trippy but i wouldnt eat here again 0 
the food was terrible 0 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
i never come again 0 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
his losing his marbles so early in the proceedings is totally implausible and unconvincing 0 
however the keypads are so tinny that i sometimes reach the wrong buttons 0 
this item worked great but it broke after 6 months of use 0 
all in all i can assure you ill be back 1 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
poor quality 0 
great earpiece 1 
gets a signal when other verizon phones wont 1 
everything was perfect the night we were in 1 
there is no real plot 0 
the text messaging feature is really tricky to use 0 
its a great item 1 
they are so cool 1 
i really like this product over the motorola because it is allot clearer on the ear piece and the mic 1 
the company shipped my product very promptly and it works well 1 
great product fast shipping 1 
sending it back 0 
poor quality and service 0 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
the servers are not pleasant to deal with and they dont always honor pizza hut coupons 0 
food is way overpriced and portions are fucking small 0 
his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic 1 
i advise you to look out for it 1 
everything about this movie is stupid 0 
i purcashed this for the car charger and it does not work 0 
battery chargelife is quite long 1 
it wasnt busy at all and now we know why 0 
food was great and so was the serivce 1 
easily none other cartoon made me laugh in a tender way before getting into dark sitcoms oriented for teenagers 1 
best breakfast buffet 1 
there is a lot of beautiful places 1 
its reception is very very poor 0 
if there was ever an indication of a writer and a directors ability to meld two highly volatile temperaments into a seamless union of creativity then this is it 1 
his use of the colours of the french flag in the three films was nothing short of incredible every shot every scene was like a work of art 1 
you have to hold the phone at a particular angle for the other party to hear you clearly 0 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
i did not expect this to be so good 1 
probably not in a hurry to go back 0 
this is a chilly unremarkable movie about an author livingworking in a chilly abstruse culture 0 
which are small and not worth the price 0 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
the food is rich so order accordingly 1 
stopped by during the late may bank holiday off rick steve recommendation and loved it 1 
you cant beat that 1 
this second appearance of mickey mouse following the silent plane crazy earlier that year is probably his most famous filmmostly because it was so groundbreaking 1 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
great phone 1 
when i opened the sandwich i was impressed but not in a good way 0 
shes poised and amazing 1 
thank you for wasting my money 0 
i have always used corded headsets and the freedom from the wireless is very helpful 1 
battery has no life 0 
im a big fan of this series mostly due to anne rices style sensitivities and treatments 1 
it definitely was not as good as my s11 1 
coming here is like experiencing an underwhelming relationship where both parties cant wait for the other person to ask to break up 0 
it was clear that she had the range and ability to pull off this part 1 
everything captain howdy says is either laughable or just plain stupid 0 
the desserts were a bit strange 0 
the only thing i wasnt too crazy about was their guacamole as i dont like it pur√©ed 0 
weve tried to like this place but after 10 times i think were done with them 0 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
the service was outshining i definitely recommend the halibut 1 
i recently tried caballeros and i have been back every week since 1 
the plantains were the worst ive ever tasted 0 
the film has an ultracheap look to it 0 
what a waste of money and time 0 
this movie creates its own universe and is fascinating in every way 1 
food was so gooodd 1 
i wish i could enter negative values admins 0 
this is a simple little phone to use but the breakage is unacceptible 0 
none of the new ones have ever quite worked properly 0 
the potato chip order was sad i could probably count how many chips were in that box and it was probably around 12 0 
i highly recommend this device to everyone 1 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
all in all im quite satisfied with this purchase 1 
seller shipped quickly and much cheaper than the competitors 1 
the cast of veteran actors are more than just a nostalgia trip 1 
better than expected 1 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
one of the best mexican movies ever and one of the less understood even by mexican themselves no matter how identified the should have felt with it 1 
steamboat willie is an amazingly important film to our cinema history 1 
i consider this theft 0 
i thoroughly enjoyed it when christopher eccleston took control of the tardis and the continuation of the series 1 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
not worth it 0 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
i have never had such bland food which surprised me considering the article we read focused so much on their spices and flavor 0 
these were so good we ordered them twice 1 
insults profound deuchebaggery and had to go outside for a smoke break while serving just to solidify it 0 
dont buy this product 0 
you share general loewenhielms exquisite joy in his partaking of the cailles en sarcophage even though you are just watching a movie but you do wish for just a small sample to savor 1 
the staff are great the ambiance is great 1 
i love lane but ive never seen her in a movie this lousy 0 
his costars dont fare much better with people like morgan freeman jonah hill and ed helms just wasted 0 
it was just too horrible 0 
on the ground right next to our table was a large smeared beensteppedinandtrackedeverywhere pile of green bird poop 0 
anyways the food was definitely not filling at all and for the price you pay you should expect more 0 
clever and a real crowdpleaserthis film still ranks among mickeys best films even after 80 wonderful years 1 
im a big fan of this series mostly due to anne rices style sensitivities and treatments 1 
a world better than 95 of the garbage in the theatres today 1 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
but the duet between the astronaut and his doctor at the beginning of the movie is a perfect exchange if one considers that this movie was made well into the cold war and the astronauts biggest fear is that he has crashed in the ussr 1 
i love the look and feel of samsung flipphones 1 
no ear loop needed its tiny and the sound is great 1 
this place is way too overpriced for mediocre food 0 
worst martini ever 0 
the plot well i said id let that one go 0 
the only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive 1 
the scenery that the two daughters paint and photograph are beautiful 1 
i was mortified 0 
this is definitely a cult classic well worth viewing and sharing with others 1 
the service was meh 0 
i was mortified 0 
we had so much to say about the place before we walked in that he expected it to be amazing but was quickly disappointed 0 
nice case feels good in your hands 1 
frozen pucks of disgust with some of the worst people behind the register 0 
i am not a filmmaker nor am i a director but i would hide my head in the sand if id spent whatever amount of money and time on this movie 0 
i came over from verizon because cingulair has nicer cell phones the first thing i noticed was the really bad service 0 
the performances are real and gripping the crocdodile is extremely well done indeed if the black water website is to be believed thats because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous 1 
its a great tool for entertainment communication and data managementoh be sure to use activesync 42 for optimal data synchronization results 1 
gotta love those closeups of slimy drooling teeth 1 
people couldnt hear me talk and i had to pull out the earphone and talk on the phone 0 
what a big waste of time 0 
initially the local sites in the film which was filmed here in buffalo intrigued me 1 
and those baby owls were adorable 1 
i would recommend this 1 
i am very impressed with the job that motorola did on the sturdiness of this phone 1 
good food good service 1 
these are the central themes of the film and they are handled ineptly stereotypically and with no depth of imagination 0 
this review is long overdue since i consider a tale of two sisters to be the single greatest film ever made 1 
piece of trash 0 
see it 1 
i really enjoyed crema caf√© before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
very friendly staff 1 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
ive never been more insulted or felt disrespected 0 
this is essentially a communications tool that does not communicate 0 
its a little geeky but i think thats its sex on toast and it rocks and oozes sex right down to its battery embedded sleek stylish leather case 1 
this movie is possibly one of the most creative works of horror ever 1 
worked great 1 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
very good stuff for the price 1 
much less than the jawbone i was going to replace it with 1 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
exceptionally bad 0 
i also didnt like the on button it felt like it would crack with use 0 
it has been a winner for us 1 
service is quick and even to go orders are just like we like it 1 
battery has no life 0 
this is so embarassing and also my ears hurt if i try to push the ear plug into my ear 0 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
ray charles life provided excellent biographical material for the film which goes well beyond being just another movie about a musician 1 
restaurant is always full but never a wait 1 
easy to pair with my samsung cell 1 
you wont forget this movie 1 
i will not be eating there again 0 
despite the pans of reviewers i liked this movie 1 
you wont regret it 1 
she ordered a toasted english muffin that came out untoasted 0 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurv√•g being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
eclectic selection 1 
if good intentions made a film great then this film might be one of the greatest films ever made 1 
great for ipods too 1 
but the premise of the film was so ridiculous that the president of the us 0 
using all earpieces left or right this thing will not stay on my ear 0 
kris kristoffersen is good in this movie and really makes a difference 1 
this totally unfunny movie is so over the top and pathetic and unrealistic that throughout the whole 90 minutes of utter torture i probably looked at my watch about 70000 times 0 
it does everything the description said it would 1 
owners are really great people 1 
damian is so talented and versatile in so many ways of writing and portraying different characters on screen 1 
rip off over charge shipping 0 
as an earlier review noted plug in this charger and nothing happens 0 
a standout scene 1 
i highly recommend this modest priced cellular phone 1 
punishment park is a brilliant piece of cinema 1 
dont waste your money 0 
the battery is completely useless to me 0 
this device is great in several situations1 1 
the screen size is big key pad lit well enough and the camera quality is excellent for a camera phone 1 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
this movie does an excellent job of revealing the complexity of the task and the incredible challenges facing south africa 1 
it wasnt busy either also the building was freezing cold 0 
i also didnt like the on button it felt like it would crack with use 0 
the sound quality for the device is unacceptableunless you are in a really quiet area you almost hear nothing 0 
it works fine on my motorola 325 cellphone and a lot better than the wornout battery did 1 
no one at the table thought the food was above average or worth the wait that we had for it 0 
it finds my cell phone right away when i enter the car 1 
great audio 1 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
this was a poor remake of my best friends wedding 0 
plus it was wellpaced and suited its relatively short run time 1 
the things that the four kids get themselves into is absolutely hilarious to watch 1 
iam very pleased with my purchase 1 
i cant believe theres even a sequel to this 0 
i am not a filmmaker nor am i a director but i would hide my head in the sand if id spent whatever amount of money and time on this movie 0 
i like steiners because its dark and it feels like a bar 1 
i came over from verizon because cingulair has nicer cell phones the first thing i noticed was the really bad service 0 
but the convoluted plot just didnt convince me and much of the film was watched with a weird questioning glance 0 
they brought a fresh batch of fries and i was thinking yay something warm but no 0 
i great reception all the time 1 
almost everyone involved must be return to school acting is utterly predictable and bad script is pile of garbage all round 0 
no ear loop needed its tiny and the sound is great 1 
utter crap sound quality is terrible 0 
im probably one of the few people to ever go to ians and not like it 0 
meredith m was better than all right 1 
love the margaritas too 1 
thats how id describe this painfully dreary timewaster of a film 0 
i might have gotten a defect but i would not risk buying it again because of the built quality alone 0 
if you look for authentic thai food go else where 0 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
plus its only 8 bucks 1 
none of the new ones have ever quite worked properly 0 
it clicks into place in a way that makes you wonder how long that mechanism would last 0 
predictable but not a bad watch 1 
much less than the jawbone i was going to replace it with 1 
the pizza selections are good 1 
the servers are not pleasant to deal with and they dont always honor pizza hut coupons 0 
great service and food 1 
crostini that came with the salad was stale 0 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
appetite instantly gone 0 
the staff is friendly and the joint is always clean 1 
the writer gorman bechard undoubtedly did his homework because all references are industry and characterage appropriate 1 
it wasnt busy at all and now we know why 0 
hes a national treasure 1 
to those who find this movie intelligent or even masterful i can only say its your intelligence and your imagination you obviously used to try and make some sense of this pitiful attempt its in our human nature to try and make sense of things 0 
great it was new packaged nice works good no problems and it came in less time then i expected 1 
car charger as well as ac charger are included to make sure you never run out of juicehighy recommended 1 
id advise anyone to go and see it 1 
this is one of the better buffets that i have been to 1 
i was so insulted 0 
her role was played well 1 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
i particularly remember my senses being assaulted by strident cords of music that would blare out with very little warning and even less meaning 0 
not good enough for the price 0 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
i will be back many times soon 1 
after two i felt disgusting 0 
this was like the final blow 0 
its not hard to make a decent hamburger 0 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
the awful dialogue and hopeless overacting by everyone who gets shot top off a real waste of space and time 0 
seems like a good quick place to grab a bite of some familiar pub food but do yourself a favor and look elsewhere 0 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
great service and food 1 
this gets a 1 out of 10 simply because theres nothing lower 0 
the acting helps the writing along very well maybe the idiotsavant sister could have been played better and it is a real joy to watch 1 
special thanks to dylan t for the recommendation on what to order all yummy for my tummy 1 
i have purchased these for both family and friends and all enjoy their clarity and ease of use 1 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clich√©s to be admitted elsewhere 0 
i seriously cannot believe that the owner has so many unexperienced employees that all are running around like chickens with their heads cut off 0 
this is a very average phone with bad battery life that operates on a weak network 0 
amazon sucks 0 
worst service to boot but that is the least of their worries 0 
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0 
i didnt want the clip going over the top of my ear causing discomfort 0 
i had a pretty satifying experience 1 
absolutel junk 0 
this movie is greatespecially if you enjoy visual arts 1 
nothing at all to recommend 0 
i heart this place 1 
each track commands sentiment actually contributing to the scenes and characters 1 
the story unfolds in 18th century jutland and the use of period music played on period instruments is just one more fine touch 1 
the steak was amazingrge fillet relleno was the best seafood plate i have ever had 1 
it works 1 
i could care less the interior is just beautiful 1 
the pizza selections are good 1 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
very disappointed and wondered how it could be in the oscar shortlist 0 
but the duet between the astronaut and his doctor at the beginning of the movie is a perfect exchange if one considers that this movie was made well into the cold war and the astronauts biggest fear is that he has crashed in the ussr 1 
special mention should be made of the superb music score and sound effects which are an integral element in helping to make this such a memorable and enjoyable cartoon 1 
youll love it 1 
there is simply no excuse for something this poorly done 0 
he is an amazing film artist one of the most important whoever lived 1 
great bluetooth 1 
i am going to have to be the first to negatively review this product 0 
essentially you can forget microsofts tech support 0 
so bad 0 
theres barely a boring moment in the film and there are plenty of humorous parts 1 
dont do it 0 
on the good side the staff was genuinely pleasant and enthusiastic a real treat 1 
great brunch spot 1 
it was pretty gross 0 
2 thumbs up to this seller 1 
raw and sublimely moving 1 
clever and a real crowdpleaserthis film still ranks among mickeys best films even after 80 wonderful years 1 
overall i rate this movie a 10 out of a 110 scale 1 
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
unfortunately the ability to actually know you are receiving a call is a rather important feature and this phone is pitiful in that respect 0 
very displeased 0 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
echo problemvery unsatisfactory 0 
i great reception all the time 1 
at a time when it seems that film animation has been dominated by disneypixars cgi masterpieces it is both refreshing and comforting to know that miyazaki is still relying on traditional handdrawn animation to tell his charming and enchanting stories 1 
today was my first taste of a buldogis gourmet hot dog and i have to tell you it was more than i ever thought possible 1 
this is one of the best italian thrillers of the early 70s 1 
have been going since 2007 and every meal has been awesome 1 
dont buy this product 0 
the keyboard is a nice compromise between a full qwerty and the basic cell phone number keypad 1 
much less than the jawbone i was going to replace it with 1 
delicious nyc bagels good selections of cream cheese real lox with capers even 1 
that being said for a phone the camera is very nice many cool effects to play with and video is decent as well 1 
this place is not quality sushi it is not a quality restaurant 0 
add betty white and jean smart and you have a great cast everyone played their parts really well 1 
and generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode 0 
pretty piece of junk 0 
i was not happy with this item 0 
stopped by during the late may bank holiday off rick steve recommendation and loved it 1 
do not buy if you want to use the holster 0 
logitech bluetooth headset is a 10 1 
i cannot believe that the actors agreed to do this film 0 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
the shower area is outside so you can only rinse not take a full shower unless you dont mind being nude for everyone to see 0 
no im going to eat the potato that i found some strangers hair in it 0 
ordered an appetizer and took 40 minutes and then the pizza another 10 minutes 0 
very good food great atmosphere1 1 
first time there and might just be the last 0 
waaaaaayyyyyyyyyy over rated is all i am saying 0 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
hence the whole story lacks a certain energy 0 
i get absolutely horrible reception in my apartment where with other phones i have not had this problem 0 
id love to go back 1 
my first visit to hiro was a delight 1 
camera color balance is awful 0 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
it was just too horrible 0 
but when i check voice mail at night the keypad backlight turns off a few seconds into the first message and then im lost 0 
other than that the leather is nice and soft the fit is very tight the cut out for the face is a good shape 1 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
it was awesome 1 
it just blew 0 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
this is just a great movie 1 
weve have gotten a much better service from the pizza place next door than the services we received from this restaurant 0 
i love the look and feel of samsung flipphones 1 
barney is definitely super de duper 1 
in fact this stinker smells like a directtovideo release 0 
they have horrible attitudes towards customers and talk down to each one when customers dont enjoy their food 0 
the characters are fleshed out surprisingly well particularly grimes and blake and all the actors deliver their sharply scripted lines with just the right amount of deadpan tongue in cheek to make the dialogue both hilarious and realistic 1 
its reception is very very poor 0 
about half way through this film i started to dislike it 0 
the service here is fair at best 0 
seafood was limited to boiled shrimp and crab legs but the crab legs definitely did not taste fresh 0 
the portion was huge 1 
battery is holding up well 1 
i think i was one of the people who found this another one of roths pearls 1 
if that bug never showed up i would have given a 4 for sure but on the other side of the wall where this bug was climbing was the kitchen 0 
the writers were smack on and i think the best actors and actresses were a bonus to the showthese characters were so real 1 
avoid avoid avoid 0 
the service was poor and thats being nice 0 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
very cheap plastic creaks like an old wooden floor 0 
i really enjoyed crema caf√© before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
i could not recommend these more 0 
this would not even be good as a made for tv flick 0 
very clear quality sound and you dont have to mess with the sound on your ipod since you have the sound buttons on the headset 1 
this was a poor remake of my best friends wedding 0 
the calls drop the phone comes on and off at will the screen goes black and the worst of all it stops ringing intermittently 0 
only pros large seating area nice bar area great simple drink menu the best brick oven pizza with homemade dough 1 
the staff is great the food is delish and they have an incredible beer selection 1 
i agree with jessica this movie is pretty bad 0 
however i needed some better instructions 0 
i got it because it was so small and adorable 1 
the owners are super friendly and the staff is courteous 1 
good food good service 1 
nice quality build unlike some cheap s out there 1 
the dialogue sucked 0 
i wasnt the least bit interested 0 
i really enjoyed crema caf√© before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
now i know that i made a wise decision 1 
the performances are not improved by improvisation because the actors now have twice as much to worry about not only whether theyre delivering the line well but whether the line itself is any good 0 
the handsfree part works fine but then the car tries to download the address book and the treo rebootsoverall i still rate this device high 1 
my sashimi was poor quality being soggy and tasteless 0 
a great way to finish a great 1 
its worth driving up from tucson 1 
i would recommend this 1 
i exchanged the sony ericson z500a for this and im pretty happy with that decision 1 
in fact im going to round up to 4 stars just because she was so awesome 1 
the feel of the dining room was more college cooking course than high class dining and the service was slow at best 0 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
i can say that the desserts were yummy 1 
i cant believe theres even a sequel to this 0 
excellent performance 1 
they never brought a salad we asked for 0 
this is an outstanding little restaurant with some of the best food i have ever tasted 1 
conclusion i loved it 1 
give this one a look 1 
but what really made it unwatchable was the direction 0 
poor quality 0 
so i am here to warn youdo not rent this movie it is the dumbest thing you have never seen 0 
the first time i ever came here i had an amazing experience i still tell people how awesome the duck was 1 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
the plot simply rumbles on like a machine desperately depending on the addition of new scenes 0 
yes i am simplifying things here for the sake of brevity for this really is at the core of the problems with this film it has too much going on without any real fulfilling explanation 0 
they could be used as exemplars for any set designer 1 
this movie is possibly one of the most creative works of horror ever 1 
service is quick and friendly 1 
the explosion of the gas tanks at the end was just as awful 0 
does not fit 0 
this is a great little item 1 
there is so much good food in vegas that i feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to rice and company 0 
nothing special 0 
you will leave the theater wanting to go out and dance under the stars 1 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
never been to hard rock casino before will never ever step forward in it again 0 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
the story which was told so eloquently by francis ford coppola 25 years earlier really unfolds gradually and leaves room for the characters to develop 1 
updatewent back for a second time and it was still just as amazing 1 
im surprised this is a good quality car charger and theres not much reviews about it 1 
id advise anyone to go and see it 1 
youll love how thin it is 1 
we got the food and apparently they have never heard of salt and the batter on the fish was chewy 0 
worse theres an incredibly weak subplot thrown in that follows a little band of latterday mansonites as they go after a reporter whos working on a story on the anniversary of the killings 0 
reasonably priced also 1 
each track commands sentiment actually contributing to the scenes and characters 1 
still its quite interesting and entertaining to follow 1 
now we were chosen to be tortured with this disgusting piece of blatant american propaganda 0 
food was so gooodd 1 
brilliance indeed 1 
headset works great was packaged nicely to avoid any damage 1 
the real killer is the volume and of course it breaking 0 
i really dont see how anyone could enjoy this movie 0 
i got to enjoy the seafood salad with a fabulous vinegrette 1 
the two main characters may be two of the most believable children i ever saw put on screen 1 
the food came out at a good pace 1 
never heard of any of them except cole who was totally unbelievable in the part 0 
by the time the film ended i not only disliked it i despised it 0 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
also were served hot bread and butter and home made potato chips with bacon bits on topvery original and very good 1 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
trumbull on i love lucy 1 
one nice thing was that they added gratuity on the bill since our party was larger than 6 or 8 and they didnt expect more tip than that 1 
but when someone strives for greatness and poetry but delivers a muddled and often ridiculous story a bunch of disparate scenes pretentious dialogue then you get the worst kind of a movie that some other reviewer very accurately defined as pretentious crap 0 
great food and service huge portions and they give a military discount 1 
up there with the best of melville 1 
dont buy this product 0 
there is nothing privileged about workingeating there 0 
anyways the food was definitely not filling at all and for the price you pay you should expect more 0 
the worst was the salmon sashimi 0 
ive had no trouble accessing the internet downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions 1 
i do think tom hanks is a good actor 1 
this is a masterful piece of filmmaking with many themes simmering and occasionally boiling over in this warts and all study of the poets bohemian selfindulgent wartime years that span the aerial bombardments of london and the outward tranquillity of a welsh coastal retreat the borderlines between friendship lust and love dedication to art and experience versus practical concerns jealousy rivalry cowardice and egotism versus heroism and selfsacrifice and more 1 
good price 1 
after trying many many handsfree gadgets this is the one that finally works well 1 
unless youre just out to visually collect all extant films of austens work you can skip this one 0 
ive bought 5 wired headphones that sound better than these 0 
battery is holding up well 1 
it is a joy to use 1 
definitely a bargain 1 
i love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it 1 
i just dont know how this place managed to served the blandest food i have ever eaten when they are preparing indian cuisine 0 
both of the egg rolls were fantastic 1 
i live in the neighborhood so i am disappointed i wont be back here because it is a convenient location 0 
in the summer you can dine in a charming outdoor patio so very delightful 1 
the chips that came out were dripping with grease and mostly not edible 0 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
reasonably priced also 1 
very disappointed 0 
all in all ha long bay was a bit of a flop 0 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
the spaghetti is nothing special whatsoever 0 
it felt too light and tinny 0 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
highly recommend for any one who has a blue tooth phone 1 
this review is long overdue since i consider a tale of two sisters to be the single greatest film ever made 1 
the plantains were the worst ive ever tasted 0 
i am so tired of clich√©s that is just lazy writing and here they come in thick and fast 0 
people who like european films and art movies will like this movie 1 
on three different occasions i asked for well done or medium well and all three times i got the bloodiest piece of meat on my plate 0 
i would highly recommend this product 1 
that was done in the second movie 0 
the acting is terrible and the writing is worse 0 
oh yeah and the storyline was pathetic too 0 
and his subtle connections between the three films are awesome 1 
i could not understand what kind of idiot would produce this mess in the first place not to mention several season 0 
although i very much liked the look and sound of this place the actual experience was a bit disappointing 0 
i gave it a 10 1 
the burger had absolutely no flavor the meat itself was totally bland the burger was overcooked and there was no charcoal flavor 0 
the staff is always super friendly and helpful which is especially cool when you bring two small boys and a baby 1 
design flaw 0 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
the best place to go for a tasty bowl of pho 1 
the chips and salsa were really good the salsa was very fresh 1 
did not like at all 0 
the writers were smack on and i think the best actors and actresses were a bonus to the showthese characters were so real 1 
problem is that the ear loops are made of weak material and break easily 0 
improper description i had to return it 0 
the ambiance isnt much better 0 
their steaks are 100 recommended 1 
definitely worth checking out 1 
the acting by the whole cast could be put on a scale and balanced perfectly between overacting and underacting 0 
i dont think there are any redeeming qualities in this remake 0 
the point is the journey a journey that touches every member of the family 1 
the seasonal fruit was fresh white peach puree 1 
but despite these few flaws this case is of exceptional quality and well worth the additional costs of owning an official oem product 1 
the building itself seems pretty neat the bathroom is pretty trippy but i wouldnt eat here again 0 
excellent dualpurpose headset 1 
this was a different cut than the piece the other day but still wonderful and tender s well as well flavored 1 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
these are certainly very comfortable and functionality is decent 1 
dont waste your on this one 0 
excellent sound quality 1 
the charger arrived within the promised timeframe but it did not work 0 
the acting sucks the music sucks the script sucks the pacing sucks the special fx suck the directing sucks basically this movie sucks 0 
i had a salad with the wings and some ice cream for dessert and left feeling quite satisfied 1 
not easy to watch 0 
seller shipped quickly and much cheaper than the competitors 1 
i had strawberry tea which was good 1 
obviously they have a terrible customer service so you get what you pay for 0 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
go watch it 1 
very slow at seating even with reservation 0 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
id like to return it 0 
i had heard good things about this place but it exceeding every hope i could have dreamed of 1 
a good commentary of todays love and undoubtedly a film worth seeing 1 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
its a total package 1 
i am a fan of his this movie sucked really bad 0 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
constantine gives everything the right intensity and seems to have a good understanding of the underlying psychological motivations 1 
so absolutley fantastic 1 
the restaurant is very clean and has a family restaurant feel to it 1 
lastly the mozzarella sticks they were the best thing we ordered 1 
perabo has a nice energy level and is obviously very comfortable in front of a camera 1 
the budget was evidently very limited 0 
they know how to make them here 1 
the story line is just awful 0 
it holds a charge for a long time is reasonably comfortable under longwearing conditions and the quality of sound is tremendous 1 
it works 1 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
this movie now joins revenge of the boogeyman and zombiez as part of the hellish trinity of horror films 0 
worthwhile 1 
went in for happy hour great list of wines 1 
the best place to go for a tasty bowl of pho 1 
food was so gooodd 1 
comfortable in my hand 1 
very much disappointed with this company 0 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
the food wasnt good 0 
i gave it 5 stars because of the sound quality 1 
this film highlights the fundamental flaws of the legal process that its not about discovering guilt or innocence but rather is about who presents better in court 1 
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
very very sad 0 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
service was exceptional and food was a good as all the reviews 1 
linked to my phone without effort 1 
before i go in to why i gave a 1 star rating please know that this was my third time eating at bachi burger before writing a review 0 
the mic there is a joke and the volume is quite low 0 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
its just adorable seeing mickey playing turkey in the straw in a highly imaginative if occasionally cruel way 1 
this movie is greatespecially if you enjoy visual arts 1 
nice docking station for home or work 1 
i would recommend purchasing the jabra jx10 series 2 which works flawlessly with my moto q go figure 1 
great choice 1 
it doesnt make you look cool 0 
fantastic service here 1 
but its just not funny 0 
no plot whatsoever 0 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
if it were possible to give them zero stars theyd have it 0 
i checked out this place a couple years ago and was not impressed 0 
big disappointment with calendar sync 0 
worst customer service ever 0 
it was quite comfortable in the ear 1 
plus it was wellpaced and suited its relatively short run time 1 
like the other reviewer said you couldnt pay me to eat at this place again 0 
for those that havent seen it dont waste your time 0 
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
small sleek impressive looking practical setup with ample storage in place 1 
the plot doesnt hang together at all and the acting is absolutely appalling 0 
but the convoluted plot just didnt convince me and much of the film was watched with a weird questioning glance 0 
elias koteasjack palance play good roles angelina is hot and gets nakedbilly drago appears in this and is cool as usual a cameo by sven ole thorsen helps make this a very enjoyable movie with good acting and a decent budget 1 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
this company charge me a restocking fee and still not given me my refund back 0 
it definitely was not as good as my s11 1 
kids pizza is always a hit too with lots of great side dish options for the kiddos 1 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
join the club and get awesome offers via email 1 
i didnt know pulled pork could be soooo delicious 1 
great product for the price 1 
similarly the delivery man did not say a word of apology when our food was 45 minutes late 0 
this place deserves no stars 0 
i wasted my little money with this earpiece 0 
the entire audience applauded at the conclusion of the film 1 
never been to hard rock casino before will never ever step forward in it again 0 
you share general loewenhielms exquisite joy in his partaking of the cailles en sarcophage even though you are just watching a movie but you do wish for just a small sample to savor 1 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
it finds my cell phone right away when i enter the car 1 
the food was delicious our bartender was attentive and personable and we got a great deal 1 
works well 1 
now you know why i gave it a 10 1 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
this place is not worth your time let alone vegas 0 
do not make the same mistake as me 0 
that company is a joke 0 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
i got to enjoy the seafood salad with a fabulous vinegrette 1 
a disappointment 0 
the lighting is awful 0 
i consider this theft 0 
the headset fulfills my requirements so i am happy with my purchase 1 
thank you for such great service 1 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
although i very much liked the look and sound of this place the actual experience was a bit disappointing 0 
regardless the film fails on most levels 0 
gets the job done 1 
low quality 0 
looks great and is strong 1 
kieslowski never ceases to amaze me 1 
just spicy enough perfect actually 1 
the death row scenes were entirely unmoving 0 
but other than that the movie seemed to drag and the heroes didnt really work for their freedom 0 
an interesting premise and billy drago is always good as a dangerous nutbag side note id love to see drago stephen mchattie and lance hendrikson in a flick together talk about raging cheekbones 1 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
nobody identifies with these characters because theyre all cardboard cutouts and stereotypes or predictably reversestereotypes 0 
what a great double cheeseburger 1 
i would recommend it 1 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
im not sure what he was trying to do with this film 0 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
not to mention the combination of pears almonds and bacon is a big winner 1 
please dont waste your money 0 
i believe the screenwriter did a good job of tying up the loose ends 1 
the earpiece on this is too large or too heavyit keeps falling out of my ear 0 
server did a great job handling our large rowdy table 1 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
i wouldnt return 0 
the only place good for this film is in the garbage 0 
they have a really nice atmosphere 1 
with great sound effects and impressive special effects i cant recommend this movie enough 1 
the stories were as unbelievable as the actors 0 
its extremely slow and takes forever to do anything with it 0 
oh and i forgot to also mention the weird color effect it has on your phone 0 
my boyfriend tried the mediterranean chicken salad and fell in love 1 
ryans bar is definitely one edinburgh establishment i wont be revisiting 0 
great case and price 1 
love this phone 1 
i am a fan of his this movie sucked really bad 0 
the food was outstanding and the prices were very reasonable 1 
the camera although rated at an impressive 13 megapixels renders images that fall well below expectations of such a relatively high resolution 0 
having to humour him just to get by and get through the day was so apt 1 
the jamaican mojitos are delicious 1 
sending it back 0 
i hate those things as much as cheap quality black olives 0 
the sound quality is excellent as well 1 
the memories are murky but i can only say that i enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show 1 
just reading on the specs alone makes you say wow 1 
although i very much liked the look and sound of this place the actual experience was a bit disappointing 0 
what a big waste of time 0 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
at no point in the proceedings does it look remotely like america 0 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
i wasted my little money with this earpiece 0 
i dont know exactly what it is about this movie but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our familys memories 1 
think it over when you plan to own this onethis sure is the last moto phone for me 0 
this is a witty and delightful adaptation of the dr seuss book brilliantly animated by upas finest and thoroughly deserving of its academy award 1 
their research and development division obviously knows what theyre doing 1 
blue ant is easy to use 1 
the phone was unusable and was not new 0 
but other than that the movie seemed to drag and the heroes didnt really work for their freedom 0 
logitech bluetooth headset is a 10 1 
i have bought this nokia cell phone a few weeks ago and it was a nightmare 0 
110 and only because there is no setting for 010 0 
your brain will attempt to shutdown as part of a primal impulse of selfpreservation 0 
it has kept up very well 1 
see both films if you can 1 
the sweet potato tots were good but the onion rings were perfection or as close as i have had 1 
service stinks here 0 
ive had this for nearly 2 years and it has worked great for me 1 
sounds good reasonably priced and effective its that simple 1 
reversible plug works great 1 
1010 1 
the greek dressing was very creamy and flavorful 1 
still waiting im sure this item would work well if i ever recieve it 0 
product is useless since it does not have enough charging current to charge the 2 cellphones i was planning to use it with 0 
the owners really really need to quit being soooooo cheap let them wrap my freaking sandwich in two papers not one 0 
this is such a fun and funny movie 1 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
my wife had the lobster bisque soup which was lukewarm 0 
i hope this place sticks around 1 
its the best headset i have used 1 
the salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop which was perfectly cooked 1 
this is cool because most cases are just open there allowing the screen to get all scratched up 1 
its worth driving up from tucson 1 
punishment park is a brilliant piece of cinema 1 
i could eat their bruschetta all day it is devine 1 
this is a good battery and it got here really fast 1 
magical help 1 
what a great double cheeseburger 1 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
i have 23 bars on my cell phone when i am home but you cant not hear anything 0 
great phone 1 
the sets especially designed to work with the camera are amazingstylized beautiful and effective 1 
oh the charger seems to work fine 1 
best of all is the rotating feature very helpful 1 
in fact this stinker smells like a directtovideo release 0 
and finally after all that we get to an ending that wouldve been great had it been handled by competent people and not jerry falwell 0 
could not get strong enough signal 0 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
my gyro was basically lettuce only 0 
works as described 1 
its just lame 0 
i mean really how do you get so famous for your fish and chips when its so terrible 0 
its just painful 0 
though the wind and the lion is told largely through the eyes of the son every member of the family can identify with one of the characters whether it be sean connerys noble brigand candace bergens feisty heroine john hustons wily john hay or steve kanalys spiffy radiant ruthless cando lieutenant roosevelts big stick 1 
it was so bad i had lost the heart to finish it 0 
i wear it everyday and it holds up very well 1 
a cheap and cheerless heist movie with poor characterisation lots of underbite style stoic emoting think chow yun fat in a better tomorrow and some cheesy clich√©s thrown into an abandoned factory ready for a few poorly executed flying judo rolls a la john woo 0 
not loud enough and doesnt turn on like it should 0 
my phone doesnt slide around my car now and the grip prevents my phone from slipping out of my hand 1 
food was really boring 0 
an interesting premise and billy drago is always good as a dangerous nutbag side note id love to see drago stephen mchattie and lance hendrikson in a flick together talk about raging cheekbones 1 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
i exchanged the sony ericson z500a for this and im pretty happy with that decision 1 
the story is also both funny and poignant at times 1 
avoid avoid avoid 0 
great bluetooth 1 
design flaw 0 
if she had not rolled the eyes we may have stayed not sure if we will go back and try it again 0 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurv√•g being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
very good lunch spot 1 
headset works great was packaged nicely to avoid any damage 1 
worst hour and a half of my lifeoh my gosh 0 
if you have not seen this movie i definitely recommend it 1 
and his subtle connections between the three films are awesome 1 
great pizza and salads 1 
i immediately said i wanted to talk to the manager but i did not want to talk to the guy who was doing shots of fireball behind the bar 0 
the block was amazing 1 
the meat was pretty dry i had the sliced brisket and pulled pork 0 
go to place for gyros 1 
point your finger at any item on the menu order it and you wont be disappointed 1 
dont buy this product it fails 0 
i probably wont be coming back here 0 
talk about useless customer service 0 
the service was outshining i definitely recommend the halibut 1 
i have read others reviews here but i havent had any problem with it 1 
anyway the plot flowed smoothly and the malebonding scenes were a hoot 1 
then as if i hadnt wasted enough of my life there they poured salt in the wound by drawing out the time it took to bring the check 0 
the interplay between martin and emilio contains the same wonderful chemistry we saw in wall street with martin and charlie 1 
the plug did not work very well 0 
i will never go back to this place and will never ever recommended this place to anyone 0 
the burger had absolutely no flavor the meat itself was totally bland the burger was overcooked and there was no charcoal flavor 0 
it rocked my world and is certainly a must see for anyone with no social or physical outlets 1 
i work in the hospitality industry in paradise valley and have refrained from recommending cibo any longer 0 
this was such an awesome movie that i bought it off of ebay 1 
the acting is like watching wooden puppets moving around and reading from a book thats how bad it is 0 
i had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get some relief 0 
it didnt make me scared horrified or make me sympathetic towards the characters it was simply annoying 0 
i liked this movie way too much 1 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
my rating just 3 out of 10 0 
the lines the cuts the audio everything is wrong 0 
only pros large seating area nice bar area great simple drink menu the best brick oven pizza with homemade dough 1 
i did not expect this to be so good 1 
poor reliability 0 
penne vodka excellent 1 
superb phone on a great network 1 
my friend did not like his bloody mary 0 
lets start with all the problems¬óthe acting especially from the lead professor was very very bad 0 
our server was very nice and even though he looked a little overwhelmed with all of our needs he stayed professional and friendly until the end 1 
the food was great as always compliments to the chef 1 
the selection was probably the worst ive seen in vegasthere was none 0 
sound quality on both end is excellent i use headset to call my wife and ask my wife to use headset to call me 2 1 
its really easy 1 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
also its slim enough to fit into my alarm clock docking station without removing the case 1 
i promise they wont disappoint 1 
the soundtrack wasnt terrible either 1 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
first the bathrooms at this location were dirty seat covers were not replenished just plain yucky 0 
it looses connection to the phone even when it is within a couple feet between the two 0 
this place is pretty good nice little vibe in the restaurant 1 
the budget was evidently very limited 0 
best of luck to the rude and noncustomer service focused new management 0 
but now that it is out of warranty the same problems reoccurebottom line put your money somewhere else cingular will not support it 0 
nice docking station for home or work 1 
special mention should be made of the superb music score and sound effects which are an integral element in helping to make this such a memorable and enjoyable cartoon 1 
this is the first phone ive had that has been so cheaply made 0 
not much seafood and like 5 strings of pasta at the bottom 0 
i dont like this nokia either 0 
the scripting of the subtle comedy is unmatched by any movie in recent years 1 
very bad performance plays angela bennett a computer expert who is at home all the time 0 
hes a national treasure 1 
this is probably one of the least effective and utterly unoriginal films i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
all the characters in this film are tremendously well played 1 
that just screams legit in my booksomethats also pretty rare here in vegas 1 
sprint charges for this service 0 
worthwhile 1 
the live music on fridays totally blows 0 
i guess i liked the details of his dysfunctionhe was believable 1 
its welldesigned and very sharp the blue is a very nice color 1 
attempting artiness with black white and clever camera angles the movie disappointed became even more ridiculous as the acting was poor and the plot and lines almost nonexistent 0 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
the soundtrack wasnt terrible either 1 
the ambiance was incredible 1 
car charger as well as ac charger are included to make sure you never run out of juicehighy recommended 1 
feelings thoughtsgabriels discomfort during the danceall these intangibles leap to life and come within the viewers grasp in hustons portrayal 1 
ps the only scene in the movie that was cool is when the central character finds her room blown up 1 
the salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop which was perfectly cooked 1 
its been my choice headset for yearsgreat sound good volume good noise cancellation 1 
i am very happy 1 
bt50 battery junk 0 
avoid at all costs 0 
you can watch them preparing the delicious food 1 
otherwise easy to install and use clear sound 1 
comes with a strong light that you can use to light up your camera shots and even flash sos signals seriously 1 
this place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver 0 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
but it does get better reception and clarity than any phone ive had before 1 
i would recommend this 1 
a great touch 1 
you wont regret it 1 
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
in fact im going to round up to 4 stars just because she was so awesome 1 
too bad cause i know its family owned i really wanted to like this place 0 
i let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this bad idea we both hated it 0 
i own a jabra earset and was very happy with it but the sound quality especially outgoing on this is better 1 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
why was this film made 0 
the stories were powerful explorations of the nature of man and of art 1 
so bad 0 
a great touch 1 
by this time our side of the restaurant was almost empty so there was no excuse 0 
they keep getting better and better this is my third one and ive had numerous palms too 1 
the design is very good4 1 
good food good service 1 
extremely tasty 1 
dont waste your money 0 
even if you love bad movies do not watch this movie 0 
this is a simple little phone to use but the breakage is unacceptible 0 
the chefs were friendly and did a good job 1 
it is an insane game 1 
i highly recommend this case 1 
i immediately said i wanted to talk to the manager but i did not want to talk to the guy who was doing shots of fireball behind the bar 0 
excellent dualpurpose headset 1 
i loved their mussels cooked in this wine reduction the duck was tender and their potato dishes were delicious 1 
love the margaritas too 1 
110 and only because there is no setting for 010 0 
it really created a unique feeling though 1 
i will not be eating there again 0 
excellent dualpurpose headset 1 
the directing and the cinematography arent quite as good 0 
not to mention the combination of pears almonds and bacon is a big winner 1 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
the ri style calamari was a joke 0 
gets a signal when other verizon phones wont 1 
sending it back 0 
the noise shield is incrediable 1 
otherwise dont even waste your time on this 0 
treo and tmobile refused to replace it again and forced me to buy another phone without any kind of upgrade discount 0 
i really liked that 1 
the selection was probably the worst ive seen in vegasthere was none 0 
his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic 1 
but it picked up speed and got right to the point 1 
it rocked my world and is certainly a must see for anyone with no social or physical outlets 1 
looks great and is strong 1 
wont work right or atleast for me 0 
i tried talking real loud but shouting on the telephone gets old and i was still told it wasnt great 0 
drinks took close to 30 minutes to come out at one point 0 
how can anyone in their right mind ask for anything more from a movie than this 1 
improper description i had to return it 0 
i believe that pitch black was done well 1 
this allows the possibility of double booking for the same date and time after the first 0 
good transmit audio 1 
he owns the film just as spacek owned coal miners daughter and quaid owned great balls of fire 1 
i was not happy with this item 0 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani ¬ñ particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
i ordered this for sony ericsson w810i but i think it only worked once thats when i first used it 0 
it is just the sort of pap that is screened in the afternoon to punish the unemployed for not having jobs 0 
very good stuff for the price 1 
i love their fries and their beans 1 
the goat taco didnt skimp on the meat and wow what flavor 1 
eclectic selection 1 
for the price on amazon it is an excellent product which i would highly recommend 1 
john garfield ann revere lilli plmer william conrad canada leeand filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screenjames wong howe 1 
also its slim enough to fit into my alarm clock docking station without removing the case 1 
nevertheless yet another wonderful film from the great masters stable 1 
the desserts were a bit strange 0 
design flaw 0 
i gave it 5 stars then and im giving it 5 stars now 1 
i really do recommend this place you can go wrong with this donut place 1 
the plastic breaks really easy on this clip 0 
it is shameful 0 
the sound quality is good and functionality is awesome 1 
the food wasnt good 0 
if you want healthy authentic or ethic food try this place 1 
this is a great place to eat 1 
so i am here to warn youdo not rent this movie it is the dumbest thing you have never seen 0 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
it definitely was not as good as my s11 1 
juano hernandez an exceptional actor who played supporting roles in many films of the era is a proud black man who is accused of murdering a white man in the south 1 
very slow at seating even with reservation 0 
the presentation of the food was awful 0 
probably not in a hurry to go back 0 
aailiyah was pretty good as akasha in places compelling her first entrance and mini dance scene 1 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
i dont know exactly what it is about this movie but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our familys memories 1 
excellent product 1 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
the building itself seems pretty neat the bathroom is pretty trippy but i wouldnt eat here again 0 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
whatever the producer was going for he missed entirely 0 
unfortunately any virtue in this films production work was lost on a regrettable script 0 
i sat riveted to the tv screen 1 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
now imagine that every single one of those decisions was made wrong 0 
you also cannot take pictures with it in the case because the lense is covered 0 
the food was terrible 0 
i can assure you that you wont be disappointed 1 
do not buy for d807wrongly advertised for d807 0 
restored my phone to like new performance 1 
the story is also both funny and poignant at times 1 
i love the pho and the spring rolls oh so yummy you have to try 1 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
it was also the right balance of war and love 1 
it is easy to turn on and off when you are in the car and the volume controls are quite accessable 1 
the selection of food was not the best 0 
this would not even be good as a made for tv flick 0 
definitely a turn off for me i doubt ill be back unless someone else is buying 0 
the only place good for this film is in the garbage 0 
the acting as youd expect from this cast is top notch 1 
i wont be back 0 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
i am going to have to be the first to negatively review this product 0 
the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach 0 
the design is very good4 1 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
all in all ha long bay was a bit of a flop 0 
the plot well i said id let that one go 0 
shrimp when i unwrapped it i live only 12 a mile from brushfire it was literally ice cold 0 
reception is terrible and full of static 0 
for service i give them no stars 0 
not only did the software do a great job of this i could also make my own ringtones form my existing cds without an internet connection 1 
beware this is not a trashy cult movie this is trash period 0 
very slow at seating even with reservation 0 
my only problem is i thought the actor playing the villain was a low rent michael ironside 0 
its a great item 1 
fits comfortably came with three sizes of earbud tips 1 
the menu is always changing food quality is going down service is extremely slow 0 
this wonderful experience made this place a muststop whenever we are in town again 1 
the screen size is big key pad lit well enough and the camera quality is excellent for a camera phone 1 
insults profound deuchebaggery and had to go outside for a smoke break while serving just to solidify it 0 
the inside is really quite nice and very clean 1 
this place is not quality sushi it is not a quality restaurant 0 
its just adorable seeing mickey playing turkey in the straw in a highly imaginative if occasionally cruel way 1 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
wonderful lil tapas and the ambience made me feel all warm and fuzzy inside 1 
performed awful muffled tinny incoming sound and severe echo for those on the other end of the call 0 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
it was not good 0 
the script is bad very bad ¬ñ it contains both cheesiness and unethical joke that you normally see in rated r or nc17 movie 0 
i wont be back 0 
highly unprofessional and rude to a loyal patron 0 
after 20 minutes wait i got a table 0 
perhaps i caught them on an off night judging by the other reviews but im not inspired to go back 0 
i took back my money and got outta there 0 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
dont bother coming here 0 
just spicy enough perfect actually 1 
if it were possible to give them zero stars theyd have it 0 
we enjoy their pizza and brunch 1 
i vomited in the bathroom mid lunch 0 
if you want healthy authentic or ethic food try this place 1 
gave up trying to eat any of the crust teeth still sore 0 
last night was my second time dining here and i was so happy i decided to go back 1 
bought mainly for the charger which broke soon after purchasing 0 
alexander nevsky is a great film 1 
nobody identifies with these characters because theyre all cardboard cutouts and stereotypes or predictably reversestereotypes 0 
unreliable im giving up 0 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
i have read others reviews here but i havent had any problem with it 1 
its an empty hollow shell of a movie 0 
they could be used as exemplars for any set designer 1 
i use this product in a motor control center where there is a lot of high voltage humming from the equipment and it works great 1 
it has been a winner for us 1 
works fine 1 
amazon sucks 0 
furthermore you cant even find hours of operation on the website 0 
terrible phone holder 0 
mobile phone tools are a must have 1 
the awful dialogue and hopeless overacting by everyone who gets shot top off a real waste of space and time 0 
the plot well i said id let that one go 0 
the chips and sals a here is amazing 1 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
i have always used corded headsets and the freedom from the wireless is very helpful 1 
waitress was good though 1 
you have to hold the phone at a particular angle for the other party to hear you clearly 0 
poor quality 0 
a very very very slowmoving aimless movie about a distressed drifting young man 0 
this is the place where i first had pho and it was amazing 1 
it had some average acting from the main person and it was a low budget as you clearly can see 0 
the delivery was on time 1 
the things that the four kids get themselves into is absolutely hilarious to watch 1 
its the best headset i have used 1 
poor product 0 
it was just not a fun experience 1 
the file browser offers all the options that one needshandsfree is great 1 
excellent short film 1 
very much disappointed with this company 0 
this greedy corporation will never see another dime from me 0 
go and see it 1 
the jamaican mojitos are delicious 1 
love the margaritas too 1 
this totally unfunny movie is so over the top and pathetic and unrealistic that throughout the whole 90 minutes of utter torture i probably looked at my watch about 70000 times 0 
im not eating here 0 
it fits my ear well and is comfortable on 1 
it was attached to a gas station and that is rarely a good sign 0 
it was also the right balance of war and love 1 
the sound is clear and the people i talk to on it are amazed at the quality too 1 
anyway the plot flowed smoothly and the malebonding scenes were a hoot 1 
you get extra minutes so that you can carry out the call and not get cut off 1 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
love this phone 1 
the only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port irda 0 
again no plot at all 0 
im in az all the time and now have my new spot 1 
pretty awesome place 1 
what this film lacks is a convincing script 0 
not my thing 0 
but now that it is out of warranty the same problems reoccurebottom line put your money somewhere else cingular will not support it 0 
if you love death and decay and shakespears lyrics this is the one 1 
very very fun chef 1 
there is no real plot 0 
very disappointed 0 
if you do go see this movie bring a pillow or a girlfriendboyfriend to keep you occupied through out 0 
ample portions and good prices 1 
if you love death and decay and shakespears lyrics this is the one 1 
i love this phone it is very handy and has a lot of features 1 
this gets a 1 out of 10 simply because theres nothing lower 0 
poor quality 0 
it doesnt make you look cool 0 
so far so good 1 
overall i am psyched to have a phone which has all my appointments and contacts in and gets great reception 1 
doesnt work at all i bougth it for my l7c and its not working 0 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
truly awful 0 
i wouldnt see this movie again for free 0 
poor quality 0 
it is just the sort of pap that is screened in the afternoon to punish the unemployed for not having jobs 0 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
everyone is treated equally special 1 
he is an amazing film artist one of the most important whoever lived 1 
i am so pleased to know such a modern day genius is out there letting is passion for art drive him and taking us as an audience with him 1 
i as well wouldve given godfathers zero stars if possible 0 
what did bother me was the slow service 0 
i was totally fascinated by the music the dancing everything 1 
as i said abovepretty useless 0 
a cheap and cheerless heist movie with poor characterisation lots of underbite style stoic emoting think chow yun fat in a better tomorrow and some cheesy clich√©s thrown into an abandoned factory ready for a few poorly executed flying judo rolls a la john woo 0 
the jamaican mojitos are delicious 1 
barney is definitely super de duper 1 
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0 
great earpiece 1 
good item low price 1 
the yellowtail carpaccio was melt in your mouth fresh 1 
i mean really how do you get so famous for your fish and chips when its so terrible 0 
the cg opening sequence in space looked like it could have been created on microsoft slideshow for gods sake 0 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
it clicks into place in a way that makes you wonder how long that mechanism would last 0 
this convention never worked well in the past and certainly doesnt work here 0 
this movie was kind of long in length but i enjoyed every minute of it 1 
here in the wind and the lion we see a wonderful rendering of americas own imperial age 1 
everyone is treated equally special 1 
i had the chicken pho and it tasted very bland 0 
the worst experience ever 0 
there are many continuity errors one other user commented on different cars in the garage joes glassesthe one that got to me the most was the fact joes facial hair configuration seemed to change from scene to scene 0 
the acting was bad the dialogs were extremely shallow and insincere 0 
this is a great deal 1 
ill put this gem up against any movie in terms of screenplay cinematography acting postproduction editing directing or any other aspect of filmmaking 1 
this is by far the worst purchase ive made on amazon 0 
a good film by a great director 1 
i gave it 5 stars because of the sound quality 1 
then theres the plot holes 0 
it is not good 0 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
it rocked my world and is certainly a must see for anyone with no social or physical outlets 1 
we waited an hour for what was a breakfast i could have done 100 times better at home 0 
in summary this was a largely disappointing dining experience 0 
it is easy to turn on and off when you are in the car and the volume controls are quite accessable 1 
we would recommend these to others 1 
the fries were great too 1 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
the characters were all funny and had the peculiarity of not having a true lead character 1 
waiter was a jerk 0 
furthermore you cant even find hours of operation on the website 0 
what a piece of junk i lose more calls on this phone 0 
i was so insulted 0 
at least think to refill my water before i struggle to wave you over for 10 minutes 0 
schrader has made a resume full of lousy amateurish films 0 
this movie creates its own universe and is fascinating in every way 1 
seafood was limited to boiled shrimp and crab legs but the crab legs definitely did not taste fresh 0 
i liked this movie way too much 1 
when my order arrived one of the gyros was missing 0 
the food was barely lukewarm so it must have been sitting waiting for the server to bring it out to us 0 
at no point in the proceedings does it look remotely like america 0 
we had a group of 70 when we claimed we would only have 40 and they handled us beautifully 1 
didnt laugh or even smile once 0 
its extremely slow and takes forever to do anything with it 0 
and there wasnt a single sour note struck actingwise either some surprisingly solid casting here 1 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
i guess i liked the details of his dysfunctionhe was believable 1 
the movie showed a lot of florida at its best made it look very appealing 1 
even the squibs look awful 0 
very well made and fits my surefire gx2 perfectly 1 
the croutons also taste homemade which is an extra plus 1 
i was amazed at the quick arrival of the two original lg cell phone batteries and and at a fraction of the price 1 
this is a good battery and it got here really fast 1 
also the story and acting were weak 0 
warning do not buy 0 
the owners are super friendly and the staff is courteous 1 
coming here is like experiencing an underwhelming relationship where both parties cant wait for the other person to ask to break up 0 
ray charles is legendary 1 
i checked out this place a couple years ago and was not impressed 0 
to summarize the food was incredible nay transcendant but nothing brings me joy quite like the memory of the pneumatic condiment dispenser 1 
why are these sad little vegetables so overcooked 0 
overall i like there food and the service 1 
i would avoid this place if you are staying in the mirage 0 
everything was good and tasty 1 
the accompanied software is almost brilliant 1 
will not be back 0 
the company shipped my product very promptly and it works well 1 
very serious spoilers this movie was a huge disappointment 0 
every time he opened his mouth you expect to hear you see kids pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show 0 
join the club and get awesome offers via email 1 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
the worst experience ever 0 
it was a riot to see hugo weaving play a sexobsessed gay real estate salesman who uses his clients houses for his trysts with the flaming darren tom hollander 1 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
good transmit audio 1 
i would recommend purchasing the jabra jx10 series 2 which works flawlessly with my moto q go figure 1 
disappointment i hate anything that goes in my ear 0 
i seriously cannot believe that the owner has so many unexperienced employees that all are running around like chickens with their heads cut off 0 
i dont recommend unless your car breaks down in front of it and you are starving 0 
both films are terrible but to the credit of the 1986 version it was watchable 0 
it shouldnt take 30 min for pancakes and eggs 0 
being a 90s child i truly enjoyed this show and i can proudly say that i enjoyed it big time and even more than the classical wb cartoons 1 
so i am here to warn youdo not rent this movie it is the dumbest thing you have never seen 0 
this was reflected not only in the cast but also in the belowpar script which borrowed much from the earlier classic 0 
very happy with this product 1 
the food is about on par with dennys which is to say not good at all 0 
dont waste your money and time 0 
steve martin delivers a really funny performance of a middleaged upper class uptight white guy 1 
we are so glad we found this place 1 
would not go back 0 
it will drive you barking mad 0 
great atmosphere friendly and fast service 1 
i could barely stomach the meal but didnt complain because it was a business lunch 0 
bad fit way too big 0 
it will drive you barking mad 0 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
what a big waste of time 0 
i really like this product over the motorola because it is allot clearer on the ear piece and the mic 1 
no additional ear gels provided and no instructions whatsoever 0 
very disappointing 0 
light weight i hardly notice it is there 1 
the memories are murky but i can only say that i enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show 1 
i am very happy 1 
cinematography the film was shot in an interesting way 1 
i sat riveted to the tv screen 1 
i hate movies like that 0 
host staff were for lack of a better word bitches 0 
oh the charger seems to work fine 1 
product is exactly as described 1 
works fine 1 
will not be back 0 
great value 1 
waited 2 hours never got either of our pizzas as many other around us who came in later did 0 
what a big waste of time 0 
works as described 1 
i am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this 1 
the characters are fleshed out surprisingly well particularly grimes and blake and all the actors deliver their sharply scripted lines with just the right amount of deadpan tongue in cheek to make the dialogue both hilarious and realistic 1 
waited and waited and waited 0 
the portion was huge 1 
avoid this film at all costs 0 
needless to say i wont be going back anytime soon 0 
my fella got the huevos rancheros and they didnt look too appealing 0 
everything captain howdy says is either laughable or just plain stupid 0 
worst thai ever 0 
love this place hits the spot when i want something healthy but not lacking in quantity or flavor 1 
nargile i think you are great 1 
the movie is not completely perfect but titta di girolamo will stay with you for a long time after the vision of the movie 1 
overall the film is interesting and thoughtprovoking 1 
the plantains were the worst ive ever tasted 0 
the greek dressing was very creamy and flavorful 1 
this greedy corporation will never see another dime from me 0 
the text messaging feature is really tricky to use 0 
after two i felt disgusting 0 
but other than that the movie seemed to drag and the heroes didnt really work for their freedom 0 
comfortable fit you need your headset to be comfortable for at least an hour at a time if not for an entire day 1 
excellent sound battery life and inconspicuous to boot 1 
the chefs were friendly and did a good job 1 
enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film 1 
i have recommended it to friends 1 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
would not recommend to others 0 
service is also cute 1 
krussel always good 1 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
i knew when i saw the film that more great things were to come from this gifted actor 1 
simple lightweight and great fit 1 
the food was barely lukewarm so it must have been sitting waiting for the server to bring it out to us 0 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
it was awesome 1 
there were too many close ups 0 
this is one of the best movies out there that shows such strong sibling bond for each other 1 
this is one of peter watkins most accessible films 1 
i left with a stomach ache and felt sick the rest of the day 0 
works great 1 
i mean really how do you get so famous for your fish and chips when its so terrible 0 
mic doesnt work 0 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
it failed to convey the broad sweep of landscapes that were a great part of the original 0 
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0 
i want to first say our server was great and we had perfect service 1 
great pocket pc phone combination 1 
it felt too light and tinny 0 
in fact its hard to remember that the part of ray charles is being acted and not played by the man himself 1 
i ordered the lemon raspberry ice cocktail which was also incredible 1 
the waitresses are very friendly 1 
nothing special 0 
its worth driving up from tucson 1 
i could not stand to even watch it for very long for fear of losing iq 0 
cooked to perfection and the service was impeccable 1 
this wonderful experience made this place a muststop whenever we are in town again 1 
very slow at seating even with reservation 0 
i wouldnt see this movie again for free 0 
the owners are super friendly and the staff is courteous 1 
the first thing that happened was that the tracking was off 0 
i highly recommend this movie for anyone interested in art poetry theater politics or japanese history 1 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
i will never go back to this place and will never ever recommended this place to anyone 0 
this company charge me a restocking fee and still not given me my refund back 0 
but in any case the best part is you can download these pictures to your laptop using ir or even send pictures from your laptop to the phone 1 
unfortunately it was not good 0 
great product fast shipping 1 
my wife had the lobster bisque soup which was lukewarm 0 
i love the ownerchef his one authentic japanese cool dude 1 
probably never coming back and wouldnt recommend it 0 
item arrived quickly and works great with my metro pcs samsung schr450 slider phone and sony premium sound in ear plugs 1 
insults profound deuchebaggery and had to go outside for a smoke break while serving just to solidify it 0 
people who like european films and art movies will like this movie 1 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
i bought this to use with my kindle fire and absolutely loved it 1 
the staff is always super friendly and helpful which is especially cool when you bring two small boys and a baby 1 
i understand that its supposed to be a cheap popcorn comedy but that doesnt mean that it has to completely insult our intelligence and have writing so incredibly hackneyed that it borders on offensive 0 
its really easy 1 
left very frustrated 0 
things that went wrong they burned the saganaki 0 
the music in the film is really nice too 1 
it was a drive to get there 0 
no ear loop needed its tiny and the sound is great 1 
i am so pleased to know such a modern day genius is out there letting is passion for art drive him and taking us as an audience with him 1 
the place was fairly clean but the food simply wasnt worth it 0 
i like armand assante my cable companys summary sounded interesting so i watched it twice already and probably will again 1 
today was my first taste of a buldogis gourmet hot dog and i have to tell you it was more than i ever thought possible 1 
my first visit to hiro was a delight 1 
i had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get some relief 0 
the secondary plot line is incomprehensible and its relation to the primary plot line is mystifying 0 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
but what really made it unwatchable was the direction 0 
horrible phone 0 
the selection on the menu was great and so were the prices 1 
the movie in movie situations in the beginning and through the game that is played with her by the acting coach are fascinating 1 
is it possible for a movie to get any worse than this 0 
how can that bethe audio quality is poor 0 
but i definitely would not eat here again 0 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
an awesome new look for fall 2000 1 
if you have not seen this movie i definitely recommend it 1 
but the service was beyond bad 0 
macbeth jason connery moved me to tears with his final monolog out brief candle outhe gave the sphere of moral decay and dark forces a human face which makes it the more interesting 1 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
unfortunately inexperience of direction meant that scene after scene passed with little in the way of dramatic tension or conflict 0 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
the han nan chicken was also very tasty 1 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
i put the latest os on it v115g and it now likes to slow to a crawl and lock up every once in a while 0 
i would recommend this 1 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
very much disappointed with this company 0 
someone shouldve invented this sooner 1 
i have to mention this and it is a huge spoiler i loved the ending how all the characters of the three films were the remaining survivors of the ferry disaster with valentine and the young judge together and the old man watching it on her tv solidifying his happiness over the suffering which he dealt with for those many years 1 
what is even more stupid is that who had thought an idea that there should be a volcano in los angeles 0 
absolutel junk 0 
terrible phone holder 0 
this particular model would not work with my motorola q smartphone 0 
after the first charge kept going dead after 12 minutes 0 
i just saw this film and i recommend it 1 
very disappointed in accessoryone 0 
its too bad the food is so damn generic 0 
very good lunch spot 1 
first of all it doesnt wear well 0 
he came running after us when he realized my husband had left his sunglasses on the table 1 
what the hell kind of crap is that 0 
great food and great service in a clean and friendly setting 1 
the steaks are all well trimmed and also perfectly cooked 1 
rating 1 out of 10 0 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
after one bite i was hooked 1 
the script is a big flawed mess 0 
this is high adventure at its best 1 
that said our mouths and bellies were still quite pleased 1 
you can watch them preparing the delicious food 1 
service was good and the company was better 1 
will never ever go back and have told many people what had happened 0 
we enjoy their pizza and brunch 1 
never been to hard rock casino before will never ever step forward in it again 0 
the whole experience was underwhelming and i think well just go to ninja sushi next time 0 
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1 
not much seafood and like 5 strings of pasta at the bottom 0 
these were so good we ordered them twice 1 
product is useless since it does not have enough charging current to charge the 2 cellphones i was planning to use it with 0 
however after finally watching this film i realized that not only had i had a closed mind to the brilliance it depicts i also found myself watching it over and over again 1 
i really enjoyed crema caf√© before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
what the hell kind of crap is that 0 
i dont have very many words to say about this place but it does everything pretty well 1 
the problem i have is that they charge 1199 for a sandwich that is no bigger than a subway sub which offers better and more amount of vegetables 0 
a truly truly bad film 0 
it lasts less than 3o minutes if i actually try to use the phonemy wife has the same phone with the same problem 0 
the pancake was also really good and pretty large at that 1 
my drink was never empty and he made some really great menu suggestions 1 
after all the rave reviews i couldnt wait to eat herewhat a disappointment 0 
the portion was huge 1 
im still trying to get over how bad it was 0 
this item worked great but it broke after 6 months of use 0 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
when achille and philippa beautifully sing a duet from don giovanni that perfectly describes their situation in the movie you appreciate the subtle layers of this excellent film 1 
as i said abovepretty useless 0 
what a big waste of time 0 
the lighting is awful 0 
but then they came back cold 0 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
it finds my cell phone right away when i enter the car 1 
it works 1 
the results well are a shame 0 
horrible dont waste your time and money 0 
this place is way too overpriced for mediocre food 0 
i recently tried caballeros and i have been back every week since 1 
give this one a look 1 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
the management is rude 0 
voice quality signal strength dropped calls 0 
ive only had my bluetooth for a few weeks but i really like it 1 
so absolutley fantastic 1 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
if you hate earbugs avoid this phone by all means 0 
seller shipped quickly and much cheaper than the competitors 1 
third the cheese on my friends burger was cold 0 
avoid avoid avoid 0 
not recommended 0 
delicious nyc bagels good selections of cream cheese real lox with capers even 1 
the camera although rated at an impressive 13 megapixels renders images that fall well below expectations of such a relatively high resolution 0 
bad purchase 0 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
excellent hands free tool 1 
1 hour 54 minutes of sheer tedium melodrama and horrible acting a mess of a script and a sinking feeling of good lord what were they thinking 0 
same evening him and i are both drastically sick 0 
1010 1 
you wont regret it 1 
i immediately said i wanted to talk to the manager but i did not want to talk to the guy who was doing shots of fireball behind the bar 0 
i thoroughly enjoyed it when christopher eccleston took control of the tardis and the continuation of the series 1 
so they performed 1 
that was funny 1 
great earpiece 1 
prosgood camera very nice pictures also has cool styles like black and white and more 1 
it was so boring 0 
if that bug never showed up i would have given a 4 for sure but on the other side of the wall where this bug was climbing was the kitchen 0 
probably not in a hurry to go back 0 
do not buy for d807wrongly advertised for d807 0 
point your finger at any item on the menu order it and you wont be disappointed 1 
definitely worth checking out 1 
ill put this gem up against any movie in terms of screenplay cinematography acting postproduction editing directing or any other aspect of filmmaking 1 
ive had better not only from dedicated boba tea spots but even from jenni pho 0 
a piece of junk that broke after being on my phone for 2 days 0 
their chow mein is so good 1 
i also didnt like the on button it felt like it would crack with use 0 
seafood was limited to boiled shrimp and crab legs but the crab legs definitely did not taste fresh 0 
del taco is pretty nasty and should be avoided if possible 0 
john wayne did an incredible job for being so young in the movie industry 1 
this does not fit the palm tungsten e2 and it broke the first time i tried to plug it in 0 
it didnt charge for me 0 
nothing special 0 
the handsfree part works fine but then the car tries to download the address book and the treo rebootsoverall i still rate this device high 1 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
for a self proclaimed coffee cafe i was wildly disappointed 0 
feelings thoughtsgabriels discomfort during the danceall these intangibles leap to life and come within the viewers grasp in hustons portrayal 1 
hitchcock is a great director 1 
this does not fit the palm tungsten e2 and it broke the first time i tried to plug it in 0 
battery chargelife is quite long 1 
i wasnt the least bit interested 0 
ambience is perfect 1 
this phone works great 1 
worked great 1 
i recently tried caballeros and i have been back every week since 1 
mark my words this is one of those cult films like evil dead 2 or phantasm that people will still be discovering and falling in love with 20 30 40 years down the line 1 
no ear loop needed its tiny and the sound is great 1 
avoid this establishment 0 
the things that the four kids get themselves into is absolutely hilarious to watch 1 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
ive only had my bluetooth for a few weeks but i really like it 1 
the pizza selections are good 1 
despite how hard i rate businesses its actually rare for me to give a 1 star 0 
the desserts were a bit strange 0 
the acting is fantastic the stories are seamlessly woven together and the dogs are splendid a must rent view or see 1 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
join the club and get awesome offers via email 1 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
this film and i use that word loosely is an insult to the moviegoing public 0 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
im super pissd 0 
for sushi on the strip this is the place to go 1 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
that just screams legit in my booksomethats also pretty rare here in vegas 1 
product is useless since it does not have enough charging current to charge the 2 cellphones i was planning to use it with 0 
how can that bethe audio quality is poor 0 
jamie foxx absolutely is ray charles 1 
avoid avoid avoid 0 
if you want a sandwich just go to any firehouse 1 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
i didnt realize how wonderful the short really is until the last two scenes 1 
there was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth but it didnt really work into the rest of the plot 0 
service was good and the company was better 1 
nevertheless yet another wonderful film from the great masters stable 1 
the construction of the headsets is poor 0 
this is hands down the best phone ive ever had 1 
so absolutley fantastic 1 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
waitress was good though 1 
if you do go see this movie bring a pillow or a girlfriendboyfriend to keep you occupied through out 0 
an interesting premise and billy drago is always good as a dangerous nutbag side note id love to see drago stephen mchattie and lance hendrikson in a flick together talk about raging cheekbones 1 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
the movie in movie situations in the beginning and through the game that is played with her by the acting coach are fascinating 1 
the first time i ever came here i had an amazing experience i still tell people how awesome the duck was 1 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
food is way overpriced and portions are fucking small 0 
the inside is really quite nice and very clean 1 
waaaaaayyyyyyyyyy over rated is all i am saying 0 
it is an insane game 1 
the headsets are easy to use and everyone loves them 1 
poor construction 0 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
works great 1 
great phone 1 
is pretty funny 1 
would come back again if i had a sushi craving while in vegas 1 
great product and price 1 
treo and tmobile refused to replace it again and forced me to buy another phone without any kind of upgrade discount 0 
good case excellent value 1 
the salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop which was perfectly cooked 1 
is it possible for a movie to get any worse than this 0 
i ate there twice on my last visit and especially enjoyed the salmon salad 1 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
absolutel junk 0 
the cashew cream sauce was bland and the vegetables were undercooked 0 
both of the egg rolls were fantastic 1 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
do not purchase this phone 0 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
the lighting is just dark enough to set the mood 1 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
i believe that pitch black was done well 1 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
bad characters bad story and bad acting 0 
not worth it 0 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
nice design and quality 1 
the casting is also horrible cause all you see is a really really bad actors period 0 
jawbone era is awesome too 1 
horrible horrible protector 0 
it came free with a dvd player i bought but i still turned the thing off halfway through because i was embarrassed for howell 0 
during several different 2 minute calls i experienced 5 drops and it was in an area that had 5 bars 0 
you wont be disappointed 1 
it looses connection to the phone even when it is within a couple feet between the two 0 
not much dialogue not much music the whole film was shot as elaborately and aesthetically like a sculpture 1 
actually the graphics were good at the time 1 
the phone takes forever to charge like 2 to 5 hours literally 0 
some great music and terrific scenery 1 
first the bathrooms at this location were dirty seat covers were not replenished just plain yucky 0 
it seems completely secure both holding on to my belt and keeping the iphone inside 1 
the food was delicious our bartender was attentive and personable and we got a great deal 1 
the movie has almost no action scenes in it and very little comedy 0 
dont waste your money and time 0 
this is high adventure at its best 1 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
it failed to convey the broad sweep of landscapes that were a great part of the original 0 
in fact this stinker smells like a directtovideo release 0 
there were several moments in the movie that just didnt need to be there and were excruciatingly slow moving 0 
bt50 battery junk 0 
the death row scenes were entirely unmoving 0 
well im satisfied 1 
awesome service and food 1 
i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
the phone is sturdy and waterproof 1 
the classic maine lobster roll was fantastic 1 
this was one of the worst films i have ever seen 0 
this is hands down the best phone ive ever had 1 
razr battery good buy 1 
server did a great job handling our large rowdy table 1 
it has a very good plot it holds your complete attention the acting is superb tom wilkinson was fantastic and emily watson was also very good 1 
the good cinematography also makes her and monica bellucci look very beautiful 1 
highly recommended 1 
i use this product in a motor control center where there is a lot of high voltage humming from the equipment and it works great 1 
they will customize your order any way youd like my usual is eggplant with green bean stir fry love it 1 
i did not have any problem with this item and would order it again if needed 1 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
bad script bad direction and horrible acting make this one plain bad 0 
it holds a charge for a long time is reasonably comfortable under longwearing conditions and the quality of sound is tremendous 1 
clear skype calls long battery life long range 1 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
what a piece of junk i lose more calls on this phone 0 
how can you call yourself a steakhouse if you cant properly cook a steak i dont understand 0 
we loved the biscuits 1 
obviously they have a terrible customer service so you get what you pay for 0 
linksys should have some way to exchange a bad phone for a refurb unit or something 0 
the food was barely lukewarm so it must have been sitting waiting for the server to bring it out to us 0 
happy so far 1 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
hot dishes are not hot cold dishes are close to room tempi watched staff prepare food with bare hands no gloveseverything is deep fried in oil 0 
the cast was great 1 
this is simply the best bluetooth headset for sound quality 1 
im glad the film didnt go for the most obvious choice as a lesser film certainly would have 1 
i gave it 5 stars because of the sound quality 1 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
none of it works just dont buy it 0 
the stories were powerful explorations of the nature of man and of art 1 
the holster that arrived did not match the photo in the ad 0 
i like the fact that it rests lightly against your ear rather than inside 1 
the aerial scenes were welldone 1 
how can anyone in their right mind ask for anything more from a movie than this 1 
i was shocked because no signs indicate cash only 0 
the worst was the salmon sashimi 0 
i could not understand what kind of idiot would produce this mess in the first place not to mention several season 0 
dont waste your money 0 
when it opens the battery connection is broken and the device is turned off 0 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
very disappointing 0 
simple lightweight and great fit 1 
i am glad i purchased it 1 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
i love the ownerchef his one authentic japanese cool dude 1 
not to mention the combination of pears almonds and bacon is a big winner 1 
everything is appalling 0 
i do love sushi but i found kabuki to be overpriced overhip and underservices 0 
customer service was terrible 0 
food was good service was good prices were good 1 
ambience is perfect 1 
comes with a strong light that you can use to light up your camera shots and even flash sos signals seriously 1 
it was absolutely amazing 1 
fantastic buy and will get again for whatever my next phone is 1 
once your food arrives its meh 0 
this was such an awesome movie that i bought it off of ebay 1 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
setup couldnt have been simpler 1 
i found a six inch long piece of wire in my salsa 0 
the block was amazing 1 
i dont have to be an accountant to know im getting screwed 0 
started watching this but didnt believe in any of the characters 0 
seriously killer hot chai latte 1 
the telephone repair man was really funny and his reactions to the nuts and bitchy boss were truly genuine 1 
all i have to say is the food was amazing 1 
i loved it 1 
then theres the plot holes 0 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
their chow mein is so good 1 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
my 5year old nokia 2160 from tracfone holds the charge a lot better than this 0 
regardless the film fails on most levels 0 
if you have not seen this movie i definitely recommend it 1 
a cheap and cheerless heist movie with poor characterisation lots of underbite style stoic emoting think chow yun fat in a better tomorrow and some cheesy clich√©s thrown into an abandoned factory ready for a few poorly executed flying judo rolls a la john woo 0 
i just dont know how this place managed to served the blandest food i have ever eaten when they are preparing indian cuisine 0 
great phone 1 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
i like design and look of jabra behing the ear headsets and 5020 is pretty comfortible to wear 24 hours a day without pain in the ear 1 
i also didnt like the on button it felt like it would crack with use 0 
the file browser offers all the options that one needshandsfree is great 1 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
other than that the leather is nice and soft the fit is very tight the cut out for the face is a good shape 1 
voice recognition is tremendous 1 
motorola finally got the voice quality of a bluetooth headset right 1 
i got home to see the driest damn wings ever 0 
call me a nut but i think this is one of the best movies ever 1 
on the good side the staff was genuinely pleasant and enthusiastic a real treat 1 
the stories were powerful explorations of the nature of man and of art 1 
it crackles with an unpredictable youthful energy but honestly i found it hard to follow and concentrate on it meanders so badly 0 
the wind and the lion is well written and superbly acted 1 
i swung in to give them a try but was deeply disappointed 0 
its a case of so bad it is laughable 0 
if you havent gone here go now 1 
it was that year however that reminded us that huston was still at the top of his game as evinced by his faithful adaptation of james joyces acclaimed novella the dead 1 
over rated 0 
this place is not quality sushi it is not a quality restaurant 0 
the phone takes forever to charge like 2 to 5 hours literally 0 
its a piece of crap 0 
i found a six inch long piece of wire in my salsa 0 
this is the first phone ive had that has been so cheaply made 0 
the sound quality for the device is unacceptableunless you are in a really quiet area you almost hear nothing 0 
not good for the money 0 
anyway the plot flowed smoothly and the malebonding scenes were a hoot 1 
they brought a fresh batch of fries and i was thinking yay something warm but no 0 
a bit predictable 0 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
i recently tried caballeros and i have been back every week since 1 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
it was either too cold not enough flavor or just bad 0 
then the film just dropped the ball 0 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
the food came out at a good pace 1 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
its a total package 1 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
they keep getting better and better this is my third one and ive had numerous palms too 1 
the acting is beyond abysmal 0 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
poor product 0 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
kris kristoffersen is good in this movie and really makes a difference 1 
good product good seller 1 
awesome device 1 
they have great dinners 1 
best headset ever 1 
the dining space is tiny but elegantly decorated and comfortable 1 
brilliance indeed 1 
same evening him and i are both drastically sick 0 
the acting as youd expect from this cast is top notch 1 
great character actors telly savalas and peter boyle 1 
lifetime does not air it enough so if anyone knows what store sells it let me know because this is a musthave 1 
i have read others reviews here but i havent had any problem with it 1 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
the battery is working well as a replacement for the original that came with the phone over 2 years ago 1 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
beware this is not a trashy cult movie this is trash period 0 
this movie is excellentangel is beautiful and scamp is adorablehis little yelps when hes scaredand the funniest parts are whenscamp is caught under the curtain and when angel and scamp are singing ive never had this feeling beforei totally recommend this movieits coming out on special edition on june 20the cover has scamp on a garbage can and angel underneath the lid 1 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
but then they came back cold 0 
we walked away stuffed and happy about our first vegas buffet experience 1 
also were served hot bread and butter and home made potato chips with bacon bits on topvery original and very good 1 
lange had become a great actress 1 
the lead man is charismafree 0 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
bad day or not i have a very low tolerance for rude customer service people it is your job to be nice and polite wash dishes otherwise 0 
soyo technology sucks 0 
the fries were not hot and neither was my burger 0 
i love the scream movies and all horror movies and this one ranks way up there 1 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
dont waste your money 0 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
simply beautiful 1 
dont waste your money 0 
worst customer service ever 0 
the chefs were friendly and did a good job 1 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
the classic maine lobster roll was fantastic 1 
in an interesting part of town this place is amazing 1 
it sure does beat the nachos at the movies but i would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant 0 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
this movie is also revealing 1 
couldnt use the unit with sunglasses not good in texas 0 
thank you for wasting my money 0 
all of the main players are mesmerising 1 
highly recommend for any one who has a blue tooth phone 1 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
there is a totally unnecessary trainroller coaster scene 0 
i was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar not only because the quality is great but the service is fast and the food impeccable 1 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
phone is sturdy as all nokia bar phones are 1 
host staff were for lack of a better word bitches 0 
the reception is excellent 1 
love this phone 1 
good transmit audio 1 
if only someone involved with it knew how to string together narrative 0 
terrible product and waste of money 0 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
favorite place in town for shawarrrrrrma 1 
with great sound effects and impressive special effects i cant recommend this movie enough 1 
this phone tries very hard to do everything but fails at its very ability to be a phone 0 
each track commands sentiment actually contributing to the scenes and characters 1 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
i found this place by accident and i could not be happier 1 
this one wants to surf on the small wave of space movies in 1998 deep impact and armageddon and this one fails everywhere 0 
fantastic food 1 
tried to go here for lunch and it was a madhouse 0 
i started this review with two stars but im editing it to give it only one 0 
the buffet at bellagio was far from what i anticipated 0 
if you want a sandwich just go to any firehouse 1 
despite the pans of reviewers i liked this movie 1 
great choice 1 
could not get strong enough signal 0 
its a gloriously fun fast paced and fairly accurate portrayal of the night of a raver 1 
perhaps my phone is defective but people cannot hear me when i use this 0 
i love this device 1 
if i take a picture the battery drops a bar and starts beeping letting me know its dieing 0 
we will not be coming back 0 
i guess i should have known that this place would suck because it is inside of the excalibur but i didnt use my common sense 0 
that one didnt work either 0 
the camera really likes her in this movie 1 
her role was played well 1 
i liked the patio and the service was outstanding 1 
i was not impressed by this product 0 
very funny 1 
it is simple to use and i like it 1 
my only problem is i thought the actor playing the villain was a low rent michael ironside 0 
the chips and salsa were really good the salsa was very fresh 1 
insults profound deuchebaggery and had to go outside for a smoke break while serving just to solidify it 0 
i was so insulted 0 
its a gloriously fun fast paced and fairly accurate portrayal of the night of a raver 1 
as i said abovepretty useless 0 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
unfortunately cover girl is an example of how hollywood used to exploit women for financial gain 0 
well im satisfied 1 
but in terms of the writing its very fresh and bold 1 
very disappointed 0 
which is precisely why i am giving it such a bad review 0 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
my gyro was basically lettuce only 0 
special thanks to dylan t for the recommendation on what to order all yummy for my tummy 1 
absolutel junk 0 
battery lasts only a few hours 0 
it was either too cold not enough flavor or just bad 0 
but i definitely would not eat here again 0 
if there were zero stars i would give it zero stars 0 
i had a salad with the wings and some ice cream for dessert and left feeling quite satisfied 1 
it was a waste of my money 0 
att is not clear sound is very distorted and you have to yell when you talk 0 
very displeased 0 
they brought a fresh batch of fries and i was thinking yay something warm but no 0 
i would have given no star if i was able 0 
this was reflected not only in the cast but also in the belowpar script which borrowed much from the earlier classic 0 
i dont think you will be disappointed 1 
jamie foxx absolutely is ray charles 1 
it shouldnt take 30 min for pancakes and eggs 0 
my rating just 3 out of 10 0 
obviously they have a terrible customer service so you get what you pay for 0 
the worst sappiest dialogue i could go on and on 0 
the only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port irda 0 
the jalapeno bacon is soooo good 1 
they brought a fresh batch of fries and i was thinking yay something warm but no 0 
the service was extremely slow 0 
will never ever go back and have told many people what had happened 0 
wont work right or atleast for me 0 
the things that the four kids get themselves into is absolutely hilarious to watch 1 
another thing i didnt really like is when a character got punched in the face a gallon of blood would spew forth soon after 0 
a happy wonderful feel good ending 1 
it is wonderful and inspiring to watch and i hope that it gets released again on to video or dvd 1 
the presentation of the food was awful 0 
definitely will come back here again 1 
we enjoy their pizza and brunch 1 
1 hour 54 minutes of sheer tedium melodrama and horrible acting a mess of a script and a sinking feeling of good lord what were they thinking 0 
not what i wanted 0 
i will continue to come here on ladies night andddd date night highly recommend this place to anyone who is in the area 1 
all in all i give this one a resounding 9 out of 10 1 
i probably wont be coming back here 0 
obviously they have a terrible customer service so you get what you pay for 0 
the voice recognition thru the handset is excellent 1 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
seriously its not worth wasting your or your kids time on 0 
punishment park is a brilliant piece of cinema 1 
the staff are also very friendly and efficient 1 
its the best headset i have used 1 
in short dont bother with this movie 0 
i particularly remember my senses being assaulted by strident cords of music that would blare out with very little warning and even less meaning 0 
the eargels channel the sound directly into your ear and seem to increase the sound volume and clarity 1 
this is a great deal 1 
i highly recommend this movie for anyone interested in art poetry theater politics or japanese history 1 
the plot doesnt hang together at all and the acting is absolutely appalling 0 
great software for motorolas 1 
this is a chilly unremarkable movie about an author livingworking in a chilly abstruse culture 0 
the food is good 1 
crust is not good 0 
too bad cause i know its family owned i really wanted to like this place 0 
this one works and was priced right 1 
good price 1 
the seasonal fruit was fresh white peach puree 1 
it is just the sort of pap that is screened in the afternoon to punish the unemployed for not having jobs 0 
nice design and quality 1 
dont waste your time here 0 
waste of money 0 
none of it works just dont buy it 0 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
the acting is fantastic the stories are seamlessly woven together and the dogs are splendid a must rent view or see 1 
everything about this movie is stupid 0 
every time he opened his mouth you expect to hear you see kids pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show 0 
it is an insane game 1 
but even the talented carrell cant save this 0 
it just blew 0 
i highly recommend this movie for anyone interested in art poetry theater politics or japanese history 1 
with the originality and freshness of the first movie now spent this remake had little else to offer 0 
very comfortable 1 
the film is well paced understated and one of the best courtroom documentaries ive seen 1 
we enjoy their pizza and brunch 1 
ive bought 5 wired headphones that sound better than these 0 
does not fit 0 
poor quality and service 0 
the sides are delish mixed mushrooms yukon gold puree white corn beateous 1 
1010 1 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
i love this device 1 
he was terrible 0 
the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach 0 
incredible 1 
i felt as though her going to ireland did absolutely nothing whatsoever 0 
i cannot make calls at certain places 0 
i really do recommend this place you can go wrong with this donut place 1 
i didnt know pulled pork could be soooo delicious 1 
people couldnt hear me talk and i had to pull out the earphone and talk on the phone 0 
they could be used as exemplars for any set designer 1 
i want to first say our server was great and we had perfect service 1 
excellent sound quality 1 
so i am here to warn youdo not rent this movie it is the dumbest thing you have never seen 0 
the food is not tasty at all not to say its real traditional hunan style 0 
even if you love bad movies do not watch this movie 0 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
i think it was robert ryans best film because he portrayed someone like my father and he was a schizophrenic in real lifemy father although he never murdered anyone but was affected more so during the second world war which made him worse 1 
it kept getting worse and worse so now im officially done 0 
bad characters bad story and bad acting 0 
end of days is one of the worst bigbudget action movies ive ever seen 0 
good value great food great service 1 
this is a good joint 1 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
the service was a little slow considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace 0 
just as good as when i had it more than a year ago 1 
never again will i be dining at this place 0 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
cant upload ringtones from a third party 0 
walked in and the place smelled like an old grease trap and only 2 others there eating 0 
will go back next trip out 1 
but despite these few flaws this case is of exceptional quality and well worth the additional costs of owning an official oem product 1 
a disappointment 0 
the battery is completely useless to me 0 
it didnt work people can not hear me when i talk 0 
we ordered some old classics and some new dishes after going there a few times and were sorely disappointed with everything 0 
1010 1 
star trek v the final frontier is the worst in the series 0 
also its slim enough to fit into my alarm clock docking station without removing the case 1 
no shifting no bubbling no peeling not even a scratch nothingi couldnt be more happier with my new one for the droid 1 
it was so funny 1 
lot of holes in the plot theres nothing about how he became the emperor nothing about where he spend 20 years between his childhood and mature age 0 
i believe that pitch black was done well 1 
what on earth is irons doing in this film 0 
i think the most wonderful parts literally full of wonder are the excerpts from his works 1 
whatever prompted such a documentary is beyond me 0 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
no shifting no bubbling no peeling not even a scratch nothingi couldnt be more happier with my new one for the droid 1 
the food came out at a good pace 1 
no plot whatsoever 0 
i was amazed at the quick arrival of the two original lg cell phone batteries and and at a fraction of the price 1 
i checked out this place a couple years ago and was not impressed 0 
say bye bye to your tip lady 0 
favorite place in town for shawarrrrrrma 1 
con spotty service 0 
i like design and look of jabra behing the ear headsets and 5020 is pretty comfortible to wear 24 hours a day without pain in the ear 1 
greatno problems at all 1 
the worst phone ive ever had only had it for a few months 0 
i just dont know how this place managed to served the blandest food i have ever eaten when they are preparing indian cuisine 0 
by the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant i was bored and didnt care what happened next and so i switched off 0 
definitely worth checking out 1 
these are certainly very comfortable and functionality is decent 1 
and sometimes it was so embarrassing that i had to look away 0 
the best place to go for a tasty bowl of pho 1 
conclusion very filling meals 1 
though the wind and the lion is told largely through the eyes of the son every member of the family can identify with one of the characters whether it be sean connerys noble brigand candace bergens feisty heroine john hustons wily john hay or steve kanalys spiffy radiant ruthless cando lieutenant roosevelts big stick 1 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
i wasnt expecting oscar material but this 0 
very disappointing 0 
youd have to have the iq of particularly stupid mollusk not to see that one coming 0 
spoilers whatever else can or cant be said about it surface is superbly crafted 1 
if she had not rolled the eyes we may have stayed not sure if we will go back and try it again 0 
i enjoyed it 1 
perabo has a nice energy level and is obviously very comfortable in front of a camera 1 
shrimp when i unwrapped it i live only 12 a mile from brushfire it was literally ice cold 0 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
what a piece of junk i lose more calls on this phone 0 
they never brought a salad we asked for 0 
the movie is littered with overt racial slurs towards the black cast members and in return the whites are depicted as morons and boobs 0 
low quality 0 
then as if i hadnt wasted enough of my life there they poured salt in the wound by drawing out the time it took to bring the check 0 
the menu is always changing food quality is going down service is extremely slow 0 
the last 15 minutes of movie are also not bad as well 1 
there were several moments in the movie that just didnt need to be there and were excruciatingly slow moving 0 
best of all is the rotating feature very helpful 1 
the interplay between martin and emilio contains the same wonderful chemistry we saw in wall street with martin and charlie 1 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
not only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic but it also managed to give away the entire movie and im not exaggerating every moment every plot point every joke is told in the trailer 0 
it was probably dirt 0 
after the disappointing dinner we went elsewhere for dessert 0 
it has been a winner for us 1 
i still maintain that monkeys shouldnt make headphones we just obviously dont share enough dna to copy the design over to humans 0 
earbud piece breaks easily 0 
i had a seriously solid breakfast here 1 
if she had not rolled the eyes we may have stayed not sure if we will go back and try it again 0 
the loudspeaker option is great the bumpers with the lights is very appealing 0 
steve martin delivers a really funny performance of a middleaged upper class uptight white guy 1 
very disappointed 0 
but the service was beyond bad 0 
i advise everyone do not be fooled 0 
highly unrecommended 0 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
steamboat willie is an amazingly important film to our cinema history 1 
good works fine 1 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
from what my dinner companions told meeverything was very fresh with nice texture and taste 1 
great value 1 
the first thing that happened was that the tracking was off 0 
ordered an appetizer and took 40 minutes and then the pizza another 10 minutes 0 
having trouble with volume 0 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
the service was outshining i definitely recommend the halibut 1 
not much flavor to them and very poorly constructed 0 
damian is so talented and versatile in so many ways of writing and portraying different characters on screen 1 
i own 2 of these cases and would order another 1 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
but now i was completely grossed out 0 
you can watch them preparing the delicious food 1 
cooked to perfection and the service was impeccable 1 
could not get strong enough signal 0 
no one at the table thought the food was above average or worth the wait that we had for it 0 
the service was poor and thats being nice 0 
phone now holds charge like it did when it was new 1 
maybe its just their vegetarian fare but ive been twice and i thought it was average at best 0 
the jabra eargels fit my ears very well 1 
spend your money and time some place else 0 
it didnt charge for me 0 
i was very disappointed in the movie 0 
otherwise easy to install and use clear sound 1 
battery has no life 0 
best headset ever 1 
the bathrooms are clean and the place itself is well decorated 1 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
the jalapeno bacon is soooo good 1 
everything was fresh and delicious 1 
now i know that i made a wise decision 1 
now the burgers arent as good the pizza which used to be amazing is doughy and flavorless 0 
it is unusable in a moving car at freeway speed 0 
the vegetables are so fresh and the sauce feels like authentic thai 1 
this game rocks 1 
rating 1 out of 10 0 
every thing on phone work perfectly she like it 1 
ive never been more insulted or felt disrespected 0 
motorola finally got the voice quality of a bluetooth headset right 1 
excellent product for the price 1 
and the accents are absolutely abysmal 0 
think it over when you plan to own this onethis sure is the last moto phone for me 0 
great service and food 1 
its quite simply the highest most superlative form of cinema imaginable 1 
but the movie makes a lot of serious mistakes 0 
case was more or less an extra that i originally put on but later discarded because it scratched my ear 0 
excellent short film 1 
works great 1 
the delivery was on time 1 
but its just not funny 0 
end of days is one of the worst bigbudget action movies ive ever seen 0 
avoid this establishment 0 
if it were possible to give them zero stars theyd have it 0 
the incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film 1 
say bye bye to your tip lady 0 
to summarize the food was incredible nay transcendant but nothing brings me joy quite like the memory of the pneumatic condiment dispenser 1 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
bad characters bad story and bad acting 0 
during several different 2 minute calls i experienced 5 drops and it was in an area that had 5 bars 0 
in the span of an hour i had two people exclaim whoa is that the new phone on tv 1 
they refuse to refund or replace 0 
but now that it is out of warranty the same problems reoccurebottom line put your money somewhere else cingular will not support it 0 
this place has it 1 
it failed to convey the broad sweep of landscapes that were a great part of the original 0 
this is an extraordinary film 1 
ambience is perfect 1 
dont buy this product 0 
its a gloriously fun fast paced and fairly accurate portrayal of the night of a raver 1 
how can that bethe audio quality is poor 0 
youll love it 1 
cant say enough good things about this place 1 
delicious 1 
maybe there would be a reasonable explanation for this atrocity 0 
by this time our side of the restaurant was almost empty so there was no excuse 0 
hot dishes are not hot cold dishes are close to room tempi watched staff prepare food with bare hands no gloveseverything is deep fried in oil 0 
if i take a picture the battery drops a bar and starts beeping letting me know its dieing 0 
it really created a unique feeling though 1 
this was my first and only vegas buffet and it did not disappoint 1 
about ten minutes into this film i started having second thoughts 0 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
about half way through this film i started to dislike it 0 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
over rated 0 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
ambience is perfect 1 
as i said abovepretty useless 0 
cant say enough good things about this place 1 
great pizza and salads 1 
this one works and was priced right 1 
hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in 0 
horrible phone 0 
this was a different cut than the piece the other day but still wonderful and tender s well as well flavored 1 
the screen does get smudged easily because it touches your ear and face 0 
ive bought 5 wired headphones that sound better than these 0 
long whiny and pointless 0 
the waitresses are very friendly 1 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
ordered burger rare came in well done 0 
the chicken i got was definitely reheated and was only ok the wedges were cold and soggy 0 
but i thought his acting was skilled 1 
poor product 0 
its welldesigned and very sharp the blue is a very nice color 1 
the server was very negligent of our needs and made us feel very unwelcome i would not suggest this place 0 
i was so insulted 0 
its very slow 0 
the script is bad very bad ¬ñ it contains both cheesiness and unethical joke that you normally see in rated r or nc17 movie 0 
im really disappointed all i have now is a charger that doesnt work 0 
the range is very decent ive been able to roam around my house with the phone in the living room with no receptionsound quality issues 1 
the sergeant pepper beef sandwich with auju sauce is an excellent sandwich as well 1 
that just screams legit in my booksomethats also pretty rare here in vegas 1 
we waited an hour for what was a breakfast i could have done 100 times better at home 0 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
the cinematography is simply stunning to say the least and the fx are nothing if not stateoftheart 1 
i guess i should have known that this place would suck because it is inside of the excalibur but i didnt use my common sense 0 
waste of 13 bucks 0 
in fact its hard to remember that the part of ray charles is being acted and not played by the man himself 1 
pricing is a bit of a concern at mellow mushroom 0 
what is even more stupid is that who had thought an idea that there should be a volcano in los angeles 0 
having to humour him just to get by and get through the day was so apt 1 
the classic maine lobster roll was fantastic 1 
better than expected 1 
though the wind and the lion is told largely through the eyes of the son every member of the family can identify with one of the characters whether it be sean connerys noble brigand candace bergens feisty heroine john hustons wily john hay or steve kanalys spiffy radiant ruthless cando lieutenant roosevelts big stick 1 
i dont each much pasta but i love the homemade hand made pastas and thin pizzas here 1 
so in a nutshell 1 the restaraunt smells like a combination of a dirty fish market and a sewer 0 
you get extra minutes so that you can carry out the call and not get cut off 1 
so i am here to warn youdo not rent this movie it is the dumbest thing you have never seen 0 
great pork sandwich 1 
im not sure how long we stood there but it was long enough for me to begin to feel awkwardly out of place 0 
then scene where they debated whether or not to sack the trumpeter who falsely was accused for the murder is pure horror really stupid 0 
wow very spicy but delicious 1 
the battery is unreliable as well as the service use antena 0 
i mean this in a terrible way 0 
i have purchased these for both family and friends and all enjoy their clarity and ease of use 1 
worked perfectly 1 
those burgers were amazing 1 
they never brought a salad we asked for 0 
ray charles is legendary 1 
cant store anything but phone numbers to sim 0 
linksys should have some way to exchange a bad phone for a refurb unit or something 0 
i vomited in the bathroom mid lunch 0 
what a disappointment 0 
do not purchase this phone 0 
you get what you pay for i guess 0 
i dont like this nokia either 0 
worst customer service ever 0 
on the good side the staff was genuinely pleasant and enthusiastic a real treat 1 
ray charles is legendary 1 
i could eat their bruschetta all day it is devine 1 
when i opened the sandwich i was impressed but not in a good way 0 
how can you call yourself a steakhouse if you cant properly cook a steak i dont understand 0 
the meat was pretty dry i had the sliced brisket and pulled pork 0 
the acting is terrible and the writing is worse 0 
battery is holding up well 1 
i dont have very many words to say about this place but it does everything pretty well 1 
everything was fresh and delicious 1 
add betty white and jean smart and you have a great cast everyone played their parts really well 1 
i love being able to use one headset for both by landline and cell 1 
avoid avoid avoid 0 
the acting was decidely wooden though no worse than a period universal b movie 0 
the death row scenes were entirely unmoving 0 
we got the food and apparently they have never heard of salt and the batter on the fish was chewy 0 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
this results in the phone being either stuck at max volume or mute 0 
yet plantronincs continues to use the same flawed charger design 0 
the worst one of the series 0 
all this movie does is make you sick watching all these slackers make excuses for their stupid actions for 90 minutes 0 
but now that it is out of warranty the same problems reoccurebottom line put your money somewhere else cingular will not support it 0 
the croutons also taste homemade which is an extra plus 1 
but above all the exquisite visual composition of each moment with inventive and elegant use of closeup camera angle and lighting including pointillistic faux home movie footage is a wonder and joy to behold 1 
at around 4 pm i bought it at around 8pm i started to watch at around 815pm i fast forwarded the remaining film to see if there was anything left watchable for a human being with a brain but there wasnt 0 
this particular model would not work with my motorola q smartphone 0 
the movie is littered with overt racial slurs towards the black cast members and in return the whites are depicted as morons and boobs 0 
does everything it should and more 1 
the owners are super friendly and the staff is courteous 1 
i ended up sliding it on the edge of my pants or back pockets instead 1 
first off the reception sucks i have never had more than 2 bars ever 0 
everything was fresh and delicious 1 
i have yet to run this new battery below two bars and thats three days without charging 1 
i highly recommend these and encourage people to give them a try 1 
the plot such as it is is so derivative and predictable that the ending is like a mercy killing 0 
piece of junk 0 
i bought this battery with a coupon from amazon and im very happy with my purchase 1 
this is an unbelievable bargain 1 
that was funny 1 
good case excellent value 1 
i dont have very many words to say about this place but it does everything pretty well 1 
the transfers are very good 1 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
this is a witty and delightful adaptation of the dr seuss book brilliantly animated by upas finest and thoroughly deserving of its academy award 1 
the design might be ergonomic in theory but i could not stand having these in my ear 0 
im still trying to get over how bad it was 0 
the restaurant atmosphere was exquisite 1 
the tracfonewebsite is user friendly and makes it easy toactivate etc 1 
this was a poor remake of my best friends wedding 0 
if you want a sandwich just go to any firehouse 1 
very much disappointed with this company 0 
i believe that this place is a great stop for those with a huge belly and hankering for sushi 1 
but storm trooper is not even bad enough to make it to the list of wonderfully terrible movies 0 
this was like the final blow 0 
excellent product for the price 1 
we enjoy their pizza and brunch 1 
however i recently watched the whole thing again on dvd and i was completely struck by how extremely stupid the storyline was how it contained holes inconsistencies and frankly a whole lot of crap and how horrid the dancing was 0 
the calls drop the phone comes on and off at will the screen goes black and the worst of all it stops ringing intermittently 0 
i just saw this film and i recommend it 1 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
now i know that i made a wise decision 1 
woa talk about awful 0 
i was left shattered from the experience of watching this film and i took a good two hours to fully recover 0 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
things that went wrong they burned the saganaki 0 
the delivery was on time 1 
ordered an appetizer and took 40 minutes and then the pizza another 10 minutes 0 
there is a lot of beautiful places 1 
does not fit 0 
the movie was very interesting from beginning to the end 1 
waitress was a little slow in service 0 
integrated seamlessly with the motorola razr phone 1 
food was average at best 0 
krussel always good 1 
insults profound deuchebaggery and had to go outside for a smoke break while serving just to solidify it 0 
what a waste 0 
this is a really fantastic thai restaurant which is definitely worth a visit 1 
never got it 0 
fantastic buy and will get again for whatever my next phone is 1 
i do love sushi but i found kabuki to be overpriced overhip and underservices 0 
i never come again 0 
the headsets are easy to use and everyone loves them 1 
i was hoping for more 0 
also its slim enough to fit into my alarm clock docking station without removing the case 1 
good show samsung 1 
even when the women finally show up there is no sign of improvement the most expected things happen and by the time the film is over you might be far asleep 0 
but storm trooper is not even bad enough to make it to the list of wonderfully terrible movies 0 
it had some average acting from the main person and it was a low budget as you clearly can see 0 
stopped by during the late may bank holiday off rick steve recommendation and loved it 1 
first of all there are enough racial stereotypes and racial jokes to offend everyone 0 
ive only had my bluetooth for a few weeks but i really like it 1 
this case seems well made 1 
once your food arrives its meh 0 
the staff is friendly and the joint is always clean 1 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
service was exceptional and food was a good as all the reviews 1 
its too bad that everyone else involved didnt share crowes level of dedication to quality for if they did wed have a far better film on our hands than this subpar mess 0 
i would have given no star if i was able 0 
couldnt ask for a more satisfying meal 1 
seriously killer hot chai latte 1 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
if you see it you should probably just leave it on the shelf 0 
this phone tries very hard to do everything but fails at its very ability to be a phone 0 
the cast of veteran actors are more than just a nostalgia trip 1 
love this product 1 
ive only had my bluetooth for a few weeks but i really like it 1 
im very disappointed with my decision 0 
if you see it you should probably just leave it on the shelf 0 
so far so good 1 
their frozen margaritas are way too sugary for my taste 0 
however i recently watched the whole thing again on dvd and i was completely struck by how extremely stupid the storyline was how it contained holes inconsistencies and frankly a whole lot of crap and how horrid the dancing was 0 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
raw and sublimely moving 1 
total waste of time 0 
either way it sucks 0 
this is such a fun and funny movie 1 
plug was the wrong size 0 
great hands free device 1 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
yes this film does require a rather significant amount of puzzlesolving but the pieces fit together to create a beautiful picture 1 
the service was outshining i definitely recommend the halibut 1 
this is the place where i first had pho and it was amazing 1 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
the owners are super friendly and the staff is courteous 1 
so absolutley fantastic 1 
the ngage is still lacking in earbuds 0 
service was exceptional and food was a good as all the reviews 1 
definitely worth seeing its the sort of thought provoking film that forces you to question your own threshold of loneliness 1 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
i do not know if this was emilio estevezs directorial debut but the pacing the interplay and development of the characters as well as some clever camera work surrounding the character estevez plays all suggest a natural eye 1 
i really like this product over the motorola because it is allot clearer on the ear piece and the mic 1 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
some great music and terrific scenery 1 
which are small and not worth the price 0 
i love this cable it allows me to connect any miniusb device to my pc 1 
not sure who was more lost the flat characters or the audience nearly half of whom walked out 0 
the voice recognition thru the handset is excellent 1 
not much flavor to them and very poorly constructed 0 
exactly what i wanted 1 
the goat taco didnt skimp on the meat and wow what flavor 1 
everyone is very attentive providing excellent customer service 1 
the incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film 1 
the battery is unreliable as well as the service use antena 0 
i must say i have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again 1 
we were promptly greeted and seated 1 
lot of holes in the plot theres nothing about how he became the emperor nothing about where he spend 20 years between his childhood and mature age 0 
lot of holes in the plot theres nothing about how he became the emperor nothing about where he spend 20 years between his childhood and mature age 0 
but the service was beyond bad 0 
the place was fairly clean but the food simply wasnt worth it 0 
items stated as included from the description are not included 0 
the price was very good and with the free shipping and all it was a good purchase 1 
reversible plug works great 1 
do not make the same mistake as me 0 
we loved the place 1 
thats how id describe this painfully dreary timewaster of a film 0 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
i have always used corded headsets and the freedom from the wireless is very helpful 1 
works great when my cat attacked the phone he scratched the protective strip instead of destroying the screen 1 
the film gives meaning to the phrase never in the history of human conflict has so much been owed by so many to so few 1 
you never know if you pushed it hard enough or the right number of times for the function you want or not 0 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
you cant beat the price on these 1 
i didnt realize how wonderful the short really is until the last two scenes 1 
disappointing accessory from a good manufacturer 0 
i have read others reviews here but i havent had any problem with it 1 
its a little geeky but i think thats its sex on toast and it rocks and oozes sex right down to its battery embedded sleek stylish leather case 1 
bt50 battery junk 0 
on the negative its insipid enough to cause regret for another 2 hours of life wasted in front of the screen 0 
insults profound deuchebaggery and had to go outside for a smoke break while serving just to solidify it 0 
their steaks are 100 recommended 1 
works like a charm it work the same as the one i got with the phone 1 
im really disappointed all i have now is a charger that doesnt work 0 
this one wants to surf on the small wave of space movies in 1998 deep impact and armageddon and this one fails everywhere 0 
it does everything the description said it would 1 
iam very pleased with my purchase 1 
worst customer service ever 0 
the croutons also taste homemade which is an extra plus 1 
either way it sucks 0 
the owners are super friendly and the staff is courteous 1 
from here on the widmark character turns unintentionally comical 0 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
i checked everywhere and there is no feature for it which is really disappointing 0 
horrible phone 0 
regardless the film fails on most levels 0 
it sure does beat the nachos at the movies but i would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant 0 
the scallop dish is quite appalling for value as well 0 
he owns the film just as spacek owned coal miners daughter and quaid owned great balls of fire 1 
great movie 1 
i was very disappointed in the movie 0 
they keep getting better and better this is my third one and ive had numerous palms too 1 
i love the camera its really pretty good quality 1 
after 3 months screen just went black all of a sudden 0 
as for the mains also uninspired 0 
both great 1 
but the convoluted plot just didnt convince me and much of the film was watched with a weird questioning glance 0 
but the service was beyond bad 0 
after watching this film i wanted to learn more about the works of this artist 1 
as i said abovepretty useless 0 
its a shame to see good actors like thomerson and james make a living in a mess like this 0 
both rickman and stowe play their roles to the hilt in this tale of a childrens book writer who maybe has written a subversive tract 1 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
i do not know if this was emilio estevezs directorial debut but the pacing the interplay and development of the characters as well as some clever camera work surrounding the character estevez plays all suggest a natural eye 1 
and there wasnt a single sour note struck actingwise either some surprisingly solid casting here 1 
the potatoes were like rubber and you could tell they had been made up ahead of time being kept under a warmer 0 
the design might be ergonomic in theory but i could not stand having these in my ear 0 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
started watching this but didnt believe in any of the characters 0 
we had 7 at our table and the service was pretty fast 1 
oh yeah and the storyline was pathetic too 0 
at a time when it seems that film animation has been dominated by disneypixars cgi masterpieces it is both refreshing and comforting to know that miyazaki is still relying on traditional handdrawn animation to tell his charming and enchanting stories 1 
the worst piece of crap ever along with the verizon customer service 0 
this is one of the best movies out there that shows such strong sibling bond for each other 1 
definitely worth seeing its the sort of thought provoking film that forces you to question your own threshold of loneliness 1 
the phone loads super 1 
the story line is just awful 0 
my fella got the huevos rancheros and they didnt look too appealing 0 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
after charging overnight these batteries work great 1 
iam very pleased with my purchase 1 
this place was such a nice surprise 1 
the service was a bit lacking 0 
the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach 0 
ps the only scene in the movie that was cool is when the central character finds her room blown up 1 
not recommended 0 
there is simply no excuse for something this poorly done 0 
the worst phone from samsungcrap this crappy samsung e715 is the worst i have ever seeen 0 
i hate writing bad reviews about films especially those in which i really like the star but this film is so bad i dont believe for one second that anyone could have been proud of it 0 
its also great to see that renowned silent screenwriter frances marion hasnt missed a step going from silent to sound 1 
the food was very good 1 
if you hate earbugs avoid this phone by all means 0 
this is high adventure at its best 1 
very poor service 0 
restored my phone to like new performance 1 
this is infuriating 0 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
crisp and clear 1 
other than that the leather is nice and soft the fit is very tight the cut out for the face is a good shape 1 
like the other reviewer said you couldnt pay me to eat at this place again 0 
bad script bad direction and horrible acting make this one plain bad 0 
comfort for our whole family 1 
the microphone also works well but according to people i have called it applifies everything 1 
this movie contained an allstar cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i havent seen before 1 
the jalapeno bacon is soooo good 1 
the characters are fleshed out surprisingly well particularly grimes and blake and all the actors deliver their sharply scripted lines with just the right amount of deadpan tongue in cheek to make the dialogue both hilarious and realistic 1 
i also didnt like the on button it felt like it would crack with use 0 
this was one of the worst films i have ever seen 0 
then our food came out disappointment ensued 0 
i live in the neighborhood so i am disappointed i wont be back here because it is a convenient location 0 
this really is how vegas fine dining used to be right down to the menus handed to the ladies that have no prices listed 1 
i would recommend saving room for this 1 
the cr√™pe was delicate and thin and moist 1 
my 810 score is mostly for the plot 1 
if you see it you should probably just leave it on the shelf 0 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
just does not work 0 
i really enjoyed eating here 1 
leopard print is wonderfully wild 1 
it is wonderful and inspiring to watch and i hope that it gets released again on to video or dvd 1 
id like to return it 0 
ryans bar is definitely one edinburgh establishment i wont be revisiting 0 
the building itself seems pretty neat the bathroom is pretty trippy but i wouldnt eat here again 0 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
we are so glad we found this place 1 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
doesnt do the job 0 
a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it 1 
i want my money back 0 
today the graphics are crap 0 
a greasy unhealthy meal 0 
at first glance it is a lovely bakery cafe nice ambiance clean friendly staff 1 
walked in and the place smelled like an old grease trap and only 2 others there eating 0 
great place to relax and have an awesome burger and beer 1 
first of all it doesnt wear well 0 
will definitely be back 1 
this is hands down the best phone ive ever had 1 
at a time when it seems that film animation has been dominated by disneypixars cgi masterpieces it is both refreshing and comforting to know that miyazaki is still relying on traditional handdrawn animation to tell his charming and enchanting stories 1 
avoid at any and all costs 0 
the place was fairly clean but the food simply wasnt worth it 0 
hes a national treasure 1 
very disappointed 0 
the phone is sturdy and waterproof 1 
i have only had it for a few weeks but so far so good 1 
the best phone in market 1 
fantastic buy and will get again for whatever my next phone is 1 
frozen pucks of disgust with some of the worst people behind the register 0 
the movie in movie situations in the beginning and through the game that is played with her by the acting coach are fascinating 1 
i never walked out of a movie faster 0 
the restaurant is very clean and has a family restaurant feel to it 1 
in the span of an hour i had two people exclaim whoa is that the new phone on tv 1 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
what the hell kind of crap is that 0 
this case seems well made 1 
nice spicy and tender 1 
obviously they have a terrible customer service so you get what you pay for 0 
not only did the software do a great job of this i could also make my own ringtones form my existing cds without an internet connection 1 
they have horrible attitudes towards customers and talk down to each one when customers dont enjoy their food 0 
poor construction 0 
id like to return it 0 
i especially liked the noncliche choices with the parents in other movies i could predict the dialog verbatim but the writing in this movie made better selections 1 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
this phone is pretty sturdy and ive never had any large problems with it 1 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
the design might be ergonomic in theory but i could not stand having these in my ear 0 
very disappointed 0 
we walked away stuffed and happy about our first vegas buffet experience 1 
the acting was bad the dialogs were extremely shallow and insincere 0 
this results in the phone being either stuck at max volume or mute 0 
from here on the widmark character turns unintentionally comical 0 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
the first thing that happened was that the tracking was off 0 
so in a nutshell 1 the restaraunt smells like a combination of a dirty fish market and a sewer 0 
the volume for the ringer is real good you have choices how loud 1 
pretty good beer selection too 1 
the buffet at bellagio was far from what i anticipated 0 
if it was to turn my good day feeling into a night of disturbing memories than i guess he succeeded 0 
my mother and brother had to do thiswhen i saw robert ryan portraying this type of man it was a very good imitation of this type of individual and i was impressed 1 
i know this is not like the other restaurants at all something is very off here 0 
the chains which im no fan of beat this place easily 0 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
this was one of the worst films i have ever seen 0 
what a waste of money and time 0 
i had about two bites and refused to eat anymore 0 
maybe its just their vegetarian fare but ive been twice and i thought it was average at best 0 
i promise they wont disappoint 1 
obviously they have a terrible customer service so you get what you pay for 0 
pricing is a bit of a concern at mellow mushroom 0 
i promise they wont disappoint 1 
the sound quality for the device is unacceptableunless you are in a really quiet area you almost hear nothing 0 
we sat another ten minutes and finally gave up and left 0 
putting the race card aside lets look at the major flaw in the film they destroy latifas character 0 
works great 1 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
we recently witnessed her poor quality of management towards other guests as well 0 
problem is that the ear loops are made of weak material and break easily 0 
i would recommend purchasing the jabra jx10 series 2 which works flawlessly with my moto q go figure 1 
ps the only scene in the movie that was cool is when the central character finds her room blown up 1 
i have had tmobile service for 2 or 3 years now and i am pretty happy with it 1 
ive missed numerous calls because of this reason 0 
i find this inexcusable and so will probably be returning this phone and perhaps changing carriers 0 
i am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this 1 
i also decided not to send it back because our waitress looked like she was on the verge of having a heart attack 0 
its practically perfect in all of them ¬ñ a true masterpiece in a sea of faux masterpieces 1 
of all the dishes the salmon was the best but all were great 1 
the food is rich so order accordingly 1 
lucy bell is so much higher than this crap and for her to sink this low is quite depressing 0 
never again will i be dining at this place 0 
if there were zero stars i would give it zero stars 0 
i had strawberry tea which was good 1 
i love it 1 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
everything is appalling 0 
shrimp when i unwrapped it i live only 12 a mile from brushfire it was literally ice cold 0 
comfortable in my hand 1 
sprint charges for this service 0 
as many people complained i found this headsets microphone was very weak 0 
i had high hopes for this place since the burgers are cooked over a charcoal grill but unfortunately the taste fell flat way flat 0 
the food is very good for your typical bar food 1 
your brain will attempt to shutdown as part of a primal impulse of selfpreservation 0 
needless to say i wont be going back anytime soon 0 
its very slow 0 
nevertheless yet another wonderful film from the great masters stable 1 
i will not return 0 
the story itself is just predictable and lazy 0 
this is a really fantastic thai restaurant which is definitely worth a visit 1 
unfortunately the ability to actually know you are receiving a call is a rather important feature and this phone is pitiful in that respect 0
