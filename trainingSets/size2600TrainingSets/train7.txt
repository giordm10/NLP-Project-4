also notable is john baileys fine crisp beautifully colored cinematography and the great production design costumes by eiko ishioka who went on to do the memorable costumes for coppolas dracula for which she received a well deserved oscar 1 
if you are looking for a good quality motorola headset keep looking this isnt it 0 
the problem i have is that they charge 1199 for a sandwich that is no bigger than a subway sub which offers better and more amount of vegetables 0 
piece of trash 0 
i knew when i saw the film that more great things were to come from this gifted actor 1 
also its slim enough to fit into my alarm clock docking station without removing the case 1 
it was quite comfortable in the ear 1 
we recently witnessed her poor quality of management towards other guests as well 0 
i was hoping for more 0 
i love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it 1 
the characters are interesting and you really care for them 1 
conclusion very filling meals 1 
nice solid keyboard 1 
the plot was the same as pretty much every other cheap horror 0 
will be back again 1 
a film not easily forgotten 1 
okay i like to consider myself a fair critic so ill give credit where credits duethe creature effects were actually pretty cool 1 
i do not know if this was emilio estevezs directorial debut but the pacing the interplay and development of the characters as well as some clever camera work surrounding the character estevez plays all suggest a natural eye 1 
the nachos are a must have 1 
do not buy if you want to use the holster 0 
the only good thing was that it fits comfortably on small ears 1 
good quality 1 
i was sitting in my vehicle with the cradle on my belt and the headset lost signal 0 
essentially you can forget microsofts tech support 0 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
you need at least 3 mins to get to your phone book from the time you first turn on the phonebattery life is short 0 
jawbone era is awesome too 1 
all in all a great disappointment 0 
oh this is such a thing of beauty this restaurant 1 
im glad the film didnt go for the most obvious choice as a lesser film certainly would have 1 
my fiancé and i came in the middle of the day and we were greeted and seated right away 1 
excellent 1 
this is a very average phone with bad battery life that operates on a weak network 0 
very good phone 1 
crisp and clear 1 
first time there and might just be the last 0 
point your finger at any item on the menu order it and you wont be disappointed 1 
echo problemvery unsatisfactory 0 
on the up side their cafe serves really good food 1 
the food was barely lukewarm so it must have been sitting waiting for the server to bring it out to us 0 
pretty good beer selection too 1 
so in a nutshell 1 the restaraunt smells like a combination of a dirty fish market and a sewer 0 
the accompanied software is almost brilliant 1 
we are sending it back 0 
overall a delight 1 
an extensive menu provides lots of options for breakfast 1 
the soundtrack sucked 0 
the decor is nice and the piano music soundtrack is pleasant 1 
the worst was the salmon sashimi 0 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
the pizza selections are good 1 
battery is holding up well 1 
no real improvement 0 
go to place for gyros 1 
i wish i could return the unit and get back my money 0 
terrible management 0 
the salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop which was perfectly cooked 1 
if you simply want a small flip phone look elsewhere as the extra bells whistles are mediocre 0 
the food was barely lukewarm so it must have been sitting waiting for the server to bring it out to us 0 
both of the egg rolls were fantastic 1 
i could not stand to even watch it for very long for fear of losing iq 0 
this place has it 1 
one of the best mexican movies ever and one of the less understood even by mexican themselves no matter how identified the should have felt with it 1 
it will drive you barking mad 0 
some highlights great quality nigiri here 1 
id say that would be the hardest decision honestly all of ms dishes taste how they are supposed to taste amazing 1 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
as for the service i thought it was good 1 
this frog phone charm is adorable and very eye catching 1 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
couldnt figure it out 0 
favorite place in town for shawarrrrrrma 1 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
the story itself is just predictable and lazy 0 
it was so boring 0 
the script is bad very bad  it contains both cheesiness and unethical joke that you normally see in rated r or nc17 movie 0 
the opening sequence of this gem is a classic and the cat n mouse games that follow are a delight to watch 1 
motorola finally got the voice quality of a bluetooth headset right 1 
to sum the film up breeders is a terrible cheaply made horror movie that should be avoided like the ebola virus 0 
i think it was robert ryans best film because he portrayed someone like my father and he was a schizophrenic in real lifemy father although he never murdered anyone but was affected more so during the second world war which made him worse 1 
they were goldencrispy and delicious 1 
i received my supposedly new motorola 375 and apparently there was not a match between the phone and the charger 0 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
this is the first phone ive had that has been so cheaply made 0 
its a feelgood film and thats how i felt when i came out of the cinema 1 
but its just not funny 0 
the selection was probably the worst ive seen in vegasthere was none 0 
very good lunch spot 1 
their daily specials are always a hit with my group 1 
the visual effects were awful 0 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
pretty piece of junk 0 
food was good service was good prices were good 1 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
if that bug never showed up i would have given a 4 for sure but on the other side of the wall where this bug was climbing was the kitchen 0 
2 times very bad customer service 0 
as i said abovepretty useless 0 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
i rate this movie 910 1 
very clear quality sound and you dont have to mess with the sound on your ipod since you have the sound buttons on the headset 1 
best of all is the rotating feature very helpful 1 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
but i thought his acting was skilled 1 
big disappointment with calendar sync 0 
the burger i got the gold standard a 17 burger and was kind of disappointed 0 
all in all i can assure you ill be back 1 
im glad i found this product on amazon it is hard to find it wasnt high priced 1 
good food good service 1 
but whatever it was that cost them so much it didnt translate to quality thats for sure 0 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
the only thing worse than taylors acting was stanwycks singing 0 
this blueant supertooth handsfree phone speaker is awesome 1 
when my mom and i got home she immediately got sick and she only had a few bites of salad 0 
tom wilkinson broke my heart at the end and everyone elses judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike 1 
be sure to order dessert even if you need to pack it togo the tiramisu and cannoli are both to die for 1 
the foreigner is not worth one second of your time 0 
his performance is simply genius 1 
you have to hold the phone at a particular angle for the other party to hear you clearly 0 
an awesome new look for fall 2000 1 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
the chips and sals a here is amazing 1 
i also didnt like the on button it felt like it would crack with use 0 
excellent dualpurpose headset 1 
the desserts were a bit strange 0 
amazon sucks 0 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
best of all is the rotating feature very helpful 1 
and sometimes it was so embarrassing that i had to look away 0 
i liked it 1 
cant get the software to work with my computer 0 
shes poised and amazing 1 
we ordered the duck rare and it was pink and tender on the inside with a nice char on the outside 1 
excellent bluetooth headset 1 
comfortable nice range good battery life 1 
i waited and waited 0 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
we waited for thirty minutes to be seated although there were 8 vacant tables and we were the only folks waiting 0 
hated it 0 
perabo has a nice energy level and is obviously very comfortable in front of a camera 1 
we are so glad we found this place 1 
its uncomfortable and the sound quality is quite poor compared with the phone razr or with my previous wired headset that plugged into an lg 0 
we ordered the duck rare and it was pink and tender on the inside with a nice char on the outside 1 
too politically correct 0 
we wont be going back 0 
they never brought a salad we asked for 0 
ill be looking for a new earpiece 0 
the characters are interesting and you want to find out more about them the longer the movie goes on and i think people will be surprised by who does and doesnt make it 1 
i wear glasses and it fits fine with them 1 
great sound and service 1 
an hour seriously 0 
generally it just lacked imagination 0 
i have been in more than a few bars in vegas and do not ever recall being charged for tap water 0 
level 5 spicy was perfect where spice didnt overwhelm the soup 1 
a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it 1 
its too bad that everyone else involved didnt share crowes level of dedication to quality for if they did wed have a far better film on our hands than this subpar mess 0 
great phone 1 
this may be the only bad film he ever made 0 
the flat reenactments dont hold your attention because they are emotionally adrift and stagy 0 
clear skype calls long battery life long range 1 
i have always used corded headsets and the freedom from the wireless is very helpful 1 
excellent hands free tool 1 
not my thing 0 
the best place in vegas for breakfast just check out a sat or sun 1 
this film tries to be a serious and sophisticated thrillerhorror flick and it fails miserably 0 
service sucks 0 
the pleather case doesnt fit 0 
will never ever go back 0 
sam shepards portrayal of a gung ho marine was sobering 1 
i think it was robert ryans best film because he portrayed someone like my father and he was a schizophrenic in real lifemy father although he never murdered anyone but was affected more so during the second world war which made him worse 1 
great phone 1 
it fits my ear well and is comfortable on 1 
i did not bother contacting the company for few dollar product but i learned the lesson that i should not have bought this form online anyway 0 
it was a waste of my money 0 
ive seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie 0 
sounds good reasonably priced and effective its that simple 1 
i still maintain that monkeys shouldnt make headphones we just obviously dont share enough dna to copy the design over to humans 0 
the instructions didnt explain that a microphone jack could be used 0 
putting the race card aside lets look at the major flaw in the film they destroy latifas character 0 
waste of money 0 
this place lacked style 0 
glad i didnt pay to see it 0 
i went on motorolas website and followed all directions but could not get it to pair again 0 
i like the fact that it rests lightly against your ear rather than inside 1 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
10 out of 10 for both the movie and trilogy 1 
funny clever hip just like prays previous film hype 1 
the only possible way this movie could be redeemed would be as mst3k fodder 0 
my 5year old nokia 2160 from tracfone holds the charge a lot better than this 0 
i especially liked the noncliche choices with the parents in other movies i could predict the dialog verbatim but the writing in this movie made better selections 1 
after the first charge kept going dead after 12 minutes 0 
the jerky camera movements were also annoying 0 
the performances are real and gripping the crocdodile is extremely well done indeed if the black water website is to be believed thats because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous 1 
this is probably the most irritating show i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
now you know why i gave it a 10 1 
good product incredible value 1 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
i promise they wont disappoint 1 
i can think of no other film where something vitally important occurs every other minute 1 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
avoid this establishment 0 
perabo has a nice energy level and is obviously very comfortable in front of a camera 1 
my experience was terrible this was my fourth bluetooth headset and while it was much more comfortable than my last jabra which i hated 0 
lewis blacks considerable talent is wasted here too as he is at his most incendiary when he is unrestrained which the pg13 rating certainly wont allow 0 
im really disappointed all i have now is a charger that doesnt work 0 
when a song could explain the emotions of the subjects better such as when jay adams unfortunate life was a subject of talk the song old man by neil young was played which evokes many emotions 1 
it is zillion times away from reality 0 
the food was very good 1 
i could eat their bruschetta all day it is devine 1 
yet i enjoy watching it 1 
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1 
excellent performance 1 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
i probably wont be coming back here 0 
it felt too light and tinny 0 
the plug did not work very well 0 
it is an hour and half waste of time following a bunch of very pretty high schoolers whine and cry about life 0 
setup went very smoothly 1 
really pleased with this product so far 1 
i was shocked because no signs indicate cash only 0 
if there were zero stars i would give it zero stars 0 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
problem is that the ear loops are made of weak material and break easily 0 
trying to make a call on these is an exercise in frustration 0 
great sound and service 1 
i sat riveted to the tv screen 1 
i am pairing this with my iphone and i could not be happier with it so far 1 
i really like this product over the motorola because it is allot clearer on the ear piece and the mic 1 
overall i am psyched to have a phone which has all my appointments and contacts in and gets great reception 1 
poorly contstruct hinge 0 
the delivery was on time 1 
it also took her forever to bring us the check when we asked for it 0 
the new characters werent all that memorable and i found myself forgetting who was who 0 
just does not work 0 
of course the footage from the 70s was grainy but that only enhanced the film 1 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
i didnt know pulled pork could be soooo delicious 1 
so bad 0 
it was absolutely amazing 1 
my boyfriend and i came here for the first time on a recent trip to vegas and could not have been more pleased with the quality of food and service 1 
i got the car charger and not even after a week the charger was brokeni went to plug it in and it started smoking 0 
worst customer service 0 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
unfortunately it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees 0 
and those baby owls were adorable 1 
i tried the cape cod ravoli chickenwith cranberrymmmm 1 
crash is a depressing little nothing that provokes emotion but teaches you nothing if you already know racism and prejudice are bad things 0 
bad characters bad story and bad acting 0 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
highly recommended 1 
the nokia ca42 usb cable did not work with my phone 0 
i probably wont be coming back here 0 
lordy the khao soi is a dish that is not to be missed for curry lovers 1 
i dont know what the big deal is about this place but i wont be back yaall 0 
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
the food wasnt good 0 
however paul schrader has indeed made a film about mishima that is both superb complex 1 
they will customize your order any way youd like my usual is eggplant with green bean stir fry love it 1 
i was sitting in my vehicle with the cradle on my belt and the headset lost signal 0 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
a piece of cinematic garbage captured on celluloid 0 
stay away from the q 0 
not enough volume 0 
what this film lacks is a convincing script 0 
item arrived quickly and works great with my metro pcs samsung schr450 slider phone and sony premium sound in ear plugs 1 
my 5year old nokia 2160 from tracfone holds the charge a lot better than this 0 
yes i am simplifying things here for the sake of brevity for this really is at the core of the problems with this film it has too much going on without any real fulfilling explanation 0 
sauce was tasteless 0 
also difficult to put onid recommend avoiding this product 0 
best fish ive ever had in my life 1 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
a happy wonderful feel good ending 1 
there still are good actors around 1 
love the margaritas too 1 
nice design and quality 1 
very good product well made 1 
the only thing really worth watching was the scenery and the house because it is beautiful 1 
my sashimi was poor quality being soggy and tasteless 0 
absolutel junk 0 
they have great dinners 1 
food arrived quickly 1 
i really wanted the plantronics 510 to be the right one but it has too many issues for methe good 0 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
i was particularly pleased with the acting ability of dwight schultz 1 
my mother and brother had to do thiswhen i saw robert ryan portraying this type of man it was a very good imitation of this type of individual and i was impressed 1 
this phone might well be the worst ive ever had in any brand 0 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
i am pairing this with my iphone and i could not be happier with it so far 1 
crust is not good 0 
the screen size is big key pad lit well enough and the camera quality is excellent for a camera phone 1 
the very idea of it was lame take a minor character from a mediocre pg13 film and make a complete nonsequel while changing its tone to a pgrated family movie 0 
any ring toneoverall good phone to buy 1 
what a great double cheeseburger 1 
yes its shiny on front side and i love it 1 
punishment park is a brilliant piece of cinema 1 
the phone was unusable and was not new 0 
but when someone strives for greatness and poetry but delivers a muddled and often ridiculous story a bunch of disparate scenes pretentious dialogue then you get the worst kind of a movie that some other reviewer very accurately defined as pretentious crap 0 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
i hate movies like that 0 
no one at the table thought the food was above average or worth the wait that we had for it 0 
though the wind and the lion is told largely through the eyes of the son every member of the family can identify with one of the characters whether it be sean connerys noble brigand candace bergens feisty heroine john hustons wily john hay or steve kanalys spiffy radiant ruthless cando lieutenant roosevelts big stick 1 
comfortable nice range good battery life 1 
the sides are delish mixed mushrooms yukon gold puree white corn beateous 1 
the sound quality is excellent as well 1 
i never walked out of a movie faster 0 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
however my girl was complain that some time the phone doesnt wake up like normal phone does 0 
the only good thing was our waiter he was very helpful and kept the bloddy marys coming 1 
worked very well paired with a treo 700w and as a skype headset on my pc using a usb bluetooth transceiver 1 
kris kristoffersen is good in this movie and really makes a difference 1 
never heard of any of them except cole who was totally unbelievable in the part 0 
first time going but i think i will quickly become a regular 1 
we walked away stuffed and happy about our first vegas buffet experience 1 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
dont go here 0 
bad quality 0 
i went to bachi burger on a friends recommendation and was not disappointed 1 
i have only had it for a few weeks but so far so good 1 
the cable looks so thin and flimsy it is scary 0 
the plot such as it is is so derivative and predictable that the ending is like a mercy killing 0 
i tried talking real loud but shouting on the telephone gets old and i was still told it wasnt great 0 
the battery is completely useless to me 0 
i totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is 1 
the performances are real and gripping the crocdodile is extremely well done indeed if the black water website is to be believed thats because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous 1 
but above all the exquisite visual composition of each moment with inventive and elegant use of closeup camera angle and lighting including pointillistic faux home movie footage is a wonder and joy to behold 1 
then a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use 0 
coming here is like experiencing an underwhelming relationship where both parties cant wait for the other person to ask to break up 0 
awful service 0 
its also great to see that renowned silent screenwriter frances marion hasnt missed a step going from silent to sound 1 
the staff was very attentive 1 
reaching for the bottom row is uncomfortable and the send and end keys are not where i expect them to be3 0 
this is the first phone ive had that has been so cheaply made 0 
try them in the airport to experience some tasty food and speedy friendly service 1 
kids pizza is always a hit too with lots of great side dish options for the kiddos 1 
it clicks into place in a way that makes you wonder how long that mechanism would last 0 
both the hot sour the egg flower soups were absolutely 5 stars 1 
lastly the mozzarella sticks they were the best thing we ordered 1 
but in terms of the writing its very fresh and bold 1 
ordered an appetizer and took 40 minutes and then the pizza another 10 minutes 0 
works great 1 
none of the three sizes they sent with the headset would stay in my ears 0 
this item is great installed it let it charged up overnite and it has been working good every since with no problems 1 
ill even say it again  this is torture 0 
oh the charger seems to work fine 1 
avoid this one if you can 0 
the ri style calamari was a joke 0 
this is one of the worst sandra bullock movie since speed 2 but not quite that bad 0 
hell no will i go back 0 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
bacon is hella salty 1 
how awesome is that 1 
it is a really good show to watch 1 
generally it just lacked imagination 0 
dont bother coming here 0 
the story is lame not interesting and never really explains the sinister origins of the puppets 0 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
the croutons also taste homemade which is an extra plus 1 
but it picked up speed and got right to the point 1 
nice headphones for the price and they work great 1 
it was so boring 0 
lets start with all the problemsthe acting especially from the lead professor was very very bad 0 
i would have given no star if i was able 0 
defective crap 0 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
it fits my ear well and is comfortable on 1 
i liked this movie way too much 1 
phone now holds charge like it did when it was new 1 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
this is the place where i first had pho and it was amazing 1 
these headphones were a great find and i think they are perhaps the best purchase ive made in the last several years seriously 1 
its worth driving up from tucson 1 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
nice solid keyboard 1 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
the writers were smack on and i think the best actors and actresses were a bonus to the showthese characters were so real 1 
best of all is the rotating feature very helpful 1 
dont waste your money and time 0 
the soundtrack sucked 0 
it crackles with an unpredictable youthful energy but honestly i found it hard to follow and concentrate on it meanders so badly 0 
the bt headset was such a disapoinment 0 
this movie is so awesome 1 
delete this film from your mind 0 
2 thumbs up 1 
the delivery was on time 1 
what a big waste of time 0 
barney is definitely super de duper 1 
a must study for anyone interested in the worst sins of industrial design 0 
same evening him and i are both drastically sick 0 
this place is overpriced not consistent with their boba and it really is overpriced 0 
not even good for camp value 0 
it is an hour and half waste of time following a bunch of very pretty high schoolers whine and cry about life 0 
very good stuff for the price 1 
i guess that nobody at the network that aired this dribble watched it before putting it on 0 
waaaaaayyyyyyyyyy over rated is all i am saying 0 
the price was very good and with the free shipping and all it was a good purchase 1 
dont buy it 0 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
why are these sad little vegetables so overcooked 0 
worst service to boot but that is the least of their worries 0 
nice solid keyboard 1 
the holster that arrived did not match the photo in the ad 0 
the acting helps the writing along very well maybe the idiotsavant sister could have been played better and it is a real joy to watch 1 
you get incredibly fresh fish prepared with care 1 
this totally unfunny movie is so over the top and pathetic and unrealistic that throughout the whole 90 minutes of utter torture i probably looked at my watch about 70000 times 0 
my fiancé and i came in the middle of the day and we were greeted and seated right away 1 
no im going to eat the potato that i found some strangers hair in it 0 
appears to actually outperform the original battery from china that came with my v325i 1 
simple lightweight and great fit 1 
there was hardly any meat 0 
this movie is terrible 0 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
it was pretty gross 0 
i promise they wont disappoint 1 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
an extensive menu provides lots of options for breakfast 1 
the food is rich so order accordingly 1 
bad fit way too big 0 
this product is great it makes working a lot easier i can go to the copier while waiting on hold for something 1 
i would definitely recommend the jabra bt250v for those who are looking for comfort clarity and a great price 1 
were jerks on the phone 0 
the seasonal fruit was fresh white peach puree 1 
excellent short film 1 
this is the first phone ive had that has been so cheaply made 0 
the ambience is wonderful and there is music playing 1 
the pancake was also really good and pretty large at that 1 
lastly the mozzarella sticks they were the best thing we ordered 1 
maybe if they werent cold they would have been somewhat edible 0 
i connected my wifes bluetoothmotorola hs850 to my phone and it worked like a charm whether the phone was in my pocket or the case 1 
now the pizza itself was good the peanut sauce was very tasty 1 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
a great way to finish a great 1 
i dont understand how this garbage got on the shelves of the movie store its not even a real movie 0 
it was awesome 1 
motorola finally got the voice quality of a bluetooth headset right 1 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
the attention given to every character and complex psychological portrayals detailing loyalty treachery love and hope are tremendous 1 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
the biggest complaint i have is the battery drains superfast 0 
the attractive set used throughout most of the film is an eyepleasing gem 1 
another note about this phones appearance is that it really looks rather bland especially in the all black model 0 
try them in the airport to experience some tasty food and speedy friendly service 1 
her lines seem to have been written by a fifteen year old though they are trying oh so so hard to sound like how a fifteen year old would really um you know well talk 0 
when i received my pita it was huge it did have a lot of meat in it so thumbs up there 1 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
generally it just lacked imagination 0 
my boyfriend and i came here for the first time on a recent trip to vegas and could not have been more pleased with the quality of food and service 1 
this case has passed the one year mark and while it shows signs of wear it is 100 functional 1 
i would highly recommend this product 1 
everything on the menu is terrific and we were also thrilled that they made amazing accommodations for our vegetarian daughter 1 
bad reception 0 
the biggest complaint i have is the battery drains superfast 0 
cant store anything but phone numbers to sim 0 
then our food came out disappointment ensued 0 
there is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again 0 
case was more or less an extra that i originally put on but later discarded because it scratched my ear 0 
the result is a powerhouse achievement made more timely now perhaps because of our cultures disturbing fascination with celebrity and its distorted interpretations of fame 1 
the bottowm lineanother worthless cheap gimmick from sprint 0 
im not eating here 0 
this is not moviemaking 0 
total letdown i would much rather just go to the camelback flower shop and cartel coffee 0 
ray charles life provided excellent biographical material for the film which goes well beyond being just another movie about a musician 1 
my boyfriend tried the mediterranean chicken salad and fell in love 1 
the story is lame not interesting and never really explains the sinister origins of the puppets 0 
kris kristoffersen is good in this movie and really makes a difference 1 
the interplay between martin and emilio contains the same wonderful chemistry we saw in wall street with martin and charlie 1 
conclusion i loved it 1 
their onscreen chemistry critical to the entire film is genuine 1 
bad fit way too big 0 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
they are so easy to love but even more easy to identify with 1 
definitely worth seeing its the sort of thought provoking film that forces you to question your own threshold of loneliness 1 
as i said abovepretty useless 0 
he deserves 5 stars 1 
avoid at all costs 0 
dont waste your money 0 
howeverthe riingtones are not the best and neither are the games 0 
in summary this was a largely disappointing dining experience 0 
the biggest complaint i have is the battery drains superfast 0 
after the first charge kept going dead after 12 minutes 0 
i found a six inch long piece of wire in my salsa 0 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
i had high hopes for this place since the burgers are cooked over a charcoal grill but unfortunately the taste fell flat way flat 0 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
it was packed 0 
the sides are delish mixed mushrooms yukon gold puree white corn beateous 1 
crisp and clear 1 
there was no chemistry between ben affleck and sandra bullock in this film and i couldnt understand why he would consider even leaving his wifetobe for this chick that he supposedly was knocked out by 0 
the scripting of the subtle comedy is unmatched by any movie in recent years 1 
so far it has worked like a charm 1 
my ribeye steak was cooked perfectly and had great mesquite flavor 1 
it is a joy to use 1 
a great film by a great director 1 
the sound quality is good and functionality is awesome 1 
i had to wait over 30 minutes to get my drink and longer to get 2 arepas 0 
either way it sucks 0 
not much flavor to them and very poorly constructed 0 
all in all im quite satisfied with this purchase 1 
very disappointed and wondered how it could be in the oscar shortlist 0 
not easy to watch 0 
the block was amazing 1 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
i never come again 0 
service was good and the company was better 1 
i have eaten here multiple times and each time the food was delicious 1 
also makes it easier to hold on to 1 
good item low price 1 
the story unfolds in 18th century jutland and the use of period music played on period instruments is just one more fine touch 1 
the charger arrived within the promised timeframe but it did not work 0 
any ring toneoverall good phone to buy 1 
if there was ever an indication of a writer and a directors ability to meld two highly volatile temperaments into a seamless union of creativity then this is it 1 
in fact its hard to remember that the part of ray charles is being acted and not played by the man himself 1 
i enjoyed it 1 
when achille and philippa beautifully sing a duet from don giovanni that perfectly describes their situation in the movie you appreciate the subtle layers of this excellent film 1 
i tried the cape cod ravoli chickenwith cranberrymmmm 1 
it wasnt busy either also the building was freezing cold 0 
i wouldnt see this movie again for free 0 
i was amazed at the quick arrival of the two original lg cell phone batteries and and at a fraction of the price 1 
go watch it 1 
very clear quality sound and you dont have to mess with the sound on your ipod since you have the sound buttons on the headset 1 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
i had high hopes for this place since the burgers are cooked over a charcoal grill but unfortunately the taste fell flat way flat 0 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
seriously killer hot chai latte 1 
i bought two of them and neither will charge 0 
after 3 months screen just went black all of a sudden 0 
good case excellent value 1 
att is not clear sound is very distorted and you have to yell when you talk 0 
a lot of websites have been rating this a very good phone and so do i 1 
the first time i ever came here i had an amazing experience i still tell people how awesome the duck was 1 
some great music and terrific scenery 1 
cute quaint simple honest 1 
the earpiece on this is too large or too heavyit keeps falling out of my ear 0 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
fast service 1 
the pizza selections are good 1 
ordered burger rare came in well done 0 
overall i wasnt very impressed with noca 0 
do not buy for d807wrongly advertised for d807 0 
works like a charm it work the same as the one i got with the phone 1 
fantastic food 1 
we had a group of 70 when we claimed we would only have 40 and they handled us beautifully 1 
i waited and waited 0 
the seasonal fruit was fresh white peach puree 1 
so anyone near you will hear part of your conversation 0 
the crêpe was delicate and thin and moist 1 
the secondary plot line is incomprehensible and its relation to the primary plot line is mystifying 0 
this blueant supertooth handsfree phone speaker is awesome 1 
dont go here 0 
sucked most of the stuff does not work with my phone 0 
we had a group of 70 when we claimed we would only have 40 and they handled us beautifully 1 
great bluetooth 1 
the steak and the shrimp are in my opinion the best entrees at gc 1 
maybe if they werent cold they would have been somewhat edible 0 
the file browser offers all the options that one needshandsfree is great 1 
what happened next was prettyoff putting 0 
before i go in to why i gave a 1 star rating please know that this was my third time eating at bachi burger before writing a review 0 
i cant wait to go back 1 
in summary this was a largely disappointing dining experience 0 
5 stars for the brick oven bread app 1 
lightweight and works well 1 
what a big waste of time 0 
with the originality and freshness of the first movie now spent this remake had little else to offer 0 
i am so pleased to know such a modern day genius is out there letting is passion for art drive him and taking us as an audience with him 1 
great character actors telly savalas and peter boyle 1 
well im satisfied 1 
setup went very smoothly 1 
we started with the tuna sashimi which was brownish in color and obviously wasnt fresh 0 
its so stupid to have to keep buying new chargers car chargers cradles headphones and car kits every time a new phone comes out 0 
now i know that i made a wise decision 1 
this movie totally grates on my nerves 0 
its just lame 0 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
the death row scenes were entirely unmoving 0 
dee snider just plain sucks 0 
better than expected 1 
unreliable im giving up 0 
it fits my ear well and is comfortable on 1 
the scenes with the ohsomature neighbourgirl are a misplace 0 
i have purchased these for both family and friends and all enjoy their clarity and ease of use 1 
i cant see how this movie can be an inspiration to anyone to come out or overcome fear and rejection 0 
you need two hands to operate the screenthis software interface is decade old and cannot compete with new software designs 0 
i waited and waited 0 
the shrimp tender and moist 1 
i was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar not only because the quality is great but the service is fast and the food impeccable 1 
i did not expect this to be so good 1 
what a waste of money and time 0 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
the classic maine lobster roll was fantastic 1 
not good by any stretch of the imagination 0 
the movie had you on the edge of your seat and made you somewhat afraid to go to your car at the end of the night 1 
its a gloriously fun fast paced and fairly accurate portrayal of the night of a raver 1 
generous portions and great taste 1 
battery is terrible 0 
the cashier was friendly and even brought the food out to me 1 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
my 810 score is mostly for the plot 1 
comes with a strong light that you can use to light up your camera shots and even flash sos signals seriously 1 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
walked in and the place smelled like an old grease trap and only 2 others there eating 0 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
not loud enough and doesnt turn on like it should 0 
the only possible way this movie could be redeemed would be as mst3k fodder 0 
also the story and acting were weak 0 
it is an hour and half waste of time following a bunch of very pretty high schoolers whine and cry about life 0 
lifetime does not air it enough so if anyone knows what store sells it let me know because this is a musthave 1 
1 hour 54 minutes of sheer tedium melodrama and horrible acting a mess of a script and a sinking feeling of good lord what were they thinking 0 
as a courtroom drama its compelling as an indictment on the american justice system its frightening 1 
this place receives stars for their appetizers 1 
service was fantastic 1 
rude inconsiderate management 0 
the vanilla ice cream was creamy and smooth while the profiterole choux pastry was fresh enough 1 
the service here is fair at best 0 
if you love authentic mexican food and want a whole bunch of interesting yet delicious meats to choose from you need to try this place 1 
my boyfriend and i came here for the first time on a recent trip to vegas and could not have been more pleased with the quality of food and service 1 
i believe the screenwriter did a good job of tying up the loose ends 1 
the scripting of the subtle comedy is unmatched by any movie in recent years 1 
judith light is one of my favorite actresses and i think she does a superb job in this film 1 
overpriced for what you are getting 0 
he really didnt seem to want to be hosting his voiceovers were monotonous didnt get involved with the guests 0 
phone falls out easily 0 
the cg opening sequence in space looked like it could have been created on microsoft slideshow for gods sake 0 
im not eating here 0 
worst customer service 0 
i even fully charged it before i went to bed and turned off blue tooth and wifi and noticed that it only had 20 left in the morning 0 
this short film certainly pulls no punches 0 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
piece of junk 0 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
the best place in vegas for breakfast just check out a sat or sun 1 
i dont think you will be disappointed 1 
very windresistant 1 
it rocked my world and is certainly a must see for anyone with no social or physical outlets 1 
barney is definitely super de duper 1 
bela lugosi was totally extraneous intoning odd lines 0 
i have had problems wit hit dropping signal and more 0 
rating 1 out of 10 0 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
this place is great 1 
my fiancé and i came in the middle of the day and we were greeted and seated right away 1 
used and dirty 0 
best fish ive ever had in my life 1 
i advise you to look out for it 1 
the range is very decent ive been able to roam around my house with the phone in the living room with no receptionsound quality issues 1 
there is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again 0 
there still are good actors around 1 
i felt insulted and disrespected how could you talk and judge another human being like that 0 
which are small and not worth the price 0 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
the best place in vegas for breakfast just check out a sat or sun 1 
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0 
treo and tmobile refused to replace it again and forced me to buy another phone without any kind of upgrade discount 0 
the cow tongue and cheek tacos are amazing 1 
a must study for anyone interested in the worst sins of industrial design 0 
it was clear that she had the range and ability to pull off this part 1 
the ri style calamari was a joke 0 
great product fast shipping 1 
he came running after us when he realized my husband had left his sunglasses on the table 1 
avoid at all cost 0 
the plot is nonsense that doesnt interest in the slightest way or have any uniqueness to it 0 
the design is very odd as the ear clip is not very comfortable at all 0 
i did not have any problem with this item and would order it again if needed 1 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
a film not easily forgotten 1 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
all the actors give a wonderful performance especially jennifer rubin as jamie harris who changes from the nervous starlet in the beginning through the strange events she is part of to the cool star 1 
very displeased 0 
shes poised and amazing 1 
first of all there are enough racial stereotypes and racial jokes to offend everyone 0 
even if you love bad movies do not watch this movie 0 
this film offers many delights and surprises 1 
the restaurant atmosphere was exquisite 1 
food was so gooodd 1 
nice spicy and tender 1 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
overall a delight 1 
the ambience is wonderful and there is music playing 1 
even allowing for poor production values for the time 1971 and the format some kind of miniseries this is baaaaaad 0 
but if you liked movies like the matrix and better yet their sequels i think youll appreciate the thought provoking mindblowing experience this film will give you 1 
this is a chilly unremarkable movie about an author livingworking in a chilly abstruse culture 0 
imdb ratings only go as low 1 for awful its time to get some negative numbers in there for cases such as these 0 
rude inconsiderate management 0 
a good quality bargain i bought this after i bought a cheapy from big lots that sounded awful and people on the other end couldnt hear me 1 
the jerky camera movements were also annoying 0 
best headset ever 1 
i have yet to run this new battery below two bars and thats three days without charging 1 
we started with the tuna sashimi which was brownish in color and obviously wasnt fresh 0 
also notable is john baileys fine crisp beautifully colored cinematography and the great production design costumes by eiko ishioka who went on to do the memorable costumes for coppolas dracula for which she received a well deserved oscar 1 
the screen does get smudged easily because it touches your ear and face 0 
i will not be eating there again 0 
the script is horrendously stupid 0 
i love the ringtones because they are so upbeat 1 
perfect for the ps3 1 
great choice 1 
i think i was one of the people who found this another one of roths pearls 1 
this movie is also revealing 1 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
we had fantastic service and were pleased by the atmosphere 1 
it just blew 0 
the sound quality is good and functionality is awesome 1 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
secondly hitchcock pretty much perfected the thriller and chase movie 1 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
when i saw it in the theater i thought i was going to be sick 0 
the attention given to every character and complex psychological portrayals detailing loyalty treachery love and hope are tremendous 1 
and i really did find them funny 1 
not too screamy not to masculine but just right 1 
you wont forget this movie 1 
i love all the features and form factor 1 
i love the camera its really pretty good quality 1 
the story which was told so eloquently by francis ford coppola 25 years earlier really unfolds gradually and leaves room for the characters to develop 1 
a very good film indeed about great and unconditional love 1 
her lines seem to have been written by a fifteen year old though they are trying oh so so hard to sound like how a fifteen year old would really um you know well talk 0 
now this is a movie i really dislike 0 
i saw mirrormask last night and it was an unsatisfactory experience 0 
you need two hands to operate the screenthis software interface is decade old and cannot compete with new software designs 0 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
i saw it as a child on tv back in 1973 when it was the stranger and i loved it 1 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
but it is great i would really recommend it 1 
my 810 score is mostly for the plot 1 
worst martini ever 0 
my only problem is i thought the actor playing the villain was a low rent michael ironside 0 
i had ordered a motorola data cable got a very well finished and working product 1 
i go to far too many places and ive never seen any restaurant that serves a 1 egg breakfast especially for 400 0 
these are fabulous 1 
so far it has worked like a charm 1 
sweetest phone 1 
cant store anything but phone numbers to sim 0 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
it came free with a dvd player i bought but i still turned the thing off halfway through because i was embarrassed for howell 0 
trumbull on i love lucy 1 
they made this case too small and is very difficult to install 0 
the sound quality is good and functionality is awesome 1 
really good product 1 
overall i was not impressed and would not go back 0 
the service here leaves a lot to be desired 0 
of course the acting is blah 0 
it will drive you barking mad 0 
it was too predictable even for a chick flick 0 
took an hour to get our food only 4 tables in restaurant my food was luke warm our sever was running around like he was totally overwhelmed 0 
still its quite interesting and entertaining to follow 1 
these are the nicest restaurant owners ive ever come across 1 
there is no real plot 0 
good value great food great service 1 
worked very well paired with a treo 700w and as a skype headset on my pc using a usb bluetooth transceiver 1 
not much flavor to them and very poorly constructed 0 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
disappointing accessory from a good manufacturer 0 
a piece of cinematic garbage captured on celluloid 0 
ive had this bluetoooth headset for some time now and still not comfortable with the way it fits on the ear 0 
i am very impressed with this headset from plantronics 1 
the buffet at bellagio was far from what i anticipated 0 
very well made and fits my surefire gx2 perfectly 1 
how can you call yourself a steakhouse if you cant properly cook a steak i dont understand 0 
good product incredible value 1 
they know how to make them here 1 
sweetest phone 1 
we loved the biscuits 1 
what did bother me was the slow service 0 
very displeased 0 
but then they came back cold 0 
trying to make a call on these is an exercise in frustration 0 
both great 1 
the warm beer didnt help 0 
it was either too cold not enough flavor or just bad 0 
i find wasting food to be despicable but this just wasnt food 0 
much less than the jawbone i was going to replace it with 1 
warning do not buy 0 
the block was amazing 1 
great pizza and salads 1 
yes its that bad 0 
we had fantastic service and were pleased by the atmosphere 1 
i waited and waited 0 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
also if your phone is dropped this case is not going to save it specially when dropped face down 0 
this was a different cut than the piece the other day but still wonderful and tender s well as well flavored 1 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
i received my orders well within the shipping timeframe everything was in good working order and overall i am very excited to have this source 1 
hes a national treasure 1 
this is a masterful piece of filmmaking with many themes simmering and occasionally boiling over in this warts and all study of the poets bohemian selfindulgent wartime years that span the aerial bombardments of london and the outward tranquillity of a welsh coastal retreat the borderlines between friendship lust and love dedication to art and experience versus practical concerns jealousy rivalry cowardice and egotism versus heroism and selfsacrifice and more 1 
this early film from future goremeister lucio fulci is a very good addition to the giallo subgenre 1 
someone shouldve invented this sooner 1 
at least think to refill my water before i struggle to wave you over for 10 minutes 0 
im pleased 1 
also the story and acting were weak 0 
customer service was terrible 0 
con spotty service 0 
i really enjoyed eating here 1 
prosgood camera very nice pictures also has cool styles like black and white and more 1 
this product is great it makes working a lot easier i can go to the copier while waiting on hold for something 1 
2 thumbs up 1 
there was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters 0 
del taco is pretty nasty and should be avoided if possible 0 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
no shifting no bubbling no peeling not even a scratch nothingi couldnt be more happier with my new one for the droid 1 
im not sure how long we stood there but it was long enough for me to begin to feel awkwardly out of place 0 
the menu had so much good stuff on it i could not decide 1 
when achille and philippa beautifully sing a duet from don giovanni that perfectly describes their situation in the movie you appreciate the subtle layers of this excellent film 1 
about ten minutes into this film i started having second thoughts 0 
but the actingeven that of such professionals as drago and debbie rochonwas terrible the directing worse perhaps contributory to the former the dialog chimplike and the camera work barely tolerable 0 
on three different occasions i asked for well done or medium well and all three times i got the bloodiest piece of meat on my plate 0 
but this movie really got to me 1 
the only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port irda 0 
best fish ive ever had in my life 1 
this particular model would not work with my motorola q smartphone 0 
i literally vomited while watching this film 0 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
as many people complained i found this headsets microphone was very weak 0 
great product 1 
the sound quality for the device is unacceptableunless you are in a really quiet area you almost hear nothing 0 
the descriptions said yum yum sauce and another said eel sauce yet another said spicy mayowell none of the rolls had sauces on them 0 
the price is reasonable and the service is great 1 
waste your money on this game 1 
very displeased 0 
this is a stunning movie 1 
i think i was one of the people who found this another one of roths pearls 1 
not what i wanted 0 
i dont think ill be running back to carlys anytime soon for food 0 
better than expected 1 
very good lunch spot 1 
the only very disappointing thing was there was no speakerphone 0 
i seriously cannot believe that the owner has so many unexperienced employees that all are running around like chickens with their heads cut off 0 
that said our mouths and bellies were still quite pleased 1 
its pure brilliance 1 
problem is that the ear loops are made of weak material and break easily 0 
i was amazed at the quick arrival of the two original lg cell phone batteries and and at a fraction of the price 1 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
does not work for listening to music with the cingular 8125 0 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
i ate there twice on my last visit and especially enjoyed the salmon salad 1 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
total waste of time 0 
nothing special 0 
great pocket pc phone combination 1 
total waste of time 0 
what on earth is irons doing in this film 0 
this one is simply a disappointment 0 
i rather enjoyed it 1 
i would definitely recommend the jabra bt250v for those who are looking for comfort clarity and a great price 1 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
one thing i hate is the mode set button at the side 0 
the only suspense i was feeling was the frustration at just how retarded the girls were 0 
they were goldencrispy and delicious 1 
very cheap plastic creaks like an old wooden floor 0 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
i wish i could enter negative values admins 0 
it was so boring 0 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
he surely doesnt know how to make a coherent action movie from the screenwriter of air force one who was only obliged to write the script just for a big sum of money 0 
it crackles with an unpredictable youthful energy but honestly i found it hard to follow and concentrate on it meanders so badly 0 
this is one of the better buffets that i have been to 1 
1010 1 
plus its only 8 bucks 1 
looks great and is strong 1 
overall i wasnt very impressed with noca 0 
arrived quickly and much less expensive than others being sold 1 
fantastic earphones 1 
another note about this phones appearance is that it really looks rather bland especially in the all black model 0 
i will never forget it now 1 
this was a poor remake of my best friends wedding 0 
the kids are annoying 0 
dessert panna cotta was amazing 1 
which is precisely why i am giving it such a bad review 0 
have been going since 2007 and every meal has been awesome 1 
perhaps my phone is defective but people cannot hear me when i use this 0 
the directing and the cinematography arent quite as good 0 
gotta love those closeups of slimy drooling teeth 1 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
as i said abovepretty useless 0 
i could care less the interior is just beautiful 1 
crust is not good 0 
this was like the final blow 0 
add betty white and jean smart and you have a great cast everyone played their parts really well 1 
this place is amazing 1 
highly recommended 1 
if you are reading this please dont go there 0 
whatever prompted such a documentary is beyond me 0 
started watching this but didnt believe in any of the characters 0 
the scripting of the subtle comedy is unmatched by any movie in recent years 1 
the potato chip order was sad i could probably count how many chips were in that box and it was probably around 12 0 
there was hardly any meat 0 
i have tried these cables with my computer and my ipod and it works just fine 1 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
so good i am going to have to review this place twice once hereas a tribute to the place and once as a tribute to an event held here last night 1 
lovely little thriller from hitchcock with lots of nice shenanigans surrounding a murdered spy a kidnapped child a nasty church a foreign plot and some random taxidermists 1 
this product is clearly not ready for prime time i dont care how cool it looks if you cant tell a call is coming in its worthless 0 
terrible product and waste of money 0 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
awesome selection of beer 1 
we made the drive all the way from north scottsdale and i was not one bit disappointed 1 
makes it easier to keep up with my bluetooth when im not wearing it 0 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
a great touch 1 
editing the editing of this film was phenomenal in my opinion 1 
you also cannot take pictures with it in the case because the lense is covered 0 
i will be back many times soon 1 
ordered a double cheeseburger got a single patty that was falling apart picture uploaded yeah still sucks 0 
they never brought a salad we asked for 0 
best service and food ever maria our server was so good and friendly she made our day 1 
dont make the same mistake i did 0 
you also cannot take pictures with it in the case because the lense is covered 0 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
the buffet at bellagio was far from what i anticipated 0 
i love their fries and their beans 1 
see it with your kids if you have a chanceit will open up some amazing dialog about how far race relations have come in the last 50 years 1 
the potatoes were great and so was the biscuit 1 
definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly will return next time im in vegas 1 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
you get extra minutes so that you can carry out the call and not get cut off 1 
excellent starter wireless headset 0 
i think i was one of the people who found this another one of roths pearls 1 
great charger 1 
at around 4 pm i bought it at around 8pm i started to watch at around 815pm i fast forwarded the remaining film to see if there was anything left watchable for a human being with a brain but there wasnt 0 
i love this cable it allows me to connect any miniusb device to my pc 1 
there is no plot or storyline 0 
it crackles with an unpredictable youthful energy but honestly i found it hard to follow and concentrate on it meanders so badly 0 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
not easy to watch 0 
dont buy it 0 
in a word it is embarrassing 0 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
yes i am simplifying things here for the sake of brevity for this really is at the core of the problems with this film it has too much going on without any real fulfilling explanation 0 
good food good service 1 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
took an hour to get our food only 4 tables in restaurant my food was luke warm our sever was running around like he was totally overwhelmed 0 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
in a word it is embarrassing 0 
highly recommend for any one who has a blue tooth phone 1 
i was very excited to get this headset because i thought it was really cute 1 
very good stuff for the price 1 
very bad experience 0 
this is so embarassing and also my ears hurt if i try to push the ear plug into my ear 0 
avoid at all cost 0 
the only downside is the service 0 
very comfortable 1 
if you have not seen this movie i definitely recommend it 1 
also the fries are without a doubt the worst fries ive ever had 0 
i really hope the team behind this movie makes more movies and that they will continue to do so in their own some kinda weird style 1 
it has been a winner for us 1 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
the tracfonewebsite is user friendly and makes it easy toactivate etc 1 
the 12 mega pixel camera being a part of a phone is reasonably good7 1 
works great 1 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
i had absolutely no problem with this headset linking to my 8530 blackberry curve 1 
then scene where they debated whether or not to sack the trumpeter who falsely was accused for the murder is pure horror really stupid 0 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
the cast of veteran actors are more than just a nostalgia trip 1 
food was below average 0 
imdb ratings only go as low 1 for awful its time to get some negative numbers in there for cases such as these 0 
ample portions and good prices 1 
this short film certainly pulls no punches 0 
highquality chicken on the chicken caesar salad 1 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
its a great item 1 
it makes very strange ticking noises before it ends the call 0 
the building itself seems pretty neat the bathroom is pretty trippy but i wouldnt eat here again 0 
its one of the movies i need to see whenever it comes on tvnever mind the fact that i already have it memorized 1 
took an hour to get our food only 4 tables in restaurant my food was luke warm our sever was running around like he was totally overwhelmed 0 
thats how id describe this painfully dreary timewaster of a film 0 
my sister has one also and she loves it 1 
good prices 1 
now imagine that every single one of those decisions was made wrong 0 
i received it quickly and it works great 1 
this is a stunning movie 1 
the volume for the ringer is real good you have choices how loud 1 
i highly recommend this movie for anyone interested in art poetry theater politics or japanese history 1 
obviously they have a terrible customer service so you get what you pay for 0 
reaching for the bottom row is uncomfortable and the send and end keys are not where i expect them to be3 0 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
2 thumbs up 1 
she carries the movie well 1 
so i basically threw my money out the window for nothing 0 
i like armand assante my cable companys summary sounded interesting so i watched it twice already and probably will again 1 
it is cheap and it feel and look just as cheap 0 
star trek v the final frontier is the worst in the series 0 
the food was great as always compliments to the chef 1 
the manager was the worst 0 
its a great item 1 
very pleased with this headset 1 
the best part about nurse betty is its unpredictability 1 
crostini that came with the salad was stale 0 
small sleek impressive looking practical setup with ample storage in place 1 
delete this film from your mind 0 
the hockey scenes are terrible defensemen playing like theyre 5 years old goalies diving at shots that are 10 feet wide of the net etc 0 
then a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use 0 
great phone 1 
it didnt charge for me 0 
it was either too cold not enough flavor or just bad 0 
rating 1 out of 10 0 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
no shifting no bubbling no peeling not even a scratch nothingi couldnt be more happier with my new one for the droid 1 
dee snider just plain sucks 0 
i live in the neighborhood so i am disappointed i wont be back here because it is a convenient location 0 
the whole experience was underwhelming and i think well just go to ninja sushi next time 0 
the foreigner is not worth one second of your time 0 
ive seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie 0 
the eargels channel the sound directly into your ear and seem to increase the sound volume and clarity 1 
food was really boring 0 
this place is horrible and way overpriced 0 
raw and sublimely moving 1 
he came running after us when he realized my husband had left his sunglasses on the table 1 
my boyfriend tried the mediterranean chicken salad and fell in love 1 
very windresistant 1 
there was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters 0 
all in all a great disappointment 0 
it looked like a wonderful story 1 
it only recognizes the phone as its storage device 0 
the only thing i did like was the prime rib and dessert section 1 
it has everything i need and i couldnt ask for more 1 
i recommend this for everyone who loves film movies anythinga work of art 1 
crash is a depressing little nothing that provokes emotion but teaches you nothing if you already know racism and prejudice are bad things 0 
the secondary plot line is incomprehensible and its relation to the primary plot line is mystifying 0 
o my gosh the best phone i have ever had 1 
he was terrible 0 
restaurant is always full but never a wait 1 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
bad quality 0 
the performances are real and gripping the crocdodile is extremely well done indeed if the black water website is to be believed thats because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous 1 
this movie contained an allstar cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i havent seen before 1 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
the secondary plot line is incomprehensible and its relation to the primary plot line is mystifying 0 
thank you for such great service 1 
i checked everywhere and there is no feature for it which is really disappointing 0 
chinese forgeries abound 0 
ive also had problems with the phone reading the memory card in which i always turn it on and then off again 0 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
this is probably the most irritating show i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
everything is appalling 0 
ordered an appetizer and took 40 minutes and then the pizza another 10 minutes 0 
they have been around for years and carries the highest quality of antiglare screen protector that i have found to date 1 
i have been to very few places to eat that under no circumstances would i ever return to and this tops the list 0 
its one of the movies i need to see whenever it comes on tvnever mind the fact that i already have it memorized 1 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
what this film lacks is a convincing script 0 
better than expected 1 
long whiny and pointless 0 
this was such an awesome movie that i bought it off of ebay 1 
i saw this short film on hbo the other day and absolutely loved it 1 
pretty piece of junk 0 
horrible phone 0 
the 12 mega pixel camera being a part of a phone is reasonably good7 1 
to sum the film up breeders is a terrible cheaply made horror movie that should be avoided like the ebola virus 0 
the things that the four kids get themselves into is absolutely hilarious to watch 1 
so dont go there if you are looking for good food 0 
both of them were truly unbelievably good and i am so glad we went back 1 
their rotating beers on tap is also a highlight of this place 1 
so i basically threw my money out the window for nothing 0 
i had to wait over 30 minutes to get my drink and longer to get 2 arepas 0 
what a big waste of time 0 
works great 1 
i had the chicken pho and it tasted very bland 0 
why are these sad little vegetables so overcooked 0 
talk about useless customer service 0 
in short dont bother with this movie 0 
i really do recommend this place you can go wrong with this donut place 1 
i took back my money and got outta there 0 
this place receives stars for their appetizers 1 
it was so bad i had lost the heart to finish it 0 
the manager was the worst 0 
really bad 0 
service is quick and friendly 1 
cumbersome design 0 
i contacted the company and they told me that although the unit was still under warranty if i couldnt produce my receipt i was out of luck 0 
like the other reviewer said you couldnt pay me to eat at this place again 0 
when achille and philippa beautifully sing a duet from don giovanni that perfectly describes their situation in the movie you appreciate the subtle layers of this excellent film 1 
i dont think ill be running back to carlys anytime soon for food 0 
must have been an off night at this place 0 
food was good service was good prices were good 1 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
i was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar not only because the quality is great but the service is fast and the food impeccable 1 
battery is terrible 0 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
the film is well paced understated and one of the best courtroom documentaries ive seen 1 
the secondary plot line is incomprehensible and its relation to the primary plot line is mystifying 0 
their onscreen chemistry critical to the entire film is genuine 1 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
all in all id expected a better consumer experience from motorola 0 
ill be looking for a new earpiece 0 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
we started with the tuna sashimi which was brownish in color and obviously wasnt fresh 0 
disappointed with battery 0 
it felt too light and tinny 0 
excellent performance 1 
crisp and clear 1 
it fits my ear well and is comfortable on 1 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
this is some seriously good pizza and im an expertconnisseur on the topic 1 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
dessert panna cotta was amazing 1 
the food is rich so order accordingly 1 
battery life is also great 1 
server did a great job handling our large rowdy table 1 
worst foodservice ive had in a while 0 
the interplay between martin and emilio contains the same wonderful chemistry we saw in wall street with martin and charlie 1 
bland and flavorless is a good way of describing the barely tepid meat 0 
now the pizza itself was good the peanut sauce was very tasty 1 
id advise anyone to go and see it 1 
an extensive menu provides lots of options for breakfast 1 
the spaghetti is nothing special whatsoever 0 
also the area where my unit broke im not too fond of the magnetic strap 0 
the movie is terribly boring in places 0 
i think i was one of the people who found this another one of roths pearls 1 
the range is very decent ive been able to roam around my house with the phone in the living room with no receptionsound quality issues 1 
the film has great actors a master director a significant themeat least a wouldbe significant theme undertone of fifties existential worldweariness aerial scenes that ought to have thrilled both senses and imagination and characters about which one might deeply care 1 
we wont be going back 0 
waitress was good though 1 
if it was to turn my good day feeling into a night of disturbing memories than i guess he succeeded 0 
easy to use 1 
worst ever 0 
this item is great installed it let it charged up overnite and it has been working good every since with no problems 1 
director paul matthews who also wrotedirected the weak 1995 monster movie grim clearly doesnt know how to pace his films 0 
the cashier had no care what so ever on what i had to say it still ended up being wayyy overpriced 0 
awesome device 1 
the holster that arrived did not match the photo in the ad 0 
the sweet potato tots were good but the onion rings were perfection or as close as i have had 1 
the grilled chicken was so tender and yellow from the saffron seasoning 1 
it was so boring 0 
i ended up sliding it on the edge of my pants or back pockets instead 1 
also the phone doesnt seem to accept anything except cbr mp3s preferably ripped by windows media player 0 
saggy floppy piece of junk 0 
lewis blacks considerable talent is wasted here too as he is at his most incendiary when he is unrestrained which the pg13 rating certainly wont allow 0 
not much dialogue not much music the whole film was shot as elaborately and aesthetically like a sculpture 1 
extremely tasty 1 
you cant relate with them hell you barely can understand them 0 
there was a warm feeling with the service and i felt like their guest for a special treat 1 
im still infatuated with this phone 1 
service was fantastic 1 
i would highly recommend this 1 
i was totally fascinated by the music the dancing everything 1 
their steaks are 100 recommended 1 
the football scenes at the end were perplexing 0 
seems like a good quick place to grab a bite of some familiar pub food but do yourself a favor and look elsewhere 0 
this is a great deal 1 
i will be back many times soon 1 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
god and i can never get that 90 minutes back 0 
helen baxendale is a very credible lady macbeth who can be very cheerfull at times and sometimes she just looks like a naughty girl but deadly in her taste for blood and evil 1 
if you are razr owneryou must have this 1 
i never walked out of a movie faster 0 
this was utterly confusing at first which caused me to lose a couple of very very important contacts 0 
its pure brilliance 1 
very good though 1 
works great 1 
also if your phone is dropped this case is not going to save it specially when dropped face down 0 
avoid this establishment 0 
the staff was very attentive 1 
worked perfectly 1 
never got it 0 
i am so pleased to know such a modern day genius is out there letting is passion for art drive him and taking us as an audience with him 1 
i just dont know how this place managed to served the blandest food i have ever eaten when they are preparing indian cuisine 0 
this is high adventure at its best 1 
when it opens the battery connection is broken and the device is turned off 0 
the aerial scenes were welldone 1 
seriously flavorful delights folks 1 
a happy wonderful feel good ending 1 
not much flavor to them and very poorly constructed 0 
a great touch 1 
great food and service huge portions and they give a military discount 1 
aailiyah was pretty good as akasha in places compelling her first entrance and mini dance scene 1 
if only someone involved with it knew how to string together narrative 0 
dont buy this product 0 
my husband and i ate lunch here and were very disappointed with the food and service 0 
the structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema 1 
im glad i found this product on amazon it is hard to find it wasnt high priced 1 
the most annoying thing about cover girl is the way in which rita hayworth is put up on a pedestal 0 
it was a waste of my money 0 
ive had no trouble accessing the internet downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions 1 
i had a pretty satifying experience 1 
plug was the wrong size 0 
just what i wanted 1 
i have to mention this and it is a huge spoiler i loved the ending how all the characters of the three films were the remaining survivors of the ferry disaster with valentine and the young judge together and the old man watching it on her tv solidifying his happiness over the suffering which he dealt with for those many years 1 
everything about this product is wrongfirst 0 
go watch it 1 
excellent starter wireless headset 0 
john wayne did an incredible job for being so young in the movie industry 1 
during several different 2 minute calls i experienced 5 drops and it was in an area that had 5 bars 0 
service stinks here 0 
this place is not worth your time let alone vegas 0 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
i had about two bites and refused to eat anymore 0 
i love the ringtones because they are so upbeat 1 
do not buy do not buyit sucks 0 
they brought a fresh batch of fries and i was thinking yay something warm but no 0 
went in for happy hour great list of wines 1 
in summary this was a largely disappointing dining experience 0 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
yeah the movie pretty much sucked 0 
dont waste your money 0 
i know this is not like the other restaurants at all something is very off here 0 
the last 15 minutes of movie are also not bad as well 1 
probably not in a hurry to go back 0 
the plot was the same as pretty much every other cheap horror 0 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
if you are razr owneryou must have this 1 
i swung in to give them a try but was deeply disappointed 0 
the igo chargers and tips are really great 1 
food was so gooodd 1 
amazon sucks 0 
after arguing with verizon regarding the dropped calls we returned the phones after two days 0 
both do good jobs and are quite amusing 1 
unfortunately any virtue in this films production work was lost on a regrettable script 0 
each track commands sentiment actually contributing to the scenes and characters 1 
about ten minutes into this film i started having second thoughts 0 
we were promptly greeted and seated 1 
the only possible way this movie could be redeemed would be as mst3k fodder 0 
love the margaritas too 1 
he is an amazing film artist one of the most important whoever lived 1 
the directing seems too pretentious 0 
very disappointing 0 
be sure to order dessert even if you need to pack it togo the tiramisu and cannoli are both to die for 1 
everything about it is fine and reasonable for the price ie 1 
the sides are delish mixed mushrooms yukon gold puree white corn beateous 1 
and it was way to expensive 0 
rude inconsiderate management 0 
it also took her forever to bring us the check when we asked for it 0 
back to good bbq lighter fare reasonable pricing and tell the public they are back to the old ways 1 
service is friendly and inviting 1 
often the dialogue doesnt really follow from one line to another or fit the surroundings 0 
its a piece of crap 0 
the color is even prettier than i thought it would be and the graphics are incredibly sharp 1 
the food is good 1 
for the price on amazon it is an excellent product which i would highly recommend 1 
if you love authentic mexican food and want a whole bunch of interesting yet delicious meats to choose from you need to try this place 1 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
echo problemvery unsatisfactory 0 
at first i thought i was grtting a good deal at 744 until i plugged it into my phone v3c razr 0 
the goat taco didnt skimp on the meat and wow what flavor 1 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
really pleased with this product so far 1 
everything about this movie is stupid 0 
editing the editing of this film was phenomenal in my opinion 1 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
the plot such as it is is so derivative and predictable that the ending is like a mercy killing 0 
someone shouldve invented this sooner 1 
i would avoid this place if you are staying in the mirage 0 
i advise you to look out for it 1 
do not make the same mistake as me 0 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
reasonably priced also 1 
the food was great as always compliments to the chef 1 
then i exchanged for the same phone even that had the same problem 0 
the phone crashed completely and now i have to get it replaced 0 
basically the service was very bad 0 
the jabra eargels fit my ears very well 1 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
the cast of veteran actors are more than just a nostalgia trip 1 
but when someone strives for greatness and poetry but delivers a muddled and often ridiculous story a bunch of disparate scenes pretentious dialogue then you get the worst kind of a movie that some other reviewer very accurately defined as pretentious crap 0 
using all earpieces left or right this thing will not stay on my ear 0 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
it has everything i need and i couldnt ask for more 1 
i received my orders well within the shipping timeframe everything was in good working order and overall i am very excited to have this source 1 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
it was attached to a gas station and that is rarely a good sign 0 
what a waste 0 
of course the acting is blah 0 
has been working great 1 
cant say enough good things about this place 1 
this was a poor remake of my best friends wedding 0 
dee snider just plain sucks 0 
the headsets are easy to use and everyone loves them 1 
the performances are real and gripping the crocdodile is extremely well done indeed if the black water website is to be believed thats because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous 1 
i think not again 0 
after trying many many handsfree gadgets this is the one that finally works well 1 
i find wasting food to be despicable but this just wasnt food 0 
this is definitely a cult classic well worth viewing and sharing with others 1 
this movie is so awesome 1 
itll be a regular stop on my trips to phoenix 1 
i dont have very many words to say about this place but it does everything pretty well 1 
speaking of the music it is unbearably predictably and kitchy 0 
the phone is sturdy and waterproof 1 
i would not recommend this place 0 
there was no chemistry between ben affleck and sandra bullock in this film and i couldnt understand why he would consider even leaving his wifetobe for this chick that he supposedly was knocked out by 0 
this isnt a small family restaurant this is a fine dining establishment 1 
i would give this television series a 10 plus if i could 1 
i was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar not only because the quality is great but the service is fast and the food impeccable 1 
having to humour him just to get by and get through the day was so apt 1 
and finally after all that we get to an ending that wouldve been great had it been handled by competent people and not jerry falwell 0 
to be honest with you this is unbelievable nonsense and very foolish 0 
the characters are interesting and you want to find out more about them the longer the movie goes on and i think people will be surprised by who does and doesnt make it 1 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
the success of the film depends on the casting of sydney greenstreet as the alexander yardley character 1 
regrettably the film fails 0 
lasted one day and then blew up 0 
the only suspense i was feeling was the frustration at just how retarded the girls were 0 
the buffet at bellagio was far from what i anticipated 0 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
but the actingeven that of such professionals as drago and debbie rochonwas terrible the directing worse perhaps contributory to the former the dialog chimplike and the camera work barely tolerable 0 
i do not know if this was emilio estevezs directorial debut but the pacing the interplay and development of the characters as well as some clever camera work surrounding the character estevez plays all suggest a natural eye 1 
not impressed 0 
excellent short film 1 
the ear buds only play music in one ear 0 
the crêpe was delicate and thin and moist 1 
it was a huge awkward 15lb piece of cow that was 34ths gristle and fat 0 
it felt too light and tinny 0 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
if i take a picture the battery drops a bar and starts beeping letting me know its dieing 0 
this is a stunning movie 1 
the battery is completely useless to me 0 
product is exactly as described 1 
both of the egg rolls were fantastic 1 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
he was terrible 0 
extremely tasty 1 
i wear it everyday and it holds up very well 1 
the pan cakes everyone are raving about taste like a sugary disaster tailored to the palate of a six year old 0 
the only suspense i was feeling was the frustration at just how retarded the girls were 0 
piece of junk 0 
seafood was limited to boiled shrimp and crab legs but the crab legs definitely did not taste fresh 0 
for the price this was a great deal 1 
i ate there twice on my last visit and especially enjoyed the salmon salad 1 
the performances are real and gripping the crocdodile is extremely well done indeed if the black water website is to be believed thats because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous 1 
the warm beer didnt help 0 
frozen pucks of disgust with some of the worst people behind the register 0 
the soundtrack sucked 0 
soyo technology sucks 0 
treo and tmobile refused to replace it again and forced me to buy another phone without any kind of upgrade discount 0 
i believe the screenwriter did a good job of tying up the loose ends 1 
nice leather 1 
i love the look and feel of samsung flipphones 1 
the cast is always entertaining as usual 1 
i love being able to use one headset for both by landline and cell 1 
the first time i ever came here i had an amazing experience i still tell people how awesome the duck was 1 
the bt headset was such a disapoinment 0 
total waste of time 0 
worth every penny 1 
the mic is great 1 
as a courtroom drama its compelling as an indictment on the american justice system its frightening 1 
this is a good joint 1 
director paul matthews who also wrotedirected the weak 1995 monster movie grim clearly doesnt know how to pace his films 0 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
ive owned this phone for 7 months now and can say that its the best mobile phone ive had 1 
the performances are not improved by improvisation because the actors now have twice as much to worry about not only whether theyre delivering the line well but whether the line itself is any good 0 
overall i was not impressed and would not go back 0 
its so stupid to have to keep buying new chargers car chargers cradles headphones and car kits every time a new phone comes out 0 
the aerial scenes were welldone 1 
the only good thing was that it fits comfortably on small ears 1 
the battery is unreliable as well as the service use antena 0 
the manager was the worst 0 
this is the place where i first had pho and it was amazing 1 
everything was gross 0 
i really liked that 1 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
the nachos are a must have 1 
to summarize the food was incredible nay transcendant but nothing brings me joy quite like the memory of the pneumatic condiment dispenser 1 
the service here leaves a lot to be desired 0 
much more interesting more action more suspense and less of the unneeded controversy 1 
this phone might well be the worst ive ever had in any brand 0 
the directing seems too pretentious 0 
how stupid is that 0 
the text messaging feature is really tricky to use 0 
great time family dinner on a sunday night 1 
the movie was so boring that i sometimes found myself occupied peaking in the paper instead of watching never happened during a columbo movie before 0 
the feel of the dining room was more college cooking course than high class dining and the service was slow at best 0 
i think it was robert ryans best film because he portrayed someone like my father and he was a schizophrenic in real lifemy father although he never murdered anyone but was affected more so during the second world war which made him worse 1 
i especially liked the noncliche choices with the parents in other movies i could predict the dialog verbatim but the writing in this movie made better selections 1 
worthwhile 1 
just as good as when i had it more than a year ago 1 
works like a charm it work the same as the one i got with the phone 1 
this is was due to the fact that it took 20 minutes to be acknowledged then another 35 minutes to get our foodand they kept forgetting things 0 
tried to go here for lunch and it was a madhouse 0 
he also came back to check on us regularly excellent service 1 
there still are good actors around 1 
its extremely slow and takes forever to do anything with it 0 
the only downside is the service 0 
one more thing i can tolerate political incorrectness very well im all for artistic freedom and suspension of disbelief but the slavic female character was just too much 0 
brilliance indeed 1 
i dont have to be an accountant to know im getting screwed 0 
i highly recommend these and encourage people to give them a try 1 
service is perfect and the family atmosphere is nice to see 1 
very very disappointed ordered the 35 big bay plater 0 
not good enough for the price 0 
the only thing really worth watching was the scenery and the house because it is beautiful 1 
we sat another ten minutes and finally gave up and left 0 
this movie is a good and humorous comment on life in 2006 1 
works good 1 
the interplay between martin and emilio contains the same wonderful chemistry we saw in wall street with martin and charlie 1 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
the servers are not pleasant to deal with and they dont always honor pizza hut coupons 0 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
all of the tapas dishes were delicious 1 
a very good film indeed about great and unconditional love 1 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
the earpiece on this is too large or too heavyit keeps falling out of my ear 0 
the fact is this film is a wonderful heartwarming tale about two people chasing their dreams 1 
so just beware 0 
an extensive menu provides lots of options for breakfast 1 
its also great to see that renowned silent screenwriter frances marion hasnt missed a step going from silent to sound 1 
phone falls out easily 0 
however i needed some better instructions 0 
i know this is not like the other restaurants at all something is very off here 0 
generous portions and great taste 1 
okay i like to consider myself a fair critic so ill give credit where credits duethe creature effects were actually pretty cool 1 
highly unprofessional and rude to a loyal patron 0 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
once your food arrives its meh 0 
the chains which im no fan of beat this place easily 0 
it was pretty gross 0 
i understand that its supposed to be a cheap popcorn comedy but that doesnt mean that it has to completely insult our intelligence and have writing so incredibly hackneyed that it borders on offensive 0 
main thing i didnt enjoy is that the crowd is of older crowd around mid 30s and up 0 
i think this restaurant suffers from not trying hard enough 0 
awesome service and food 1 
only like 3 or 4 buildings used a couple of locations maybe poor hummh 0 
only pros large seating area nice bar area great simple drink menu the best brick oven pizza with homemade dough 1 
easily none other cartoon made me laugh in a tender way before getting into dark sitcoms oriented for teenagers 1 
i cant believe theres even a sequel to this 0 
lots of holes in the script 0 
a week later after i activated it it suddenly died 0 
the salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop which was perfectly cooked 1 
awesome device 1 
great place to eat reminds me of the little mom and pop shops in the san francisco bay area 1 
we waited for thirty minutes to be seated although there were 8 vacant tables and we were the only folks waiting 0 
go watch it 1 
i would highly recommend this product 1 
we arent ones to make a scene at restaurants but i just dont get itdefinitely lost the love after this one 0 
you will leave the theater wanting to go out and dance under the stars 1 
it was an inexpensive piece but i would still have expected better quality 0 
love this product 1 
im so sorry but i really cant recommend it to anyone 0 
hard to judge whether these sides were good because we were grossed out by the melted styrofoam and didnt want to eat it for fear of getting sick 0 
to be honest with you this is unbelievable nonsense and very foolish 0 
we would recommend these to others 1 
initially the local sites in the film which was filmed here in buffalo intrigued me 1 
some may say this buffet is pricey but i think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot 1 
conclusion i loved it 1 
it is a joy to use 1 
i had absolutely no problem with this headset linking to my 8530 blackberry curve 1 
very funny 1 
camerawork again bad 0 
totally different with loads of understatement and black comedy this is a film few get to see but those who do will remember it 1 
not a good bargain 0 
my headset works just peachykeen 1 
i had the mac salad and it was pretty bland so i will not be getting that again 0 
this movie is also revealing 1 
not recommended 0 
the service was poor and thats being nice 0 
the seasonal fruit was fresh white peach puree 1 
kris kristoffersen is good in this movie and really makes a difference 1 
the owners really really need to quit being soooooo cheap let them wrap my freaking sandwich in two papers not one 0 
it wasnt busy either also the building was freezing cold 0 
the ambiance was incredible 1 
nothing special 0 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
makes it easier to keep up with my bluetooth when im not wearing it 0 
there is nothing privileged about workingeating there 0 
same evening him and i are both drastically sick 0 
owners are really great people 1 
i knew when i saw the film that more great things were to come from this gifted actor 1 
now imagine that every single one of those decisions was made wrong 0 
food was really boring 0 
same evening him and i are both drastically sick 0 
unfortunately it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees 0 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
love this place hits the spot when i want something healthy but not lacking in quantity or flavor 1 
i vomited in the bathroom mid lunch 0 
they work about 2 weeks then break 0 
really good product 1 
by far the best cheesecurds we have ever had 1 
it was an inexpensive piece but i would still have expected better quality 0 
nice leather 1 
i dont know what the big deal is about this place but i wont be back yaall 0 
both of the egg rolls were fantastic 1 
waitress was a little slow in service 0 
i love this place 1 
it is wonderful and inspiring to watch and i hope that it gets released again on to video or dvd 1 
waste your money on this game 1 
it was horrible 0 
there is no plot here to keep you going in the first place 0 
we ordered some old classics and some new dishes after going there a few times and were sorely disappointed with everything 0 
bad quality 0 
i have to mention this and it is a huge spoiler i loved the ending how all the characters of the three films were the remaining survivors of the ferry disaster with valentine and the young judge together and the old man watching it on her tv solidifying his happiness over the suffering which he dealt with for those many years 1 
after watching this film i wanted to learn more about the works of this artist 1 
considering the relations off screen between taylor and stanwyck it was surprising how little chemistry there was on screen between the two of them 0 
the building itself seems pretty neat the bathroom is pretty trippy but i wouldnt eat here again 0 
it is worth the drive 1 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
kind of hard to mess up a steak but they did 0 
top line dont waste your time and money on this one its as bad as it comes 0 
i also decided not to send it back because our waitress looked like she was on the verge of having a heart attack 0 
this is an unbelievable bargain 1 
the script is horrendously stupid 0 
the sound is clear and the people i talk to on it are amazed at the quality too 1 
there is no plot or storyline 0 
this place is horrible and way overpriced 0 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
the building itself seems pretty neat the bathroom is pretty trippy but i wouldnt eat here again 0 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
he deserves 5 stars 1 
the music in the film is really nice too 1 
reaching for the bottom row is uncomfortable and the send and end keys are not where i expect them to be3 0 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
i kept catching the cable on the seat and i had to pull the phone out to turn it on an off 0 
we received a white colored battery that goes dead after a couple hoursthe original used to last a week but still lasts longer than thereplacement 0 
the movie lacks visual interest drama expression of feeling and celebration of the very patriotism that underlines the narrative 0 
battery life is real good 1 
the two main characters may be two of the most believable children i ever saw put on screen 1 
incredible 1 
still its quite interesting and entertaining to follow 1 
her role was played well 1 
obviously they have a terrible customer service so you get what you pay for 0 
it has all the features i want 1 
im so happy to be here 1 
i own 2 of these cases and would order another 1 
this phone is pretty sturdy and ive never had any large problems with it 1 
both rickman and stowe play their roles to the hilt in this tale of a childrens book writer who maybe has written a subversive tract 1 
it is worth the drive 1 
worst foodservice ive had in a while 0 
the ear buds only play music in one ear 0 
filmiing was less expansive 0 
terrible product and waste of money 0 
awful service 0 
i wasted my little money with this earpiece 0 
the design is very odd as the ear clip is not very comfortable at all 0 
i love the ownerchef his one authentic japanese cool dude 1 
i immediately said i wanted to talk to the manager but i did not want to talk to the guy who was doing shots of fireball behind the bar 0 
filmiing was less expansive 0 
earbud piece breaks easily 0 
a must study for anyone interested in the worst sins of industrial design 0 
they never brought a salad we asked for 0 
this is by far the worst purchase ive made on amazon 0 
but i definitely would not eat here again 0 
worse theres an incredibly weak subplot thrown in that follows a little band of latterday mansonites as they go after a reporter whos working on a story on the anniversary of the killings 0 
it also took her forever to bring us the check when we asked for it 0 
considering the relations off screen between taylor and stanwyck it was surprising how little chemistry there was on screen between the two of them 0 
i particularly remember my senses being assaulted by strident cords of music that would blare out with very little warning and even less meaning 0 
this is simply the best bluetooth headset for sound quality 1 
for the price this was a great deal 1 
i dont know exactly what it is about this movie but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our familys memories 1 
i would have casted her in that role after ready the script 1 
oh yeah and the storyline was pathetic too 0 
nice docking station for home or work 1 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
highly recommend for any one who has a blue tooth phone 1 
we received a white colored battery that goes dead after a couple hoursthe original used to last a week but still lasts longer than thereplacement 0 
horrible had to switch 3 times 0 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
a piece of cinematic garbage captured on celluloid 0 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
ill even say it again  this is torture 0 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
all the characters in this film are tremendously well played 1 
very very disappointed ordered the 35 big bay plater 0 
there is no plot or storyline 0 
initially the local sites in the film which was filmed here in buffalo intrigued me 1 
i love this device 1 
excellent starter wireless headset 0 
i did not expect this to be so good 1 
i use this product in a motor control center where there is a lot of high voltage humming from the equipment and it works great 1 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
doesnt last long 0 
they have horrible attitudes towards customers and talk down to each one when customers dont enjoy their food 0 
very satisifed with that 1 
an amazing finale to possibly the best trilogy of all time 1 
the concert sequences just sucked 0 
i bought two of them and neither will charge 0 
what a disappointment 0 
this movie is a good and humorous comment on life in 2006 1 
i still maintain that monkeys shouldnt make headphones we just obviously dont share enough dna to copy the design over to humans 0 
it is super charged up for use as a small hybrid palmtopcameracellphone and excels in those roles 1 
this allows the possibility of double booking for the same date and time after the first 0 
when it opens the battery connection is broken and the device is turned off 0 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
good case excellent value 1 
if only someone involved with it knew how to string together narrative 0 
this movie is a good and humorous comment on life in 2006 1 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
it has everything i need and i couldnt ask for more 1 
and sometimes it was so embarrassing that i had to look away 0 
editing the editing of this film was phenomenal in my opinion 1 
one thing i hate is the mode set button at the side 0 
much less than the jawbone i was going to replace it with 1 
but it is great i would really recommend it 1 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
on the negative its insipid enough to cause regret for another 2 hours of life wasted in front of the screen 0 
i wasted my little money with this earpiece 0 
awsome device works great 1 
i would highly recommend this product 1 
really pleased with this product so far 1 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
drinks took close to 30 minutes to come out at one point 0 
attempting artiness with black white and clever camera angles the movie disappointed became even more ridiculous as the acting was poor and the plot and lines almost nonexistent 0 
20th century foxs road house 1948 is not only quite a silly noir but is an implausible unmitigated bore of a movie 0 
on the ground right next to our table was a large smeared beensteppedinandtrackedeverywhere pile of green bird poop 0 
things happen characters personalities change plot twists occur for no real reason other than that script calls for it 0 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
nargile i think you are great 1 
first off the reception sucks i have never had more than 2 bars ever 0 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
he surely doesnt know how to make a coherent action movie from the screenwriter of air force one who was only obliged to write the script just for a big sum of money 0 
chinese forgeries abound 0 
they have horrible attitudes towards customers and talk down to each one when customers dont enjoy their food 0 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
all in all a great disappointment 0 
the characters were all funny and had the peculiarity of not having a true lead character 1 
this is a chilly unremarkable movie about an author livingworking in a chilly abstruse culture 0 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
i paid the bill but did not tip because i felt the server did a terrible job 0 
the vanilla ice cream was creamy and smooth while the profiterole choux pastry was fresh enough 1 
food was really good and i got full petty fast 1 
from here on the widmark character turns unintentionally comical 0 
definitely will come back here again 1 
bad characters bad story and bad acting 0 
nicest chinese restaurant ive been in a while 1 
if you havent choked in your own vomit by the end by all the cheap drama and worthless dialogue youve must have bored yourself to death with this waste of time 0 
what is even more stupid is that who had thought an idea that there should be a volcano in los angeles 0 
in other words the content level of this film is enough to easily fill a dozen other films 1 
on a positive note our server was very attentive and provided great service 1 
not recommended 0 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
the meat was pretty dry i had the sliced brisket and pulled pork 0 
on the negative its insipid enough to cause regret for another 2 hours of life wasted in front of the screen 0 
it sure does beat the nachos at the movies but i would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant 0 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
works great when my cat attacked the phone he scratched the protective strip instead of destroying the screen 1 
its a feelgood film and thats how i felt when i came out of the cinema 1 
i would give this television series a 10 plus if i could 1 
i am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this 1 
piece of junk 0 
not tasty and the texture was just nasty 0 
its uncomfortable and the sound quality is quite poor compared with the phone razr or with my previous wired headset that plugged into an lg 0 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
audio quality is poor very poor 0 
the burger had absolutely no flavor the meat itself was totally bland the burger was overcooked and there was no charcoal flavor 0 
judith light is one of my favorite actresses and i think she does a superb job in this film 1 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
this is essentially a communications tool that does not communicate 0 
this is a great restaurant at the mandalay bay 1 
i really wanted the plantronics 510 to be the right one but it has too many issues for methe good 0 
this scene is very strong and unpleasant 0 
works great 1 
the kids are annoying 0 
here in the wind and the lion we see a wonderful rendering of americas own imperial age 1 
the movie in movie situations in the beginning and through the game that is played with her by the acting coach are fascinating 1 
so flavorful and has just the perfect amount of heat 1 
the acting was decidely wooden though no worse than a period universal b movie 0 
the ripped banana was not only ripped but petrified and tasteless 0 
it was that year however that reminded us that huston was still at the top of his game as evinced by his faithful adaptation of james joyces acclaimed novella the dead 1 
comfortable fit you need your headset to be comfortable for at least an hour at a time if not for an entire day 1 
does not work 0 
unfortunately we must have hit the bakery on leftover day because everything we ordered was stale 0 
excellent service 1 
the shipping time was also very quick 1 
i am so pleased to know such a modern day genius is out there letting is passion for art drive him and taking us as an audience with him 1 
20th century foxs road house 1948 is not only quite a silly noir but is an implausible unmitigated bore of a movie 0 
i was deeply impressed with the character he played 1 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
ordered burger rare came in well done 0 
the acting was bad the dialogs were extremely shallow and insincere 0 
this is a great deal 1 
ill be looking for a new earpiece 0 
the least said about the acting the better 0 
i am so tired of clichés that is just lazy writing and here they come in thick and fast 0 
first time there and might just be the last 0 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
i love the look and feel of samsung flipphones 1 
great phone 1 
ive had better not only from dedicated boba tea spots but even from jenni pho 0 
during several different 2 minute calls i experienced 5 drops and it was in an area that had 5 bars 0 
i dont recommend unless your car breaks down in front of it and you are starving 0 
dont bother go to the store 0 
the instruction manual is lacking 0 
its pretty surprising that this wonderful film was made in 1949 as hollywood generally had its collective heads in the sand concerning black and white issues at that time 1 
mic doesnt work 0 
i am far from a sushi connoisseur but i can definitely tell the difference between good food and bad food and this was certainly bad food 0 
im not sure how long we stood there but it was long enough for me to begin to feel awkwardly out of place 0 
this movie is terrible 0 
it has everything i need and i couldnt ask for more 1 
i loved it it was really scary 1 
the scenery that the two daughters paint and photograph are beautiful 1 
dont waste your time here 0 
nice headset priced right 1 
if you have not seen this movie i definitely recommend it 1 
this short film certainly pulls no punches 0 
plantronics bluetooth excelent buy 1 
this scene is very strong and unpleasant 0 
what on earth is irons doing in this film 0 
speaking of the music it is unbearably predictably and kitchy 0 
i have been very happy with the 510 and have had no complaints from any one regarding my sound quality on their end 1 
i bought this phone as a replacement for my startac and have regretted it since 0 
i paid too much 0 
i dont think it would hold it too securly on your belt 0 
this is a stunning movie 1 
i cant see how this movie can be an inspiration to anyone to come out or overcome fear and rejection 0 
could not get strong enough signal 0 
this frog phone charm is adorable and very eye catching 1 
i guess that nobody at the network that aired this dribble watched it before putting it on 0 
i got the car charger and not even after a week the charger was brokeni went to plug it in and it started smoking 0 
punishment park is a brilliant piece of cinema 1 
it was a pale color instead of nice and char and has no flavor 0 
voice recognition is tremendous 1 
after arguing with verizon regarding the dropped calls we returned the phones after two days 0 
painful on the ear 0 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
i didnt realize how wonderful the short really is until the last two scenes 1 
this place is disgusting 0 
it defeats the purpose of a bluetooth headset 0 
this place was such a nice surprise 1 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
similarly the delivery man did not say a word of apology when our food was 45 minutes late 0 
the restaurant atmosphere was exquisite 1 
delete this film from your mind 0 
they will customize your order any way youd like my usual is eggplant with green bean stir fry love it 1 
im very disappointed with my decision 0 
the feel of the dining room was more college cooking course than high class dining and the service was slow at best 0 
i love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it 1 
dont go here 0 
its not user friendly 0 
this movie is greatespecially if you enjoy visual arts 1 
the delivery was on time 1 
this isnt a small family restaurant this is a fine dining establishment 1 
this is probably the most irritating show i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
i dont think ill be running back to carlys anytime soon for food 0 
again lame 0 
the only very disappointing thing was there was no speakerphone 0 
mobile phone tools are a must have 1 
the potatoes were great and so was the biscuit 1 
you cant beat the price on these 1 
not tasty and the texture was just nasty 0 
i probably wont be coming back here 0 
if you want a real scare rent this one 1 
i wont be back 0 
there are many continuity errors one other user commented on different cars in the garage joes glassesthe one that got to me the most was the fact joes facial hair configuration seemed to change from scene to scene 0 
ordered burger rare came in well done 0 
plus it was wellpaced and suited its relatively short run time 1 
how can anyone in their right mind ask for anything more from a movie than this 1 
his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic 1 
this is definitely one of the better documentaries i have seen looking at family relationships and marriage 1 
the things that the four kids get themselves into is absolutely hilarious to watch 1 
pretty cool i would say 1 
steer clear of this product and go with the genuine palm replacementr pens which come in a threepack 0 
okay i like to consider myself a fair critic so ill give credit where credits duethe creature effects were actually pretty cool 1 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
its one of the movies i need to see whenever it comes on tvnever mind the fact that i already have it memorized 1 
have been going since 2007 and every meal has been awesome 1 
this device is great in several situations1 1 
bad day or not i have a very low tolerance for rude customer service people it is your job to be nice and polite wash dishes otherwise 0 
seriously killer hot chai latte 1 
now the pizza itself was good the peanut sauce was very tasty 1 
it didnt charge for me 0 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
portable and it works 1 
eew this location needs a complete overhaul 0 
good show samsung 1 
this is definitely a cult classic well worth viewing and sharing with others 1 
works great 1 
it lasts less than 3o minutes if i actually try to use the phonemy wife has the same phone with the same problem 0 
also if your phone is dropped this case is not going to save it specially when dropped face down 0 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
i dont know what the big deal is about this place but i wont be back yaall 0 
nice quality build unlike some cheap s out there 1 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
service is quick and even to go orders are just like we like it 1 
the sound quality is excellent as well 1 
service stinks here 0 
the sound quality is good and functionality is awesome 1 
i am so pleased to know such a modern day genius is out there letting is passion for art drive him and taking us as an audience with him 1 
one nice thing was that they added gratuity on the bill since our party was larger than 6 or 8 and they didnt expect more tip than that 1 
i love this phone 1 
disapointing results 0 
how can that bethe audio quality is poor 0 
i dont have very many words to say about this place but it does everything pretty well 1 
all the actors give a wonderful performance especially jennifer rubin as jamie harris who changes from the nervous starlet in the beginning through the strange events she is part of to the cool star 1 
people couldnt hear me talk and i had to pull out the earphone and talk on the phone 0 
the plot was the same as pretty much every other cheap horror 0 
soyo technology sucks 0 
the movie has almost no action scenes in it and very little comedy 0 
this is a great phone 1 
woa talk about awful 0 
performed awful muffled tinny incoming sound and severe echo for those on the other end of the call 0 
i hope this place sticks around 1 
in addition it feels amp looks as if the phone is all lightweight cheap plastic 0 
its a case of so bad it is laughable 0 
food was really boring 0 
the burger i got the gold standard a 17 burger and was kind of disappointed 0 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
but it is great i would really recommend it 1 
fantastic service here 1 
but it does get better reception and clarity than any phone ive had before 1 
i really enjoyed eating here 1 
i would highly recommend this 1 
i tried the cape cod ravoli chickenwith cranberrymmmm 1 
comfortable fit you need your headset to be comfortable for at least an hour at a time if not for an entire day 1 
excellent short film 1 
your brain will attempt to shutdown as part of a primal impulse of selfpreservation 0 
you cant beat the price on these 1 
avoid at all costs 0 
loved the casting of jimmy buffet as the science teacher 1 
but the actingeven that of such professionals as drago and debbie rochonwas terrible the directing worse perhaps contributory to the former the dialog chimplike and the camera work barely tolerable 0 
people who like european films and art movies will like this movie 1 
the block was amazing 1 
the movie is full of wonderful dancing hence the title 1 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
on the negative its insipid enough to cause regret for another 2 hours of life wasted in front of the screen 0 
poor product 0 
im using it with an iriver spinn with case and it fits fine 1 
dont waste your time 0 
great time family dinner on a sunday night 1 
the flat reenactments dont hold your attention because they are emotionally adrift and stagy 0 
either way it sucks 0 
a very good film indeed about great and unconditional love 1 
this is a great product sure beats using your fingers 1 
the sangria was about half of a glass wine full and was 12 ridiculous 0 
very poor service 0 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
there is so much good food in vegas that i feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to rice and company 0 
howeverthe riingtones are not the best and neither are the games 0 
the fact is this film is a wonderful heartwarming tale about two people chasing their dreams 1 
an hour seriously 0 
the story starts too fast with absolutely no suspense or buildup in the slightest 0 
so badwellits just bad 0 
buttons are too small 0 
we had 7 at our table and the service was pretty fast 1 
will be back again 1 
the burger had absolutely no flavor the meat itself was totally bland the burger was overcooked and there was no charcoal flavor 0 
just as good as when i had it more than a year ago 1 
hes a national treasure 1 
this place is like chipotle but better 1 
first the bathrooms at this location were dirty seat covers were not replenished just plain yucky 0 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
horrible had to switch 3 times 0 
the malta settings are as dry and as barren as the dialogue 0 
its a mediocre miserable hollow laughable and predictable piece of garbage 0 
only pros large seating area nice bar area great simple drink menu the best brick oven pizza with homemade dough 1 
my mother and brother had to do thiswhen i saw robert ryan portraying this type of man it was a very good imitation of this type of individual and i was impressed 1 
very well made and fits my surefire gx2 perfectly 1 
anyways the food was definitely not filling at all and for the price you pay you should expect more 0 
the majority of the logitech earbud headsets failed 0 
the ending is so so perfect youll shed a tear 1 
i understand that its supposed to be a cheap popcorn comedy but that doesnt mean that it has to completely insult our intelligence and have writing so incredibly hackneyed that it borders on offensive 0 
good quality 1 
okay i like to consider myself a fair critic so ill give credit where credits duethe creature effects were actually pretty cool 1 
started watching this but didnt believe in any of the characters 0 
helen baxendale is a very credible lady macbeth who can be very cheerfull at times and sometimes she just looks like a naughty girl but deadly in her taste for blood and evil 1 
that was done in the second movie 0 
battery chargelife is quite long 1 
saw the movie today and thought it was a good effort good messages for kids 1 
does not fit 0 
there is however some pretty good acting at least for this type of film 1 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
i contacted the company and they told me that although the unit was still under warranty if i couldnt produce my receipt i was out of luck 0 
never again will i be dining at this place 0 
better than youd expect 1 
the warm beer didnt help 0 
i can say that the desserts were yummy 1 
it dit not work most of the time with my nokia 5320 0 
also the phone doesnt seem to accept anything except cbr mp3s preferably ripped by windows media player 0 
battery chargelife is quite long 1 
disappointing accessory from a good manufacturer 0 
the best part about nurse betty is its unpredictability 1 
now this is a movie i really dislike 0 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
back to good bbq lighter fare reasonable pricing and tell the public they are back to the old ways 1 
it is a joy to use 1 
so far it has worked like a charm 1 
if she had not rolled the eyes we may have stayed not sure if we will go back and try it again 0 
if you love death and decay and shakespears lyrics this is the one 1 
avoid avoid avoid 0 
i love all the features and form factor 1 
the whole experience was underwhelming and i think well just go to ninja sushi next time 0 
updatewent back for a second time and it was still just as amazing 1 
the buffet at bellagio was far from what i anticipated 0 
they could be used as exemplars for any set designer 1 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
i do not know if this was emilio estevezs directorial debut but the pacing the interplay and development of the characters as well as some clever camera work surrounding the character estevez plays all suggest a natural eye 1 
fantastic service here 1 
the things that the four kids get themselves into is absolutely hilarious to watch 1 
i believe that pitch black was done well 1 
omg i felt like i had never eaten thai food until this dish 1 
it feels poorly constructed the menus are difficult to navigate and the buttons are so recessed that it is difficult to push them 0 
this case seems well made 1 
you need at least 3 mins to get to your phone book from the time you first turn on the phonebattery life is short 0 
nice sound 1 
black water is a thriller that manages to completely transcend its limitations its an indie flick by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience 1 
bought mainly for the charger which broke soon after purchasing 0 
i think this restaurant suffers from not trying hard enough 0 
updatewent back for a second time and it was still just as amazing 1 
he is one of my favourite directors and one of the most talented directors in the history of cinema 1 
i had heard good things about this place but it exceeding every hope i could have dreamed of 1 
it is super charged up for use as a small hybrid palmtopcameracellphone and excels in those roles 1 
ordered a double cheeseburger got a single patty that was falling apart picture uploaded yeah still sucks 0 
we wont be going back 0 
when i placed my treo into the case not only was it not snug but there was a lot of extra room on the sides 0 
so far it has worked like a charm 1 
i dont think i will be back for a very long time 0 
the result is a powerhouse achievement made more timely now perhaps because of our cultures disturbing fascination with celebrity and its distorted interpretations of fame 1 
you can find better movies at youtube 0 
i love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it 1 
i thought it was bad 0 
i didnt want the clip going over the top of my ear causing discomfort 0 
this place is amazing 1 
good show samsung 1 
not nearly as good looking as the amazon picture makes it look 0 
ive only had my bluetooth for a few weeks but i really like it 1 
he deserves 5 stars 1 
weve tried to like this place but after 10 times i think were done with them 0 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
after arguing with verizon regarding the dropped calls we returned the phones after two days 0 
i love this phone it is very handy and has a lot of features 1 
i love the pho and the spring rolls oh so yummy you have to try 1 
almost everyone involved must be return to school acting is utterly predictable and bad script is pile of garbage all round 0 
it felt too light and tinny 0 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
my friend did not like his bloody mary 0 
i believe that pitch black was done well 1 
special mention should be made of the superb music score and sound effects which are an integral element in helping to make this such a memorable and enjoyable cartoon 1 
this movie is a good and humorous comment on life in 2006 1 
hated it 0 
highly recommended a 1 
considering the relations off screen between taylor and stanwyck it was surprising how little chemistry there was on screen between the two of them 0 
an excellent new restaurant by an experienced frenchman 1 
none of the three sizes they sent with the headset would stay in my ears 0 
the scripting of the subtle comedy is unmatched by any movie in recent years 1 
avoid at all costs 0 
performed awful muffled tinny incoming sound and severe echo for those on the other end of the call 0 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
id like to return it 0 
this movie is greatespecially if you enjoy visual arts 1 
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1 
as i said abovepretty useless 0 
as for the service im a fan because its quick and youre being served by some nice folks 1 
it has everything i need and i couldnt ask for more 1 
i was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar not only because the quality is great but the service is fast and the food impeccable 1 
its a fresh subtle and rather sublime effect 1 
i can say that the desserts were yummy 1 
i am very happy 1 
i will not return 0 
horrible horrible protector 0 
considering the relations off screen between taylor and stanwyck it was surprising how little chemistry there was on screen between the two of them 0 
the real killer is the volume and of course it breaking 0 
but now that it is out of warranty the same problems reoccurebottom line put your money somewhere else cingular will not support it 0 
i guess i should have known that this place would suck because it is inside of the excalibur but i didnt use my common sense 0 
their research and development division obviously knows what theyre doing 1 
it was a very superficial movie and it gave me the feeling that i was watching play rather than a film 0 
what a waste of time 0 
the service was not up to par either 0 
this place is not worth your time let alone vegas 0 
very disappointed in accessoryone 0 
setup went very smoothly 1 
i consider this theft 0 
how can that bethe audio quality is poor 0 
when a song could explain the emotions of the subjects better such as when jay adams unfortunate life was a subject of talk the song old man by neil young was played which evokes many emotions 1 
host staff were for lack of a better word bitches 0 
worst ever 0 
by far the best cheesecurds we have ever had 1 
best headset ever 1 
from here on the widmark character turns unintentionally comical 0 
this movie is also revealing 1 
i know he was a contract player with little control over his scripts but the acting was as bad as the script 0 
i bought this to use with my kindle fire and absolutely loved it 1 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
omg i felt like i had never eaten thai food until this dish 1 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
the things that the four kids get themselves into is absolutely hilarious to watch 1 
the only very disappointing thing was there was no speakerphone 0 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
utterly without merit on any level this is akin to torture 0 
the best part about nurse betty is its unpredictability 1 
the script is was there a script 0 
once your food arrives its meh 0 
i love this phone 1 
its a sad movie but very good 1 
it was pretty gross 0 
i think not again 0 
i have only had it for a few weeks but so far so good 1 
that said our mouths and bellies were still quite pleased 1 
walked in and the place smelled like an old grease trap and only 2 others there eating 0 
very clear quality sound and you dont have to mess with the sound on your ipod since you have the sound buttons on the headset 1 
we arent ones to make a scene at restaurants but i just dont get itdefinitely lost the love after this one 0 
good case excellent value 1 
the ambiance isnt much better 0 
try them in the airport to experience some tasty food and speedy friendly service 1 
not my thing 0 
reception is terrible and full of static 0 
and if that isnt enough of a mess of a movie for you the picture is also marred with a constant use of studio sets and indoor exteriors 0 
both the hot sour the egg flower soups were absolutely 5 stars 1 
a piece of junk that broke after being on my phone for 2 days 0 
excellent cast story line performances 1 
in conclusion i will not bother with this movie because a volcano in los angeles is nothing but nonsense 0 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
see it with your kids if you have a chanceit will open up some amazing dialog about how far race relations have come in the last 50 years 1 
the cashier was friendly and even brought the food out to me 1 
works fine 1 
it doesnt make you look cool 0 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
my boyfriend tried the mediterranean chicken salad and fell in love 1 
i have read others reviews here but i havent had any problem with it 1 
for sushi on the strip this is the place to go 1 
i especially love the long battery life 1 
frankly after cotton club and unfaithful it was kind of embarrassing to watch lane and gere in this film because it is bad 0 
i left with a stomach ache and felt sick the rest of the day 0 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film 1 
the characters are interesting even if a bit predictable 1 
you get extra minutes so that you can carry out the call and not get cut off 1 
gets a signal when other verizon phones wont 1 
the folks at otto always make us feel so welcome and special 1 
excellent 1 
ps the only scene in the movie that was cool is when the central character finds her room blown up 1 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
defective crap 0 
conclusion i loved it 1 
i really dont see how anyone could enjoy this movie 0 
very windresistant 1 
really bad 0 
i liked it 1 
i also decided not to send it back because our waitress looked like she was on the verge of having a heart attack 0 
i love this place 1 
well never go again 0 
service stinks here 0 
i dont think i will be back for a very long time 0 
worst phone ever 0 
avoid at all costs 0 
i found this place by accident and i could not be happier 1 
i just saw this film and i recommend it 1 
this film offers many delights and surprises 1 
the lighting is awful 0 
he owns the film just as spacek owned coal miners daughter and quaid owned great balls of fire 1 
this film has no redeeming features 0 
we also ordered the spinach and avocado salad the ingredients were sad and the dressing literally had zero taste 0 
this movie contained an allstar cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i havent seen before 1 
the food wasnt good 0 
today the graphics are crap 0 
i dont think you will be disappointed 1 
so good i am going to have to review this place twice once hereas a tribute to the place and once as a tribute to an event held here last night 1 
works great 1 
great character actors telly savalas and peter boyle 1 
the script is bad very bad  it contains both cheesiness and unethical joke that you normally see in rated r or nc17 movie 0 
his losing his marbles so early in the proceedings is totally implausible and unconvincing 0 
i love the look and feel of samsung flipphones 1 
the hockey scenes are terrible defensemen playing like theyre 5 years old goalies diving at shots that are 10 feet wide of the net etc 0 
the characters are fleshed out surprisingly well particularly grimes and blake and all the actors deliver their sharply scripted lines with just the right amount of deadpan tongue in cheek to make the dialogue both hilarious and realistic 1 
schrader has made a resume full of lousy amateurish films 0 
service is also cute 1 
however i needed some better instructions 0 
go to place for gyros 1 
i am pairing this with my iphone and i could not be happier with it so far 1 
stopped by during the late may bank holiday off rick steve recommendation and loved it 1 
a piece of cinematic garbage captured on celluloid 0 
i could not stand to even watch it for very long for fear of losing iq 0 
this is an unbelievable bargain 1 
overall i am psyched to have a phone which has all my appointments and contacts in and gets great reception 1 
its so bad its actually worth seeing just for that reason 0 
the plastic breaks really easy on this clip 0 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
works as described 1 
we had a group of 70 when we claimed we would only have 40 and they handled us beautifully 1 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
i guess i should have known that this place would suck because it is inside of the excalibur but i didnt use my common sense 0 
crisp and clear 1 
his performance as awarded was stunning 1 
not good enough for the price 0 
hard to judge whether these sides were good because we were grossed out by the melted styrofoam and didnt want to eat it for fear of getting sick 0 
this device is great in several situations1 1 
they could serve it with just the vinaigrette and it may make for a better overall dish but it was still very good 1 
voice recognition is tremendous 1 
no ear loop needed its tiny and the sound is great 1 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
would not reccommend 0 
after arguing with verizon regarding the dropped calls we returned the phones after two days 0 
this is one of the best movies out there that shows such strong sibling bond for each other 1 
poor product 0 
thank you for such great service 1 
big disappointment with calendar sync 0 
works great 1 
a pretty good product 1 
i cant believe theres even a sequel to this 0 
this game rocks 1 
this allows the possibility of double booking for the same date and time after the first 0 
have been going since 2007 and every meal has been awesome 1 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
a week later after i activated it it suddenly died 0 
food quality has been horrible 0 
highly entertaining at all angles 1 
unfortunately any virtue in this films production work was lost on a regrettable script 0 
if you love authentic mexican food and want a whole bunch of interesting yet delicious meats to choose from you need to try this place 1 
the accompanied software is almost brilliant 1 
the best scene in the movie was when gerardo is trying to find a song that keeps running through his head 1 
i cant believe theres even a sequel to this 0 
great movie 1 
it works 1 
i would recommend saving room for this 1 
they are so easy to love but even more easy to identify with 1 
that movie was bad 0 
cheap but hey it works was pleasantly suprised given the low cost of this item 1 
that movie was bad 0 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
what this film lacks is a convincing script 0 
i would have given no star if i was able 0 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
highquality chicken on the chicken caesar salad 1 
the only thing that i think could improve is the sound leaks out from the headset 0 
pretty cool i would say 1 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
if you love authentic mexican food and want a whole bunch of interesting yet delicious meats to choose from you need to try this place 1 
i have yet to run this new battery below two bars and thats three days without charging 1 
we enjoy their pizza and brunch 1 
once you get inside youll be impressed with the place 1 
the chains which im no fan of beat this place easily 0 
doesnt do the job 0 
defective crap 0 
disappointing accessory from a good manufacturer 0 
lange had become a great actress 1 
must have been an off night at this place 0 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
this is a bad film with bad writing and good actorsan ugly cartoon crafted by paul haggis for people who cant handle anything but the bold strokes in storytellinga picture painted with crayons 0 
110 and only because there is no setting for 010 0 
both rickman and stowe play their roles to the hilt in this tale of a childrens book writer who maybe has written a subversive tract 1 
the acting was bad the dialogs were extremely shallow and insincere 0 
the only thing i did like was the prime rib and dessert section 1 
the only place good for this film is in the garbage 0 
an hour seriously 0 
their frozen margaritas are way too sugary for my taste 0 
i really liked that 1 
this is some seriously good pizza and im an expertconnisseur on the topic 1 
it was an inexpensive piece but i would still have expected better quality 0 
the songs were the best and the muppets were so hilarious 1 
works great 1 
thank you for such great service 1 
att is not clear sound is very distorted and you have to yell when you talk 0 
the last 15 minutes of movie are also not bad as well 1 
you get incredibly fresh fish prepared with care 1 
this is an unbelievable bargain 1 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
the accompanied software is almost brilliant 1 
it is unusable in a moving car at freeway speed 0 
couldnt figure it out 0 
the script is was there a script 0 
we loved the place 1 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
the only thing really worth watching was the scenery and the house because it is beautiful 1 
furthermore you cant even find hours of operation on the website 0 
the battery is completely useless to me 0 
painful on the ear 0 
so badwellits just bad 0 
it was clear that she had the range and ability to pull off this part 1 
i have always used corded headsets and the freedom from the wireless is very helpful 1 
much more interesting more action more suspense and less of the unneeded controversy 1 
avoid this one if you can 0 
and there wasnt a single sour note struck actingwise either some surprisingly solid casting here 1 
i rather enjoyed it 1 
if that bug never showed up i would have given a 4 for sure but on the other side of the wall where this bug was climbing was the kitchen 0 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
the warm beer didnt help 0 
the cg opening sequence in space looked like it could have been created on microsoft slideshow for gods sake 0 
the portion was huge 1 
my sanyo has survived dozens of drops on blacktop without ill effect 1 
utter crap sound quality is terrible 0 
left very frustrated 0 
if you simply want a small flip phone look elsewhere as the extra bells whistles are mediocre 0 
this is a great little item 1 
if you havent gone here go now 1 
what a disappointment 0 
the malta settings are as dry and as barren as the dialogue 0 
arrived quickly and much less expensive than others being sold 1 
everything about this movie is stupid 0 
the movie is not completely perfect but titta di girolamo will stay with you for a long time after the vision of the movie 1 
not much seafood and like 5 strings of pasta at the bottom 0 
it was attached to a gas station and that is rarely a good sign 0 
youll love how thin it is 1 
the hockey scenes are terrible defensemen playing like theyre 5 years old goalies diving at shots that are 10 feet wide of the net etc 0 
insults profound deuchebaggery and had to go outside for a smoke break while serving just to solidify it 0 
they have horrible attitudes towards customers and talk down to each one when customers dont enjoy their food 0 
i dont have to be an accountant to know im getting screwed 0 
we walked away stuffed and happy about our first vegas buffet experience 1 
the acting is fantastic the stories are seamlessly woven together and the dogs are splendid a must rent view or see 1 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
the story itself is just predictable and lazy 0 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
this is a very average phone with bad battery life that operates on a weak network 0 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
their frozen margaritas are way too sugary for my taste 0 
first time there and might just be the last 0 
very comfortable 1 
kind of flops around 0 
kris kristoffersen is good in this movie and really makes a difference 1 
these products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet 0 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
so dont go there if you are looking for good food 0 
the basic premise is wasted since it is sidelined by the inexplicable focus on the documentary crew 0 
cute quaint simple honest 1 
i was bored throughout the whole damn thing 0 
we waited for thirty minutes to be seated although there were 8 vacant tables and we were the only folks waiting 0 
unless youre just out to visually collect all extant films of austens work you can skip this one 0 
not a weekly haunt but definitely a place to come back to every once in a while 1 
waste your money on this game 1 
i love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it 1 
does not work 0 
the menu had so much good stuff on it i could not decide 1 
the update procedure is difficult and cumbersome 0 
the noise shield is incrediable 1 
very cheap plastic creaks like an old wooden floor 0 
her role was played well 1 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
however the ear pads come off easily and after only one week i lost one 0 
it rocked my world and is certainly a must see for anyone with no social or physical outlets 1 
i rather enjoyed it 1 
these are the nicest restaurant owners ive ever come across 1 
i have had problems wit hit dropping signal and more 0 
the waitress and manager are so friendly 1 
i did not expect this to be so good 1 
overall a great experience 1 
the movie had you on the edge of your seat and made you somewhat afraid to go to your car at the end of the night 1 
bad reception 0 
i had a salad with the wings and some ice cream for dessert and left feeling quite satisfied 1 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
my only problem is i thought the actor playing the villain was a low rent michael ironside 0 
like the other reviewer said you couldnt pay me to eat at this place again 0 
the characters are interesting and you really care for them 1 
you truly take this journey through the eyes and soul of a child 1 
this scene is very strong and unpleasant 0 
now you know why i gave it a 10 1 
lets start with all the problemsthe acting especially from the lead professor was very very bad 0 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
clever and a real crowdpleaserthis film still ranks among mickeys best films even after 80 wonderful years 1 
however the ear pads come off easily and after only one week i lost one 0 
we walked away stuffed and happy about our first vegas buffet experience 1 
nice headset priced right 1 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
things that went wrong they burned the saganaki 0 
even when the women finally show up there is no sign of improvement the most expected things happen and by the time the film is over you might be far asleep 0 
coming here is like experiencing an underwhelming relationship where both parties cant wait for the other person to ask to break up 0 
con spotty service 0 
this is infuriating 0 
having trouble with volume 0 
and the sound quality is great 1 
considering the relations off screen between taylor and stanwyck it was surprising how little chemistry there was on screen between the two of them 0 
we had 7 at our table and the service was pretty fast 1 
perfect for the ps3 1 
awesome service and food 1 
its hard not to fall headoverheels in love with that girl 1 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
after 3 months screen just went black all of a sudden 0 
how awful she is 0 
w810i is just superb 1 
great atmosphere friendly and fast service 1 
i guess that nobody at the network that aired this dribble watched it before putting it on 0 
all this movie does is make you sick watching all these slackers make excuses for their stupid actions for 90 minutes 0 
the eargels channel the sound directly into your ear and seem to increase the sound volume and clarity 1 
i could not stand to even watch it for very long for fear of losing iq 0 
the only consistent thread holding the series together were the amazing performances of leni parker and anita laselva as the two taelons in quiet idealogical conflict 0 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
not even good for camp value 0 
last night was my second time dining here and i was so happy i decided to go back 1 
bad fit way too big 0 
the films sole bright spot was jonah hill who will look almost unrecognizable to fans of the recent superbad due to the amount of weight he lost in the interim 1 
the last 15 minutes of movie are also not bad as well 1 
he cant act one of the least scary villains i have ever seen he cant write did he write this damn movie in his sleep 0 
the hockey scenes are terrible defensemen playing like theyre 5 years old goalies diving at shots that are 10 feet wide of the net etc 0 
worst service to boot but that is the least of their worries 0 
service is quick and friendly 1 
there is a totally unnecessary trainroller coaster scene 0 
the battery is unreliable as well as the service use antena 0 
i liked the patio and the service was outstanding 1 
razr battery good buy 1 
only had this a month but its worked flawlessly so far 1 
the fries were great too 1 
the acting was bad 0 
the text messaging feature is really tricky to use 0 
and if that isnt enough of a mess of a movie for you the picture is also marred with a constant use of studio sets and indoor exteriors 0 
no plot whatsoever 0 
after my phone got to be about a year old its been slowly breaking despite much care on my part 0 
so flavorful and has just the perfect amount of heat 1 
first of all there are enough racial stereotypes and racial jokes to offend everyone 0 
a lot of websites have been rating this a very good phone and so do i 1 
all the pretty pictures in the world cannot make up for a piece of work that is flawed at the core 0 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
the headsets are easy to use and everyone loves them 1 
the jalapeno bacon is soooo good 1 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
i have 23 bars on my cell phone when i am home but you cant not hear anything 0 
sucked most of the stuff does not work with my phone 0 
excellent sound battery life and inconspicuous to boot 1 
the worst phone ive ever had only had it for a few months 0 
i rather enjoyed it 1 
you can watch them preparing the delicious food 1 
do not purchase this phone 0 
i have to mention this and it is a huge spoiler i loved the ending how all the characters of the three films were the remaining survivors of the ferry disaster with valentine and the young judge together and the old man watching it on her tv solidifying his happiness over the suffering which he dealt with for those many years 1 
i must say i have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again 1 
the acting is fantastic the stories are seamlessly woven together and the dogs are splendid a must rent view or see 1 
i promise they wont disappoint 1 
i cant believe theres even a sequel to this 0 
hated it 0 
for a self proclaimed coffee cafe i was wildly disappointed 0 
an hour seriously 0 
you also cannot take pictures with it in the case because the lense is covered 0 
it wasnt busy either also the building was freezing cold 0 
i dont each much pasta but i love the homemade hand made pastas and thin pizzas here 1 
wow very spicy but delicious 1 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
works great 1 
everyone is very attentive providing excellent customer service 1 
easily none other cartoon made me laugh in a tender way before getting into dark sitcoms oriented for teenagers 1 
its one of the movies i need to see whenever it comes on tvnever mind the fact that i already have it memorized 1 
really really good rice all the time 1 
excellent service 1 
to summarize the food was incredible nay transcendant but nothing brings me joy quite like the memory of the pneumatic condiment dispenser 1 
love this product 1 
i highly recommend this case 1 
the script is was there a script 0 
i was so insulted 0 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
but the service was beyond bad 0 
much less than the jawbone i was going to replace it with 1 
director paul matthews who also wrotedirected the weak 1995 monster movie grim clearly doesnt know how to pace his films 0 
i had ordered a motorola data cable got a very well finished and working product 1 
it is very educational for children 1 to 8 years old 1 
no shifting no bubbling no peeling not even a scratch nothingi couldnt be more happier with my new one for the droid 1 
then as if i hadnt wasted enough of my life there they poured salt in the wound by drawing out the time it took to bring the check 0 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
the cast was great 1 
the delivery was on time 1 
im translating movies for a living and this is the first movie in my 5year working experience that i found offensive to my intelligence 0 
of course the footage from the 70s was grainy but that only enhanced the film 1 
this pair of headphones is the worst that i have ever had soundwise 0 
bad choice 0 
good product incredible value 1 
ordered burger rare came in well done 0 
works great 1 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
its pure brilliance 1 
an italian reviewer called this a small great film and thats right 1 
now i know that i made a wise decision 1 
it is very educational for children 1 to 8 years old 1 
this is a beautiful phone 1 
if you see it you should probably just leave it on the shelf 0 
the noise shield is incrediable 1 
the service was a little slow considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace 0 
plus its only 8 bucks 1 
this place is overpriced not consistent with their boba and it really is overpriced 0 
at first glance it is a lovely bakery cafe nice ambiance clean friendly staff 1 
filmiing was less expansive 0 
i want my money back 0 
the price was very good and with the free shipping and all it was a good purchase 1 
i heart this place 1 
the pleather case doesnt fit 0 
i hope this place sticks around 1 
i took back my money and got outta there 0 
doesnt work at all i bougth it for my l7c and its not working 0 
the pizza selections are good 1 
camera color balance is awful 0 
a very very very slowmoving aimless movie about a distressed drifting young man 0 
good case 1 
case was more or less an extra that i originally put on but later discarded because it scratched my ear 0 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
awesome selection of beer 1 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
love the margaritas too 1 
product was excellent and works better than the verizon one and boy was it cheaper 1 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
i find wasting food to be despicable but this just wasnt food 0 
it did not work in my cell phone plug i am very up set with the charger 0 
they could be used as exemplars for any set designer 1 
excellent 1 
but the convoluted plot just didnt convince me and much of the film was watched with a weird questioning glance 0 
rip off over charge shipping 0 
the bus boy on the other hand was so rude 0 
that being said for a phone the camera is very nice many cool effects to play with and video is decent as well 1 
all in all i think it was a good investment 1 
car charger as well as ac charger are included to make sure you never run out of juicehighy recommended 1 
do not buy if you want to use the holster 0 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
food quality has been horrible 0 
my sanyo has survived dozens of drops on blacktop without ill effect 1 
some great music and terrific scenery 1 
it looked like a wonderful story 1 
better than youd expect 1 
my only complaint is the standard sound volume is a little low even when turned up to 5of 5 0 
comes with a strong light that you can use to light up your camera shots and even flash sos signals seriously 1 
battery has no life 0 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
all in all its an insult to ones intelligence and a huge waste of money 0 
the phone takes forever to charge like 2 to 5 hours literally 0 
save your money ive had this item for 11 months now 0 
doesnt work at all i bougth it for my l7c and its not working 0 
there were too many close ups 0 
the best scene in the movie was when gerardo is trying to find a song that keeps running through his head 1 
its like a bad two hour tv movie 0 
the best part about nurse betty is its unpredictability 1 
i could not stand to even watch it for very long for fear of losing iq 0 
it was quite comfortable in the ear 1 
this greedy corporation will never see another dime from me 0 
totally different with loads of understatement and black comedy this is a film few get to see but those who do will remember it 1 
there were too many close ups 0 
i vomited in the bathroom mid lunch 0 
there is a totally unnecessary trainroller coaster scene 0 
i own 2 of these cases and would order another 1 
lousy product 0 
their chow mein is so good 1 
they have been around for years and carries the highest quality of antiglare screen protector that i have found to date 1 
the camera on the phone may be used as a dustpan when indoors id rather be using a disposable then this 0 
i think i was one of the people who found this another one of roths pearls 1 
works great 1 
it ranks highly as a great noircrimedrama incredible performances by belmondo and lino ventura 1 
the staff is always super friendly and helpful which is especially cool when you bring two small boys and a baby 1 
thus far have only visited twice and the food was absolutely delicious each time 1 
the shipping time was also very quick 1 
you need at least 3 mins to get to your phone book from the time you first turn on the phonebattery life is short 0 
i dont think ill be running back to carlys anytime soon for food 0 
i have had mine for about a year and this christmas i bought some for the rest of the family 1 
not easy to watch 0 
classywarm atmosphere fun and fresh appetizers succulent steaks baseball steak 1 
i will never forget it now 1 
yet i enjoy watching it 1 
the shower area is outside so you can only rinse not take a full shower unless you dont mind being nude for everyone to see 0 
i have had this phone for over a year now and i will tell you its not that great 0 
conclusion very filling meals 1 
great choice 1 
good works fine 1 
my fella got the huevos rancheros and they didnt look too appealing 0 
it was a great phone 1 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
the pizza tasted old super chewy in not a good way 0 
in fact its hard to remember that the part of ray charles is being acted and not played by the man himself 1 
so flavorful and has just the perfect amount of heat 1 
the desserts were a bit strange 0 
the seller is very understanding and patient i would definitely buy from them again 1 
excellent product 1 
if you havent choked in your own vomit by the end by all the cheap drama and worthless dialogue youve must have bored yourself to death with this waste of time 0 
of all the dishes the salmon was the best but all were great 1 
stopped by during the late may bank holiday off rick steve recommendation and loved it 1 
you can watch them preparing the delicious food 1 
hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in 0 
what a waste of money and time 0 
its a case of so bad it is laughable 0 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
both of the egg rolls were fantastic 1 
im not eating here 0 
exceptionally bad 0 
the two main characters may be two of the most believable children i ever saw put on screen 1 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
dont buy this product 0 
john garfield ann revere lilli plmer william conrad canada leeand filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screenjames wong howe 1 
if you do watch it however there are small consolations the actresses playing annes sisters each do a wonderful job with their roles 1 
dont make the same mistake i did 0 
i will be back many times soon 1 
i bought this to use with my kindle fire and absolutely loved it 1 
no real improvement 0 
definitely will come back here again 1 
the battery is completely useless to me 0 
the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach 0 
the story starts too fast with absolutely no suspense or buildup in the slightest 0 
they brought a fresh batch of fries and i was thinking yay something warm but no 0 
there are so many problems i dont know where to start 0 
you need at least 3 mins to get to your phone book from the time you first turn on the phonebattery life is short 0 
the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach 0 
total waste of time 0 
avoid this establishment 0 
really pleased with this product so far 1 
i was bored throughout the whole damn thing 0 
the service was a bit lacking 0 
best service and food ever maria our server was so good and friendly she made our day 1 
easily none other cartoon made me laugh in a tender way before getting into dark sitcoms oriented for teenagers 1 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
wed definitely go back here again 1 
food was so gooodd 1 
as a sushi lover avoid this place by all means 0 
cumbersome design 0 
this case seems well made 1 
this scene is very strong and unpleasant 0 
overall the film is interesting and thoughtprovoking 1 
excellent product 1 
there is really nothing for me at postinos hope your experience is better 0 
omg i felt like i had never eaten thai food until this dish 1 
first off the reception sucks i have never had more than 2 bars ever 0 
if you want a real scare rent this one 1 
still its quite interesting and entertaining to follow 1 
i go to far too many places and ive never seen any restaurant that serves a 1 egg breakfast especially for 400 0 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
none of the three sizes they sent with the headset would stay in my ears 0 
as a sushi lover avoid this place by all means 0 
lange had become a great actress 1 
being a 90s child i truly enjoyed this show and i can proudly say that i enjoyed it big time and even more than the classical wb cartoons 1 
excellent sound battery life and inconspicuous to boot 1 
unfortunately any virtue in this films production work was lost on a regrettable script 0 
they are so easy to love but even more easy to identify with 1 
do not buy do not buyit sucks 0 
at around 4 pm i bought it at around 8pm i started to watch at around 815pm i fast forwarded the remaining film to see if there was anything left watchable for a human being with a brain but there wasnt 0 
the aerial scenes were welldone 1 
the cast was great 1 
this movie is possibly one of the most creative works of horror ever 1 
the cashier was friendly and even brought the food out to me 1 
dont waste your money 0 
as a sushi lover avoid this place by all means 0 
appears to actually outperform the original battery from china that came with my v325i 1 
after 20 minutes wait i got a table 0 
still waiting im sure this item would work well if i ever recieve it 0 
it definitely was not as good as my s11 1 
its this pandering to the audience that sabotages most of his films 0 
it has everything i need and i couldnt ask for more 1 
all in all id expected a better consumer experience from motorola 0 
this was a poor remake of my best friends wedding 0 
he was terrible 0 
well just if you keep thinking how bad it is 0 
both films are terrible but to the credit of the 1986 version it was watchable 0 
it is practically useless and did not add any kind of boost to my reception after i bought it 0 
we made the drive all the way from north scottsdale and i was not one bit disappointed 1 
it is perfect for a sitdown family meal or get together with a few friends 1 
its still wild stuff though and is highly recommended to fans of giallo cinema 1 
all things considered a job very well done 1 
bad reception 0 
best of all is the rotating feature very helpful 1 
i felt insulted and disrespected how could you talk and judge another human being like that 0 
the movie had you on the edge of your seat and made you somewhat afraid to go to your car at the end of the night 1 
the accompanied software is almost brilliant 1 
i understand that its supposed to be a cheap popcorn comedy but that doesnt mean that it has to completely insult our intelligence and have writing so incredibly hackneyed that it borders on offensive 0 
dont waste your money 0 
funny clever hip just like prays previous film hype 1 
it is so small and you dont even realize that it is there after a while of getting used to it 1 
the volume for the ringer is real good you have choices how loud 1 
battery has no life 0 
the server was very negligent of our needs and made us feel very unwelcome i would not suggest this place 0 
good servicecheck 1 
att is not clear sound is very distorted and you have to yell when you talk 0 
however i recently watched the whole thing again on dvd and i was completely struck by how extremely stupid the storyline was how it contained holes inconsistencies and frankly a whole lot of crap and how horrid the dancing was 0 
the chicken dishes are ok the beef is like shoe leather 0 
this is one of the worst sandra bullock movie since speed 2 but not quite that bad 0 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
the scenes are often funny and occasionally touching as the characters evaluate their lives and where they are going 1 
attempting artiness with black white and clever camera angles the movie disappointed became even more ridiculous as the acting was poor and the plot and lines almost nonexistent 0 
very disappointing 0 
your staff spends more time talking to themselves than me 0 
amazon sucks 0 
whatever the producer was going for he missed entirely 0 
if you want a real scare rent this one 1 
i think that it is a must see older john wayne film 1 
delicious 1 
it wasnt busy either also the building was freezing cold 0 
see it with your kids if you have a chanceit will open up some amazing dialog about how far race relations have come in the last 50 years 1 
after the first charge kept going dead after 12 minutes 0 
it crackles with an unpredictable youthful energy but honestly i found it hard to follow and concentrate on it meanders so badly 0 
the service was not up to par either 0 
i wear it everyday and it holds up very well 1 
its an empty hollow shell of a movie 0 
omg i felt like i had never eaten thai food until this dish 1 
we walked away stuffed and happy about our first vegas buffet experience 1 
barney is definitely super de duper 1 
its a long time since i was so entertained by a movie 1 
doesnt work at all i bougth it for my l7c and its not working 0 
the steak and the shrimp are in my opinion the best entrees at gc 1 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
i could not recommend these more 0 
the phone loads super 1 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
okay i like to consider myself a fair critic so ill give credit where credits duethe creature effects were actually pretty cool 1 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
the loudspeaker option is great the bumpers with the lights is very appealing 0 
but the convoluted plot just didnt convince me and much of the film was watched with a weird questioning glance 0 
their daily specials are always a hit with my group 1 
both of the egg rolls were fantastic 1 
the camera really likes her in this movie 1 
to be honest with you this is unbelievable nonsense and very foolish 0 
this game rocks 1 
plug was the wrong size 0 
however this didnt make up for the fact that overall this was a tremendously boring movie 0 
the bartender was also nice 1 
i want my money back 0 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
this pair of headphones is the worst that i have ever had soundwise 0 
does everything it should and more 1 
too politically correct 0 
the reception is excellent 1 
i give it 2 thumbs down 0 
but in terms of the writing its very fresh and bold 1 
on the good side the staff was genuinely pleasant and enthusiastic a real treat 1 
i tried talking real loud but shouting on the telephone gets old and i was still told it wasnt great 0 
i contacted the company and they told me that although the unit was still under warranty if i couldnt produce my receipt i was out of luck 0 
good case excellent value 1 
the fact is this film is a wonderful heartwarming tale about two people chasing their dreams 1 
the only thing i wasnt too crazy about was their guacamole as i dont like it puréed 0 
i can assure you that you wont be disappointed 1 
worthwhile 1 
ill definitely be in soon again 1 
this film tries to be a serious and sophisticated thrillerhorror flick and it fails miserably 0 
all in all i can assure you ill be back 1
